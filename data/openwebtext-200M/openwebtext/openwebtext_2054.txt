Silver Certificates : The Last Metal Standard
First issued in 1878 , Silver Certificates were our nation ’s primary currency for many years .
They were issued in denominations ranging from $ 1 to $ 1,000 and could be exchanged for silver at the U.S. Treasury .
The last series of Silver Certificates was issued in 1965 .
Silver certificates are a result of the Free Silver Movement that originated in the early 1870s .
This movement sought to increase the money supply by producing silver coinage , rather than paper notes .

WASHINGTON -- A Pentagon report will accuse Iran of continuing to funnel weapons and training personnel into Iraq , adding fuel to a heated debate among U.S. policy makers about whether Iran deserves any credit for the steep declines in Iraq 's once - unrelenting violence .
The military assessment about Iraq , set to be released to Congress today , will paint a positive picture of Iraq 's overall security situation , according to several officials familiar with its contents .

In today ’s Science Express , the advance online publication of the journal Science , researchers report a series of experiments that mark an important step toward understanding a longstanding fundamental physics problem of quantum mechanics .
The scientists presented their findings at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society this week .
The problem the physicists addressed is how a fundamental particle in matter loses track of its quantum mechanical properties through interactions with its environment .
The research was performed by scientists at the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California , Santa Barbara and the U. S. Department of Energy Ames Laboratory in Iowa .
At the quantum level things like particles or light waves behave in ways very different from what scientists expect in a human - scale world .
In the quantum world , for example , an electron can exist in two places at the same time , what is called a " superposition " of states , or spin up and down at the same time .
Quantum mechanics in computing could lead to communication with no possible eavesdropping , lightning - fast database searches , and code - cracking ability .
The answer to the problem the researchers have tackled is key to unraveling how the classical world in which we live emerges from all the interacting quantum particles in matter .
This scientific query surrounds the basic quantum dynamics of a single particle spin coupled to a collection , or bath , of random spins .
This scenario describes the underlying behavior of a broad class of materials around us , ranging from quantum spin tunneling in magnetic molecules to nuclear magnetic resonance in semiconductors .
“ We were stunned by these unexpected experimental results , and extremely excited by the ability to control and monitor single quantum states , especially at room temperature , ” said author David Awschalom , a professor of physics at UC Santa Barbara .
Awschalom is affiliated with the California NanoSystems Institute at UCSB and is the Director of the Center for Spintronics & Quantum Computation , also at the university .
Recently the issue of how fundamental particles lose track of quantum mechanical properties through interaction with the environment has gained crucial importance in the field of quantum information .
In this area , robust manipulation of quantum states promises enormous speedups over classical computation .
Keeping track of the quantum phase is essential for keeping the quantum information , and insight into loss of the phase will greatly help to mitigate this process .
Experimental work on this subject has thus far been hindered by the lack of high - fidelity coherent control of a single spin in nature and our inability to directly influence the bath dynamics .
In a collaboration between physicists in Awschalom ’s research group at UCSB and Slava Dobrovitski , a visiting scientist from Ames Laboratory in Iowa , a series of experiments were undertaken that utilized electron spins in diamond to investigate different regimes of spin - bath interactions , and provide much information about the decoherence dynamics .
The scientists use diamond crystals to study a single electron spin tied to an adjustable collection of nearby spins .
Two features of diamond that make this system viable for unprecedented investigations into the coherent dynamics are the precise optical control of a single spin that is unique to diamond , and the magnetic tunability of the spin - bath and intrabath dynamics with small permanent magnets .
Their team ’s observations contain a number of extraordinary discoveries , such as the time - dependent disappearance and reappearance of quantum oscillations of the spins in the diamond lattice .
“ To our surprise , when looking at longer times , the oscillations disappeared then re-appeared , ” said co-author Ronald Hanson , a postdoctoral student at UCSB during this period who is now a professor at the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft , at Delft University of Technology , in the Netherlands .
“ At first it looked like an artifact , but repeated measurements reproduced this behavior . ”
The problem of a single spin coupled to a bath of spins has been the subject of an intense international research effort , as this conceptual framework describes the physical behavior of a number of real systems .
Among others , these include atomic and electronic spins that are prime candidates for implementing quantum information processors and coherent spintronics devices .
A series of direct experiments coupled to theoretical simulations demonstrate that spins in diamond serve as a nearly ideal , adjustable , model of central spin .
“ This work demonstrates a rare level of synergy between experiment , analytical theory , and computer simulations , ” said Dobrovitski .
“ These three constituents all agree , support , and complement each other .
Together , they give a lucid qualitative picture of what happens with spin centers in diamond , and , at the same time , provide a quantitatively accurate description .
This agreement is hard to anticipate in advance for such complex systems , where many nuclear and electron quantum spins interact with each other . ”
Studies of the quantum dynamics of spins in diamond is an emerging topic involving several leading research groups worldwide .
It may also be important in the context of recent interest in possible carbon - based electronic devices employing carbon nanotubes and / or graphene .

INDIANAPOLIS ( Reuters ) - Indiana voters on Tuesday elected a Muslim to Congress , only the second of that faith chosen in U.S. history .
Andre Carson , grandson of the late Democrat Rep. Julia Carson , was elected to serve the balance of her term in the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election .
She died in December 2007 , after serving 11 years in the heavily Democratic district .
The younger Carson , 33 , a member of the Indianapolis City Council who converted to Islam about a decade ago , will serve out the remainder of his grandmother ’s term through calendar 2008 .
He beat Republican Jon Elrod and a third party candidate with 52 percent of the vote to 44 percent for Elrod .
The first and only other Muslim member of the U.S. Congress is Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota , also a Democrat , who is in his first term .
Carson will face a strong challenge against other contenders in a May primary which will determine who runs in November for the next full two - year term in the district which covers most of the city of Indianapolis .
His Democratic opponents then are expected to be two state legislators -- Carolene Mays , an Indianapolis newspaper publisher , and David Orentlicher , a lawyer and doctor who is a professor of law and medical ethics at Indiana University School of Law and Indiana University Medical Center .
Carson ’s faith had not been an issue in the special election .
Americans are increasingly frustrated about the subpar performance of this country ’s fragmented health care system , and with good reason .
A new survey of patients in seven industrialized nations underscores just how badly sick Americans fare compared with patients in other nations .
One - third of the American respondents felt their system is so dysfunctional that it needs to be rebuilt completely — the highest rate in any country surveyed .
The system was given poor scores both by low - income , uninsured patients and by many higher - income patients .
The survey , the latest in a series from the Commonwealth Fund , is being published today on the Web site of Health Affairs , a respected health policy journal .
Researchers interviewed some 12,000 adults in Australia , Canada , Germany , the Netherlands , New Zealand , the United Kingdom and the United States .
Given the large number of people uninsured or poorly insured in this country , it was no surprise that Americans were the most likely to go without care because of costs .
Fully 37 percent of the American respondents said that they chose not to visit a doctor when sick , skipped a recommended test or treatment or failed to fill a prescription in the past year because of the cost — well above the rates in other countries .
Patients here were more likely to get appointments quickly for elective surgery than those in nearly all the other countries .
But access to primary care doctors , the mainstay of medical practice , was often rocky .
Only half of the American adults were able to see a doctor the same day that they became sick or the day after , a worse showing than in all the other countries except Canada .
Getting care on nights and weekends was problematic .
Retailers and publishers have fought hard to work their way up in the ranking of Google ’s search results and refine the search features of their own Web sites to help users once they arrive .
Now , Google is taking a greater role in helping users search within particular sites .
And some of the same retailers and publishers are not happy about it .
This month , the company introduced a search - within - search feature that lets users stay on Google to find pages on popular sites like those of The Washington Post , Wikipedia , The New York Times , Wal - Mart and others .
The search box appears when someone enters the name of certain Web addresses or company names  say , “ Best Buy ”  rather than entering a request like “ cellphones . ”
The results of the search are almost all individual company pages .
Google tops those results with a link to the home page of the Web site in question , adds another search box , and offers users the chance to let Google search for certain things within that site .
The problem , for some in the industry , is that when someone enters a term into that secondary search box , Google will display ads for competing sites , thereby profiting from ads it sells against the brand .
The feature also keeps users searching on Google pages and not pages of the destination Web site .
McCain : ‘ There Will Be Other Wars ’
James Joyner · · 6 comments
John McCain wants Florida voters to know that national security policy , not the economy , is the most important issue in this presidential election because we ’re in a war and will inevitably be in others .
Sam Stein is worried :
Sen .
John McCain told a crowd of supporters on Sunday , “ It ’s a tough war we ’re in .
It ’s not going to be over right away .
There ’s going to be other wars . ”
Offering more of his increasingly bleak “ straight talk , ” he repeated the claim : “ I ’m sorry to tell you , there ’s going to be other wars .
We will never surrender but there will be other wars . ”
McCain did not elaborate who the United States would be fighting .
But he did warn the crowd to be ready for the ramifications of current and future battles .
“ And right now – we ’re gonna have a lot of PTSD [ post traumatic stress disorder ] to treat , my friends , ” he said .
“ We ’re gonna have a lot of combat wounds that have to do with these terrible explosive IEDs that inflict such severe wounds .
And my friends , it ’s gonna be tough , we ’re gonna have a lot to do . ”
I do n’t know the context of these remarks .
They ’re rather strange and depressing if they ’re part of a stump speech but just more “ straight talk ” if they were in response to an audience question .
There ’s not much question about the underlying point .
Every president in my lifetime has used military force , often many times .
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon had Vietnam ; Gerald Ford , Mayaguez ; Jimmy Carter , Desert One ; Ronald Reagan : Beirut and Grenada ; George H.W. Bush : Panama , Desert Storm , and Somalia ; Bill Clinton : Somalia II , Haiti , and perhaps a dozen others ; George W. Bush : Afghanistan and Iraq .
And that ’s just off the top of my head .
Some of those conflicts were unavoidable and perhaps ill advised .
But , with the exception of Nixon ’s inheritance of Vietnam , they all had at least one thing in common :
The president was n’t expecting them when campaigning for office .

The Association of Muslim Scholars ' Al Basaer newspaper carried an editorial Wednesday with the headline " Sorrows of a nation with 1 million dead . "
The editorial said that when the announcement of a million Iraqis dead since the beginning of the occupation in 2003 was released , there was no outrage in the Arab world and the news passed as normal .
It added that the Arab world considered the news of 1 million dead as the " normality of life in Iraq . "
" The Arabic media was less interested by the news on Iraq as the uprising of the blockaded Palestinians in Gaza is seemingly more important , " it said .
It added that the interest in daily armed clashes and attacks garnered more attention than major changes in societies and the influence of these changes on people 's lives -- " events increasingly causing agony and struggle for the people of Iraq , " it said .
It said that the Algerian revolution ended with 1 million martyrs , Algiers entered history and was able to achieve its goal of ending the occupation and announcing independence .
" One million Iraqis died in five years . �
Still there is no glimmer of light giving us hope the occupier will leave our country even in the long term , " the paper said .
It added that the death of 1 million Iraqis was announced last month by Human Rights Watch , which documented the deaths of 1,033,000 Iraqis between 2003 and 2007 .
" This report means that the situation in the agonized Iraq is in continuous deterioration as 200,000 people have died each year since the invasion in 2003 , " it said .
Mehdi al - Fahdawi , the editorial writer , said , " Before the announcement of the casualty report , I had the chance to meet with Iraqi resistance leaderships and they noted that the Arab world gave up the Iraqi matter and handed it over to the Americans . "
" The Arabs merely watching what is taking place in Iraq as if watching a crime or violent movie on a screen , forgetting this shredded country named Iraq is part of the Arab nation and what happens to it today , happens to other Arab countries tomorrow , " the paper said .
The editorial added that the Arab world is involved with what is happening in Palestine , which is a natural and justified reaction , but that it is unacceptable the entire world turn their backs on the situation in Iraq .
" If people face death in Gaza , people in Iraq die everyday .
If they have not enough electricity , Iraqis have no electricity or fuel or water for more than one hour every day .
The barriers in the Occupied Territories in Palestine are similar to those in Baghdad , " the editorial said .
It added that the U.S. influence on the Arab countries made the latter support the American - Israeli blockade on Gaza and align with the government in Ramallah in its struggle against the elected government in the Gaza Strip .
The Saudi - based newspaper concluded that the increase of the U.S. role in the Arab world encourages their governments to reduce their participation in helping the people of Iraq .
" Lines have interfered with the map of the Iraqi resistance , resulting in its defacement and giving it a bad reputation to the point we no more know who is lined with the Iraqi people and who is against them , or who is with the Americans and who disagrees with them , " it said .
Al Basaer said there are groups on the ground in Iraq that coordinate among themselves to fight U.S. forces and consider them their main enemy .

The US economy continues its 21st century decline , even as the Bush Regime outfits B - 2 stealth bombers with 30,000 pound monster “ bunker buster ” bombs for its coming attack on Iran .
While profits soar for the armaments industry , the American people continue to take it on the chin .
The latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the real wages and salaries of US civilian workers are below those of 5 years ago .
It could not be otherwise with US corporations offshoring good jobs in order to reduce labor costs and , thereby , to convert wages once paid to Americans into multi-million dollar bonuses paid to CEOs and other top management .
Good jobs that still remain in the US are increasingly filled with foreign workers brought in on work visas .
Corporate public relations departments have successfully spread the lie that there is a shortage of qualified US workers , necessitating the importation into the US of foreigners .
The truth is that the US corporations force their American employees to train the lower paid foreigners who take their jobs .
Otherwise , the discharged American gets no severance pay .
Law firms , such as Cohen & Grigsby , compete in marketing their services to US corporations on how to evade the law and to replace their American employees with lower paid foreigners .
As Lawrence Lebowitz , vice president at Cohen & Grisby , explained in the law firm ’s marketing video , “ our goal is clearly , not to find a qualified and interested US worker . ”
Meanwhile , US colleges and universities continue to graduate hundreds of thousands of qualified engineers , IT professionals , and other professionals who will never have the opportunity to work in the professions for which they have been trained .
America today is like India of yesteryear , with engineers working as bartenders , taxi cab drivers , waitresses , and employed in menial work in dog kennels as the offshoring of US jobs dismantles the ladders of upward mobility for US citizens .
Over the last year ( from June 2006 through June 2007 ) the US economy created 1.6 million net private sector jobs .
As Charles McMillion of MBG Information Services reports each month , essentially all of the new jobs are in low - paid domestic services that do not require a college education .
The category , “ Leisure and hospitality , ” accounts for 30 per cent of the new jobs , of which 387,000 are bartenders and waitresses , 38,000 are workers in motels and hotels , and 50,000 are employed in entertainment and recreation .
The category , “ Education and health services , ” accounts for 35 per cent of the gain in employment , of which 100,000 are in educational services and 456,000 are in health care and social assistance , principally ambulatory health care services and hospitals .
“ Professional and technical services ” accounts for 268,000 of the new jobs .
“ Finance and insurance ” added 93,000 new jobs , of which about one quarter are in real estate and about one half are in insurance .
“ Transportation and warehousing ” added 65,000 jobs , and wholesale and retail trade added 185,000 .
Over the entire year , the US economy created merely 51,000 jobs in architectural and engineering services , less than the 76,000 jobs created in management and technical consulting ( essentially laid - off white collar professionals ) .
Except for a well - connected few graduates , who find their way into Wall Street investment banks , top law firms , and private medical practice , American universities today consist of detention centers to delay for four or five years the entry of American youth into unskilled domestic services .
Meanwhile the rich are getting much richer and luxuriating in the most fantastic conspicuous consumption since the Gilded Age .
Robert Frank has dubbed the new American world of the super - rich “ Richistan . ”
In Richistan there is a two - year waiting list for $ 50 million 200 - foot yachts .
In Richistan Rolex watches are considered Wal - Mart junk .
Richistanians sport $ 736,000 Franck Muller timepieces , sign their names with $ 700,000 Mont Blanc jewel - encrusted pens .
Their valets , butlers ( with $ 100,000 salaries ) , and bodyguards carry the $ 42,000 Louis Vuitton handbags of wives and mistresses .
Richistanians join clubs open only to those with $ 100 million , pay $ 650,000 for golf club memberships , eat $ 50 hamburgers and $ 1,000 omelettes , drink $ 90 a bottle Bling mineral water and down $ 10,000 “ martinis on a rock ” ( gin or vodka poured over a diamond ) at New York ’s Algonquin Hotel .
Who are the Richistanians ?
They are CEOs who have moved their companies abroad and converted the wages they formerly paid Americans into $ 100 million compensation packages for themselves .
They are investment bankers and hedge fund managers , who created the subprime mortgage derivatives that currently threaten to collapse the economy .
One of them was paid $ 1.7 billion last year .
The $ 575 million that each of 25 other top earners were paid is paltry by comparison , but unimaginable wealth to everyone else .
Some of the super rich , such as Warren Buffet and Bill Gates , have benefitted society along with themselves .
Both Buffet and Gates are concerned about the rapidly rising income inequality in the US .
They are aware that America is becoming a feudal society in which the super - rich compete in conspicuous consumption , while the serfs struggle merely to survive .
With the real wages and salaries of American civilian workers lower than 5 years ago , with their debts at all time highs , with the prices of their main asset -- their homes -- under pressure from overbuilding and fraudulent finance , and with scant opportunities to rise for the children they struggled to educate , Americans face a dim future .
Indeed , their plight is worse than the official statistics indicate .
During the Clinton administration , the Boskin Commission rigged the inflation measures in order to hold down indexed Social Security payments to retirees .
Another deceit is the measure called “ core inflation . ”
This measure of inflation excludes food and energy , two large components of the average family ’s budget .
Wall Street and corporations and , therefore , the media emphasize core inflation , because it holds down cost of living increases and interest rates .
In the second quarter of this year , the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , a more complete measure of inflation , increased at an annual rate of 5.2 per cent compared to 2.3 per cent for core inflation .
An examination of how inflation is measured quickly reveals the games played to deceive the American people .
Housing prices are not in the index .
Instead , the rental rate of housing is used as a proxy for housing prices .
More games are played with the goods and services whose prices comprise the weighted market basket used to estimate inflation .
If beef prices rise , for example , the index shifts toward lower priced chicken .
Inflation is thus held down by substituting lower priced products for those whose prices are rising faster .
As the weights of the goods in the basket change , the inflation measure does not reflect a constant pattern of expenditures .
Some economists compare the substitution used to minimize the measured rate of inflation to substituting sweaters for fuel oil .
Other deceptions , not all intentional , abound in official US statistics .
Business Week ’s June 18 cover story used the recent important work by Susan N. Houseman to explain that much of the hyped gains in US productivity and GDP are “ phantom gains ” that are not really there .
Other phantom productivity gains are produced by corporations that shift business costs to consumers by , for example , having callers listen to advertisements while they wait for a customer service representative , and by pricing items in the inflation basket according to the low prices of stores that offer customers no service .
The longer callers can be made to wait , the fewer the customer representatives the company needs to employ .
The loss of service is not considered in the inflation measure .
It shows up instead as a gain in productivity .
In American today the greatest rewards go to investment bankers , who collect fees for creating financing packages for debt .
These packages include the tottering subprime mortgage derivatives .
Recently , a top official of the Bank of France acknowledged that the real values of repackaged debt instruments are unknown to both buyers and sellers .
Many of the derivatives have never been priced by the market .
Think of derivatives as a mutual fund of debt , a combination of good mortgages , subprime mortgages , credit card debt , auto loans , and who knows what .
Not even institutional buyers know what they are buying or how to evaluate it .
Arcane pricing models are used to produce values , and pay incentives bias the assigned values upward .
Richistan wealth may prove artificial and crash , bringing an end to the new Gilded Age .
But the plight of the rich in distress will never compare to the decimation of America ’s middle class .
The offshoring of American jobs has destroyed opportunities for generations of Americans .
Never before in our history has the elite had such control over the government .
To run for national office requires many millions of dollars , the raising of which puts “ our ” elected representatives and “ our ” president himself at the beck and call of the few moneyed interests that financed the campaigns .
America as the land of opportunity has passed into history .

We 're not exactly clear on how Gibson 's legal team managed to license all those brand names and guitar designs to Activision for this many Guitar Hero games before realizing that the company maybe - sorta had a patent on the idea , but here we are : Activision filed a lawsuit yesterday asking the US District Court for Central California to invalidate a 1999 Gibson patent on " simulating a musical performance , " because apparently Gibson 's bugging them about it since January .
Wait , just January ?
Seriously , people , you 'd have thought this would 've come up by now .
Anyway , Activision says that Gibson is still a " good partner , " just that it " disagrees with the applicability of their patent and would like a legal determination on this . "
We 're sure it would .
Gibson 's patent apparently involves playing an instrument of some kind along with a pre-recorded concert while wearing what is described as a " 3 - D headset , " so there seems to be some overlap , but we 'll see what the court says -- something tells us explaining Guitar Hero to the judge is going to be relatively amusing .
On reading the patent , Gibson 's system is designed to be used with a " musical instrument " -- and no matter what the Guitar Zeros have to say , we do n't think Guitar Hero controllers really qualify .
It 'll definitely be interesting to see what the court has to say about that , no ?
[ Thanks , Matt G. ]

BitTorrent 's popularity is still growing , and new sites are launched every day .
Unfortunately it is impossible to feature all the new sites here , so we decided to post a selection of BitTorrent sites that look promising , or offer something new .
PizzaTorrent
PizzaTorrent is a meta - search engine , inspired by the enormous success of another site we introduced last month , YouTorrent .
The site has a similar look and feel as YouTorrent , but it also includes some unique features .
One of the most significant differences is that it sorts the torrents by category .
In the sidebar you can also click on one of the indexed sites to perform a direct search .
The search results are presented in a clean way and ordered by rank , which is the output of a formula that looks at the torrent name , keywords , date added , number of seeds and seeds vs. peers .
The administrator of PizzaTorrent told TorrentFreak that his site is indeed based on the YouTorrent concept , but that he will continue to add more unique features .
Bit -Tunes
Bit -Tunes is a BitTorrent / iTunes mashup based on the popular blog platform WordPress .
The site collects information from iTunes on both the newly released and most popular albums available on the iTunes store .
It fetches the album cover in high - resolution from online stores such as Amazon , and matches every album dynamically with torrent downloads available on various BitTorrent sites .
The Bit - Tunes administrator told TorrentFreak :
The purpose of the site is to discover great music albums and new artists , and download music DRM - free without the need to go through the iTunes Store or own an iPod .
I have a bunch more ideas of which contextual information can be added to every album ( buy it on Amazon , preview / listen online ) , to provide an even better user experience .
LookTorrent
LookTorrent is another BitTorrent meta - search engine that was launched recently .
The difference with PizzaTorrents is that search results are presented in tabs , similar to Torrent - Finder .
Each tab shows the search results of one BitTorrent site , and you can select which sites you want to search .
In addition , LookTorrent allows users to rate the sites and it displays search suggestions at the bottom of every results page .
ShareByte
ShareByte is different from most other search engines because it is a community driven site where users add and edit the torrents .
At the moment is is still a bit low on content , but the idea might appeal to people who like to participate .
All the files are categorized and links to subtitles , video trailers , IMDB ratings and more are included , or can be added by users .
In addition , the site offers some useful features to registered users , as they can add torrents to their favorites and rate the audio and video quality of the files .
As said before , BitTorrent meta - search engines can be really useful , but they are useless if all the sites they index host the same . torrent files .
A bit more diversity might be a good idea , especially in the long term .
Do you know any other new BitTorrent sites that are worth visiting ?

L’âge semble offrir un privilège rare .
Celui de s’affranchir des convenances et de la langue de bois .
Homme carré dans un corps rond que l’impopularité n’a jamais affecté , Raymond barre ancien Premier ministre est depuis quelques jours au centre d’une polémique suscitée par ses propos tenus dans un entretien à France Culture diffusé jeudi 1er mars et , réitéré dans l’émission « Les Grosses Têtes » de RTL qui sera diffusée jeudi 8 mars .
L’ancien maire de Lyon , en fin d’interview , incrimine notamment « le lobby juif capable de monter des opérations indignes » et défend , à sa façon et , dans une certaine mesure , Maurice Papon et Bruno Gollnisch .
Par hasard , le 1er mars dernier , je tombe sur France Culture .
Le timbre de la voix est aisément reconnaissable .
Le professeur Barre est l’invité de l’émission en cours pour parler de son dernier livre L’expérience du pouvoir écrit avec Jean Bothorel .
Comme souvent avec lui , les propos sont intéressants et sortent des discours stéréotypés .
Contrairement aux mauvaises langues qui voudraient depuis laisser croire que le poids des années ( 82 ans ) pèse sur son intellect , l’ancien politique et universitaire a conservé toute sa verdeur .
Je garde le fil .
En fin d’émission pourtant quelque chose change , imperceptible .
Une légère tension peut être .
" Juif , Papon " .
Les mots ont été prononcés par l’un de journalistes .
Le ton se relève un peu .
Le débit des mots s’accélère .
On devine chez l’invité une vieille blessure et la volonté de dire enfin des choses longtemps contenues .
Raymond Barre prendra - t - il le risque de briser le tabou qui entoure ces questions et de créer une polémique ?
Oui .
En homme libre , il libère sa pensée .
" M. Papon a été un ministre parfait " .
Suivent quinze minutes de propos politiquement incorrects .
" Maurice Papon était un grand commis de l’Etat " .
Préfet de Police de Paris pendant dix ans nommé par le général de Gaulle .
Un professionnel de l’ordre qui , à ses yeux , paye pour les événements de Charonne en 1961 à un moment où de Gaulle était chef de l’Etat .
Par la suite , " Papon fut un parlementaire raisonnable , modéré de l’UDR et , membre de la commission des Finances . "
Raymond Barre ne regrette pas son choix d’en avoir fait un ministre et rappelle que ce n’est qu’en 1981 qu’il a appris , avec l’opinion publique , les actes reprochés à l’ancien fonctionnaire du régime de Vichy .
" Personne ne parlait de son rôle pendant l’Occupation , ce n’est apparu qu’en 1981 . "
Si l’ancien Premier ministre reconnaît qu’on a toujours le droit de faire jouer la clause de conscience , il préfère en revenir à la situation de la France en 1944 - 1945 , à la nécessaire continuité de fonctionnement de l’Etat .
De cette période , R. Barre considère que Maurice Papon est devenu un bouc émissaire , même si , dans le droit fil des conclusions du jury d’honneur qui l’avait à moitié blanchi , il ne porte pas de jugement sur l’attitude de l’intéressé .
Un journaliste fait alors le lien avec l’attentat survenu en 1980 contre la synagogue de la rue Copernic à Paris ( quatre morts et vingt blessés ) .
Raymond Barre , alors Premier ministre , avait choqué une partie l’opinion en déclarant sur TF1 : " Cet attentat odieux a voulu frapper les israélites qui se rendaient à la synagogue , il a frappé des Français innocents qui traversaient la rue Copernic . "
Ses propos du 8 octobre à l ’Assemblée nationale , assurant ses " compatriotes juifs " de la " sympathie de l’ensemble de la nation " , n’effaceront pas le malaise laissé par sa précédente phrase .
Ces mots " malheureux " , Raymond Barre ne les regrette pas .
Il rappelle le contexte électoral de l’époque favorable aux manipulations et à la déformation des propos .
N’avait - il pas , dans la même déclaration , précisé que la communauté juive , ne peut être séparée de la communauté française ?
" Quand on cite , on cite en entier " , assène - t - il , expliquant que ses déclarations reposaient sur le fait que les auteurs de l’attentat avaient pour intention déclarée de châtier des juifs français et pas des Français non juifs .
Et de conclure sur cet épisode qui lui a visiblement laissé des souvenirs douloureux :
" Sur cette affaire , je considère que le lobby juif est capable de monter des opérations indignes . "
" Je vous ai parlé franchement .
Que l’on me fasse passer pour un antisémite , cela m’est complètement égal . "
En remontant le temps , les journalistes abordent alors le cas de Bruno Gollnisch , l’un des leaders du Front national , conseiller municipal de Lyon lorsque Raymond Barre en était le maire .
L’ancien édile brise un nouvel interdit tacite en reconnaissant que l’élu frontiste s’est , tout au long de ses six années de mandat , toujours conduit correctement dans ses fonctions de conseiller municipal , se taisant lorsqu ’il le lui demandait .
" Je blâmais ce qu’il avait dit mais c’était un bon conseiller municipal . "
" Les gens peuvent avoir leurs opinions , je reconnais leurs qualités . "
" Que ceux qui ne sont pas convaincus de cela pensent ce qu’ils veulent . "
Au fond , une tempête dans un verre d’eau .
Un parler vrai , une liberté de ton devenus si rares dans notre monde médiatico - politique frileux , pasteurisé , qu’ils dérangent .
Beaucoup de bruit pour rien pour ceux qui veulent bien se donner la peine de juger Raymond Barre à l’aune de ses actions passées et surtout d’écouter ses propos dans leur intégralité .
Pour ceux qui veulent se construire leur propre opinion et ne pas se contenter de hurler avec la meute , je mets en lien ci-dessous l’interview si décriée .
Juste histoire de ne pas laisser livrer une nouvelle fois l’honneur d’un homme aux chiens .
Last week , when we spoke , you told me that there were good reasons you were n't initiating impeachment hearings at this time .
( see video of me and Congressman Conyers here )
I tried to tell you that impeachment is a tool , and you turned to me with a wry , frankly , contagious grin , and asked me ( with a who - the - hell - do - you - think - you 're - talking - to - you - young - whippersnapper look ) if I knew who had more experience with impeachment than anyone else in congress .
But then you went on to tell me how concerned you were with how we would look if impeachment failed .
You mentioned how the Republicans ran against the Dems in '06 with the threat that the Dems would waste time and divide the country with impeachment .
And you and I both know that this is the talking point that the Dem leadership has actually borrowed from the Republicans -- that impeachment would take up all of congress 's time to get other things done .
But Mr. Conyers , you , being the most experienced member of congress , regarding impeachment , you know that this is not true .
You know that when the Nixon and Agnew impeachment hearings were going on , congress got its other work done .
I 'm certain you know all of this .
It seems what you need is some way to educate the leaders in congress so THEY get it and stop thinking of impeachment in terms of the senate vote .
My conversations with impeachment advocates has led me to believe that on solution is to commission polling regarding impeachment .
But past polls have asked the simple question -- " Should Bush or Cheney be impeached ? "
That 's not the way to frame the polling .
Instead , a series of questions should be asked .
They would look something like this .

BAGHDAD –
The recent attacks by Blackwater mercenaries in Baghdad are far from the first – and many believe they will not be the last .
Seventeen Iraqis were killed Sept. 16 , and another 27 were wounded at Nisoor square in western Baghdad when mercenaries from the company opened fire on them .
Dozens of witnesses said that , contrary to Blackwater claims , the mercenaries had not come under attack .
Several Kurds who were at the scene said they saw no one firing at the mercenaries at any time , an observation corroborated by forensic evidence .
Kurds are one ethnic group that has been supportive of the U.S. - led invasion and occupation of Iraq .
The Kurd witnesses work for a political party whose building looks directly down on the square where the bloodshed occurred .
“ I call it a massacre , ” Omar H. Waso , a senior official from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , told reporters .
“ It is illegal .
They used the law of the jungle . ”
“ Some of the victims were Iraqis who were close to the government , ” an eyewitness speaking on the condition of anonymity told IPS .
“ There was a notable fuss about five or six bodies in particular when the Ministry of Interior ’s inspectors arrived on the scene . ”
The history of Western mercenary companies , often referred to as “ security contractors , ” is full of such stories .
“ They killed my young neighbor Sinan in cold blood , ” a 32 - year - old using the name Ibrahim Obeidy told IPS .
“ They have killed so many Iraqis , and no one can even ask them why . ”
“ Iraqis in Anbar province [ to the west of Baghdad ] have always said that strange - looking forces have conducted executions in cold blood , ” Abdul - Sattar Ahmed , a lawyer from Ramadi , told IPS .
“ Groups of men in civilian outfits , but in armored vehicles and sometimes helicopters , have carried out the most mysterious executions .
They seldom arrest ; they prefer to kill . ”
Salih Aziz , who works with the Iraqi Group for Human Rights , an NGO in Baghdad , told IPS that Blackwater convoys , which usually comprise several large , white SUVs , have proven deadly for Iraqi civilians since the early months of the occupation in March 2003 .
“ Since the very beginning of the U.S. occupation of Iraq , Baghdad streets have seen peculiar looking groups of men in armored cars with black glasses , killing anyone who approached them , ” said Aziz .
“ They were the first to be hated by Iraqis . ”
Blackwater USA came to international attention when four of their mercenaries were killed in Fallujah March 31 , 2004 .
The incident led to two brutal U.S. military sieges of the city .
The November siege of that year left approximately 70 percent of the city destroyed .
Tens of thousands of residents remain refugees to this day .
“ It is all about business and moneymaking , ” Malik Nizar , a 50 - year - old businessman in Baghdad , told IPS .
“ Top corporate officials , like the CEO of Blackwater , Erik Prince , are making billions of dollars out of security contracts in Iraq , and they would not give it up for the world . ”
Independent journalist Jeremy Scahill is the author of the best - selling book Blackwater : The Rise of the World ’s Most Powerful Mercenary Army .
“ From documents I obtained , it is clear that Blackwater has been contracted for some $ 750 million in private armed security services for the U.S. State Department alone , ” Scahill told IPS in a telephone interview .
“ The extent of its total U.S. contracts worldwide in unknown , as Blackwater also does covert work for the government , and its overt work is shrouded in secrecy and layers of bureaucratic protection . ”
Scahill said that while Blackwater is now under increased scrutiny , it is continuing to win lucrative contracts in Washington .
“ These include a recent $ 92 million Pentagon contract to operate flights in Central Asia , as well as a share of a whopping $ 15 billion contract to fight the so - called war on drugs , ” Scahill told IPS .
“ Even if Blackwater loses its overt Iraq contract , this company will continue to make a killing off the U.S. taxpayers . ”
The political fallout from the incident in Baghdad last month has led the Iraqi government to accept the findings of an Iraqi investigative committee that Blackwater guards are guilty of the killings , and that they acted without provocation .
The Iraqi investigators said Blackwater should be expelled from the country and demanded $ 8 million compensation for the family of each victim .
Officials decided last week to establish a committee to find ways to repeal a 2004 directive issued by L. Paul Bremer , head of the former U.S. occupation government in Iraq , which placed private security companies outside Iraqi law , making them immune to prosecution .
Many Iraqis are angry that Blackwater enjoys special rights .
“ I was shot at while driving my car in Baghdad in December 2004 , ” Saad Mohammad Saed , an NGO worker in Baghdad , told IPS .
“ I recognized the vehicles to be with a private security company .
My car was destroyed and my survival was a miracle , but when I went to court to file charges , they told me they could not question those people . ”
While it could not be verified that this incident involved Blackwater personnel , there is deep public anger with the company .
Such incidents continue .
Two Iraqi women were killed in Baghdad last week .
Maro Bougos and Jenna Jalal were driving in a white Oldsmobile when they were shot dead by men from a private security convoy .
Three children in the back seat survived .
“ Will [ U.S. President George ] Bush or [ Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri ] al - Maliki or any politician look after my sister ’s children after bringing death to their mother ? ” asked Bougos ’ brother , who was at the scene of the attack .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Muslim and Jewish groups on Monday sharply criticized Sen. John McCain 's comments that he would prefer a Christian president to lead the United States .
The Arizona Republican 's remarks came in an interview with Beliefnet , a Web site that covers religious issues and affairs .
" I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles , personally , I prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith , " the GOP presidential hopeful told the Web site in an interview published Saturday .
McCain also said he agreed with a recent poll that 55 percent of Americans believe the U.S. Constitution establishes a Christian nation .
" I would probably have to say yes , that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation , " he said .
On Sunday night , McCain sought to clarify his remarks while campaigning in Hollis , New Hampshire .
" What I do mean to say is the United States of America was founded on the values of Judeo - Christian values , which were translated by our founding fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights , " he said .
" I believe that anyone can be president of the United States of any faith , " McCain said , saying he was angry his remarks were misinterpreted but " there 's nothing I can do about it . "
Ibrahim Hooper , spokesman for the Council on American - Islamic Relations , said McCain 's comments failed to recognize that Christianity is not the only faith with beliefs that support the concept of human rights .
" Sorry , Islam and other faiths have their basis in human dignity , " Hooper said .
McCain 's remarks also " go against the traditions of American pluralism and religious pluralism and inclusion , " Hooper said .
Hooper 's organization , a Washington - based Islamic civil rights and advocacy group , said it 's trying to organize a group of Muslim leaders to meet with McCain .
The National Jewish Democratic Council , an advocacy group representing Jewish Democrats , also called on the Republican Party to denounce the remarks formally .
" Former maverick John McCain 's statements were repugnant , " the group 's executive director , Ira N. Forman , said in a statement .
" It 's been sad watching him transform from political maverick to religious right mouthpiece . "
Forman added , " Someone running for president ought to understand the Constitution a little better .
Nowhere does it say the United States is a ' Christian ' nation .
How can we trust someone to uphold the Constitution who does n't even know what is in it ? "
McCain 's communication director , Jill Hazelbaker , issued a statement Sunday defending her candidate 's comments : " Read in context , his interview with Beliefnet makes clear that people of all faiths are entitled to all the rights protected by the Constitution , including the right to practice their religion freely .
" In the interview he also observed that the values protected by the Constitution , by which he meant values such as respect for human life and dignity , are rooted in the Judeo - Christian tradition .
That is all he intended to say to the question , America is a Christian nation , and it is hardly a controversial claim . "

A protracted nominating campaign and unreliable Senate schedules have made it difficult for the presidential candidates to make it back to Washington to vote .
So difficult , in fact , that Senator John McCain of Arizona has missed more than half of the roll - call votes since January 2007 , more than any other senator except Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota , who spent most of 2007 recuperating from a brain hemorrhage .
When Mr. McCain ran for president in 1999 - 2000 , he missed just 30 percent of the Senate votes .
Still , Mr. McCain has a long way to go to match the number of votes Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts missed when he ran for president in 2003 - 4 : 72 percent .
He led the entire Senate , followed by Senator John Edwards of North Carolina , who missed nearly half the votes .

Binge - drinking revellers fuelled a chaotic start to 2008 as over - stretched ambulance workers battled to cope with emergency calls flooding in at a peak of one every eight seconds .
In the capital alone the London Ambulance Service had to deal with its highest number of emergency calls since the Millennium - the majority related to excess alcohol .
As midnight came and went there was mayhem as scores of drunken partygoers around the country tumbled into the streets , some wearing little more than their underwear .
Scroll down for more ...
Fights erupted and a string of dishevelled young men and women collapsed on benches and in doorways , too inebriated to remember or care that the night was supposed to be a celebration .
There to mop up the mess were thousands of emergency workers drafted in to provide cover on the busiest night of the year .
In the first four hours of 2008 , London Ambulance Service ( LAS ) dealt with an astonishing 1,825 calls alone , peaking at over 500 calls an hour between 2 am and 4 am .
The volume of 999 calls was up 17 per cent on last year ' and four times worse than a normal night .
Meanwhile in the West Midlands the ambulance service fielded 1,400 calls in just five hours - a rate of one every 12 seconds .
It was mirrored by the North East Ambulance Service which received 1,860 calls between 11 pm and 5 am .
Last night the astonishing number of calls to deal with booze - fuelled illness of injury prompted accusations that lives of those in real emergencies were being put at risk and demands for partygoers to wake up the costs of binge - drinking .
LAS spokeswoman Gemma Gidley said : " These calls put the Service under increased pressure to manage demand when we have to ensure we respond quickly to other patients with potentially life - threatening emergencies .
" People need to think about the real consequences of drinking so much that they require treatment . "
In the south , the South Central Ambulance Service dealt with three times more incidents that normal .
Scroll down for more ...
Control room duty manager Michele Foot said : " I think we should start charging people for the drink related stuff - it 's most self inflicted . "
In some areas special temporary treatment sites were set up to cope , paramedics set out on foot in busy city centres and volunteers from the St John Ambulance Service and Red Cross were drafted in .
Alternative transport was arranged for drunken revellers to take the strain of ambulances .
Hundreds of arrests were made by police for public order offences , as well as violence and sex and drug - related crime .
Riot vans parked in city centres prepared to deal with the inevitable fall out of a night of excess .
While thousands of people celebrated the New Year peacefully - enjoying the visual spectacles of fireworks and live music - for others the temptation to over - indulge in what have become an all - too common scenes of drunkenness was too great .
In Birmingham a group of friend bragged they would be " crawling " by the end of the night .
In Newcastle , in scenes mirrored everywhere , a young woman - shoeless and seemingly very much the worse for wear - had to be aided by paramedics while nearby a well - built man lay face down in the street after being set upon by four other men .
" This is going to be a long night , " said one weary paramedic , confiding : " We will spend all night picking up people who are too drunk to walk and people who got into fights . "

Everywhere revellers who had lost all their inhibitions were happy to brag about their drinking exploits .
Sisters Sarah and Teri Crame , both dancers , wore burlesque outfits better - suited to the boudoir as they strutted through the rain - soaked street .
" We 've been drinking since about seven , " said Teri .
" We 're both wrecked and loving it .
Mixing our drinks always leads to trouble - we 've had wine , lager and vodka tonight . "
In Cardiff a group of young women , who would have been well - advised to cover up , tottered along in nothing more than heels and white underwear .
Among those happy to boast about far exceeding the Government recommended weekly safe limit for drinking in just one night were a group of teachers .
Bearing the brunt of the chaos , Paramedic Martyn Sullivan said : " We 've had a lot of drunken calls and a lot of assault .
I 've been threatened myself tonight . "
In Bristol , a young woman wearing a tiny black dress despite the elements slumped on the floor as a friend , laughing , spent five minutes trying to lift her .
Meanwhile a semi-naked man argued with police and other partygoers vomited over railings into the river .

Fights broke out long before midnight and continued into the small hours .
In Slough , Berkshire a crowd of drunken teenagers was involved in a punch up which ended with a 17 - year - old boy being stabbed in the chest .
Another person was stabbed in Woking , Surrey after a mass brawl .
In Hampshire every custody centre in the county was full .
For anyone not used to the less than sober face of a British New Year the night was something of an eye - opener .
Belgian Florence Meganck , 25 , was out in Bristol and summed up the evening .
" At 9 pm I saw people throwing up - England is totally different to Belgium .
" The whole evening I have been watching English girls wearing dresses that only just cover their underwear .
They zig - zag through the streets in their tiny skirts .
" I saw a girl who looked like she was n't older than 12 buy alcohol from a shop and then give it to even younger girls waiting outside .
" Even though I have n't drunk tonight I have had such fun laughing at all the drunken English people .
" But these drunks wo n't enjoy New Year 's Eve , most of them wo n't even remember it . "

WASHINGTON , Nov. 13 — Just four days after Michael B. Mukasey was sworn in as attorney general , Justice Department officials said Tuesday that President Bush had reversed course and approved long - denied security clearances for the Justice Department ’s ethics office to investigate the National Security Agency ’s warrantless surveillance program .
The department ’s inspector general has been investigating the department ’s involvement with the N.S.A. program for about a year , but the move suggested both that Mr. Mukasey wanted to remedy what many in Congress saw as an improper decision by the president to block the clearances and that the White House chose to back him .
Tony Fratto , a White House spokesman , and Brian Roehrkasse , a Justice Department spokesman , declined to say whether Mr. Mukasey had pressed Mr. Bush on the clearances for the department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility .
Mr. Mukasey himself had indicated in a written answer to senators on Oct. 30 , before his confirmation , that the clearance issue had been resolved .
But Democrats said they thought Mr. Mukasey deserved credit .
“ It seems the new attorney general understands that his responsibility is to the American people and the rule of law and not to any particular person , including the president , ” said Representative Maurice D. Hinchey , Democrat of New York , who had first demanded the internal Justice Department investigation .
In response to appeals from Mr. Hinchey and other members of Congress , the head of the Office of Professional Responsibility , H. Marshall Jarrett , said in February 2006 that he had opened an investigation of the conduct of department lawyers in approving and overseeing the N.S.A. program .
But three months later he said the inquiry had been dropped because his staff had been denied the necessary high - level clearances .
Dependent Records , an independent record label from Germany recently decided to shut its doors and upload all its albums onto The Pirate Bay .
Interestingly , a year ago the the CEO of the label mentioned piracy as one of the main reasons why they decided to quit .
Register readers , read this …
2 + 2 =
Nonetheless , a few days ago ( edit : someone who pretends to be ) Dependent records ’
CEO Stefan Herwig decided to upload all the albums from his label - which mainly features aggrotech , electro - industrial and futurepop artists - onto The Pirate Bay .
In the description on the torrent download page ( edit : the fake ) Herwig writes : “ I closed down my record label Dependent Records for good .
But since I want my music to be heard by the people out there , everything I have ever published is now available on The Pirate Bay , ” stressing that it ’s a legal torrent , approved by the label .
Over the past few months , more and more artists have decided to make their music available for free on BitTorrent sites .
However , this move from Dependent Records seems to be a bit odd , especially when you read why the label decided to close its doors .
Perhaps the Stefan who posted the albums onto The Pirate Bay is n’t the real one ?
Little over a year ago , ( edit : the real ) Stefan Herwig wrote : “ We are not closing our doors because of the existence of pirate websites , but because there are simply too many people who enjoy our bands and their songs who do not wish to pay for them . ”
Herwig and his team got frustrated when they saw their albums appearing on P2P networks .
They do n’t seem to buy the argument that indie artists actually profit from these new technologies , as Herwig writes : “ A popular claim often seen on Internet fora maintains that the P2P culture weakens the majors and bolsters the independent labels .
This is , we can assure you , 100 % bullshit .
Even if there are listeners who download first and buy later , they are clearly in the dwindling minority . ”
We understand Herwig ’s frustration , but 100 % bullshit is not completely accurate .
Several studies have shown that most artists , especially those who are not mainstream , profit from filesharing .
The dwindling minority Herwig is talking about probably exists because of filesharing , and may have never discovered Dependent Records ’ artists if their albums were n’t available there .
Music consumption has changed significantly the last decade .
People consume more music simply because it is available , illegal or not .
The challenge for the the recording industry is to find ways to monetize this demand , for example by all - you - can - eat plans for a fixed price .
The bottom line is , piracy has shown that music is more popular than ever , and no artist will ever argue that this is a bad thing .
Update : Stefan , and a colleagues from Dependent Records officially deny that they have anything to do with the leaked albums .
They claim that the albums are uploaded by someone who pretends to be Herwig , and has access to the entire catalog of the label .
“ We never decided anything like that .
The offer is completely illegal .
The Person who create an account with the nickname Stefan_Herwig has absolutely nothing to do with our label owner of the same name . ”
MARCH 7 -- Federal prosecutors want to gag an indicted former Washington , D.C. madam who has recently threatened to go public with details about her former customers .
In a motion filed Monday in U.S. District Court , investigators are seeking a protective order covering discovery material to be provided to Deborah Palfrey and her lawyers .
Palfrey , 50 , was indicted last week on racketeering and money laundering charges stemming from her operation of the Pamela Martin & Associates escort service , which closed last summer after 13 years in business .
In their motion , a copy of which you 'll find below , government lawyers claim that some discovery documents contain ' personal information ' about Palfrey 's former johns and prostitutes that is ' sensitive . '
The prosecution filing does not detail the nature of this confidential information , though the identity of Palfrey 's D.C. customers would surely be cloaked if the protective order was signed by Judge Gladys Kessler .
According to the prosecution motion , while Palfrey and her lawyers would be able to use the discovery material to help prepare a defense , they would not be allowed to disclose the documents to anyone else ( nor use the material for any other purposes ) .
Palfrey , whose assets were frozen late last year , has recently floated the idea of selling her escort business 's phone records .
She has also ' made statements that could be considered veiled threats to cause embarrassment to former customers and employees , ' according to the motion .
In connection with an asset forfeiture action , Palfrey has sought to depose political consultant Dick Morris , who she has identified as a former escort service client .
While no clients are identified in Palfrey 's five - count indictment , the charging document indicates that 14 former associates testified before the grand jury that indicted her .
Palfrey was previously convicted of operating a prostitution business in California and spent 18 months in prison ( where the above mug shot was snapped ) .
Before closing her business , Palfrey operated a web site touting Pamela Martin & Associates as ' the best adult agency around , ' claiming that it had an ' ongoing repeat clientele rate of 65 - 75 % . '
Palfrey 's site also advertised for escorts .
Prospective hookers , she noted , had to be at least 23 years old with two or more years of college .
And her $ 275 - an - appointment employees had to be ' weight proportionate to height . '

" Die Gustloff , " a two - part multi-million euro movie shown on German state broadcaster ZDF , was the most - watched TV program on Sunday , March 2 , with 8.45 million people tuning in .
The second half of the three - hour film will be broadcast on Monday evening .
The " Wilhelm Gustloff " had been built to hold 1,500 passengers .
The 209 metre-long ( 685 feet ) ship , named after the assassinated head of the Swiss Nazi party , was launched in 1937 and conceived as a cruise liner for the Nazis ' leisure organisation Kraft durch Freude , or " strength through joy . "
Once war broke out , it was used by the German military .
But 10,000 refugees , many of them women and children , fleeing the advancing Red Army were on board the former Nazi cruise ship when it was sunk by torpedoes from a Soviet submarine on Jan. 30 , 1945 , in the Baltic Sea shortly after leaving the port of Gotenhafen ( now Gdynia , Poland ) in Gdansk Bay .
The boat had not been flagged as a Red Cross transport .
Over 9,000 died in the icy water , six times more than were killed when the " Titanic " sunk after hitting an iceberg in 1912 .
The " Gustloff " had been used as living quarters for sailors in Gotenhafen but was seen by many as the last chance to escape the advancing Soviet Army .
Thousands collected at the port in temperatures of - 18 degree ( 0 degrees Fahrenheit ) to try to get a spot on the ship .
The ship sank 60 years ago
The movie , directed by Joseph Vilsmaier , was based on historical events , though the characters were fictitious .
Vilsmaier and screenplay writer Rainer Berg consulted with survivor Heinz Schoen , then an 18 - year - old assistant purser , to help get things right .
A critical failure
Vilsmaier tells the story through the perspective of a young captain in the merchant marine who tries in vain to prevent the ship from leaving port before an escort arrives to accompany it to Kiel .
The story of the " Gustloff " was relatively unknown until Nobel laureate Guenter Grass wrote about it in his 2002 novel " Im Krebsgang " ( Crabwalk ) .
Guenter Grass wrote about the disaster in " Crabwalk "
Wilhelm Gustloff , a Swiss Nazi leader , was assassinated by a Jewish man named David Frankenfurter in 1936 and declared a martyr by the Nazis .
Frankfurter was sentenced to 18 years in prison , expelled from the country and later worked for Israel 's defense ministry .
Switzerland only allowed him to enter the country in 1969 .
Germany 's broadsheets gave the movie bad marks , criticizing its embellishment of the events .
The film had failed due to very basic " shortcomings of the script and the directing , " the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote .
" More broadcasting time has n't led to more broadcast quality , " the Sueddeutsche Zeitung commented .
" In the end the lovers found each other : the captain and his fiance .
That 's how it is in television .
A deeper insight does n't stick , just as little does from the place it's about , the Wilhelm Gustloff , " the paper wrote .
The Frankfurter Rundschau even called the movie an " accident with history . "
The Dharavi squatter settlement in Mumbai is often described as the biggest slum in Asia .
It sits between two rail lines in the northern part of the city , on a creek that once sustained a thriving fishery .
The creek is now a sump of sewage and industrial waste , and the air above Dharavi is foul .
By one estimate , the slum is home to 10,000 small factories , almost all of them illegal and unregulated .
The factories provide sustenance of a sort to the million or so people who are thought to live in Dharavi , which at 432 acres is barely half the size of New York City 's Central Park .
There is no discernible garbage pickup , and only one toilet for every 1,440 people .
It is a vision of urban hell .
It is also one of India 's newest tourist attractions .
Since January of last year , a young British entrepreneur , Christopher Way , and his Indian business partner , Krishna Poojari , have been selling walking tours of Dharavi as if it were Jerusalem 's walled city or the byways of Dickens ' London .
There seems to be a market for this sort of thing : almost every day during the recent December holidays , small groups of foreign travelers , accompanied by Poojari or another guide , tramped through Dharavi 's fetid alleys in a stoic quest for ... What ?
Enlightenment ?
Authenticity ?
The three - hour excursions are slated for mention in a forthcoming Lonely Planet guide , and they cost about $ 6.75 a head — more if you want to go to Dharavi by air - conditioned car .
Poverty tourism — sometimes known as " poorism " — did not originate in Mumbai ( formerly Bombay ) .
For years , tour operators have been escorting foreign visitors through Rio de Janeiro 's infamous favelas , with their drug gangs and ocean views , and the vast townships outside Cape Town and Johannesburg , where tourists are invited to mix with South Africans at one of the illicit beer halls known as shebeens .
A nonprofit group in New Delhi charges tourists for guided walks through the railway station , to raise money for the street children who haunt its platforms .
But the Dharavi tours have been especially controversial .
In a lengthy report last September , the Indian English - language Times Now television channel attacked them as an exercise in voyeurism and a sleazy bid to " cash in on the Ôpoor - India ' image . "
That report was followed by a panel discussion in which the moderator all but accused Poojari of crimes against humanity .
" If you were living in Dharavi , in that slum , would you like a foreign tourist coming and walking all over you ? " he sputtered .
" This kind of slum tourism , it is a clear invasion of somebody 's privacy .... You are treating humans like animals . "
A tourism official on the panel called the tour operators " parasites [ who ] need to be investigated and put behind bars , " and a state lawmaker has threatened to shut them down .
The critics , it seemed , had claimed the moral high ground .
But could they hold it ?
One sunny morning this past December , I met Christopher Way at Leopold 's Café , a popular backpackers ' hangout in Mumbai 's bustling Colaba district .
At 31 , he is boyish and bespectacled , with a thatch of tousled brown hair and a thoughtful , unassuming manner .
Over glasses of freshly squeezed mango juice , he told me that he grew up near Birmingham , England , and after graduation from Birmingham University , set off on a path to become a chartered accountant .
But Way was afflicted with chronic wanderlust .
In 2002 , he visited Mumbai and liked the city so much that he stayed five months , volunteering as an English teacher and cricket coach in a local elementary school .
He subsequently took an extended holiday in Rio , where he signed up for one of the favela tours .
Although frustrated by the guide 's lack of knowledge about the shantytown , Way says he found the experience fascinating .
It occurred to him that he might be able to do something similar in Mumbai .
As many as half of that city 's 18 million or so residents live in squatter settlements , so there was no shortage of potential venues .
But Dharavi , as the largest and most established of Mumbai 's slums , was the obvious choice .
Way 's idea was to showcase the settlement 's economic underpinnings in a way that would challenge stereotypes about the poor .
" We 're trying to dispel the myth that people there sit around doing nothing , that they 're criminals , " he said after we had walked across the street to his office , a grubby , windowless space barely big enough for his desk and laptop computer .
" We show it for what it is — a place where people are working hard , struggling to make a living and doing it in an honest way . "
To smooth things out with local bureaucrats and Dharavi residents , Way needed an Indian partner , and he found one in Poojari , now 26 , a farmer 's son who had migrated to Mumbai as an unaccompanied 12 year old and put himself through night school by working in an office cafeteria .
The two men formed a company , Reality Tours & Travel , and bought a pair of air - conditioned SUVs .
Way bankrolled the venture with income from rental properties he owns in England .
Besides the Dharavi tours — which can be combined with visits to Mumbai 's red- light district and Dhobi Ghat , a vast open - air laundry — the company offers sightseeing of a more conventional nature , along with hotel bookings and airport transportation .
Way has pledged that once the company starts making a profit , it will donate 80 percent of its slum - tour earnings to a charitable group that works in Dharavi .
" I did n't want to make money from the slum tours , " he says .
" It would n't have felt right . "
Except on its Web site ( Leopold 's Café — " See Dharavi ( the biggest slum in Asia ) " — the company does not advertise the slum excursions .
But as word has spread over the Internet and by other means , business has grown steadily , drawing visitors from around the world .
Late one morning I met Poojari at the Churchgate railway station , where we hopped on a dilapidated commuter train for the 25 - minute ride to Dharavi .
Waiting for us there was tourist Jeff Ellingson , a 29 - year - old technology professional from Seattle .
Before we got started , Poojari explained that the company has a no- photography policy , to keep the tours from becoming too intrusive .
( For the same reason , each group is limited to five people . )
Then we took a pedestrian bridge over the railroad tracks .
Dharavi stretched before us like a vast junkyard , a hodgepodge of brick and concrete tenements roofed with corrugated metal sheets that gleamed dully in the sunshine .
Poojari gave us a moment to take it all in .
" We 'll show you the positive side of a slum , " he declared .
In the face of such squalor , his words seemed jarring .
But Dharavi 's industriousness is well documented .
Its businesses manufacture a variety of products — plastics , pottery , bluejeans , leather goods — and generate an estimated $ 665 million in annual revenue .
In other words , Dharavi is not just a slum , it is also a node on the global economy .
Dharavi's industries are arranged geographically , like medieval guilds , and the first alley we visited belonged to recyclers .
In one small " godown " ( as warehouses are known on the subcontinent ) , men were disassembling old computer keyboards .
In another , men smeared from head to toe in blue ink stripped the casings from used ballpoint pens so they could be melted down and recycled .
A few doors down , workers used heavy chains to knock the residue from steel drums that had once contained polyester resin .
Poojari told us that some of Dharavi 's empty plastic bottles come from as far away as the United Kingdom .
" People from a rich family , when they drink from a plastic bottle , they do n't know what happens to it afterwards , " he said .
" Here , you see . "
Few of the recyclers wore gloves or other protective gear , despite exposure to solvents and other chemicals that caused my eyes and throat to burn after just a few minutes .
The working conditions were typical of Dharavi 's unregulated businesses .
Some of the worst were in the foundries .
From the door of one dark , unventilated space , I watched a heavyset worker dressed in a sarong ladle molten steel into a belt - buckle mold that he held between his feet .
His bare feet .
After cracking open the mold to reveal the glowing red buckle in its bed of sand , he glanced up , and for a moment our eyes met .
His face was wooden , expressionless .
I mumbled thanks and moved on .
Not for the first time on the tour , I felt like an interloper , and I wondered how the slum workers and their families felt about white - skinned strangers who showed up to gawk from the threshold .
For Dharavi was undeniably grim .
As we neared its center , the alleys narrowed and cantilevered balconies closed out the sun , casting everything in a permanent gloom .
Children played next to gutters that flowed with human waste , and hollow - eyed men bent nearly double under the weight of burlap - covered loads .
But if the people of Dharavi resented us , they kept it to themselves .
Some even seemed happy to take part in our education .
" Here , everybody is working , " a man said genially , and in perfect English , as we paused outside the yogurt - cup recycling operation where he sat sipping tea with the owner .
The welcoming reception probably had something to do with the tour operators , who have cultivated good relations with the slum workers as well as local police .
There are , moreover , certain rules .
From the door of a one - room garment factory , I spotted a boy who looked to be no more than 8 sitting with other workers at a long table , where he was embroidering fabric with fine gold thread .
I nudged my guide : " Ask him how old he is . "
Poojari shook his head no .
Pointed questions were not part of his compact with the slum dwellers .
As it happens , Ellingson and I did not see many child laborers in Dharavi , perhaps because of laws limiting employment of children under 14 or , more likely — as Way suggested later — because they were sequestered out of view .
We did see several schools , however , and plenty of kids in uniforms .
" By plane you are coming ? " one boy asked in English , before declaring , with evident pride , " I 'm studying in 8th standard . "
Blighted though it was , Dharavi had the feeling of an established community .
Signs in Hindi advertised the services of doctors and dentists .
An outdoor barber administered a shave with a folding razor .
A laundryman stood against an alley wall , pressing clothes with an ancient - looking iron .
At a small factory where recycled plastic was melted down and turned into tiny pellets for use by toymakers , the owner , who was in his late 20s , told us that his father had started the business three decades ago .
Like many of the slum dwellers , the factory owner was a Muslim , although Dharavi is nothing if not diverse .
Its residents come from all over India , and many have lived there for a generation or more .
Poojari said that one of the slum neighborhoods is dominated by the descendants of potters from Gujarat state who settled in Dharavi in 1933 .
When we visited the potters ' district in the early afternoon , we were puzzled to find few signs of life , other than smoking kilns and an old man napping on a rope cot .
It turned out that most of the potters and their families had taken the afternoon off to attend a wedding .
Ellingson drew a comparison with Palestinian communities he had toured in the West Bank .
They were " a lot wealthier , but it 's like society has broken down , " he said , adding that in Dharavi , " it feels like something is functioning . "
I had to agree .
For one thing , almost no one asked for money , or even tried to sell me anything .
Only once was I approached for a handout , by an elderly woman .
That was a big change from Colaba , the main tourist district , where it is difficult to walk more than a few steps without being accosted by a beggar — usually a young woman with an infant on her hip — or a peddler hawking laminated maps .
Perhaps people in Dharavi were simply too busy .
And some of them clearly had rupees in their pockets .
Besides the food stalls and handcarts piled high with okra and squash , there were video parlors showing Bollywood hits , several bars and , on one thoroughfare , a spiffy - looking electronics store plastered with Sony decals .
" They 're happy to be here , " Poojari said as we paused outside a small factory where women were stitching bluejeans .
" They do n't want to move out of Dharavi . "
I do n't know about " happy , " but on the latter point , Poojari was probably correct .
Because of its prime location — on rail lines near the heart of one of the world 's most crowded cities —
Dharavi sits on valuable real estate , and its residents are not about to give up their stake .
The slum is the focus of a looming showdown with municipal authorities and developers who want to turn it into office towers , luxury apartments and shopping centers .
Families that can prove they have lived in Dharavi since 1995 would be entitled to a free apartment in the same area , but the new dwellings would be so small — just 225 square feet — that many prefer to stay where they are .
Nor is it clear what would happen to the thousands of businesses that provide Dharavi residents with jobs .
We finished the tour on the side of a busy four - lane road , where the festive sounds of a Hindu wedding ceremony — apparently the one the potters had gone to — spilled from a gaudy tent .
We paused to peek inside , and I spotted the groom sitting awkwardly beneath an enormous gold turban .
No one gave us a second glance , and I had to wonder about the motives of those in the Indian media and elsewhere who claimed on behalf of the Dharavi residents to be offended by the tours .
Surely their ire could have been better targeted at the municipal authorities who had failed to provide the community with basic sanitation .
I wondered whether the critics were n't simply embarrassed by the slum 's glaring poverty — an image at odds with the country 's efforts to rebrand itself as a big software park .
In any case , it seemed to me that the purpose of the tour was not to generate pity , but understanding .
That 's not to say that it made me an expert — I was only there a few hours , after all .
Were the people I saw in Dharavi the victims of globalization , or its beneficiaries ?
I still do n't know .
But at least the question had been raised in my mind .
John Lancaster recently completed a four - year assignment as the South Asia correspondent for the Washington Post .
We ’re not just in the most vertiginous election of our lives .
We ’re in another national seminar on gender and race that is teaching us about who we are as we figure out what we want America to be .
It ’s not yet clear which prejudice will infect the presidential contest more  misogyny or racism .
Many women
I talk to , even those who are n’t particularly fond of Hillary , feel empathy for her , knowing that any woman in a world dominated by men has to walk a tightrope between femininity and masculinity , strength and vulnerability .
They see double standards they hate  when male reporters described Hillary ’s laugh as “ a cackle ” or her voice as “ grating , ” when Rush Limbaugh goes off on her wrinkles or when male pundits seem gleeful to write her political obituary .
Several women I know , who argue with their husbands about Hillary , refer with a shudder to the “ Kill the Witch ” syndrome .
In a webcast , prestidigitator Penn Jillette talks about a joke he has begun telling in his show .
He thinks the thunderous reaction it gets from audiences shows that Hillary no longer has a shot .
The joke goes : “ Obama is just creaming Hillary .
You know , all these primaries , you know .
And Hillary says it ’s not fair , because they ’re being held in February , and February is Black History Month .
And unfortunately for Hillary , there ’s no White Bitch Month . ”
Screw Godwin ’s law !
Here ’s Napierski’s law :
“ As an online comic becomes older , the probability of complaining about Ctrl + Alt + Del approaches one . ”
I find so much humor in the CAD bashing .
Fine .
There are people out there who have legitimate gripes about CAD and Tim Buckley .
But a good chunk of the bitching comes from people who are jealous of what Buckley has achieved .
Ctrl + Alt +Del is either the second or third largest webcomic in the world ( behind only Penny Arcade or both Penny Arcade and XKCD ) .
That ’s nothing to scoff at .
And if you do n’t think he deserves it , it ’s definitely something to be jealous …
( I got a lot of flak for people not completely understanding what I was saying .
So let me give you the definition of the word jealous . )
Jeal * ous – adj .
Having to do with or arising from feelings of envy , apprehension , or bitterness .
( Make sense ? )
The problem is that every time you complain about Ctrl + Alt + Del on your site or a forum or send someone a link , you are bringing more traffic to the site .
Odds are that the people already reading CAD are not reading your blog or if they do , it wo n’t change their opinion .
But since everyone has different opinions , its possible that you gained Ctrl + Alt +
Del a new reader by exposing someone to it that may not have been familiar to it before .
What I do if I do n’t like another webcomic is nothing .
I do n’t mention it , I do n’t answer comments about it , and I definitely do n’t link to it .
I promote what I like and not what I do n’t .
Make sense ?
Since what may be known about God is plain to them , because God has made it plain to them .
For since the creation of the world God ’s invisible qualities / his eternal power and divine nature / have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , so that men are without excuse .

To you I ’m an atheist ; to God , I ’m the Loyal Opposition .

Atheism and agnosticism are two categories that get tossed around with far too much flippancy .
In common parlance , and more and more in professional circles , the terms lack proper definition .
Thus , perverted usage has taken over and confused the issues .
Atheism has come to mean “ the belief in no God ” and agnosticism “ not being sure if God exists . ”
Both of these popular definitions are wrong .
While being wrong is bad enough , these widespread distortions also work solely in favor of the theist .
Due to the misunderstanding of both terms numerous Christians have attempted to redefine all atheists as agnostics ; and far too many atheists have quietly ushered themselves into that less caustic corner .
This confusion must end .
It ’s time to do a little gerrymandering in the name of rational disbelief — to show why many self - described “ agnostics ” are actually atheists .
“ Agnosticism ” has been greatly misunderstood by modern audiences .
The term ’s original meaning has nearly been completely lost .
Originally coined by Darwin ’s attack - dog Thomas Huxley to describe himself as one who did not believe that God ’s existence was knowable , agnosticism has been converted to mean one who does not know .
The two definitions are worlds apart .
The former is a claim on the epistemological status of a belief , the latter is a reluctance to accept a claim .
Somehow we moved from the belief that God ’s existence is something that humans cannot be sure about to not being sure about God ’s existence .
Likewise , atheism suffers from severe misunderstandings .
With Christians , atheism is a category that will put you in the doghouse .
Recent data has shown atheists to be among the most distrusted people in the United States .
Agnosticism , on the other hand , will just put you out in the yard .
The modern Christian believes that agnostics ( as they mistakenly take the term ) commit a grievous — but understandable — error .
God , after all , is transcendentally unknowable .
However , with a little help ( an occasional tract or two , a gifted copy of Mere Christianity ) agnostics can be helped out of their folly .
The atheist , however , is incorrigible .
To call yourself an atheist is to put a foot down where the agnostic fears to tread .
The atheist willfully denies the existence of He - Whose - Existence - is - Obvious - and - Undeniable .
For many theists , atheists are not just incorrect but incoherent and impossible .
In his book “ God Does n’t Believe in Atheists ” noted Christian apologist Ray Comfort makes this quite clear : “ If you insist upon disbelief in God , what you must say is , ‘ Having the limited knowledge I have at present , I believe that there is no God . ’
Owing to a lack of knowledge on your part you do n’t know if God exists .
So , in the strict sense of the word , you can not be an atheist .
The only true qualifier for the title is the One who has absolute knowledge , and why on earth would God want to deny His own existence ?
The professing atheist is what is commonly known as an ‘ agnostic ’ — one who claims to not know if God exists , or ‘ one who professes ignorance . ' ”
Comfort ’s interpretation of the terms is clear .
He is also moving through well - trod territory .
Theists constantly try to demote ( or “ promote ” depending on your point of view ) professed atheists to agnostics .
This move is a furtive attempt to win an argumentative point through reclassification .
Ray Comfort ’s current shtick is playing wingman to Kirk Cameron ’s newest calling ; the Evangelical Christian organization “ The Way of the Master . ”
On the website you can see videos addressing evolution and “ atheism ” — at least Comfort ’s version of atheism .
The video on atheism has Comfort reiterating his point from “ God Does n’t Believe in Atheists . ”
However , he adds a wrinkle to his point — a wrinkle in the form of an astonishingly bad argument .
To recapitulate Comfort ’s argument : you do n’t know what you do n’t know so to claim that you know something does n’t exist is to claim that you know something that you could n’t possibly know because of all the things that you do n’t know .
You know ?
This is an argument that should make all good philosophers vomit their skeletons through their computer screens .
But , apparently due to its front - and - center treatment , this is among the best Ray Comfort has to offer .
Skeleton - vomiting aside , it is worth taking a moment to point out that Comfort ’s argument is actually an argument against the possibility for any non-omniscient creature to claim knowledge of any kind .
Flowing from his rhetoric is the inevitable conclusion that you cannot claim to know one thing unless you know all things .
Therefore , if Comfort accepts his own argument he must believe in the existence of every postulated object – every god , demi- god , man - god , sub - god and cosmic teapot ( for starters ) – as well as every possible postulation ( everything that has yet to be thought up ) .
From the position he has laid out he cannot assert his own disbelief in any contingent object or entity .
Also , as he says in his quote above , the only one who can be an atheist is God himself .
Of course , it equally follows that the only one who could be justifiably called a theist is God himself .
Comfort ’s argument rests on his confusion – a confusion that is now a pandemic – about the meanings of the terms “ agnosticism ” and “ atheism . ”
The argument only makes sense , if it makes sense at all , if his definition of atheism is the one stated earlier in this essay ; that atheism is “ belief in no God . ”
In fact , atheism is properly understood as “ no belief in God . ”
The difference is subtle yet very important .
The distinction can be pointed out by this question : “ Do you believe that FDR did not eat any oranges during the week following Pearl Harbor ? ”
Assuming that we are all ignorant of this claim it would be absurd to answer in the affirmative to this question .
The proper course is not to believe that FDR did not eat any oranges during that week but rather to take the position that you have no belief that he did .
Sufficient reason has not been given to believe the proposition .
This is the atheist position .
By demanding that theists give sufficient reasons for believing in God , the atheist maintains that the burden of proof rests on the shoulders of the theist .
This is unquestionably true with regards to any specific religious tradition .
No religious tradition holds the automatic supposition that it is true .
The preponderance of various religions and the grandiosity of their claims guarantee that it is up to the theist to convince the atheist that their conception of God is correct .
Most Christians — and this clearly includes Ray Comfort — will talk at length of how they find atheism unimaginable .
They , however , know exactly what it feels like to be an atheist .
Of all the Gods that people claim or have claimed to exist Christians find only one to have merit .
They rightly place a burden of proof upon other religions that must be satisfied in order to merit belief .
Therefore , in most situations Christians know exactly with whom the burden of proof rests .
However , when it comes to someone who does n’t accept their beliefs they shift the burden of proof to the atheist .
However , the position they take towards others ’ religions is precisely the same position I take upon theirs ( and all religions ) .
Comfort ’s argument against atheism is as much an argument against his beliefs as it is mine .
Other , non-religious , conceptions of God — the scientists ’
Gods , the prime mover , first cause , “ higher powers , ” God as essence rather than God as being — are pushed towards irrelevance .
As scientists continue to explain more about the universe the burden of proof continues to be placed in the lap of the theist — particularly with regards to teleological “ arguments from design . ”
Cosmologically , however , the question of “ why is there something instead of nothing ? ” will always be insoluble .
If you choose God to be your answer to such an abstruse question so be it .
But , for any characteristics you wish to instill in that God beyond “ first cause ” — i.e. personal , interested , omnipotent , good etc. — the burden of proof will once again lie in your lap .
These anthropomorphic characteristics are the ones that the majority of theists care the most about — whether God knows , cares , acts , desires , is angry etc .
However , they are also the hardest to justify .
Despite the many nuanced and opaque philosophical debates to be had about the status of identifying and clarifying who has the burden of proof and why , I am quite sure that miracle working , resurrected god-men , floods and floating arks , multi-armed androgynous deities , and mountain - moving prophets are not close to the gray - area of these difficult distinctions .
Whatever else it may be , the burden of proof at least rests in the hands of those who claim the magnificent .
It would behoove Christians like Comfort to return to a more productive path in order to argue for their beliefs — a path that does n’t use bad arguments and bad definitions to advance bad points .
Theists and atheists alike , if they wish to engage in meaningful debate , need to agree on at least one item ; that neither of them “ knows ” the status of God ’s existence .
Mostly this stems from traditional philosophical skepticism .
Philosophers may debate which claims are indubitable claims to knowledge ( i.e. “ I think therefore I am ” ) but almost every philosopher would agree that most claims of knowledge , especially anything based on empirical data , cannot be reasonably said to be indubitable knowledge .
Aside from more mundane reasons for doubt , there is always the possibility Descartes ’s evil demon is deceiving us or that we are simply brains - in - vats .
Beliefs are not knowledge .
Yes , believing is a necessary element of knowing .
To know so is to believe so .
But knowing is not a necessary element of believing .
To believe so is not to know so .
If we are intellectually honest with ourselves we will come to understand that nearly every belief in our heads that is at all interesting ( tautologies are awfully boring ) is a probabilistic belief rather than a certain belief .
A car just came around the corner .
I do n’t know that the car was n’t materialized by aliens immediately outside of my vision .
Likewise I do n’t know that a donkey is n’t sitting on my driveway right now .
However , I would confidently assert that I have no belief in either proposition .
But it would be disingenuous — to incorrectly use the terms — to call me a donkey - in - my - driveway agnostic .
I am a donkey - in - my - driveway atheist and I will continue believe so until you give me reason not to .
Such thinking allows us to see that those who call themselves atheists are perfectly justified in doing so .
That is , Comfort and others ’ claims that atheism is too strong of a term is inaccurate .
Furthermore , we find that many who have historically called themselves “ agnostics , ” based on the common and confused definition of “ not knowing , ” could rightly be called atheists .
Because none of us “ knows ” the status of God ’s existence , the common interpretation of “ agnosticism ” is pushed towards irrelevancy .
In one very mundane sense we are all “ agnostics . ”
But I am an atheist ; and I use the term accurately and whole - heartedly .
However , I am not an atheist because I know God does not exist .
I am an atheist because I find His existence highly improbable .
I find it improbable enough to act as if he does not exist and to be comfortable with my decision .
But , I also do n’t believe that God ’s existence or non-existence is “ knowable ” in any epistemologically defensible way .
In this sense I could rightly be called an “ agnostic atheist . ”
But actions do speak louder than words .
Like all of us , Ray Comfort does n’t know that God exists .
But Comfort acts as if God does exist because he believes God ’s existence to be highly probable .
I , as already stated , am on the other side .
However , the majority of self - described “ agnostics ” — who use the term to mean “ do n’t know ” — act like atheists .
They do not attend church or actively attempt to appease God .
In other words , they act as if the burden of proof has not been met by the theists — at least any group of theists they have encountered — and move on the supposition that the world is naturalistic and godless .
This is identical to the atheist ’s position .
The cash - value of a belief is the actions it creates .
Epistemologists have occasionally been inclined to take a gambling metaphor as representative of degrees of certainty .
“ Oh , you ’re certain of your belief ?
How much would you bet ? ”
Monetary issues aside , it is still worth acknowledging that beliefs produce actions representative of the level of conviction .
Beliefs that are thought to be highly probable produce decisive actions .
By acting as if God does n’t exist agnostics are demonstrating their skepticism towards God ’s existence .
Most importantly they are demonstrating that the burden of proof lies with the theist and that it has not been met .
However , because the term “ atheist ” has been so demonized in modern society — in addition to being massively misunderstood — agnostics prefer a lighter moniker .
But , it may be time for many agnostics to step up to the plate .
Perhaps this essay will convince some that a name - change is in order .
The broader purpose of this essay is to clarify terms and unite sides because , in reality , the agnostic and the atheist are on the same side .
Both believe the Christian ( Muslim , Hindu et. al. ) has n’t made their case .
Either way , it is certainly time for both theists and atheists to stop equivocating their definitions and clarify what is meant by “ atheist ” and “ agnostic . ”
Yes , they may be just words .
But remember , in the beginning was the word .
If you decide to learn how Native American religions formed then you ’ll have to take their culture into consideration since that has a large impact on how religions start .
This is something about religion that can be considered fairly universal , not just applicable to just Native American spirituality alone .
It 's just straws in the wind so far .
India 's Ministry of Culture announces that foreign tourists can no longer pay in dollars when visiting the Taj Mahal and other heritage sites ; they have to pay in good , hard rupees .
Iran and Venezuela call for a joint OPEC statement on the weak U.S. dollar , and Saudi Arabian Foreign Affairs Minister Saud al Faisal warns that any public reference to the U.S. dollar 's problems could cause the troubled currency to " collapse " .
Rap star Jay - Z's latest video shows our hero flashing a wad of euros , not dollars .
Only straws in the wind , but all in the past couple of weeks .
For the majority of Americans who do not travel abroad , the only visible effect so far of the dollar 's steep fall has been higher fuel prices at the pump .
The Chinese imports that fill the big - box stores still cost the same because the Chinese yuan is still pegged to the American dollar .
But that may be about to change , along with many other things .
At the beginning of 2003 , one euro bought one U.S. dollar .
Eighteen months ago , it bought $ 1.20 .
Now it is pushing $ 1.50 , and there is no reason to think that it will stop there .
Three of the world 's biggest oil exporters , Iran , Venezuela , and Russia , are demanding payment in euros rather than U.S. dollars .
Last week , a Chinese central bank vice director , Xu Jian , gave voice to the suspicion of many others , saying that the U.S. dollar was " losing its status as the world currency " .
If that happens , then America loses a great deal .
Other countries have to maintain large reserves of foreign currencies –most of which they keep in U.S. dollars –to cover their foreign debts , but the United States can pay its huge foreign debts in its own money .
If necessary , it can just print more dollars .
Having their own money as the world 's reserve currency confers advantages that Americans would miss if they lost them .
The main reason for the collapse of the U.S. dollar is President George W. Bush 's attempt to fight expensive foreign wars while cutting taxes at home .
This involved deficit financing on a very large scale , and , inevitably , the value of the dollar began to fall–slowly at first , but with increasing speed as it became clear that the White House did not care .
" Ronald Reagan proved that deficits do n't matter , " as Vice President Dick Cheney told then–treasury secretary Paul O'Neill .
But they do matter to foreigners .
As the U.S. dollar fell in value , the price of oil ( which is usually calculated in dollars ) rose to compensate for it , but there was no comparable adjustment for foreign central banks that had huge amounts of U.S. dollars in their reserves .
China , which was sitting on about a trillion U.S. dollars , simply lost several hundred billion as the currency 's value fell .
So various central banks started wondering if they should diversify their reserves , and some acted on it .
The downward pressure on the dollar will continue , because the United States is currently borrowing six percent of its gross domestic product from foreigners each year to cover its trade deficit .
Foreign banks were happy to go on lending so long as they had faith in the integrity of U.S. financial institutions , but that has been hit hard by the subprime - mortgage crisis .
Besides , other markets , notably China and India , now offer a better return–and Congress 's resistance to foreign takeover bids , combined with tighter visa restrictions , makes the U.S. a less welcoming place for foreign investors .
Above all , there are now alternatives to the U.S. dollar .
The last time it faced a comparable crisis was in 1971 , when a different Republican president was trying to run another unpopular war without raising taxes .
Richard Nixon devalued the U.S. dollar and demolished the Bretton Woods system that had fixed all other currencies in relation to the dollar , inaugurating the current era of floating exchange rates .
There was no other candidate then for the role of global reserve currency , so the dollar stayed at the centre of the system despite all the turbulence .
This time , by contrast , there is the euro , the currency of an economic zone just as big as the United States , with the Chinese currency as a possible long - term rival .
But nothing is likely to happen very fast .
The last time the world went through a change like this , it took more than 40 years to complete .
Before the First World War , the British pound reigned supreme , accounting for 64 percent of the world 's currency reserves and 60 percent of all international trade .
Britain then impoverished itself in two world wars , but the U.S. dollar did not fully replace the pound until the 1950s .
Today the U.S. dollar accounts for 70 percent of both international trade and currency reserves , but it is probably starting down the same road .
Many countries are replacing part of their dollar reserves with a basket of other currencies , and those who have pegged their currency to the dollar are starting to cut loose from it : Kuwait has already done so , and the United Arab Emirates is actively considering it .
If China unpegs , things will move a lot faster , but in any case , the long farewell of the U.S. dollar has begun .
For some , the phrase “ support our troops ” is merely a euphemism for : support the policies that put the troops there in the first place .
For others — including many activists — the mantra is a safe way to avoid taking an unqualified , uncompromising stand against this war ( and all war ) .
Many who identify themselves as “ anti- war ” still vigorously defend the troops … no questions asked .
The excuse making typically falls into two broad categories .
The first being : “ Our troops are just following orders . ”
A simple Web search will find many reasons why this concept has no legal basis .
For example , Principle IV of Nuremberg Tribunal ( 1950 ) states : “ The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him . ”
Besides this , it can be easily posited that “ only following orders ” also has no moral footing .
Of course , the facile example would be Nazi Germany .
But surely every suicide bomber is merely following orders as are those detonating IEDs in Iraq .
The Left praised Vietnam era draftees who fled to Canada .
Yet , today ’s volunteer warriors are given a free pass because they did n’t give the orders in an illegal war and occupation .
This is not only illegal and immoral ; it also lacks any radical credibility .
Somehow , individuals and groups can stand tall against war and military intervention but refuse to shine a light on those who choose ( and get paid ) to fight .
Nowhere else in the realm of activism does such a paradox exist .
Consider the animal rights activists struggling to end the morally indefensible and scientifically fraudulent enterprise of animal experimentation .
Can they expose the corporations and academic institutions but somehow “ support ” the actual scientists performing the lab experiments ?
Surely , they are “ just doing their job ” and “ following orders . ”
How about those fighting to end unfair labor practices ?
Is it acceptable to call out the CEOs of Nike & The Gap but hang yellow ribbons for those who handle day - to - day operations of a sweatshop in , say , Vietnam ?
These men and women are just as “ stuck in a bad situation ” as any grunt in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The second excuse usually sounds like this : “ It ’s a poverty draft .
These poor souls have to enlist because they any economic options . ”
America is certainly an unjust economic society and this would be a compelling argument … if it were true .
A 2006 New York Times op - ed highlighted a study by Tim Kane and Mackenzie Eaglen that “ analyzed demographic data on every single enlistee , not just a sample , and found that in terms of education , last year ’s recruits were just as qualified as those of any recent year , and maybe the best ever .
Over all , wartime recruits since 1999 are in many respects comparable to the youth population on the whole , except that they are on average a bit wealthier , much more likely to have graduated from high school and more rural than their civilian peers . ”
They also found that youths “ from wealthy American ZIP codes are volunteering in ever higher numbers ” while “ enlistees from the poorest fifth of American neighborhoods fell nearly a full percentage point over the last two years , to 13.7 percent .
In 1999 , that number was exactly 18 percent . ”
So , are some of the soldiers in Iraq there primarily for economic reasons ?
Sure .
Did others sign up for a chance to shoot some “ ragheads ” ?
Probably .
After factoring out these two relatively small groups and rejecting the illegal , immoral , and reactionary “ only following orders ” defense , I ask this of anti-war activists :
Exactly how are the men and women who willingly signed up to wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan immune from any and all scrutiny and / or blame ?
After all , what do you think “ our troops ” are doing ?
“ We know that 99.9 % of our forces conduct themselves in an exemplary manner , ” says Donald Rumsfeld .
“ We also know that in conflicts things that should n’t happen do happen . ”
If only 1/10 of 1 % of US soldiers make “ things happen that should n’t happen , ” what are the rest doing to make us stand and sing “ God Bless America ” during the 7th inning stretch at Yankee Stadium ?
How do we define exemplary manner ?
By Rumsfeld ’s reckoning ( and the standard company line of most every politician , pundit , and peon ) “ exemplary ” includes ( among other things ) the use of Daisy Cutters , cluster bombs , napalm , depleted uranium , white phosphorus , and the launching cruise missiles into crowded cities .
“ Things that should n’t happen do happen , ” Rumsfeld explains .
But what about all the stuff that this society accepts “ should ” happen ?
Why would anyone besides a sadist feel compelled to support that unconditionally ?
There are two powerful myths / ironies propping up the “ support the troops ” premise .
The first involves what they are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan in the first place .
I ca n’t tell you how many e-mails I ’ve received over the years that read something like this : “ While you sit at home in your luxurious apartment , making money off your writing ( insert laugh track here ) , those brave men and women are putting their asses on the line to fight for your freedom to write your anti-American garbage .
I say : Bullshit .
The troops in Iraq and Afghanistan are not fighting for my freedom .
They are fighting to keep the world safe for petroleum .
If anything , since 9/11 , our freedom has been slowly eroded and the presence of the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan makes it harder for anyone to speak up in dissent .
If I were in an airport , and I spoke aloud what I ’ve written in this article , I ’d likely be detained or arrested .
Irony # 2 : While most American citizens are manipulated , harassed , coerced , and guilted into hanging yellow ribbons — even if they ’re anti-war — from Shays Rebellion in 1787 to Coxey ’s Army to the Bonus Army to the Gulf War Syndrome to a quarter - million homeless vets today , generation after generation of US military personnel has suffered a lack of support from their own government ( and the corporations that own it ) .
“ Our troops ” are just as controlled and exploited as the US citizens that worship them .
And one more thing :
Let ’s stop with the “ our troops ” charade .
You and I may foot the bill , but “ we ” have no say in what they do .
If those truly were “ my ” men and women , I ’d bring them right home and put them to work doing something useful … like turning the Long Island Expressway into the world ’s longest organic farm .
Do n’t support the troops … inform them .

The banner is a taunt , but there is more .
He wants to be caught because there is guilt inside and he knows the greatest crimes that are converting America into Amurka happened on his watch .
The guilt will eat at him all the days of his life unless he comes clean .
But it is becoming clear to me that the guilt is getting to him .
He will react to it like psychos do , and do things to get caught ... like all mass murders do :
It 's a cold , gray day in December , and I 'm walking down Sixtieth Street in the Dora district of Baghdad , one of the most violent and fearsome of the city 's no - go zones .
Devastated by five years of clashes between American forces , Shiite militias , Sunni resistance groups and Al Qaeda , much of Dora is now a ghost town .
This is what " victory " looks like in a once upscale neighborhood of Iraq : Lakes of mud and sewage fill the streets .
Mountains of trash stagnate in the pungent liquid .
Most of the windows in the sand - colored homes are broken , and the wind blows through them , whistling eerily .
House after house is deserted , bullet holes pockmarking their walls , their doors open and unguarded , many emptied of furniture .
What few furnishings remain are covered by a thick layer of the fine dust that invades every space in Iraq .
Looming over the homes are twelve - foot - high security walls built by the Americans to separate warring factions and confine people to their own neighborhood .
Emptied and destroyed by civil war , walled off by President Bush 's much - heralded " surge , " Dora feels more like a desolate , post - apocalyptic maze of concrete tunnels than a living , inhabited neighborhood .
Apart from our footsteps , there is complete silence .
( Rolling Stone , emphasis added ) .
You are " doin a heckuva job " on foreign policy bushies .
It is quite foreign to American policy , but right down your sewer filled Amurkan streets .
You will be judged .
American flag waived , Amurkan flag waved ...

I find it interesting that Rove was more specific about what he asked Simpson to do .
I think Simpson was toning down the request because it was in a newscast and perhaps because what he said was just too offensive for her .
According to the above , Rove asked for : " .. I asked her to get pictures of Governor Siegelman with - naked pictures of him with his aides - ... "
Simpson did n't say that - Rove did .
Sounds like Rove was quoting himself rather than Simpson .

They 're trying to discredit Simpson by insinuating she keeps " changing her story " by adding additional information .
She 's probably been wondering if she 'll live long enough to tell the rest of it .
I do n't blame her a bit for being careful , or afraid .
The good ole boys were probably laughing while they watched her house burn to the ground , and while running her car off the road .
That 's how they work ....
Then when the tragedy rumors fly around town , they say , " AWWW I heard about that .
Ain't that too bad ? "
She ought to set up a web site and put the documentation and proof out there if it looks like they 're going to try and smear her further .
She 's messin ' with the " Big Boys " who socialize with million dollar consultants who can write a plan , and concoct a design to smear her into the ground .
Governor Patton 's mistress , Tina Conner , left the state of Kentucky in fear for her life .
And , she 's the one who ended up paying the biggest price with the courts .
They went after HER with a vengeance .
Imagine that .

Notice how Rove emphatically stated twice that he had " never met this woman " , and then later changed it to " I DON'T THINK I 've ever met the woman . "
This is how these republican scumbags lie and deceive .
They make one definite statement , a lie , and then slyly and subtly insert an " out " in case it comes back to bite them in the ass .
He knows how to talk and manipulate perception .
He 's like the David Copperfield of doublespeak .

Rove : ” What is this , what is this “ Rove : ” No , no , you can hold that one “ Alan : ” I 'll hold it , all right “ Rove : ” You can hold that one , you can hold that one “ Rove : ” I 'll look skeptically at it “ Alan : ” Come on , just hold it “ Woman 's Voice : ” You do n't need to do this .
You do n't have to do that .
No. No “ Alan : ” Sure , sure I do “ Rove : ” Nice to meet you , thanks “

N.H. RECOUNT - URGENT ACTION REQUIRED
By : Devvy
January 28 , 2008 ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
Due to the obvious fraud which occurred during the New Hampshire primary earlier this month , the fabulous Granny Warriors mobilized and not only found a GOP candidate who cares about the actual vote count , but raised an enormous amount of money in record time to get a recount underway in the state .
It would take several columns to go over step by step what a phenomenal job the Granny Warriors , Eric and Mr. Albert Howard have done to get the recount officially sanctioned .
We all owe them a huge thank you and we also need to do our part NOW because what 's happened since the recount was set to begin , has not only been reprehensible , those responsible in the Secretary of State 's office need to be held accountable .
I was on the road from January 15 - 25th and fully expected the recount to be completed by the time I returned to Texas .
On January 25 , 2008 , I spoke with a true American patriot named Eric , who has been on the ground since the beginning and has sacrificed a great deal for all of us .
During our conversation , Eric informed me that the recount had been repeatedly delayed and there was a problem with the chain of custody with the ballots among other possible violations of the law .
While listening to Eric as I was driving , had my rental vehicle been steam driven , I could have powered it the rest of the way home I was so incensed .
Mr. Albert Howard , the GOP candidate whose challenge made this recount possible , has sent a letter to the SOS informing them of what many of us already knew : the continued delay of the recount destroys we the people 's ability to stop and challenge primary outcomes in other states for obvious reasons .
There 's no doubt in my mind these delays have been deliberate on top of the other shenanigans , i.e. , while the Kucinich people only had to pay the $ 2,000 fee for the recount to begin right away , Mr. Howard 's request for the recount was met with a demand by the Secretary of State ( SOS ) that $ 55,000 be raised within 48 hours or the recount was kaput .
As I said in my January 14 , 2008 , column , there 's no question the office of the Secretary of State does not want the light shined on their ability to conduct fair and impartial elections .
However , what they 've done is patently un-American and they should be ashamed of themselves .
Of course , they are n't because this is the moral rot that has been creeping into the American landscape for decades .
Paychecks are more important than honesty and integrity .
Party loyalty now takes precedence over truth .
If the actions of Secretary Gardner of any of his personnel have violated election laws , they need to be prosecuted because no one is above the law .
Where do things stand as of today ?
According to what Eric was told on January 25 , 2008 , the process will move forward with no delays .
This from personnel who have done nothing but play games for one day shy of three weeks from the pretend primary while the clock is ticking .
There can be NO more delays .
The horse and pony production called " Super Tuesday , " February 5 , 2008 , where 22 states will be participating is closing in on those of us who want Ron Paul to win the GOP nomination this summer .
We cannot take the SOS 's ( Secretary of State ) word for anything at this point , we must act now .
What 's next ?
I can not go into details at this time , but there will be legal consequences to the actions of the Secretary of State 's office and this is being worked .
I will do an update when I have the details .
These public servants have NO right to cheat the people of New Hampshire on this recount , but that 's exactly what all this stalling and jumping through hoops has been about .
As I said above , this delay has crippled the people 's right to challenge the vote in other states and if this is n't resolved this week , the fraud will continue and Ron Paul 's run will have been for nothing , cheated by electronic voting / counting machines and career bureau - rats .
While organizations like BlackBoxVoting.org have done remarkable work over the years in fully documenting the fraud of the presidential elections in 2000 and 2004 , the vote still stood even though massive fraud took place .
We cannot let this happen with Ron Paul 's run for the White House .
Every primary means delegates for that convention this summer .
Dr. Paul 's campaign has now officially filed a caucus challenge with the Louisiana GOP ; see here .
About time his campaign decided to question and challenge what we know has been going on since Iowa .
For more details on the botching of the Louisiana caucus , see here .
These links will give you the latest on the recount .
Also , the links at the bottom will direct you to more regarding this fiasco in New Hampshire .
Letter from Albert Howard to the SOS regarding delaying of the recount New Hampshire video evidence from BlackBoxVoting.org
What can you do ?
The same as I am doing this morning : Call and fax the Governor of the State of New Hampshire , John Lynch , and politely tell him :
The Secretary of State 's office has been delaying and stalling the recount requested and paid for by Mr. Albert Howard .
This recount is from the January 8 , 2008 , primary - a whopping 20 days ago .
The obvious fraud prompted Mr. Howard to request this recount , but he has been stymied at every turn and time is of the essence on this recount which should have been finished ten days ago .
Additionally , certain individuals in the office of the Secretary of State have likely committed violations of New Hampshire 's election laws and you are requesting the Governor do two things : ( 1 ) Step in and direct the Secretary of State William M. Gardner , to get the recount done this week , and ( 2 ) direct the Attorney General for the State of New Hampshire to open an investigation into likely violations of New Hampshire 's elections laws , i.e. , chain of custody of the ballots , slits in the ballot boxes and unlawful transport and security of the ballots : NH Election laws including RSA chapters 39 & 40 : 660:5 : Conduct of recount .
If directed by the SOS , the State Police shall collect all ballots requested from the town or city clerks having custody of them and shall deliver them to the public facility designated by the SOS .
Advertisement Instead of the ballots being transported by the State Police , they were transported by Butch & Hoppy .
Butch & Hoppy ?
As far as I can find out at this time , B & H are not personnel of the SOS , but something akin to independent contractors .
BIG red flag for chain of custody and we have to get to the bottom of this travesty .
If you are a citizen of the sovereign state of New Hampshire , be sure to make that known when you contact the governor and AG 's offices .
I 've been in this arena going on twenty years and I can tell you flat out that elected officials hate getting heat from outside their state , but they pay extra attention if the heat comes from a citizen because the governor and attorney general are statewide elected offices .
Call and fax the Attorney General 's office .
Tell State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte , you insist her office open a criminal inquiry into the actions of the Office of the Secretary of State regarding the recount requested and paid for by GOP candidate , Albert Howard .
Irregularities include chain of custody of ballots , tampering with the ballot boxes , transporting the ballots , irregular security of the ballots , stalling and preferential treatment for the Kucinich people in allowing them to pay only the initial fee to begin a recount while requiring Mr. Howard to come up with $ 55,000 within 48 hours .
One note about Kucinich 's recount : it has been stopped allegedly due to lack of funds .
According to the SOS , Kucinich 's people are " happy " with the recount that did take place .
It is my understanding that the Kucinich people are not happy with the outcome of the limited recount .
If Rep . Kucinich , even though he 's dropped out of the race , is unsatisfied , then he will have to fight his own battle with the SOS .
See : New Hampshire Sec. of State Appears to Lie to Media About Kucinich Hand Count . "
You can send email , but these offices get so much , most likely all you 'll get back is a form response .
A fax is something their office staff will physically receive and we need to bury the Governor 's office and the Attorney General in faxes .
The phone call is equally important because their staffs will be overwhelmed and I say so be it .

Eric , the Granny Warriors and Mr. Howard have given up so much for this recount ; misery and headaches they should not have to endure .
The least we the people can do is back them up with our action to make sure that recount is finished in a few days because the upcoming primaries will produce more fraud .
Make no mistake about it and all our efforts and financial sacrifices to get Ron Paul the GOP nomination will be stolen from us .
Also , the Granny Warriors are in the hole as far as expenses .
Here is a recap of the monies spent on the recount effort ; I have the full breakdown .
Because of the mucking round by the SOS 's office , Mr. Howard 's expenses have increased .
Another by - product of the under handed tricks by Secretary Gardner and his people .
Total amount collected : $ 65,030.00
Minus unconfirmed donations : $ 3,535.00 ( i.e. , credit card rejections because of over limit authorization )
Minus paypal fees : $ 1,800.00
True total of income : $ 60,695.00 Money Spent : $ 2000.00 - Filing Fees
$ 2,500.00 - Expenses for Albert Howard
$ 344.00 - Air plane Fare
$ 176.00 - Hotel for Mr. Howard
$ 176.00 - Hotel ditto
$ 176.00 - Hotel ditto
$ 55,600.00 - Recount Fee to the Secretary of State Amount spent : $ 61,972.00
Amount collected : $ 60,695.00 $ 1,387.00 in the Red .
I hope you will join me in making a donation to the Granny Warriors to help them recover these expenses which are now out of pocket .
What they 've done benefits all of us ; you can make a donation here .
Please disseminate this column to all Ron Paul supporters you know because it 's numbers that count - phone calls and faxes .

Two young women who were dragged before a court for allegedly flashing their breasts at a CCTV camera have had the case against them dropped , the Crown Prosecution Service said today .
Abbi-Louise Maple and Rachel Marchant , both 21 , were accused of exposing their chests on Worthing seafront , West Sussex , on July 16 .
A CCTV operator summoned police and the pair were charged with outraging public decency .
Scroll down for more ...
They appeared at Worthing Magistrates ' Court on Wednesday and elected for Crown Court trial .
According to the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , Miss Maple and Miss Marchant were near a children 's play area and there were youngsters in the vicinity at the time of the alleged incident .
But a spokesman for the organisation said today : " The Chief Crown Prosecutor , Sarah Jane Gallagher , in consultation with Sussex Police , has subsequently reviewed the case and she has decided that to continue would not be in the public interest .
" The case has therefore been discontinued . "
Speaking after she heard the news , Miss Maple said : " We 'd been to the pub and had a few drinks .
" It was just a little joke , one of those spur - of - the - moment things .
" I 'm happy .
I just wanted it to be over , I did n't want a criminal record for that .
It 's embarrassing . "
The women 's solicitor , Chris Chatterton , said it was a common - sense decision .
" On seeing the camera they thought they 'd give the operator a surprise , " he said .
" I 'm sure they have learnt a lesson from this . "
Scroll down for more ...
The saga began when the pair were on Worthing beach with a party of friends .
After having a few drinks , they decided to flash at the CCTV camera as a joke - but the operator failed to see the funny side and called police .
Minutes later , the two blondes were arrested , questioned and then charged with committing an act outraging public decency - an offence which carries a maximum sentence of six months prison or a £ 5,000 fine .
If the case had gone to a trial at crown court it would have cost the taxpayer £ 8,000 a day .
Miss Marchant said : " We did not intend to upset anyone and I do n't think it 's that offensive because people sunbathe topless all the time .
" Everyone thinks it 's ridiculous that we 've been taken to court .
Most people think what we did was funny .
" That 's all it was - just a bit of a laugh .
" It 's a waste of time and money .
They should be concentrating on drug dealers and rapists , not two girls having a bit of harmless fun . "
The decision to prosecute for an offence that appeared so trivial drew heavy criticism .
Peter Bottomley , Tory MP for West Worthing , led calls for the case to be dropped .
He said : " This is ridiculous .
" It is a total waste of public money and waste of time for the police , the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts .
The sooner they drop the case , the better . "
There are no laws specifically prohibiting nudity in public .
Public nudity can be prosecuted under the common law offence of outraging public decency if it causes harassment , alarm or distress .
There is also an offence of indecent exposure that falls under the Sexual Offences Act .
Naturists and topless sunbathers are not usually prosecuted .
The case followed that of a 12 - year - old boy who was this week hauled before a court charged with assault after throwing a sausage at his neighbour .
A judge threw out the charge and criticised the police and lawyers for pursuing the case .
In March last year , a 15 - year - old boy from Burnley was landed with a criminal record simply for throwing a snowball at a car .
The teenager was prosecuted under a little - used 160 - year - old law and fined £ 100 .
And in January 2005 , Sarah McCaffrey , 23 , was fined £ 60 by South Tyneside court for eating an apple while driving .
Mainly , however , excuses for poverty involve the assertion that the United States is a land of opportunity , a place where people can start out poor , work hard and become rich .
But the fact of the matter is that Horatio Alger stories are rare , and stories of people trapped by their parents ’ poverty are all too common .
According to one recent estimate , American children born to parents in the bottom fourth of the income distribution have almost a 50 percent chance of staying there  and almost a two - thirds chance of remaining stuck if they ’re black .
That ’s not surprising .
Growing up in poverty puts you at a disadvantage at every step .
I ’d bracket those new studies on brain development in early childhood with a study from the National Center for Education Statistics , which tracked a group of students who were in eighth grade in 1988 .
The study found , roughly speaking , that in modern America parental status trumps ability : students who did very well on a standardized test but came from low - status families were slightly less likely to get through college than students who tested poorly but had well - off parents .
None of this is inevitable .
Poverty rates are much lower in most European countries than in the United States , mainly because of government programs that help the poor and unlucky .
And governments that set their minds to it can reduce poverty .
In Britain , the Labor government that came into office in 1997 made reducing poverty a priority  and despite some setbacks , its program of income subsidies and other aid has achieved a great deal .
Child poverty , in particular , has been cut in half by the measure that corresponds most closely to the U.S. definition .
At the moment it ’s hard to imagine anything comparable happening in this country .
To their credit  and to the credit of John Edwards , who goaded them into it  both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are proposing new initiatives against poverty .
But their proposals are modest in scope and far from central to their campaigns .

Back in November , Facebook launched their new SocialAds platform .
Like many other folks , I decided to spend $ 50 to check out the platform .
Like Fred , I decided to advertise for my fund - First Round Capital .
Unlike Fred , however , I decided to test Facebook 's targeting mechanism by running targeted ads to employees of large Internet companies -- including Yahoo and Microsoft .
One of the nice parts about Facebook 's platform is their realtime statistics .
Back in November , I saw that my Yahoo ad received 21,291 impressions with only 64 clicks -- a clickthrough rate of 0.30 % .
And my Microsoft ad received no clicks with 1,058 impressions .
So when Microsoft announced they wanted to acquire Yahoo , it got me ( and everyone else ) wondering .
Specifically , I wondered if YHOO / MSFT employees were indeed more likely to " look around " for new jobs -- and if so , how much more .
Since I had baseline data from just 90 days ago , I decided to run the ads again .
On the Yahoo side , there was a 260 % increase in clickthrough rate -- from 0.3 % to 0.86 % .
That is not surprising .
But on the Microsoft side , I was really surprised .
When I ran around 1,000 impressions before , the ad did not receive one click -- now the same advertisement received 15 clicks .
Microsoft 's clickthrough rate increased from 0 % to 1.19 % .
Maybe it's not just Microsoft 's shareholders who are unhappy .
I acknowledge that this data is probably not statistically significant -- however , it probably is a good leading indicator of the exodus that will occur .
And , while there has been a lot of discussion of whether a Microsoft / Yahoo combination would help or hurt Silicon Valley , the impact of this coming exodus has been largely ignored .
As talent leaves the big Internet / technology companies , there will be a flood of experienced folks looking to join ( or start ) startup companies .
And that 's a flood I look forward to .

Footage from Aberdeenshire was posted on YouTube
Tombstoning video
It follows footage of so - called " tombstoning " in Aberdeenshire being posted on the video - sharing internet site YouTube .
Jumping into the water from cliffs and bridges is believed to have killed five people in the UK last year .
Aberdeen Coastguard watch manager Bob Forbes said people did not realise the risks of the " stupid " stunts .
Mr Forbes told BBC Scotland : " Tombstoning is incredibly stupid and dangerous .
And posting it on the internet is also incredibly stupid .
" Jumping from a height , you do not know if you are going to hit rocks . "
He warned : " You do not see the lifeboats picking bodies out of the water . "
Mr Forbes said people also took the risk of spending their lives in a wheelchair through injury .
The Chinese government insists that next summer 's Olympic Games are not political .
A senior official said as much again on Thursday .
Yang Chunlin has cause to disagree .
Mr. Yang , a social activist arrested recently for distributing a petition titled " We Don't Want the Olympic Games , We Want Human Rights , " goes on trial next week , charged with the eminently political crime of " inciting subversion of state power . "
He faces up to five years in jail .
Politics has burst onto the Olympic scene front and center – complicating Beijing 's plans for a trouble - free coming - out party in August – with Steven Spielberg 's resignation this week as artistic adviser to the Beijing games in protest of China 's Darfur policy .
Mr. Spielberg accused Beijing of not putting enough pressure on its ally , the Sudanese government , to help end the humanitarian crisis in Darfur .
" My conscience will not allow me to continue with business as usual , " he said in a statement .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao responded Thursday that " linking political issues with the Olympic Games is not in line with the Olympic spirit . "
Despite Chinese officials ' insistence that political issues should not interfere in this year 's Olympic Games , it is unsurprising that they have .
Within China , a one - party state , almost every aspect of society is politicized .
Abroad , many activist groups object to one aspect or another of Chinese government policy .
" China is particularly vulnerable and particularly politically sensitive " to outside criticism , says David Zweig , head of the Center for China 's Transnational Relations at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology .
" They do lots of things the world does not particularly like , and they are very sensitive to what the world thinks , " Professor Zweig adds .
" They have made it to world - class status and they are getting dumped on . "
As foreign critics of Chinese policy on a range of issues – from Taiwanese independence to Tibet and from Darfur to press freedoms – gear up to use the Olympic Games as leverage in their campaigns , Beijing is handicapped by its lack of skills in handling dissenters .
At home , they have simply suppressed them .
Officials say they are ready to deal with political opponents .
" We have heard voices from all sides , " said Jiang Xiaoyu , vice president of the Beijing Olympic Games Organizing Committee ( BOCOG ) last year .
" [ There ] will be more and more of these kinds of voices and maybe more resonant .
We are mentally prepared . "
But it took the Foreign Ministry two days to respond to Spielberg 's bombshell , suggesting a low level of readiness .
" The government was intellectually aware " of the likelihood of political problems surrounding the games , says Sidney Rittenberg , a China expert who knows the country 's top leaders personally .
" But I do n't think they had real flesh - and - blood understanding of it .
The gathering storm will come as a bit of a shock . "
Politics have intruded on many past Games , starting in 1906 , when an Irish medal winner climbed the flagpole to tear down the British flag that had been raised in his honor , in the days before Irish independence .
The 1936 games in Nazi-ruled Berlin are often seen as the nadir of attempts by the host nation to use the festivities for political gain .
African nations boycotted the 1976 Games , the US and some of its allies boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , and the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotted the 1984 Games in Los Angeles in revenge .
For nearly 25 years , however , in Seoul , South Korea ; Barcelona , Spain ; Atlanta , Sydney , Australia ; and Athens ; the Olympics have been mostly free of political trouble .
" It is possible to proceed without controversy , " says David Wallechinsky , an Olympic historian .
" Nobody was mad at the Greeks .
They have n't offended anybody . "
Beijing , however , is making its Games a powerful symbol of China 's emergence as a world power , " and that , by its very nature , is political , " says Zweig .
Some officials have acknowledged as much .
" It is not only an international sports event , but also a very important political mission , " stated a 2006 opinion article in the People 's Daily .
" It is not only an Olympic feast for the Chinese people , it can also arouse Chinese patriotism . "
An awareness of how much the Games mean to China , and a fear of upsetting the authorities , appear to have been behind a plan by the British Olympic Association , revealed last weekend , to make British athletes sign a contract pledging not to comment on " politically sensitive issues " in Beijing .
In the wake of an uproar , the BOA says it will reword the contract to conform to the Olympic charter , which says : " No kind of demonstration or political , religious , or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites , venues or other areas . "
It does not forbid athletes from expressing opinions elsewhere .
Other groups are less worried about riling the Chinese .
" If the Games show China emerging as a world power , it 's fair to raise questions about their complicity in Darfur , " says Allyn Brooks - LaSure , spokesman for the Save Darfur Coalition .
He adds that " As soon as we started talking about the Olympic Games , there was at least a response from the Chinese .
It is clear they are hearing what we are saying . "
Campaigners on other issues , such as Tibetan rights , human rights abuses , and religious persecution , are gearing up to use the Olympics as a stick with which to beat Beijing , but the government issued them a stern warning two weeks ago .
" Those who always look at China through dark glasses have produced a sort of baffling excitement , " an editorial in the People 's Daily declared .
Activists who say that " they can exert enough pressure to force China into a position where it cannot help but act according to their wishes … have clearly miscalculated . "
Others are not so sure .
International pressure " might make some difference " says Mr. Rittenberg .
" Those in the leadership who are sensitive to these issues feel strengthened . "
Still , he says , " the net result is more negative than positive , " given how proud most ordinary Chinese are that their country is hosting the Games .
" Indignation at Spielberg is going to be almost universal .
" If the games are substantially damaged " by any snowball effect from Spielberg 's resignation , Rittenberg warns , " that is going to cause immense resentment among ordinary Chinese at what they see as unjust foreign interference . "
For Darfur advocates , the ball is in China 's court .
" We will continue pushing till there 's a response from China that makes a difference " says Mr. Brooks - LaSure .
" The Chinese are going to see and hear a crescendo of activism as the games get closer . "
" Beijing is going to have to start thinking how to react well and intelligently " to such pressure , says Zweig .
" They are going to be confronting this kind of thing all the time . "
During the early days of the Clinton administration , Colin Powell , then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , cringed when Madeleine Albright implied that because the United States had such a big , beautiful military , it should be willing to use it promiscuously overseas .
After the debacle in Iraq , the growing group of those who desire a more restrained foreign policy  liberals , conservatives , libertarians , and independents  should still be cringing .
Thus , the problematic , hyperactive U.S. foreign policy did not arise with President George W. Bush , but has existed through Democratic and Republican administrations since Harry S. Truman was president .
Although George W. Bush was especially gullible and incompetent in attempting his armed , nation - building fiasco in Iraq , the hyperactivity in U.S. foreign affairs is mainly structural .
In other words , pressures exist within what President Dwight Eisenhower called " the military - industrial complex " to liberally employ the military overseas to justify the purchase of large amounts of expensive military hardware made primarily here at home .
Most of the U.S. defense industry is made up of ostensibly private companies , with either no or only small amounts of commercial business , that essentially have become wards of the state .
This dedicated defense industry works in collusion with the military services to inflate threats to justify the need to buy questionable weapons , and with congressional representatives to make the taxpayers pay the bill for those unneeded arms .
In fact , when the big defense contractors choose subcontractors , they do not do so on the basis of getting the best subsystem for the best price ( as is done in the commercial marketplace ) , but to spread the subcontracts over as many states and congressional districts as possible , to widen the political support for the weapons program .
Therefore , it becomes almost politically impossible to kill a weapon system , even if its cost has become exorbitant , its performance has been poor , its schedule has slipped , or world events have made it irrelevant .
A recently publicized , egregious example of this much larger , endemic problem is the effort by Lockheed Martin to modify existing helicopters ( EH - 101s ) with new state - of - the - art communications and defense systems to create VH - 71s , a fleet of 28 helicopters to carry the president on short trips to and from Air Force One , his Boeing 747 jumbo - jet command plane .
The Navy , procuring the new helicopter for the White House , has had to halt the helicopter program in an attempt to rescue it .
According to the Washington Post , the program ’s costs have almost doubled from $ 6.1 billion in 2005 to $ 11.2 billion today , and the schedule has slipped significantly .
Such cost , schedule , or performance slippage is common in defense programs , because little competition  the foundation of the commercial marketplace  exists at the prime contract or subcontract level in the defense industry .
In addition , companies will purposefully bid with an excessively low price ( " buy in " ) to get the contract , and then count on the likelihood that they can charge the Defense Department big bucks when it comes in with changes to the very specific military requirements  which it inevitably does .
In the case of the VH - 71 , Lockheed Martin has alleged that the Navy has added 1,900 requirements since the initial contract was signed .
( The Navy denies this number , but it does not deny that the requirements have become so demanding that the entire EH - 101 aircraft has had to be completely redesigned to create a VH - 71 . )
Thus , then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ’s comparison of the grossly inefficient U.S. defense industry with Soviet central planning was entirely appropriate  both being competition - free zones .
Although Eisenhower , a former general , first warned of the " military - industrial complex " ( which really should have been called the " military - industrial - congressional complex " ) , Harry Truman actually invented it .
Up through World War II , the United States had no dedicated defense industry .
Whenever a war arose , civilian factories converted to military production and then reconverted to commercial production once the war had ended .
But Truman created the first dedicated defense industry in U.S. history by giving steady defense business to " private " companies during peacetime .
Thus , it was no coincidence that unlike the periods following all previous wars  including the first few years of the Cold War subsequent to World War II  the United States did not demobilize its military after the Korean War .
Thus was born the first large peacetime military in more than 175 years of U.S. history .
Even during the nuclear standoff between the superpowers during the Cold War , pressures to use the historically large U.S. forces in brush - fire areas proved too intense to resist .
So accompanying the atypically large peacetime military following the Korean War was an untraditional , interventionist U.S. foreign policy .
Such facts should alarm those traditional conservatives who advocate a more restrained U.S. foreign policy but who are silent when anyone mentions cutting the defense budget .
But if the Albright temptation is to be stamped out , cutting the massive base defense budget of well over $ 500 billion a year ( not counting the annual costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ) , and the offensive power projection weapons contained therein , is a must .
But how can the defense budget be cut if all those defense companies are lobbying their senators and congressman for more of the largess ?
Harry Truman ’s legacy must be modified .
A dedicated defense industry must be eradicated .
The walls around the defense industry that impede competition must be pulled down so that firms with mainly commercial business can compete for defense contracts .
The first step in this process would be to insist that the armed services ease their unique and overly rigorous requirements at the subcontract level .
In other words , the U.S. military should be forced to use commercially available parts  or such parts that can be easily modified to military requirements  in their weapon systems .
Thus , in a " back to the future " move , subcontractors  like the entire war production machinery used to do in the old days  would be able to move in and out of defense production as military threats to the United States wax and wane .
If subcontractors could move freely from commercial to weapons production and back , less pressure would arise to keep the defense budget high during times of low threat ( for example : at present , terrorism does n’t require much money to fight ) .
With lower defense budgets and a more modest and defensively oriented military , the Albright temptation to intervene excessively around the world would also be reduced .

Update : The Dihemispheric Chroaether Agitator was featured twice in Wired ’s coverage of the Maker Faire :
The nation 's biggest radio station owner has asked the Federal Communications Commission to force a merged XM / Sirius satellite radio company to obey the agency 's indecency laws as a condition for union .
" One of the primary potential dangers to free , over - the - air radio posed by this merger is siphoning popular , including ' edgy ' content , with consequent loss of advertising revenue , " Clear Channel wrote to the FCC on March 11th .
" That potential harm is mitigated if broadcast decency rules were to apply to the merged entity .
There is no constitutional bar to such a condition . "
The media giant filed the request before recent reports that FCC Chair Kevin Martin is preparing the agency to make a decision about whether to allow XM and Sirius to marry .
Now that the Department of Justice has approved the merger , the FCC is under more pressure to get the issue resolved .
Clear Channel 's filing represents a rare instance in which a major broadcaster has asked the Commission to expand , rather than restrict , its authority over so - called indecent fare .
In referring to " edgy " content , Clear Channel probably means the voice of Howard Stern , now broadcasting on channels 100 and 101 of Sirius satellite radio .
In 2004 the FCC slapped six Clear Channel stations with almost half a million dollars in fines for airing a program in which Stern and his guests discussed anal and oral sex while sounds that resembled farting aired in the background .
The agency also took exception to Stern 's praise of an imaginary personal hygiene product identified as " Sphincterine ; " flatulence could also be heard during this segment .
" Given the detailed discussion of the sounds and smells associated with excretory activity and oral sex , which were accompanied by the sound effects of flatulence and were dwelled upon , it is clear that the material was used to shock and pander , " the Commission concluded .
Two months later Clear Channel settled with the FCC for the Stern programs and other radio fare that the agency identified as indecent .
The FCC dropped its complaints and Clear Channel agreed to voluntarily pay the government $ 1.75 million and set up a company - wide plan for preventing indecent broadcasting on its licenses .
The broadcaster also removed Howard Stern from its stations .
In October 2004 , Stern announced that he would leave terrestrial radio entirely and move to Sirius .
" It 's time to go , " Stern told his listeners .
" I believe more in satellite than I do in radio . "
The FCC 's indecency rules do not apply to satellite broadcasters , at least not so far .
But Clear Channel 's March 11th filing also asks the FCC to connect other requirements to the proposed XM / Sirius merger .
Since both satellite broadcasters requested FCC permission to unite early last year , Clear Channel has repeatedly asked the agency to add conditions that would directly benefit it .
These have included further relaxing the FCC 's limits on how many radio stations an entity can own in big markets , and requiring a united XM / Sirius to integrate HD Radio technology into their satellite receivers .
Clear Channel is an HD Radio investor and booster .
Strings attached
Now Clear Channel wants even more strings attached to the possible marriage , some of which have been proposed by various public interest groups such as Public Knowledge .
They include :
A new satellite radio competitor
" Whether such competition be achieved through a long - term lease of satellite capacity to a third party having complete freedom to control programming over the leased channels or through some other means , " Clear Channel writes , " a viable competitive alternative to XM - Sirius in the SDARS allocated spectrum must be ensured concurrent with any possible license transfer . "
Ars has already reported on one possible third - party scenario , proposed by Chester C. Davenport of Georgetown Partners .
The Clear Channel filing says at least 50 percent of the available satellite spectrum should go to this new entity .
A 5 percent " public interest " set aside
This would be modeled after the FCC's Direct Broadcast Satellite ( DBS ) service set aside .
" There is no intrinsic public interest benefit flowing from the proposed XM - Sirius merger , " Clear Channel says .
" If the public interest test for grant of the license transfer is to be met , there must be a reservation of satellite capacity dedicated to the public interest . "
The filing does not attempt to define the term " public interest . "
A merged XM / Sirius cannot broadcast local programming or solicit local advertising
XM / Sirius should be defined strictly as a national service .
" Local advertising revenue is the lifeblood of the terrestrial broadcasting system , " Clear Channel declares .
" Siphoning local advertising would pose a direct threat to the ability of terrestrial broadcast radio to fulfill its core missions . "
Apparently Clear Channel finds the prospect of a merged XM / Sirius so threatening that the company is willing to advocate decency regulation and traditional public interest reforms — at least for its prospective competitors .
The abandonment of corporate responsibility and the surrender of consumer rights
Why consumer lives are worth nothing to corporations
An era of unbridled madness
( Natural News )
In arguments and discussion forheard today , Justices are proposing that consumers should not be able to sue pharmaceutical companies for damages from side effects .
Forget all the technical legalities -- this argument is absurd from the outset .
Here 's why :
If Ford makes a defective car with a poorly - designed gasoline tank that explodes and kills someone , that person 's family has a right to sue Ford , correct ?
But the U.S. Supreme Court is now effectively arguing that
In other words , the fact that Ford cars do n't kill some consumers somehow makes up for the ones killed by those defective cars .
( In this case , Ford is just an example .
There is no pending legislation against Ford that involves the U.S. Supreme Court . ) That argument is absurd .
If put in place , it would mean that , and the very definition of " harm " is no longer measured on an individual basis but rather by some sort of yet - unstated collective scorekeeping that says no company can be sued if its products provide benefits to somebody .
Of course , this is all being selectively applied only to the pharmaceutical industry at the moment , but if this line of thinking is allowed to continue , it could very quickly lead to blanket immunity for virtually all corporations against any consumer lawsuits .
After all , the argument being made to protect Big Pharma is that even though drugs kill lots of people , the fact that they help some people who are n't killed outweighs the liability from the dead people .
Should this also apply to automobiles ?
Fireworks ?
Roller coasters ?
At what point does the U.S. Supreme Court think corporations should actually be held liable for the harm caused by their products ?
Apparently , some Justices believe corporations shouldbe held liable for harmful products , even if they committed fraud in getting their products approved by regulatory agencies such as the FDA .
It 's true :
At least one Supreme Court Justice is now arguing that even in cases of drug companies defrauding the FDA and lying about the safety of their drugs , the public should still have no right whatsoever to sue over the damage ( or death ) caused by those drugs .
And how about collapsing bridges and buildings ?
According to the U.S. Supreme Court 's current thinking , people who are killed in a collapse of a defective bridge or building should have absolutely no legal recourse .
Why ?
Because that same bridge or building provided benefits to other people who were not killed !
Thus , the Supreme Court is actually following a line of flawed reasoning that would deny consumers the right to sue corporations for practically anything !
This is why I have come to the commonsense conclusion that the U.S. Supreme Court has surrendered the rights of the American people to greedy corporations that will soon , it seems , have no incentive at all to make safe products .
By the way , notice too that Big Tobacco was ultimately granted blanket product immunity under a complex settlement that essentially involved paying off U.S. States with a portion of the revenues generated by tobacco products that openly kill people .
Thus , Big Tobacco was allowed to stay in business , producing products that directly kill millions of people each year around the world .
This bring up an important law of every capitalist society :
There 's simply too much profit at stake , and money has an insidious way of influencing regulatory and judicial decisions while negating whatever imaginary rights the citizens once believed they were entitled to .
Under the protection of blanket immunity , corporations consider , and thus the normal equations of safety costs vs. liability risk are thrown out the window , replaced with a new equation of maximizing profits by minimizing expensive safety precautions .
The only reason corporations currently place any value at all on the lives of consumers is because there are financial costs associated with harming or killing people ( thanks to product liability lawsuits ) .
Take away those financial costs , and the corporations will then consider consumer lives to be worthless in any way other than the fact that consumers might be worth something if they live long enough to keep buying more products .
What 's obvious in all this is that the U.S. legal system has devolved into such a morass of fictitious legal technicalities that it no longer has any concept of commonsense reality .
There should be no argument necessary at all in this case :
Of course consumers have the right to sue companies over pharmaceuticals ( or cars or bridges ) that directly harm them !
And the fact that the FDA or some other corrupt ( or incompetent ) government agency slaps its approval onto a product should in no way grant the manufacturer complete immunity from the very real effects caused by its products .
Pharmaceuticals kill people .
It 's a simple fact .
And Big Pharma should be held responsible for the harm caused by its products .
But the Supreme Court is now looking for ways to weave complex legal technicalities into a convenient but entirely dishonest shield that allows drug companies to literally get away with murder .
If you were looking for evidence of why the United States of America has gone mad , look no further than the regulatory and legal fabrications surrounding pharmaceuticals .
Not only do we now have a system of organized medicine that operates as organized crime by protecting monopoly prices , engaging in routine scientific fraud , and drugging children with powerful psychotropic chemicals without even a single shred of real evidence that those children are " diseased , " but now we have a legal system that seems poised to hand Big Pharma unlimited permission to manufacture and market extremely dangerous chemicals with impunity .
The consumer has now been relegated to the role of " useless eater , " with zero rights and zero value .
The corporations are in charge , and the corrupt judicial system is now protecting the profits of these corporations by selling out the people .
A new era of corporate - sponsored chemical destruction is spreading like a dark shadow over the future of the American people , and the highest court in the land has declared its loyalty to the corporate Kings who rule over American consumers as tyrants over peasants .

The numbers of malicious programs have reached " epidemic " proportions
Reports vary but some estimates suggest there were five times as many variants of malicious programs in circulation in 2007 compared to 2006 .
Security company Panda Software said it was getting more than 3,000 novel samples of so called malware every day .
Criminals pump out variants to fool anti-virus programs that work , in part , by spotting common characteristics .
Threat landscape
Security software testing organisation AV
Test reported that it saw 5.49 million unique samples of malicious software in 2007 - five times more than the 972,606 it saw in 2006 .
AV Test reached its total by analysing malicious programs and generating a digital fingerprint for each unique sample .
The organisation said the different ways malware can be packaged will mean some duplication in its figures , but the broad trend showed a steep rise .
The organisation uses the samples to test security programs to see how many they can spot and stop .
Panda Software said the number of malicious samples it received in 2007 was up ten fold on 2006 .
In a statement it said the rise represented a " malware epidemic " .
Finnish security firm F - Secure said it had seen a doubling in the number of pieces of malware it detected in 2007 compared to 2006 .
Most of the malicious programs detected by these security organisations are aimed at the various versions of Microsoft 's Windows operating system .
The vast majority of these unique malicious programs will be made up of elements from older viruses that have been scrambled to look fresh .
" It started about nine months ago , in early 2007 , we saw massive surges of new variants , " said Gerhard Eschelbeck , chief technology officer at anti-spyware firm Webroot .
" There are days when we see 1,000 or more new samples , " he said .
" It 's a low - effort high - frequency type threat , " he said .
" There 's no completely ground - breaking new stuff out there . "
He added that hi-tech criminals were adopting several tactics to avoid being spotted by anti-virus programs which try to spot the " signature " of each malicious program they know about .
" Anti-virus relies on customers to submit samples , " said Mr Eschelbeck , " but with spyware you typically do not get samples because your customers do not know they are infected . "
Increasingly , security firms have turned to new techniques to combat the rise in malware variants .
Some use heuristics , or rules of thumb , to spot programs that are similar rather than identical to the ones they have seen before .
Others are using behaviour blockers that shut down any program that shows malicious intent .

Dean Edwards does a magnificent job and releases IE7 2.0 ( a set of javascripts which addresses ( most of ? ) the CSS issues in IE7 ) .
Next to the merging into 1 file , the most important change is that “ IE7.js includes only fixes that are included in the real MSIE7 browser ;
All other enhancements are moved to IE8.js . ” which is more than ingenious imo !
Spread the word ! [… ]

I just stumbled on this , bookmarking for later review … but Dean Edwards has upgraded his IE7.js to version 2.0 ( beta ) .
Now available on googlecode .
In a nutshell , IE7 is a JavaScript library to make Internet Explorer behave like a “ standards - compliant browser ” , fixing CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6 .
It appears to “ fix up ” IE6 close to how IE7 ( an improvement ) operates . [… ]
Comment : # 14 This is so brilliant .
It appears that IE8.js is a superset of IE7.js , so my first instinct is to always include IE8.js and not worry about IE7.js ?
Would you recommend so ?
In other words , under which circumstances should I include IE7.js and not IE8.js ?
Comment : # 15 @Kevin – IE8.js adds lots of fixes that are not in MSIE7 .
Some of these fixes are not included in other browsers either ( e.g. : nth - child ( ) ) .
So if you are happy with MSIE7 as a base line then you should use IE7.js .
Because you are using conditional comments then MSIE7 does not bother to download the IE7.js script .
This will result in faster page loads for all browsers other than MSIE5/6 .
Comment : # 16
This is great , thx !
I used the last alpha version in my last project and I ’m glad to see version 2 beta out now !
Comment : # 17
This is really quite fantastic .
Great work .
Unfortunately I doubt I ’ll be able to use it on the majority of my sites .
On larger pages this just slows down the page load to a crawl ( IE6 ) and I ’m experiencing a good 2 - 4 second delay where the browser just locks up .
Comment : # 18 @ Andrew – can you please post a link to one of the larger pages that is slowing down so noticeably ?
It might be something I can fix .

Mit der IE7 JavaScript Library kann man dem MSIE die standardkonforme Darstellung von Webseiten beibringen .

Kudos indeed .
I am having an issue with clientWidth in IE6 and was wondering if any light could be shed on the subject .
Has anyone else had this issue and is there a solution ?
the clientWidth issue is in IE7.js .
If I use IE8.js the error is no longer there however it does error if body {background - attachment : fixed ; }
If the fixed body line is removed from my css , no errors reported .
All good things …..

Comment : # 57 @ Shaggy – IE7 only creates one global variable : IE7
IE7 only alters the built - in objects for IE5.0 .
Most libraries do n’t support this browser anyway .
IE7 alters the DOM to fix broken HTML elements .
It does this in such a way that DOM queries are not affected .
If anything , they are improved .
IE7 does create pseudo content using the special <!> element .
This takes advantage of a bug in MSIE5 / 6/7 where comments are included in .getElementsByTagName ( " * " ) queries .
Comments reveal themselves as elements with a tagName of “ ! ” .
element .
This takes advantage of a bug in MSIE5 / 6/ 7 where comments are included in queries .
Comments reveal themselves as elements with a of “ ! ” .
IE7 makes all of it ’s CSS changes through either element.className or element.runtimeStyle .
This should not affect other libraries , so long as those libraries obey the rules of unobtrusive JavaScript .
Comment : # 58 ok , I ’m using IE7 trying to use a png background to draw a shadow down the left side of my container div .
In IE7 and Firefox it works great , but in IE6 the png image does not repeat .
It appears at the top of the div , but it does n’t repeat , any ideas ?
Also if using a png as a button background it does not register as a hot spot when rolled over .
Comment : # 59 Dean , regarding comment 59 , I ’m encountering an error when included with Prototype .
The script debugger reports the error is in the evaluated selector function : var _selectorFunction=function ( e0 , s ) {IE7._indexed ++; var r=[ ] , p={},reg=[ ] , d=document ;var e1=IE7._byId(d , 'mf- folder-nav ' ) ; if( e1&&e0==d||e0.contains (e1 ) ) {r[ r.length ] =e1 ; if ( s ) return e1 ; }return s?null :r} specifically , e0.contains ( ) is not a method .
Tracing back to cssQuery , e0 is suppose to be the context element or the document .
I did a check and it indeeds is the document .
Since document .contains does n’t exist , the solution is to not call it which I think is what you tried to do .
However that expression will always call it .
So I modified the cssParser class ( line 669 ) to do this instead : if ( e1&& ( e0==d||e0.contains ( e1 ) ) )
It seems to work fine now .
I do n’t know if that disabled any fixes but the one bug I was trying to fix is the multiple classes bug for IE6 and this solved it .
Thanks for the great work .
Comment : # 60 @ Chuck – the PNG fix does not support tiled ( repeated ) images using background - repeat .
Nor does it support positioned images using background - position .
Comment : # 61 @Tuan – this has already been reported .
It is fixed in the next release .
Comment : # 62 I wonder why nobody has said anything about this yet , but in the given example codes for linking to googlecode the version number is incorrectly 1.0 when it should be 2.0 - took a little while to notice the typo .
Comment : # 63 @ Vessa – I wonder how no one else noticed too .
Fixed now .
Comment : # 64
This script is great , I finally do n’t have to worry about CSS hacks and improper rendering .
It even fixes some CSS2 features missing from IE7 !
I tried the old version once but could n’t get it to work .
I noticed there was a new one and decided to try it .
It renders a CSS - heavy website I was working on perfectly and does n’t cause any lag or problems .
Too bad something like this ca n’t fix the missing support for XHTML served as XML ..
It ’s still a great fix for the CSS hack filled nightmare that was IE6 !
I ’m surprised something as buggy as IE6 can be made to render pages so well .
I only needed to make a few changes which were easily done .
Comment : # 65 this script did n’t work , maybe a known bug ?
i’m using ie6 ( from multiple ie ) and windows xp sp2
Comment : # 66 Nice , nice job !
One thing : position : fixed seems to give a position : absolute behavior in IE6 , meaning it scrolls along with the rest of the page .
Am I doing anything wrong ?
Comment : # 67 Cool , but not only does it not support tiling background images ( as you know ) but it also breaks IE ’s ability to do this using other methods .
Comment : # 68 @thoeger – the fixed positioning solution should work .
If you provide an example of broken behaviour then I will try to fix it .
@ Bouki – IE7.js fixes lots of different things .
You will have to be more specific about what does n’t work .
The software is still in beta so there is time to fix bugs .
Comment : # 69 @dean ;
Yeah , try and look at http://www.fys.ku.dk/~thoeger/Paradoxsite/, and the link ‘ koret ’ ( danish for ‘ the choir ’ ) on that site .
Use IE6 .
I might have missed out something but the code validates and It ’s pretty simple , so I ca n’t see what is up …
Comment : # 70 @thoeger – I ca n’t see anything wrong on at that page .
Can you be more specific what the problem is .
Comment : # 71 @dean :
The fixed elements still scroll with the rest of the page .
Comment : # 72 [ … ]
Transparent pngs do n’t work in IE 6 and lower .
There are a couple ways to get them to though .
You can read through this : PNG - 24 Alpha Transparency With Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or better ( MSIE 5.5 + )
Or you could try Dean Edward ’s IE7 script which pretty much turns old IE versions into IE7 ( which does support pngs ) Dean Edwards : IE7.js version 2.0 ( beta )
The only catch is that you wo n’t be able to use them as repeating backgrounds . [… ]
Comment : # 73
Note also that if you want transparent png images , you either need to rename them to include - trans.png or put IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = “ .png ” ; in between the script tags ( so , after SCRIPT and before / SCRIPT )
This will apply the transparency code to all png files , which is useful if you only use PNG for transparent images .

Comment : # 84 @Supercammello – the PNG fix relies on Microsoft CSS filters which were only introduced with MSIE5.5 .
Comment : # 85 Hi ,
My app is under https and when trying it with your IE7 javascript it did n’t work .
I tried under http and it worked .
I also tried to download and unzipped the library to reference them directly ( I was worry about being a problem of not coming from same domain security ) but still did n’t work .
Do you know anyone who was able to make your IE7 javascript work under https ?
Pehraps it simply does not work under https .
Thanks , great work by the way .

Comment : # 92 I ’m using your IE8 but I still have problems , which I ’m beginning to grasp at straws .
I always get an error on my site when using IE7 – line 74 , char 4 , code 0 – no matter what is on that line .
In 2 of the exact same builds of IE& – I have only one that throws an “ operation aborted ” error .
Anyone have any ideas ???
I really really appreciate any help I can get .

This certainly makes supporting IE6 less painful .
Be aware that using AlphaImageLoader to make PNGs be transparent can deadlock IE 6 .
I described this in more detail at http://blogs.cozi.com/tech/2008/03/transparent-png.html
Comment : # 97
Thanks again for your hard work on this project .
I attempted to make a post before with regards to style sheet switching and Ie7/8 ( I ’m not certain if my post in Purgatory or just did n’t go through ) .
I have gotten closer , realizing that I needed to make a couple of changes to my code .
I added the following to my function : IE7.CSS.init( ) ; IE7.HTML.init( ) ; IE7.HTML.apply ( ) ; IE7.CSS.apply ( ) ; IE7.recalc ( ) ; I now have a working version in IE and Firefox : http://markschamel.com/deanEdwards/ie8.b.html
My function is here : http://markschamel.com/deanEdwards/scripts/methods2.js
I have two questions : ( 1 ) Do I need all of the code I added ?
( 2 ) I ’m still struggling to make this work with stylesheets which import other stylesheets , any pointers ?

This set of script files , found here , are a cross - browser programmer ’s best friend .
Uploadthem to your server , link them into your page with a simple script tag , and voila , you add web standards to your IE browsers .
For me , the alpha transparency and min-width stuff is worth the price ( it ’s free ! ) , but it contains so much more .
There is also a google group you can join that Dean himself contributes to . [… ]

Comment : # 106 Great to hear that your excellent work will continue on this front !
Btw , your code view ( used in this post to denote how to link straight from google ’s servers ) is a bit wanting …
Specifically , two formatting choices break the ability to actually copy and paste from the page : 1 . Quote marks are turned into “ smart quotes ” 2 .
The final double dash that closes the comment is turned into an em dash .
I was able to sort out why adding IE7.js to my site broke it .
Others may falsely blame the javascript itself rather than simply double checking the code that includes the javascript .
Thanks for all your hard work with this project !
Comment : # 107 Dean , Could you put some an explicit licencing statement in the source code , or at least in the Subversion repository ?

Comment : # 110
Have you seen this ?
Apparently he has found a way to do transparent PNG tiling for IE 6 and below .
Any possibility of this getting into your script ?
http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/
Comment : # 111 Great work , thank you !
Especially for the .png fix , for the first time I have a fair degree of confidence that IE will get it right and am going to include them in my site design .
It should be a big embarrassment to Microsoft that their team ca n’t get such a tremendous improvement in web graphics to display correctly .
But after this long , apparently not .
So I ’ll assume they ’re up to their old tricks of stifling promising non-ms tech whilst trying to figure out how to ( re ) invent and cash in on “ IEBlend technology , now you can use your non-rectangular graphics against any background ! ”
Either that or human resources is hiring too many relatives .
I do n’t hate MS , but when I think of the countless hours that developers have spent on this inane display problem … bah .
They are holding the world back from seeing next level website graphics and what can be done with them .
If they do n’t fix it soon , maybe a movement could gain momentum , to use . png ’s as - is and state on the first line of the page “ If you see gray around the image borders , you are using a non-standards compliant browser .
Please upgrade to Firefox . ”
I know this would be limited to mainly non-commercial sites but maybe we ’d get a proper solution out of it from MS .
One .png solution I can’t remember seeing is to stick the .png in a flash .
Then you ’d just have to learn the IE flash hacks .
( grin )
An advantage is that file size can be considerably reduced compared to the plain .png file .
Another is you can put a mask on a .jpg to make it smoothly non-rectangular .
A disadvantage for most visitors would be that they ’d have to take a screenshot to save the image .
Once again , thank you Dean for this hard work !
Comment : # 112 I just tested it again , you ’re right , my bad .
Before a few days ago it ’s been a while since I tried IE and .png images and thought I read , and had tested , that it was n’t fixed yet .
I just felt my soapbox shake a bit under my feet …
IE7 users are about 41 % of my visitors so I ’m still glad for the fix .
The person my stats page reports as using IE2 will have to tough it out though .
Comment : # 113 Dean looking at 35 .
I tried doing a document . recalc after I loaded an image with AJAX but it remains gray .
I have no problem using your JS on a static html page it works great .
I also did a 2 second settimeout after the image is called that does n’t work either .
Is there something I have to do besides call .
document.recalc( ) ; ?
Thanks in advance .
Comment : # 114 Hey Dean , I just wanted to let you know that your fix saved me that incredibly huge amount of time that I usually had to spend on fixing the layout for the IE I ’m just a ‘ little ’ .. nerved ..
that I have n’t found it earlier , though I must confess that I was sceptical – as I ’m ever – using Javascript to fix CSS problems .
But hey .. its working – so what .
Never the less – best wishes , greetings and a lot of thanks Flitze
Comment : # 115 Just found out about this script and used it on a site I ’m developing where some custom Google Map elements would n’t display correctly in IE6 .
Wow , you just saved me an incredible amount of time !
I ca n’t wait to use this to implement advanced CSS in future sites .
Thanks upon thanks for the great work .
Comment : # 116 [ … ]
A partir de los inconvenientes con el diseño previo , aprendí la lección que me llevó a plantear este último objetivo .
Por ejemplo , un 39 % de las visitas utilizan Internet Explorer versión 6 , y por ello tienen algunos inconvenientes de visualización serios .
Actualmente , se continúa trabajando para “ amigar ” los estilos CSS del diseño con IE6 .
Sin embargo , no existen recetas únicas y se deben desarrollar toda una batería de estrategias y hacks para solucionarlo .
Para esto , un excelente primer recurso a investigar es el de Dean Edwards – IE.js [… ]
Comment : # 117 Hi Dean , and thanks a lot for your very good job .
I still have a problem with position : fixed in IE6 .
My page has a header which is fixed , but I cannot succeed to post the body below the header .
The top of the body disappears behind the header .
My body style has a position : absolute , with top equal to the header height .
I ’ve also tried to use “ scrollTo ( ) ” with an anchor at the top of the body , but no success
Any hint ?
Thanks in advance .
Phil .
Comment : # 118 Hi Dean , is it possible make your script more “ manual ” ?
So something like that can be used : ....... var css=new IE7CSS ( " CSS/styles.css " ) ; css.apply ( $ $ ( " [ class=Header ] " ) ) ; ....... I assume it can be much faster and do n’t break existing pages ( $$ – from MooTools )
Comment : # 119
Anyone get this to work with an AJAX call for an Image ?

Where could I find the old version of IE7.js ?
I want to take a look at the changes from version 0.9
Comment : # 131 I have no problems with IE7 , fantastic !!
but the link directly to the files on google is a little bit slow .
for me y. k. cheers !
Comment : # 132 I think this has to be a great alternative to ad hoc hacks .
BUT it has messed up my drop - down menus because only the link is being highlighted ( not the list item box ) , so the menus collapse when trying to mouse to the next level .
This is ‘ normal ’ IE6 behaviour , but I use the Suckerfish script , which enables IE6 to highlight the list item boxes .
I ’d hoped IE7.js would do the same , but in fact it does the opposite and over - rides the Suckerfish script .
IE7.js has the same effect on the menus both with and without Suckerfish My menus are based on ‘ More Eric Meyer on CSS ’ , Project 6 , but use the Suckerfish script to work in IE6 instead of csshover.htc .
Is there a solution to this , please ?

To use transparent png images , you can choose to include - trans.png or put IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = “ .png ” ; in between the script tags .

Comment : # 188 Dean , Using the multiple IEs / IE6eolas standalone , I get an error .
I realize that this is a non-standard browser , but it is one widely used by people testing web sites .
Is there a potential patch to IE8.js that would work around this ?
Line : 619 Error : Syntax error eval ( format ( _FN , reg ) + cssParser.unescape( fn ) + “ return s?null:r} ” ) ; I used the uncompressed version , so as to get a line number : http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/version/2.0(beta3)/src/IE8.js note that the Version string of the IE6 standalone is not what one would expect : 7.0.5730.11.xpsp.080413-2111 a true installation ( IE6 on Windows XP ) does not exhibit the error .
Its version string is more like expected : 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_rtm.040803-2158
In addition , the IE6 conditional comment will not execute in the IE6 standalone .
<!–[ if lt IE 7 ] >

How Does Language Impact Framework Design ?
by Frank Sommers
January 10 , 2008
Summary
Developer productivity is as much a factor of productive frameworks as it is of language capabilities .
Is there anything in Java that limits framework architects in their quest to design more productive APIs and frameworks ?
How do language features impact framework design ?
Advertisement
Much recent discussion about Java has focused either on the shortcomings of the language , or on how adding new language features to remedy those shortcomings would make Java more complex , especially for less advanced programmers .
While recent Java criticism appears to center around the language , the real issue is developer productivity .
Bill Venners , for example , bemoans that :
For several years I have been jealous of the joy people seem to feel when they program in Python or Ruby .
I believe the sense of satisfaction stems primarily from feeling , and actually being , more productive in these languages .
Although I have no doubt that my choice to use Java for Artima 's architecture was the right one , for me Java was a practical choice , not a heart choice .
When I work in Java , I would n't say I feel joy .
I do n't feel like I 'm riding a fast stallion through beautiful wooded hills , the wind in my long , flowing hair .
I feel more like I 'm struggling to convince a workhorse to pull a plow .
Elsewhere , Bill Venners says that :
I think there is a natural law of languages that [ says ] that [ a language ] over time becomes harder and harder to enhance while still maintaining backwards compatibility .
If a language is as successful as Java , it 's really expensive to break source compatibility with Java in subsequent releases of the language .
It becomes harder and harder to improve things ...
And it comes a time when it may make sense to jump to a language that is not source compatible , but is binary compatible .
Bruce Eckel seems to agree , adding that ,
If Java is to be saved at all , it needs to become like C ; a workhorse that you can rely upon .
In fact , any future changes to the language need to be things that simplify and clarify the language and its use ( say , fixing the classpath problem ) , and flesh out ( for example ) incomplete libraries that have languished ...
But we need to become especially conservative when considering major , fundamental language features like closures which , while they can be very appealing in theory , may have a cost that is too great in practice when they are forced into a language that values backward compatibility over the clarity of its abstractions .
While the capabilities and design of a language are important , a language is but one determinant of a developer 's overall productivity ( and I presume that a highly productive developer is a happy one , all things being equal ) .
Many projects choose Java more for its APIs and developer and deployment tools than for its language features .
Indeed , few Java developers embark these days on a new project without relying on some framework , whether for persistence , the Web tier , or even for desktop applications .
Using Java is increasingly a task of interacting with Java frameworks .
If Java developers spend a large portion of their time working with frameworks , and if the best Java developers still feel lacking in productivity — " struggling to convince a workhorse to pull a plow " — to what degree is that due to the lack of agility of Java frameworks , and to what extent is that attributable to the language itself ?
More interestingly , to what degree does Java 's design handicap framework architects to create more productive tools ?
Language Power , Framework Beauty
Some of those critiquing Java often point to Ruby as an example of a productive language .
Ruby code , indeed , is beautiful to look at , and I can say from experience that writing Ruby applications does make you feel productive ( and sometimes happy ) .
However , the pre-eminent Ruby application today is Rails , whereas the Java landscape is much more divided between a myriad of Web , persistence , and desktop frameworks .
Could it be that part of the productivity emanating from the Ruby community is really due to Rails , and not as much to Ruby ?
A little - discussed aspect of Rails is that you do n't need to know much Ruby to write even a fairly substantial Rails application .
A competent Java developer could learn probably in a single day all the Ruby he needed to develop a feature - rich Rails application .
A typical Rails application consists of short snippets of Ruby code pulled together by the framework into a coherent whole .
Behind the few lines of Ruby application of code is a clever exploiting of Ruby 's metaobject protocol and module system that hides a lot of complexity from the developer .
Bruce Eckel noted that developing in Flex can also make for happy developers — happier certainly , than those trying to cobble together complex HTML pages or Swing UIs .
Behind Flex , however , is the ActionScript 3 language , a version of the emerging EcmaScript 4 standard , that combines some of the ugliest aspects of Java syntax with the quirkier corners of JavaScript .
Since ActionScript 3 attempts to mix together in a single stew dynamic and static typing , as well as functional and object - oriented programming techniques , the combination can potentially yield mind - boggling complexity .
But the designers of Flex hide much of that complexity : as with Rails , Flex applications tend to consist of small snippets of ActionScript code , short functions , mixed together with an XML - based UI layout language .
Learning Flex is not so much a question of learning advanced features of ActionScript 3 , but is about learning how the Flex framework affects some desired functionality .
Both Flex and Rails selected aspects of their respective languages that are relatively easy to master , and strongly encourage the use of those features in their designs .
That 's exactly what every framework should do .
Without Rails nudging developers in a certain direction , steering clear of Ruby 's more esoteric features , we may all be complaining now how Ruby leads to overly complex and hard - to - understand code .
And without Flex , few would be inclined to touch ActionScript ( or even EcmaScript 4 ) .
In a recent blog post , Cay Horstmann complains that one his Java pain points is exactly in the area of Java frameworks :
When I embark on another web application ... I groan .
I use JSF in the forlorn hope that someone else has given me components that make me not worry about AJAX and GET vs. POST , all of which have nothing to do with the problem that I want to solve .
But then I ... despair .
If I have to paste random pieces of code to make things work , I just know I 'll be hosed when things do n't work .
Come on , folks ,
When I write a web application , I want to be able to say " This is the common layout of my pages , give me a standard login screen , I want a menu here , and fill that table with those database values , but add a column with buttons ... "
I can do it in JSF , but it is like eating soup with a fork .
Why is it that Sun can't give me a decent web framework ?
Is it a shortcoming of the Java language ?
Or crummy API design ? ... I think in this case , the Java language is sufficiently powerful , but we are hobbled by backwards compatibility with JSP and JSF , both of which are simultaneously complex and underpowered .
Or could a language enhancement such as continuations make web programming dramatically easier ?
If so , why does Rails get all the buzz and not Seaside ?
Horstmann asks the excellent question of whether there is something in Java that prevents framework architects to design a highly productive , cruft - free , and beloved framework in Java .
If so , then what in Java makes it hard to write good frameworks in that language ?
Scalable Language
On the surface , it seems that some of the emerging and popular frameworks use dynamically typed languages in order to avoid unnecessary code generation and clutter .
Ruby and ActionScript 3 also provide functional features and closures that their respective frameworks fully exploit .
Yet , I do n't believe that any those features make these languages more suitable for framework construction than Java .
Rather , the notion of a scalable language may have to do with framework bliss to a greater extent .
In their book , Programming Scala , published by Artima and recently released in PDF PrePrint , Martin Odersky , Lex Spoon , and Bill Venners , write that :
Scala has a set of convenient constructs that help you get started quickly and let you program in a pleasantly concise style .
At the same time , you have the assurance that you will not " outgrow " the language .
You can always tailor the the program to your requirements , because everything is based on library modules that you can select and adapt as needed ...
Scala is much more like a bazaar than a cathedral , in the sense that it is designed to be extended and adapted by the people programming in it .
Instead of providing all constructs you might ever need in one “ perfectly complete ” language , Scala puts the tools for building such constructs into your hands .
I recall James Gosling mentioning many years ago that one of his , and Sun's , goals with Java was to create a language that allowed developers to write big programs reliably .
Indeed , Java is eminently suitable for that task , as many large enterprise applications , IDEs , an application servers written in Java demonstrate .
But I have a feeling that most developers do n't really want to write big programs .
I certainly prefer a model of programming when I can write a few lines of code to affect just the functionality I desire .
I can get that with Ruby and ActionScript , and even in Scala .
But Java somehow always feels like having to drive a big rig to the convenience store .
It scales up very well , but does n't scale down as neatly for smaller jobs .
On that note though , the more I learn about Ruby , I 'm beginning to think that just as Java does n't easily scale down to smaller tasks , Ruby would n't scale up to large systems :
The way Ruby classes can be opened up and parts of a class redefined — a very handy feature when writing Rails modules , for instance — can , for instance , lead to completely incomprehensible programs in the wrong hands .
In the case of Ruby , the existence of Rails remedies the language 's potential scalability issues .
As Rails is increasingly employed in larger , enterprise tasks , it remains to be seen whether the ability to scale down a language is overall more important than for a language to scale up to huge programs :
It maybe that scaling up can be done with good frameworks , but scaling down really needs support in the language itself .
The jury on that is still out .
Perhaps new languages that can scale down to small tasks as well as scale up to big programs , such as Scala , will lead to more powerful and better frameworks overtime .
If you were to write your own Web / persistence / desktop framework , what language would you pick ?
In what way do you think language impacts framework design ?

US quietly demands Iraq give defense contractors , US military immunity from prosecution John Byrne and Gavin McNett
Published : Friday January 25 , 2008

This US officials are dragooning Iraq into accepting immunity for US civilian contractors in new negotiations with the Iraqi government just months after a feud over a private defense contractor exploded into an international outcry .
The Bush administration insists that Baghdad give the US " broad authority to conduct combat operations and guarantee civilian contractors specific legal protections from Iraqi law , according to administration and military officials , " a front page story in Friday 's New York Times reports .
The Administration 's proposed security agreement would replace the current United Nations mandate authorizing the US presence in Iraq , which is set to expire Dec. 31 , 2008 .
No other country working with the US military in Iraq is exempt from local laws .
A September , 2007 incident in which defense contractor Blackwater USA shot and killed 17 Iraqi civilians sparked an intense public faceoff between the Administration and the Iraqi government after Iraq refused to continue Blackwater 's license .
Blackwater , which provided security for the State Department , was soon allowed to continue business , though its immunity was revoked by Congress .
Officials have also demanded that Iraq give US troops immunity from local laws and the ability to arrest and detain suspects .
But the White House confirmed yesterday that its new budget , to be submitted in February , will reverse last year 's policy of providing a full year of funding for the war in Iraq , " leaving the next president and Congress to confront major cost questions soon after taking office in 2009 , " the Politico reported on Wednesday .
Last year 's budget , unveiled soon after Democrats took control of Congress , was explicit in requesting a full year 's worth of funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The new budget , the Politico notes , returns to the adminstration 's prior practice of " request[ing ] only incremental ' bridge ' funding , " and " wo n't sustain the military through the full length of the fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 , 2009 . "
" The American negotiating position for a formal military - to - military relationship , one that would replace the current United Nations mandate , is laid out in a draft proposal that was described by White House , Pentagon , State Department and military officials on ground rules of anonymity , " the Times wrote .
" It also includes less controversial demands that American troops be immune from Iraqi prosecution , and that they maintain the power to detain Iraqi prisoners . "
Gates disputes claim of ' permanent bases '
This reversal in requesting war funding is concurrent with an effort by the White House to remake the terms of the US military commitment in Iraq .
Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) assert that Bush is trying to lock a new president into a long - term presence .
An NPR report Thursday suggested that Administration lawyers might use the words " continuing " or " enduring " bases , rather than " permanent " bases , which Congress voted to ban last year .
Speaking to reporters Thursday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said these charges were spurious .
Gates sought to dismiss concerns among critics that a planned US military accord with Iraq would tie the hands of future US presidents regarding the mandate of US troops in the war - torn country and create permanent US bases .
" I think it is pretty clear that such an agreement would not talk about force levels .
It would not involve -- we have no interest in permanent bases , " he told reporters .
The US defense chief also insisted that discussions had just barely started on the on the still - to - be- negotiated Status of Forces Agreement .
According to a report by the House Oversight Committee , a single Blackwater guard ends up costing taxpayers $ 1,222 per day , or $ 445,000 per year , six times the equivalent of a US soldier .
Officials testify they cannot control contractors Veteran intelligence correspondent Walter Pincus , writing in the Washington Post Friday , reported that US officials now believe the Bush administration is unprepared to manage contractors involvement in the war .
Contractors " have become part of our total force , a concept that DoD [ the Defense Department ] must manage on an integrated basis with our military forces , " said Deputy Secretary of Defense Jack Bell in prepared testimony for a hearing yesterday of the Senate homeland security subcommittee , Pincus wrote .
" Frankly , we were not adequately prepared to address " what he termed " this unprecedented scale of our dependence on contractors . "
" Sen. Thomas R. Carper ( D - DE ) , the subcommittee 's chairman , noted that the Defense Contract Audit Agency has reported that $ 10 billion of about $ 57 billion in contracts for services and reconstruction in Iraq " is either questionable or cannot be supported because of a lack of contractor information needed to assess costs , " Pincus continued .
" He added that more than 80 separate criminal investigations are underway involving contracts of more than $ 5 billion . "

' The house price crash starts in 2008 '
Analysis : Fred Harrison is author of Boom Bust : House Prices , Banking and the Depressioon of 2010 .
Here he discusses solutions to the boom - bust cycle ...
Ten years ago , in my book The Chaos Makers , I forecast what would happen to the economy in 2008 : a house - price crash ahead of a wider recession .
My prediction looks like being confirmed : the latest survey of the housing market shows house prices stalling in most parts of the country , with predictions of a fall next year .
Meanwhile , the Chartered Institute of Personnel now expects unemployment to rise by 150,000 — taking the number of people out of work to its highest level since 1997 .
It need not have unfolded this way .
In 1997 , I submitted papers to Gordon Brown , the new Chancellor .
I explained that house prices would peak in 2007 because of frenzied activity in the land market .
I warned that the downturn in house prices would presage a global depression in 2010 — unless he radically reformed taxes so that they were shifted away from work and towards speculation in land .
That way , investment would go into the real economy instead of simply fuelling another property boom .
Naturally , Mr Brown took no notice .
Instead , he stuck with conventional Treasury policies .
But handing responsibility for setting interest rates to the Bank of England was never going to stop the property market from soaring : lower interest rates might be good for business but they also give landowners and speculators an even bigger return on their land , fuelling a new property boom .
People are now being lulled into thinking Britain will still manage a ' soft landing ' .
House prices may turn down over the next six months , according to the consensus view , but they will pick up again towards the end of 2008 .
These assurances are irresponsible .
They encourage first - time buyers to jump into the housing market when they see prices weakening .
But in my view , the decline in house prices will exceed 20 % over the next two years .
The argument in favour of a soft landing is that the ' fundamentals of the economy — the basic strength of markets and major businesses — remain sturdy .
This is exactly what Mr Brown emphasised in his New Year message at the weekend .
But it ignores two crucial facts .
First , the causal mechanism between house prices and the wider economy actually works in the opposite direction .
A decline in house prices is good news for first - time buyers but it is highly damaging for the economy .
We have grown to rely on property as the collateral for our credit - funded consumption binge .
Reduce the value of the collateral and people 's spending power is reduced , too .
That raises unemployment and further weakens people 's willingness to buy property .
>> Editor 's Blog :
Why house prices and shares are predicted to fall in 2008
The historical evidence is clear : over the past 200 years , housing booms have always been followed by recessions .
Our economy is like a drug addict : the heroin of house - price rises is bad for the body , but cold turkey is still a painful business .
The other reason Mr Brown 's argument is wrong is that we cannot any longer dismiss a house - price crash as just a local factor .
The real estate sector is now effectively a single global market ; property cycles have converged .
The US cycle came to an end in 2006 .
The housing markets in Ireland and Spain came to an end in 2007 .
Downturns in property prices are surfacing all the way from Eastern Europe to the Far East .
The remaining property markets will peak in 2008 .
As the property dominoes fall across the globe , the ensuing financial crisis will eclipse the present current credit crunch in the banking sector .
It takes two years or so for a recession to take hold after house prices have peaked .
So I am satisfied that my gloomy prediction of a full - blown recession in 2010 will turn out to be correct .
Can the Government soften the blows ?
Historically speaking , once a landmarket - led frenzy has taken its toll , there is little governments can do to prevent unemployment .
Even so , ministers should now focus on two areas of policy .
First , they should avoid making the downturn even worse .
If , for example , the Treasury sticks with its plan to level down the tax rate on capital gains , there will be a sharp drop in prices in the summer .
Owners of buy - to - let properties are waiting for the new tax year to offer their apartments for sale , when the CGT rate will be cut from 40 % to 18 % .
The effect will be a crash in prices , denting confidence even further .
Second , ministers should lay plans for an increase in the output of affordable houses over the next property cycle , thus restoring some confidence to the property market .
As things stand , I forecast Mr Brown will not achieve his target — three million new homes built by 2020 .
Housing starts began to fall last year : this always happens when the price of land becomes unaffordable .
But if government offered the right incentives , building firms could kickstart their construction programmes and create some new jobs .
In the longer term , ministers should give priority to reforming the tax system .
Taxes which penalise people who work , save and invest should be reduced or abolished .
Given the bad times ahead , the Chancellor should give priority to reducing income tax ( which makes it uneconomic for some people to work ) and VAT ( which reduces consumption ) .
Get house price predictions emailed once a week in 2008 ...
Instead , a tax on land values would let government raise revenue from the value created by investments in public infrastructure , such as the Jubilee line extension .
Such investments raise the productivity of the economy — for example , by getting people to their place of work more quickly .
These gains from taxpayers ' investments surface as rising land values : a flat in Stratford , for example , will be worth far more when Crossrail opens for business .
But as the tax system stands , the public purse gets very little of the benefit back .
Shifting taxation so that owners of land paid an annual tax on that land 's value — rather than on the property sitting upon it , as council tax does — would also discourage speculation and a new property bubble .
For the enterprise economy , a shift towards such a tax on land values is the most benign way for government to raise revenue .
Progressively reforming the tax regime in this way would lift the spirits of the nation .
It would give Britain a head start as the global markets recover around 2012 .
It would place the housing sector at the cutting edge of a new period of sustainable growth .
It will be hard to avoid bad economic news in 2008 .
Should n't that be all the more incentive for political leaders to work together to agree a radical way out of the cycle of boom and bust ?

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , reinforcing an ultimatum over Afghanistan , told U.S. President George W. Bush on Wednesday that Ottawa would withdraw its military mission next year unless NATO sent in more troops , officials said .

Canada , which has 2,500 soldiers in the southern city of Kandahar , is fed up with the refusal of other NATO nations to send more forces to the violent region of Afghanistan .
The Canadian combat mission there is due to end in February 2009 .
Harper said on Monday he accepted the recommendations of an independent panel that urged Canada to end the mission unless NATO provided 1,000 extra soldiers and Ottawa obtained helicopters and aerial reconnaissance vehicles .
A spokeswoman said Harper had talked to Bush on Wednesday about the report .
“ He underscored that , unless Canada was able to meet the conditions specified by the panel of additional combat troops and equipment from NATO allies , Canada ’s mission in Afghanistan will not be extended , ” she said .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush pointed out that the United States had already agreed to sent more soldiers to Afghanistan .
“ The president noted the deployment of 3,200 additional U.S. Marines to Afghanistan , as well as his continued commitment to work with NATO to enhance its commitment to the Afghanistan mission , ” Fratto said .
It was not clear whether the additional U.S. troops would meet Canada ’s condition for more soldiers in Kandahar .
Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said the addition of 2,200 U.S. Marines to southern Afghanistan would provide a lot of the combat power needed in that area .
“ The addition of the MEU ( marine expeditionary unit ) will greatly enhance the coalition ’s combat capabilities in RC - South and without placing an additional burden in an area already strapped for airlift because they come with their own transportation , ” Morrell said .
NATO says it agrees with Canada about the need to bolster its peace operation , but the alliance dismisses the idea that members are dragging their feet .
“ Canada has played and continues to play a very important role in a strategically important part of Afghanistan and we would like to see that role continue , ” NATO spokesman James Appathurai said in Brussels .
“ Certainly NATO will , to the extent that we can , support any efforts to garner more forces , including for the south .
We have a long - standing request to nations to provide additional resources . ”
So far , 78 Canadian soldiers and a diplomat have been killed in Afghanistan since Ottawa deployed troops there in 2002 .
An Ipsos - Reid poll released on Saturday said 50 percent of Canadians backed he mission and 46 percent opposed it .
A New Yorker article on light pollution has a paragraph on light and crime :
Much so - called security lighting is designed with little thought for how eyes — or criminals — operate .
Marcus Felson , a professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University , has concluded that lighting is effective in preventing crime mainly if it enables people to notice criminal activity as it ’s taking place , and if it does n’t help criminals to see what they ’re doing .
Bright , unshielded floodlights — one of the most common types of outdoor security lighting in the country — often fail on both counts , as do all - night lights installed on isolated structures or on parts of buildings that ca n’t be observed by passersby ( such as back doors ) .
A burglar who is forced to use a flashlight , or whose movement triggers a security light controlled by an infrared motion sensor , is much more likely to be spotted than one whose presence is masked by the blinding glare of a poorly placed metal halide “ wall pack . ”
In the early seventies , the public - school system in San Antonio , Texas , began leaving many of its school buildings , parking lots , and other property dark at night and found that the no-lights policy not only reduced energy costs but also dramatically cut vandalism .
A MARKETING company hired by one of Australia 's tobacco giants has been reprimanded by the Federal Health Department for recruiting non-smokers to take up the habit .
The tactic has been described as underhanded and exploitative by doctors and the anti-smoking lobby , who want tobacco advertising laws to ban the tobacco industry from using market research and other types of viral marketing techniques .
They say the research firm Feedback Plus , based in Northmead , has targeted students who are strapped for cash and people who are already hooked , including one 40 - year - old man with a heavy alcohol and cigarette dependence , who was paid by market researchers to smoke up to 200 cigarettes a week .
In an email distributed in November , Feedback Plus said it was about to embark on a large cigarette " taste - testing " survey where recruits would be given cigarettes to test at home and be paid for their opinions .
" Taste testing is not limited to smokers .
New registrations via the webpage for the testing panel … have a chance at winning an instant $ 200 cash , " the email said .

We know how you lot like your scientific analysis : adequately researched , well - balanced and backed with solid evidence .
You 'll doubtless enjoy this piece down at Pravda , then , which confirms what the nutritionally - savvy among us have known all along : that vegetarianism is n't actually an informed lifestyle choice , but rather a " perversion of nature " pursued by protein - starved fanatics whose self - deception will surely drive them to an early grave .
Pravda lays out its stall thus :
Vegetarians can be referred to as true fanatics .
On the other hand , they are seriously misled in their beliefs .
Practically nobody argues with them , since it is really difficult to convince a vegetarian of his or her self - deception .
Maybe that is the reason why the vegetarian movement develops so actively around the globe and continues to recruit many new members .
Yes , vegetarianism is sort of like the Church of Scientology , and no messing .
But here 's why it 'll kill you in the end :
To produce a cell is not an easy process for the human body .
Being a parent to all cells , a human being is supposed to be responsible for all of them .
The human body is unable to generate all substances necessary for the production of cells .
It has only 12 or 20 protein amino acids required for the process .
The remaining chemicals are supposed to be delivered with food .
Each and every human cell is supposed to be supplied with first class animal protein .
The proof ?
Ah yes ...
Some may say that there is enough protein in vegetables ( beans , for example ) .
True , but recent studies show that vegetable protein can be digested only with the help of its animal analogue .
The human body has its own preferences , by the way .
Experts proved that our body requires and assimilates the following substances as construction materials : Egg white – 100 %
Soured milk – 90 %
Fresh milk – 83 %
Beef – 76 %
Cottage cheese – 75 %
Compare this data with that concerning vegetable protein :
Wheat bread – 52 %
This is the main reason why dietitians recommend to consume 60 percent of animal protein and 40 percent of vegetable analogue from the daily ration .
Yup , we 're convinced .
Feel free to knock up a quick bacon sarnie before reading the next bit , in which Pravda really gets into its stride .

AMERICA'S big bond insurers , which have underwritten some $ 2.4 trillion of private and public - sector bonds , usually go about their business largely unnoticed .
But now they are looking distinctly wobbly they have started to attract attention .
If one or more of them were to topple over , there will be a huge knock - on effect on banks and other financial institutions that rely on their guarantees .
This in turn will further worsen the credit crunch and cause an even bigger headache for policymakers already grappling with a sharp slowdown in the American economy .
The threat of such a financial domino effect looms large .
Moody's , a credit - rating agency , has signalled that it might downgrade the AAA - ratings of two of the biggest bond insurers , MBIA and Ambac , in the near future .
On Friday January 18th , Ambac said that it had dropped a plan to raise $ 1 billion of new equity capital to preserve its rating — making futher downgrades even likelier .
In response , Fitch , another rating firm , cut Ambac 's rating .
MBIA , which recently managed to raise $ 1 billion of new capital on top of another billion that it received from Warburg Pincus , a private - equity firm , will almost certainly need even more money if it is to preserve its AAA - rating .
ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation , another insurer , is in even direr straits .
In December its single - A credit rating was cut to junk status .
The firm begged its trading partners to give it more time to sort out its problems .
But by Friday it had still not come up with a rescue plan .
The state insurance regulator of Maryland , where ACA is incorporated , has already assumed responsibility for some of its operations .
Bond insurers in effect “ lend ” their top - notch ratings to lower - quality debt , raising its value in the eyes of investors .
Any cut in those ratings may make it impossible for the bond insurers to take on new business and would reduce the value of the securities they have already underwritten .
Such cuts are now a distinct possibility because the insurers have underwritten billions of dollars of mortgage - backed securities , including those notorious collateralised - debt obligations ( CDOs ) that have now gone sour .
On Wednesday Ambac announced a $ 3.5 billion writedown — as well as the ousting of its chief executive — $ 1.1 billion of which was related to CDOs .
The insurers ' exposure to these and other exotic products is a huge multiple of their flimsy capital bases — and the chances of them having to cover claims has soared as the economy has slowed .
Small wonder , then , that their share prices plummeted this week — proving that the market has already decided they no longer deserve such lofty ratings and creating a vicious downwards spiral .
Ambac 's falling share price has severely dented it chances of raising fresh capital .
There are already signs that the insurers ' woes are contagious .
On Thursday Merrill Lynch wrote down $ 3.1 billion on debt securities that it had hedged with ACA and other bond insurers .
Other banks have also made writedowns to reflect their lack of confidence in ACA 's ability to meet its commitments .
The full extent of the “ counterparty risk ” banks face in dealing with bond insurers is only now becoming apparent Jamie Dimon , the boss of JP Morgan Chase , has said that the fallout from the bond - insurer crisis could be “ pretty terrible ” for the debt markets .
If a big insurer such as Ambac or MBIA were to take a tumble , that could look like an understatement .

Brief about Masanjia
The Masanjia Labor Camp , also called the “ Ideology Education School of Liaoning Province , ” is located in a suburb of Shenyang City , and is notorious for its heinous crimes against Falun Gong practitioners and known worldwide for its forced - brainwashing techniques .
Over the past four years and seven months , from July 1999 to February 2004 , at least 99 practitioners were murdered there because of their belief in the universal principle of “ Truthfulness - Compassion - Tolerance . ”
Their ages ranged from 27 to 65 and majority of them were only between 31 and 39 years old .
In one incident that was reported by several news agencies , 18 female practitioners were stripped naked and thrown into the cells of male criminals .
The Masanjia Labor Camp is a fascist camp for the purpose of enslaving prisoners to perform labor for profit .
Prisoners must work for extended hours under the most appalling conditions .
The main “ business ” of the women ’s section of the Masanjia Labor Camp is textile production .
Not only are the detainees not paid , but also their work hours and workloads are pushed to the limit to “ boost productivity and profits . ”
Falun Gong practitioners from 14 years of age to over 60 have been forced to do intensive labor in the labor camp .
They are routinely forced to work 14 - 16 hours a day , with no days off .
Sometimes when there is a big order , they are forced to work for 36 hours nonstop .
Falun Gong practitioners live in the most inhumane conditions .
There is no bathroom in the camp .
They are not allowed to brush their teeth , or to wash , shower , or change their clothes .
Even the time for using the toilet is limited .
The food given is minimal and is often rotten .
The horrendous conditions and excessive workload damage the health of the practitioners .
Many have swollen legs and experience irregular menstruation .
Some even develop atrophy of their buttocks due to the extensive hours of being forced to sit still and work .
Due to exhaustion , some have even fainted while working .
However , no matter what physical conditions they are in , and no matter what the state of their health , they are not spared from the hard labor .

Cases of torture
1. Zhang Guizhi , female , tortured to death in Masanjia
“ On April 12th , 2003 Ms. Zhang ’s family received a notice issued jointly by the Masanjia Labor Camp , the local police station and Liujiawopu Village Committee stating that Ms. Zhang “ is receiving emergency treatment because she ’s critically ill . ”
“ By the time Ms. Zhang ’s family arrived at Masanjia , she was already dead .
“ Family members say there were noticeable wounds on her body , including numerous bruises as well as bloodstains in her nose and mouth .
“ Labor camp officials refused to allow the family to take any photographs of the body .
“ Initially , police and camp officials declined to answer questions about the cause of her death .
When Ms. Zhang ’s family members demanded to know why her body was black and blue , the police claimed that she had fallen in the shower , triggering a heart problem that led to her death .
“ According to a source familiar with Masanjia Labor Camp , prisoners are only allowed to take showers on specific days .
April 12th was not a designated “ shower day ” for those held in the camp , the source says . ”

For months we in the US of A have been watching candidates for our presidency speak at rallies and the apparently endless debates hosted by , it seems , everybody but fast - food chains .
We know that candidates dicker with presidential debate sponsors on everything : sitting or standing , size of lectern if standing , boosters for the short of stature , position on the podium with respect to other candidates , favorable lighting , what television cameras may or may not shoot , and so on .
Candidates negotiate for every possible advantage .
They demand control .
We expect this at debates .
But what about those loud , noisy , seemingly chaotic political rallies ?
Candidates stroll onto stage surrounded by cheering supporters ( handpicked , I bet ) , American flags waving and red , white and blue confetti swirling in the air .
We see these scenes repeatedly on CNN or Fox or MSNBC or the broadcast networks , especially during CNN ’s “ Ballot Bowl ” â€” which offers “ unfiltered views of the candidates . ”
( Ballot Bowl is usually bereft of reporting that challenges candidates ’ messaging , which I detest . )
Regarding these campaign rallies :
Who decides what the TV cameras show ?
It ’s no secret that candidates seek control over their images and their messages .
But so much of that messaging is inherent in the televised image , which is overtly or covertly controlled by candidates ’ handlers .
Political consultants control who or what surrounds their candidates on screen .
Writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post :
Funds raised on the Internet flow into the other part of the air war that could determine this election : the organizing and broadcasting of images containing subliminal or unstated messages for a national television audience .
But neither the mechanics of Internet fundraising nor the selling of the candidates , 2008 , have received the media scrutiny they deserve .
[ emphasis added ]
Watch CNN ( or your TV news of choice ) .
See the candidate preen before a camera .
It ’s usually a tight frame on the candidate , or pulled sufficiently wide to see who is cheering behind or alongside the candidate â€ ” but usually not much more .
Writes Mr. Hoagland about Democratic candidate Barack Obama ’s South Carolina speech on Jan. 26 :
His mastery was impressive .
And so was that of his image managers , I gradually concluded .
I marveled at the sea of white faces nodding approvingly or cheering wildly behind Obama .
Then I realized that only a sprinkling of the black voters and volunteers who helped power the candidate ’s victory in my home state had made it onto the platform seats behind Obama , in range of the national eye .
Was it possible these voters had not come to celebrate their victory ?
Hardly .
Reporters in the hall saw Obama campaign workers usher photogenic white families toward the platform as they entered .
The scene they composed was an effective , calculated rebuttal of the Clintons ’ effort to portray Obama as a black candidate whose victory depended on race …
Such manipulation has become so commonplace that few other journalists bothered to mention the Carolina campaign tableau in their coverage , even though [ one journalist ] estimated that 85 percent of the crowd was African American .
[ emphasis added ]
( See Sen. Obama ’s speech ) .
I ’ve never worked in broadcast journalism .
But I wonder :
Who decides where cameras are placed at political rallies ?
Who decides what the cameras will or will not show ?
CNN ’s ( or other news organizations ’ ) producers ?
Campaign organizers ?
If a big - time political rally is covered by local broadcast stations ( which may not have the political heft of CNN or Fox or MSNBC ) , do those stations simply allow rally organizers to dictate terms of camera placement and coverage ?
Is this all “ pool ” camera coverage in which several news organizations share a single camera feed ?
Even if it is , who decides what the camera shows ?
I do n’t know .
I only I know what I see on the screen â€ ” and it ’s usually not enough to provide me a fuller “ truth ” of the event .
Is n’t “ truth ” supposed to be the work product of journalists ?
( Or am I just impossibly naive ? )
Let ’s not just pick on the campaign of Sen. Obama .
From Mr. Hoagland :
Team Clinton is just as ruthless , if not as adept , in arranging on - message human backdrops .
Clinton ’s stage managers in Iowa flanked her with the experience - heavy faces of her husband ; his former secretary of state , Madeleine Albright ; and retired Gen. Wesley Clark .
But defeat in Iowa got them cut out of the picture in New Hampshire in favor of teenage girls .
Now Clinton appears most often alone on stage .
For his part , John McCain is customarily surrounded on stage by members of the Republican establishment , which shot down his 2000 campaign .
Other photo mates tend to be veterans and national security figures , put there to recall McCain ’s status as an authentic war hero and his promises to keep America safe .
[ emphasis added ]
If I could attend a political rally of a presidential candidate ( assuming I could get in ; some candidates only permit true believers to attend ) , and if I could get my video camera in , and if some security guy did n’t snatch it away , I ’d pan the crowd while the candidate spoke .
I ’d try to show everything CNN et al. did not show .
Hey â€ “ is n’t that what YouTube is for ?
To show the rest of the story ?
To show the artificial messaging inherent in politics ?
Presidential candidates are being sold to us through branding and messaging .
We should be aware of the techniques they use and the degree to which the press is co-opted by candidates ’ marketing ploys .
LOS ANGELES --
The newest sensation at the center of Hollywood 's fashion scene is n't a famous designer or starlet .
It 's a 56 - year - old homeless man who spends his days dancing on roller skates .
John Wesley Jermyn has been a fixture in West Los Angeles for more than 20 years .
Nicknamed " The Crazy Robertson " and " The Robertson Dancer , " he is a constant presence on a stretch of Robertson Boulevard that has become the city 's trendiest shopping corridor and a prime strolling spot for tourists and movie stars .
Among locals and online , there 's much speculation about Mr. Jermyn's personal history , including one oft - repeated rumor that he 's a secretive millionaire .
In a plot twist worthy of Tinseltown , Mr. Jermyn now has a clothing label named after him .
Since it was introduced last month , " The Crazy Robertson " brand of T - shirts and sweatshirts , created by a trio of 23 - year - olds , has flown off the shelves at Kitson , a haunt of tabloid stars like Paris Hilton .
The clothes feature stylized images of Mr. Jermyn , including one design -- available on a $ 98 hoodie -- that has a graphic of him dancing and the phrase " No Money , No Problems " on the back .
At the largest of Kitson 's three boutiques on Robertson , shirts bearing Mr. Jermyn's likeness are sold alongside $ 290 " Victoria Beckham " jeans and $ 50 baby shoes designed by pop star Gwen Stefani .
The label 's owners , who grew up in Beverly Hills , have created a MySpace page for Mr. Jermyn .
It doubles as an ad for the clothing brand and their nightclub - promotion venture , which is also named " The Crazy Robertson . "
The young entrepreneurs spent months trying to forge a relationship with Mr. Jermyn -- who now goes by the name John Jermien -- before gaining his approval .
They have consulted him on design decisions and had a photographer shoot him for publicity images .
In May , Mr. Jermyn agreed to a deal that entitles him to 5 % of " net profit " from clothing sales , according to a copy of the contract seen by The Wall Street Journal .
He signed the contract , without speaking to an attorney or family members .
But so far he has refused to accept much cash , preferring to be paid in food , liquor and paper for his art projects , according to Teddy Hirsh , one of the label 's founders .
" He tries not to involve money in his daily life , " says Mr. Hirsh , who says he is Mr. Jermyn's agent and manager for future endeavors .
While Yahoo formulates a defense against Microsoft 's hostile $ 44.6 billion bid , Google is showing much love and support to Yahoo – a company it generally regards as a competitor .
Google 's turnabout suggests the seriousness of the threat Microsoft poses , and may give the lie to Google 's claims that a Microsoft - Yahoo combination would be anticompetitive .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt has reportedly been on the horn with Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang , trying to iron out some sort of deal under which Yahoo will outsource its search business to Google .
In the meantime , Google 's chief legal officer David Drummond is blogging about the threat a merged Microsoft - Yahoo would pose to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
" There are lots of levels of irony here , " says Joseph Turow , a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at University of
Pennsylvania .
Google 's interest is hardly altruistic – it's more likely a form of retaliation against Microsoft for raising objections to its acquisition of DoubleClick .
The bickering between Microsoft and Google has gotten ugly , culminating with Drummond 's characterization of Microsoft 's business practices as " inappropriate and illegal . "
( And if you 're keeping count , Drummond used the word " openness " three times in his blog post , while Microsoft used the word once in its response . )
" The key thing to look at in antitrust matters is to see who is complaining , " says Stan Leibowitz , an economics professor at the University of Texas at Dallas .
" If consumers are complaining , there 's a good chance [ that the deal ] will reduce competition .
And if the so - called competitors are complaining , chances are good that [ the deal ] will increase competition .
The fact that Google 's against [ Microsoft , ] and it's the market leader , it would indicate , almost by its action , that the market 's going to be more competitive . "
Assuming the transaction increases competition in the marketplace , the chances that regulators will interfere with the deal are slim .
Still , Liebowitz does n't rule out a good fight from European regulators .
" The European regulators do n't like Microsoft very much , " says Liebowitz .
" It 's hard for regulators to stop a merger , but I suspect they 'll give it a serious go over there . "

An interesting question regarding the Obama campaign has risen and in fact , Mark of Publius Endures and I discuss it a little bit in the comments to this post here .
In short , there are two Obamas , and the question he and his campaign face right now is which one is best suited to win the White House ?
Obama first became a super star within the party when he delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention .
His words easily overshadowed those of the nominee that year , John Kerry , and one could make an argument that he also outshone Bill Clinton who delivered a powerful speech in his own right .
But that was all that we really saw of Obama on the national stage prior to his announcement that he would be running for President of the United States .
What is curious now is that in the beginning of his campaign , Obama was criticized for being too professorial , and not emotional enough .
There are accounts of Obama rambling off into a kind of academic , wonkish drone as the townhall crowds around him kind of went into auto pilot .
For West Wing fans , think Martin Sheen in the flashback scene in Nashua where he tells the farmer he got screwed on milk .
The point is , what I suspect happened in the beginning is that people were expecting to see the 2004 keynote speaker , that guy who could tear the roof off of a building with his words but instead what they got was , well , this guy who was kind of a geek .
Somewhere along the line , the Obama camp shifted a little , and Obama started giving the people what they wanted .
He started delivering the big speeches and drawing the huge crowds .
He did that which seems to come so naturally to him in inspiring scores of people , and I have to agree with Mark , it worked .
It was the inspirational Obama , not the professorial Obama , that energized the young vote , that packed venues to overflowing , and ultimately led Obama to carve out his first real lead in the race for the Democratic nomination .
But of course , this opened him up to what has become essentially the only attack that anyone seems fit to launch at him now ; that he ’s all style and no substance .
As you all know , the style vs. substance argument is one that sets my nerves on edge , primarily because the argument itself rarely has any kind of substance to it .
It is possible to have a candidate that knows how to work a crowd but ca n’t tell his head from his ass , but for the most part when the old s vs. s line is dropped , it can usually translate to , “ It ’s not fair the other candidate is better at talking then me ! ”
Now , for anyone willing to spend a little time doing research , and as I ’ve maintained throughout this nomination race , Barack has plenty of substance to him .
On the night of the Potomac Primary , an NPR analyst was refuting the idea that Obama had no substance when he mentioned that here ’s a guy who has over three hundred policy point papers out there , 50 hours of substantive footage from debates , over a hundred public policy speeches , and a plethora of other resources that show where he stands on the issues and what his proposals are .
To add on to that , you can run through his website to get a good grasp on his platform , or you can read the 64 page book that goes into even further detail ( pdf ) .
My point is not to defend that he has substance , though .
That is merely a necessity to frame what is ultimately the question .
There is the rousing public speaker Obama that got him where he is , and then there ’s the policy wonk , constitutional professor that fails to inspire crowds , but has all the substance to counteract the attacks of Hillary and McCain when they say he has none .
Which one should he choose to continue the race ?
We already know that he has retooled his speeches to be more policy based in Wisconsin , and I saw a little bit of it here in Virginia at the Virginia Beach rally .
On one hand , Mark could be right , going back to the more policy based campaign for Obama could be the equivalent of playing prevent defense , and as John Maddon will tell you , “ The only thing prevent defense does is prevent you from winning ball games ” .
In this frame of mind , one would have to think that Obama ’s best bet is to keep on keepin ’ on .
Keep on packing the arenas and do n’t stop to worry about the style versus substance attacks or the accusations that he ’s some creepy cult leader .
On the other hand , I am of the mind that no direct attacks should go unanswered .
This was the fatal flaw in the 2004 Kerry campaign in that they seemed so afraid of getting in the mud that they would n’t even defend themselves , and the mud eventually began to stick .
At some point , Obama ’s going to have to find a way to address the charges that he ’s all talk without necessarily toning down the level of his rhetoric , after all , that is what brought him to the dance .
If he can manage to keep up the hope and change themes and show off his wonky side at the same time , he will effectively neutralize the number one weapon used against him , and then his opponents , both Hillary and McCain will have to answer the question that has so many pols stacked up against Obama worried in the first place .
What ’s wrong with inspiration and hope and change ?
How can you attack and put yourself on the opposite side of such things ?
That ’s a battle no right thinking strategist wants to be on the wrong side of .

Lilly Ledbetter got her 15 minutes of fame , but a little press wo n’t cover the mortgage .
The 59 - year - old mother of two had spent 19 years working at the Goodyear tire factory in Gadsden , Alabama , as one of the few women in a supervisory position .
In 1998 , after learning she ’d been getting paid far less than men doing similar jobs , she sued Goodyear under the 1964 Civil Rights Act , alleging gender discrimination in the performance evaluations that had resulted in her lower pay .
Five years later , with the backing of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , Ledbetter won a $ 3.8 million jury verdict against the company .
But Goodyear appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , which ruled against Ledbetter last June .
The court ’s conservative faction concluded that Ledbetter was obliged to sue within 180 days of receiving her first discriminatory paycheck , and was therefore out of luck .
The 5 - 4 decision reversed decades of established law in most states .
The EEOC had long held that each discriminatory paycheck resets the clock on the statute of limitations , so that workers could sue from the time they learned of the pay disparity , not from the date the disparity began .
That makes sense :
Most people do n’t know what their colleagues are paid , and many companies actively forbid workers from discussing their salaries on the job .
Ledbetter only learned how badly she was underpaid after someone put an anonymous note in her mailbox listing the salaries of some of the factory ’s male supervisors — by that time , she ’d been getting smaller paychecks for years .
The Supreme Court ruling effectively prevents anyone from suing under federal equal - pay laws , and creates a perverse incentive :
So long as an employer manages to keep an employee ’s discriminatory compensation under wraps for six months , he or she is then free to continue discriminating against the worker without fear of lawsuits .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was so outraged by the majority decision that she read her scathing dissent from the bench .
“ In our view , the court does not comprehend , or is indifferent to , the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination , ” she said , and urged Congress to “ correct this parsimonious reading ” of the civil rights law .
Overnight , Ledbetter became a cause célèbre as an angry public responded to the decision .
Hillary Clinton has invoked Ledbetter routinely on the campaign trail , and members of Congress from both parties jumped to introduce legislation to overturn the ruling .
The House worked fast , and passed a bill restoring the old rules for equal pay suits within a matter of weeks .
Action in the Senate has been a different story .
Despite bipartisan sponsors on the bill , senators did n’t even get around to holding a hearing until late last month , and the legislation now appears stalled in the face of stiff opposition from business groups thrilled by the Supreme Court decision .
These groups claim that the proposed law would bring a flood of new lawsuits related to decades - old facts , and burden companies with expensive record - keeping requirements and other paperwork hassles .
After the January hearing , Wyoming senator Mike Enzi , the ranking Republican on the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee , called the Fair Pay Restoration Act “ unfair and unreasonable ” and said the bill would do nothing but “ keep America ’s trial lawyers and employment bar busy . ”
Jocelyn Samuels , the vice president for education and employment at the National Women ’s Law Center , says such arguments are misguided , and points out that employers lived under the old rules for a long time without enduring a barrage of discrimination claims .
“ Prior experience suggests this is a reasonable rule to apply , ” she says .
Groups lobbying for the bill seem to think the senators will come around .
“ We ’re optimistic that they ’re going to mark it up and send it to the floor in the next few weeks , ” says Jocelyn Frye , general counsel for the National Partnership for Women and Families .
In fact , as Lilly Ledbetter fades from the public memory , the bill she inspired is languishing .
Supporters acknowledge that there is no current plan to get it out of committee , despite strong support from committee chair Ted Kennedy .
President Bush , meanwhile , has threatened to veto the bill if it reaches his desk .
The Senate ’s failure to take on the judiciary has implications beyond workplace gender discrimination .
In Ledbetter v. Goodyear , the top court ’s conservatives ignored the original intent of the Civil Rights Act.
According to Simon Lazarus , public - policy counsel to the National Senior Citizens Law Center , this court has similarly defied congressional intent on everything from litigation against the companies that helped Enron defraud its shareholders to cases involving mandatory binding arbitration , and lawmakers have done nothing about it .
The Ledbetter case , he adds , is hardly the first time a far - right Supreme Court has tried to gut American civil rights laws — justices made similar attempts under the late chief justice William Rehnquist in the late 1980s , but Congress responded in 1991 with new legislation to overturn the changes .
In Lazarus ’ view , the apparent unwillingness of today ’s Congress to check judicial power will only embolden the Supreme Court to behave even more radically .
The justices , he says , “ get away with it with impunity right now because Congress is not just sclerotic but structurally unable to act . ”
A recurrent group of Moroccan fraudsters calling themselves Mr-Brain has launched a website dedicated to offering easy - to - use phishing site code , email templates and other hacking tools .
The website offers phishing kits for many of the most common targets , such as Bank of America , eBay , PayPal and HSBC .
The tools and code provided by Mr-Brain are designed to make it extremely easy for other fraudsters to deploy realistic phishing sites .
Only a very basic knowledge of programming is required to configure the PHP scripts to send victims ' details to the fraudsters ' chosen electronic mail address .
Deploying one of these fully working kits can be done in as little as one minute – another factor that adds to their appeal .
Tricking the Fraudsters
Mr-Brain 's intentions are to encourage as many people as possible to use their phishing kits , for all is not what it seems at first glance .
Careful inspection of the configuration script reveals deceptive code that hides the true set of electronic mail addresses that are contacted by the kit – every fraudster who uses these kits will unwittingly send a copy of each victim 's details back to the Mr-Brain group .
The configuration script exploits the case - sensitivity in PHP variable names to disguise Mr-Brain ’s electronic mail address as an unrelated but seemingly essential part of the script , encouraging fraudsters not to alter it .
The injected electronic mail address is actually contained in a completely separate PHP file , where it is encrypted in a hidden input field named " niarB " , or " Brain " backwards .
Yet another PHP script reads the value from this input field and decrypts it before supplying it to the configuration script .
Most fraudsters are unlikely to notice this level of obfuscation and will assume the script is working normally , as they will also receive a copy of any emails produced by the script .
When Netcraft decrypted the contents , the hidden input field revealed one of Mr-Brain 's Gmail addresses , which is used to covertly capture details from all of the phishing kits that have been deployed on their behalf by other fraudsters .
A comment at the top of one of the scripts aims to deter these fraudsters from examining the script that decrypts the hidden field :
Earlier this month , Netcraft also exposed a similar phishing scam targeting Bank of America .
This , too , was authored by Mr-Brain and was configured to covertly send harvested credentials to a different Gmail address .
Each phishing kit listed on their website is accompanied by a description , showing what kind of information it steals from victims .
One page on their website lists a selection of Social Security numbers , credit card numbers and PINs under the heading " Free and Freash [ sic ] Credit Card " .
Mr-Brain claims that all of the scam pages offered on its site are undetected by Mozilla , Opera and Internet Explorer .
Netcraft blocks these sites when they are detected by the Netcraft Toolbar community , and propagates the block to all companies which licence the Netcraft Phishing Site Feed .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
If anyone knows how to operate within the law , it 's a police officer .
So those who gathered outside the Palace of Westminster knew not to shout or wave placards .
Nor is what they are doing a protest in the usual sense - it's a queue to lobby their MPs , all wearing white baseball caps emblazoned with the slogan saying " Fair p( l ) ay for police " .
THE ANSWER
It 's not a protest but a " mass queue " Protesters cannot hold placards , banners or use loudhailers Police used same tactic in 2002 , copied by other groups since the law banned unauthorised protests
A Police Federation spokeswoman hoped there would be as many as 10,000 queuing for the " bobby lobby " , although as it turned out there were barely hundreds .
" We 're policemen and we have to work within the law and we 're happy to do that .
We 're just doing what we did six years ago in 2002 and it worked well then . "
Back then they did it because it was a dignified way of getting their point across .
This time , with their march on Parliament outlawed , it had greater meaning .
The march was re-routed to avoid Westminster , and in the afternoon , members unable to squeeze into the rally in Central Hall instead formed a line outside the St Stephen 's entrance to Parliament to lobby their MPs .
The point , protesters have told the BBC , is to make a highly visible statement .
Thin blue line
So do scores of officers wearing baseball caps and T - shirts making a point constitute a " protest " ?
Is this a protest ?
What is certain is that it 's a tactic that others have tried before , such as the Stop the War coalition last October .
" We did have banners and it was n't really a queue , it turned more into a demonstration but we had discussed just marching to Whitehall and then having a queue but the police would not agree to it , " says Chris Nineham .
" This is a loophole and I 'm pleased the police have become another group that is making its point through one means or another . "
Jeremy Corbyn MP , who strongly opposes protests being banned , says : " It 's [ lobby queuing ] a partly - effective tactic but the real issue is that we should n't have to accommodate this particular law .
We should be allowed to participate in democracy inside and outside Parliament . "
Brian
Haw has overcome the ban on unauthorised protests , exempted by the High Court after successfully arguing that his one - man protest , which has been going on for seven years , pre-dates the legislation .
But others have been prosecuted , including Mark Barrett , who organised tea parties in Parliament Square in protest at the law change and was fined £ 250 .

6 Made - up memories
TAKE a moment to observe the world around you .
Scan the horizon with your eyes .
Tilt your head back and listen .
You 're probably getting the impression that your senses are doing a fine job of capturing everything that is going on .
Yet that is all it is : an impression .
Despite the fact that your visual system seems to provide you with a continuous widescreen movie , most of the time it is only gathering information from a tiny patch of the visual field .
The rest of the time it is n't even doing that .
Somehow from this sporadic input it conjures up a seamless visual experience .
What is going on ?
Bang in the middle of your retina is a small patch of densely crowded photoreceptors called the fovea .
This is the retina 's sweet spot , the only part of the eye capable of seeing with the rich detail and full colour we take for granted .
This tiny spot - which covers an area of our visual field no bigger than the moon in the sky - feeds your visual system almost all of its raw information .
To build up a big picture , your eyes constantly dart about , fixating for a fraction of a second and then moving on .
These jerky movements between fixations are called saccades , and we make about three per second , each lasting between 20 and 200 microseconds .
The curious thing about saccades is that while they are happening we are effectively blind .
The brain does n't bother to process information picked up during a saccade because the eyes move too rapidly to capture anything useful .
All in all , your visual system works like a man blundering around in the dark waving around a flickering torch with a very narrow beam .
Despite the fact that you do n't normally notice saccades , you can catch them in action .
Look at your eyes close - up in the mirror and flick your focus back and forth from one pupil to another .
However hard you try you cannot see your eyes move - even though somebody watching you can .
That 's because the motion is a saccade , and your brain is n't paying attention .
Now pick two spots in the corners of your visual field and flick your gaze from one to the other and back again .
If you 're lucky you 'll notice , just barely , a brief flash of darkness .
This is your visual cortex clocking off .
So how does your brain weave such fragmentary information into a seamless movie ?
This remains something of a mystery .
The best explanation , according to Andrew Hollingworth of the University of Iowa in Iowa City , is that your short - term and long - term visual memories retain information from previous fixations and integrate them into a here - and - now visual experience ( Visual Cognition , vol 14 , p 781 ) .
There is also some guesswork going on .
You can get a feel for this from the frozen - time illusion - the sensation that you sometimes get when you look at a clock and the second hand appears to freeze momentarily before tick - tocking back into action .
This happens because of saccades .
To compensate for the temporary shut - down of vision , your brain makes a guess at what it would have seen , but it does so retrospectively .
So the 100 or so milliseconds of blindness gets back - filled with the image that appears after the saccade is over .
If your eyes happen to alight on the clock just after the second hand has moved , your brain assumes that the hand was in that location for the duration of the saccade too .
The " second " then lasts about 10 per cent longer than normal , which is enough for you to notice .
The weirdness is n't confined to vision .
Your auditory system is also full of gaps and glitches that the brain cleans up so we can make sense of the world .
This is especially true of speech .
In everyday life we encounter lots of situations that obscure or distort people 's voices , yet most of the time we understand effortlessly .
This is because our brain pastes in the missing sounds , a phenomenon called phonemic restoration .
It is so effective that it is sometimes hard to tell that the missing sounds are not there .
A good demonstration of this effect was published last year by Makio Kashino of NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Atsugi , Japan .
He recorded a voice saying " Do you understand what I 'm trying to say ? " then removed short chunks and replaced them with silence .
This made the sentence virtually unintelligible .
But when he filled the gaps with loud white noise , the sentence miraculously becomes understandable ( Acoustic Science and Technology , vol 27 , p 318 ) .
" The sounds we hear are not copies of physical sounds , " Kashino says .
" The brain fills in the gaps , based on the information in the remaining speech signal . "
The effect is so powerful that you can even record a sentence , chop it into 50 - millisecond slices , reverse every single slice and play it back - and it is perfectly intelligible .
You can listen to Kashino 's sound files [ HERE ] .
Another demonstration of the brain 's ability to extract meaning from distorted signals is a form of synthesised speech called sine - wave speech .
When you first hear a sentence in sine - wave speech it sounds alien and unintelligible , somewhat reminiscent of whistling or birdsong .
But if you listen to the same sentence in normal speech and then return to the sine - wave version , it suddenly snaps into auditory focus .
Try as you might , you cannot " unhear " the words that you did n't even realise were words the first time you heard them ( listen to demos [ HERE ] and [ HERE ] ) .
According to Matt Davis of the UK Medical Research Council 's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge , this happens because the brain has circuits that respond to speech , but does n't switch them on unless it detects spoken language ( Hearing Research , vol 229 , p 132 ) .
Sine - wave speech is n't speech - like enough to trigger the circuits , but once you know it is speech they spring into action .
" It 's an example of top - down influence , " says Davis .
" What you know about what you 're hearing changes the way you hear it .
" Given the tricks that your visual and auditory systems play , it probably comes as no surprise that when they get together , fights can break out .
A good demonstration of this is the McGurk effect , in which listening to a series of identical syllables such as " ba ba ba ba " while watching somebody mouth " ba da la va " makes you hear " ba da la va " .
Try it for yourself Until recently , psychologists believed that the visual system always trumps the other senses , but in 2000 a team of psychologists at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena proved that this is n't the case .
They showed volunteers a single flash on a computer screen .
If they accompanied the flash with two very short beeps , the volunteers saw two flashes - in other words , this time the auditory system wins ( Nature , vol 408 , p 788 ) .
See the illusion [ HERE ] .
YOU may know the crossed - hands illusion .
Hold your arms out in front of you and cross them over , rotate your hands so your palms face each other , then mesh your fingers together .
Now slowly rotate your hands up between your arms so you 're staring at your knuckles .
Ask someone to point to one of your index fingers , then attempt to move it .
Did you move the wrong one ?
If so , you 've just experienced a minor failure of your body schema - your mental representation of the location , position and boundaries of your body .
Your brain builds this up by drawing on data from vision , touch and a body - wide network of proprioceptive sensors that monitor position .
Your body schema is a critical part of self - awareness , which is why it feels so odd when it goes wrong .
In the crossed - hands illusion , the schema fails because of a confusing visual input .
You do n't normally see your hands in this convoluted position ; the finger you move is the one that is pointing in the direction that the correct one would be pointing if you had simply clasped your hands as if in prayer .
An even odder way of disturbing your body schema is an illusion that taps straight into your sense of body ownership .
Known as the rubber - hand illusion , it fools you into thinking a rubber hand - or even a piece of wood , or a table - is part of your body .
To experience the illusion , get hold of a model hand ( it does n't have to be very realistic ) and put it on the table in front of you .
If it is a left hand , put your actual left hand somewhere you can't see it , in the same pose as the rubber hand .
Now get someone to touch and stroke your unseen hand and the rubber hand with identical movements .
If you concentrate on the rubber hand , you will probably get the uncanny feeling that it is your own .
What this illusion shows is that your sense of body ownership is less anchored in reality than you think .
Your brain will happily override information from proprioception to conjure up an incorrect yet coherent body schema based on vision and touch .
In fact , your mental body map is an absolute sucker for visual information .
This year Frank Durgin of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania set up the illusion as described above but instead of touching the rubber hand he merely " stroked " it with light from a laser pointer , leaving the unseen hand alone .
Two - thirds of 220 subjects reported a sense of ownership of the rubber hand and said they had the sensation of heat and even touch from the laser pointer ( Psychological Science , vol 18 , p 152 ) .
" It 's obvious the hand is rubber - no one is fooled at all , " says Durgin .
" But if your brain decides it 's your hand , all the conscious awareness in the world wo n't change it .
"
If you can't get hold of a fake hand , there are other ( though less reliable ) ways to experience the illusion .
Some people can be fooled into believing a piece of wood has replaced their hand .
Around half of people can even be made to feel a table top is part of their body .
Sit at a table and put your hand out of sight underneath .
Get someone to tap and stroke this hand while doing exactly the same to the table top directly above .
If you watch the table top , you may experience the illusion that the table has become part of your body .
Proprioception may be the junior partner to vision and touch in creating your body schema , but it still plays a key role .
You can demonstrate this with an illusion that taps into proprioception alone .
This Pinocchio illusion is hard to do without a specialist piece of equipment called a physiotherapy vibrator , but if you can get hold of one , try this .
Close your eyes , touch the tip of your nose and then get somebody to apply the vibrator at about 100 hertz to skin at the very top of your bicep .
This creates the strong sensation that you are straightening your elbow , and that your nose is simultaneously growing longer and longer , like Pinocchio's .
Vibrating the skin above a tendon excites stretch receptors in the muscle , creating a powerful sensation that the muscle is stretching and the joint is extending .
This confuses your proprioceptors , which revise your body schema accordingly .
The result is rather like having a phantom limb : the sensed position of your arm in space does n't correspond to its actual position .
If you 're touching your nose at the same time , this leads to a weird sensation that it is growing .
Your brain integrates the touch sensation from your fingers with the " movement " of your arm and comes to the erroneous conclusion that your nose must be growing to fill the gap .
The Pinocchio illusion is an important tool for understanding how the brain calculates the size and shape of our bodies .
This is n't just an academic question .
When it goes wrong , such as in body dysmorphic disorder , anorexia and phantom limb , the results can be devastating ( PLoS Biology , vol 3 , p e412 ) .
WOULD you consider yourself to be logical and analytical or creative and empathic ?
According to popular psychology you 're one or the other , and it's all down to which half of your brain you use the most : the rational and calculating left or the intuitive , artistic right .
It 's a myth , of course , but like all good ones it contains a grain of truth .
Your cerebral cortex - the outer layer of your brain that deals with higher functions - is indeed split into two halves .
They are connected by a flat bundle of nerve fibres called the corpus callosum , but work in subtly different ways - and these differences occasionally flicker into your conscious awareness .
The left - brain / right - brain myth arose from experiments done in the early 1970s on people who had had their corpus callosum cut as a last - ditch treatment for epilepsy .
These " split - brain " patients showed some strikingly odd responses to information that was preferentially sent to one side of the brain or the other by presenting it to the extreme left or right of their visual field .
This works because the right visual field is monitored by the right eye , which routes straight into the left brain , and vice versa .
For example , when a word or picture is presented to their right brain , split - brain patients are often unable to read or recognise it .
This and similar experiments led to the idea that the left side of the brain deals with logic and facts while the right side is more intuitive and interpretive .
We now know that this dichotomy is too simplistic , but its essence holds true .
The latest view is that the two hemispheres have subtly different styles of information processing : the left has a bias towards detail , the right a more holistic outlook .
You can watch a video of a split - brain experiment at YOUTUBE Most people , of course , have a functional corpus callosum that shunts information between the hemispheres .
Even so , subtle left - right differences exist .
One task where the hemispheres operate differently is face recognition .
When most of us see a face , our right cerebral hemisphere does the lion 's share of the work recognising its gender and decoding its expression .
And because the right hemisphere is fed by the left visual field , that means we have a notable left - sided bias in our judgement of faces .
Look at this pair of faces ( left ) .
Which appears happier ?
Chances are you chose the bottom one .
The two faces are , however , identical apart from being mirror images of one another .
The picture is called a chimeric face and is made by taking two pictures of the same face , one with a neutral expression and the other smiling , chopping the pictures in half and joining the two mismatched pieces .
Our general bias towards the left side of the face ( as we look at it ) makes us see the faces as different even though they are essentially equivalent .
It is n't just visual processing that is lateralised .
There is some evidence that emotion is too , with the right side of the brain more specialised for negative emotions and the left for positive ones .
Amazingly , simply activating one or other hemisphere by moving parts of your body can noticeably change your emotional state .
You can experience this by repeating an experiment first done in 1989 by Bernard Schiff and Mary Lamon of the University of Toronto in Canada ( Neuropsychologia , vol 27 , p 923 ) .
They asked 12 volunteers to perform a " half smile " , lifting one corner of their mouths and holding it for a minute .
Left - smilers reported feeling sadder afterwards , while right - smilers felt more positive .
Other researchers have reproduced the effect simply by getting people to contract the muscles of their left or right hand a few times .
More recent research has suggested that motivation is similarly affected : people who performed right - sided muscle contractions became more assertive and spent longer trying to crack an impossible maths puzzle .
Unsurprisingly , these claims are controversial , with some teams failing to replicate the results .
Last year , however , Eddie Harmon - Jones of Texas A&M University in College Station used EEG to confirm that flexing the hand muscles produces changes in emotion , but only when it is preceded by activation of the opposite cortex ( Psychophysiology , vol 43 , p 598 ) .
The left - brain / right - brain legend , it appears , is alive and well .
IT WAS a ground - breaking investigation into the nature of consciousness and free will .
In 1983 , psychologist Benjamin Libet of the University of California , San Francisco , hooked five volunteers up to an EEG machine and asked them to make voluntary movements , such as lifting a finger , whenever they felt like it .
Watching the electrical activity in their brains , he discovered that his subjects only became consciously aware of their intention to act a few hundred milliseconds after their brain had initiated the movement .
Libet was forced to conclude that what feels like a conscious decision may in fact be nothing of the sort ( Brain , vol 106 , p 623 ) .
This experiment was the first demonstration of what is now an established theory in neuroscience : a major proportion of your thoughts and actions - even things you believe you are in conscious control of - actually take place in your unconscious .
Most of the time you are essentially flying on autopilot .
Libet 's experiment involved equipment that you 're unlikely to have at home , but you can tap into a similar phenomenon using what is known as the " ideomotor effect " .
Make a pendulum out of a paper clip and a piece of thread and dangle it over a cross drawn on a piece of paper .
Ask yourself a simple yes / no question , such as " am I at home ? " or " do I have a cat ? " , and tell yourself that if the pendulum swings clockwise , the answer is yes , while anticlockwise means no .
Spookily , the pendulum will generally start rotating in the direction of the correct answer .
It looks supernatural , but it 's not .
The reason it works is that , as soon as you ask the question , your unconscious brain fires up motor preparation circuits in anticipation of the answer it expects to see .
These circuits initiate subtle muscle movements that you are not normally aware of - except when they are amplified by a pendulum ( or dowsing stick or Ouija board ) .
This is your unconscious brain in action .
A different aspect of your mental underworld is reflected in your " implicit assumptions " .
Your subconscious mind is n't just planning and executing actions , it also spends a great deal of time analysing the world , looking for patterns and relationships that can help you navigate through life .
The conclusions it comes to are called implicit assumptions - subtle prejudices about people and events .
For example , if you hear on the radio that a teenage boy has been shot dead in a car park near his home , it 's almost impossible not to make assumptions about his family background and the area where he lived .
" Everybody has implicit assumptions , " says Brian Nosek , a psychologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville who played a big part in their discovery .
" They 're a necessary part of how the brain operates and they generally serve us very well .
" But not always .
Nosek and colleagues argue that because we are not in control of our implicit assumptions , and are seldom aware of them , it is possible to develop unconscious prejudices that your conscious mind would find unappealing or even abhorrent - such as associating men with science and women with the arts , preferring thin people to fat people or assuming that blonde women are stupid .
" You may think you 're egalitarian , yet your associations are often quite different , " says Nosek .
Nosek and colleagues have devised a way to access these implicit assumptions ( take the test [ HERE ] ) .
The tests are based on the idea that people find it easier to recognise pairs of stimuli that fit their unconscious assumptions - white people and positive words or black people and negative words , for example .
People often find the results of their tests " provocative " , says Nosek .
" The most common implicit associations are race and age - they 're quite profound . " Maybe sometimes it is better to ignore your unconscious mind .
IMAGINE you are walking down the street and a passer - by asks you for directions .
As you talk to him , two workmen rudely barge between you carrying a door .
Then something weird happens : in the brief moment that the passer - by is behind the door , he switches places with one of the workmen .
You are left giving directions to a different person who is taller , wearing different clothes and has a different voice .
Do you think you would notice ?
Of course you would , right ?
Wrong .
When researchers at Harvard University played this trick on 15 unsuspecting people , eight of them failed to spot the change .
What this demonstrates is a phenomenon called " change blindness " .
It happens because of a chronic shortage of a crucial mental resource : attention .
You are blithely unaware of most of what is going on around you , to the point where you can fail to notice " obvious " changes in your surroundings .
Attention is not well understood , but whatever it is , we have a limited amount .
Of all the information entering or being generated by your brain at any one time - sights , sounds , memories , ideas and so on - only a tiny fraction enters your consciousness .
Object - tracking studies suggest that the maximum number of items we can attend to at any one time is around five or six ( see demos [ HERE ] ) .
Scientists studying attention spend a lot of time playing with change blindness because it provides direct access to the attentional system .
In the door experiment , the subjects fail to see the change because their attention is elsewhere and the door conceals what would otherwise be attention - grabbing motion .
You can experience the same thing by watching " flicker images " .
These consist of two consecutive images that differ only in one key feature - two cowboys who swap heads , say .
If the images are flashed up in quick succession with a brief blank screen between them ( which acts like the door ) , most people take an astonishingly long time to spot the difference ( see demos [ HERE ] , or try flicking your attention between the two images in the diagram below ) .
Similarly , we often fail to notice blatant continuity errors when films cut from one scene to another .
We also usually fail to detect gradual changes to a static scene , such as the addition of a large building ( see demos [ HERE ] and [ HERE ] ) .
" Basically , the explanation is that attention is needed to see change , " says psychologist Ronald Rensink of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada .
" Attention is drawn automatically to the motion signals that accompany a change .
But if these are swamped , then the observer can't rely on automatic control , but needs to hunt around with their attention .
" A similar phenomenon is motion - induced blindness , in which concentrating on a moving pattern causes what should be very prominent static objects - such as bright yellow dots - to disappear ( see demos [ HERE ] ) .
Motion - induced blindness was only discovered in 2001 and it is still unclear why it happens , but most researchers think it has something to do with attentional resources .
There is a related and even more counter - intuitive demonstration of our limited capacity for attention .
If you are deliberately concentrating on something , it can render you oblivious to other events that you would normally have no trouble noticing .
This " inattention blindness " is probably the reason why motorists sometimes collide with objects such as pedestrians and buses that they simply " did n't see " .
The most famous demonstration of inattention blindness was staged in 1999 by Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris of the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
It involves a game of basketball .

You wo n't believe your brain .
A FEW years ago , the actor Alan Alda visited a group of memory researchers at the University of California , Irvine , for a TV show he was making .
During a picnic lunch , one of the scientists offered Alda a hard - boiled egg .
He turned it down , explaining that as a child he had made himself sick eating too many eggs .
In fact , this had never happened , yet Alda believed it was real .
How so ?
The egg incident was a false memory planted by one of UC Irvine 's researchers , Elizabeth Loftus .
Before the visit , Loftus had sent Alda a questionnaire about his food preferences and personality .
She later told him that a computer analysis of his answers had revealed some facts about his childhood , including that he once made himself sick eating too many eggs .
There was no such analysis but it was enough to convince Alda .
Your memory may feel like a reliable record of the past , but it is not .
Loftus has spent the past 30 years studying the ease with which we can form " memories " of nonexistent events .
She has convinced countless people that they have seen or done things when they have n't - even quite extreme events such as being attacked by animals or almost drowning .
Her work has revealed much about how our brains form and retain memories .
While we would n't want to plant a memory of a nonexistent childhood trauma in your own brain , there is a less dramatic demonstration of how easy it is to form a false memory called the Deese - Roediger - McDermott paradigm .

Psychologists in Canada have finally proved what women have long suspected – men really are irrational enough to risk entire kingdoms to catch sight of a beautiful face .
Biologists have long known that animals prefer immediate rewards to greater ones in the future .
This process , known as “ discounting the future ” , is found in humans too and is fundamental to many economic models .
Resources have a value to individuals that changes through time .
For example , immediately available cash is generally worth more than the same amount would be in the future .
But greater amounts of money in the future would be worth waiting for under so - called ‘ rational ’ discounting .
But some people , such as drug addicts , show ‘ irrational ’ discounting .
For example , preferring a small amount of heroin today rather than a greater amount in the future .

Margo Wilson and Martin Daly of McMaster University in Hamilton , Canada decided to investigate discounting behaviour and see if it varied with sexual mood .
Male students , when shown pictures of pretty women , were more likely to opt for short - term economic gain than wait for a better reward in the future .
Sexual opportunity
Both male and female students at McMaster University were shown pictures of the opposite sex of varying attractiveness taken from the website ‘ Hot or Not ’ .
The 209 students were then offered the chance to win a reward .
They could either accept a cheque for between $ 15 and $ 35 tomorrow or one for $ 50 - $ 75 at a variable point in the future .
Wilson and Daly found that male students shown the pictures of averagely attractive women showed exponential discounting of the future value of the reward .
This indicated that they had made a rational decision .
When male students were shown pictures of pretty women , they discounted the future value of the reward in an “ irrational ” way – they would opt for the smaller amount of money available the next day rather than wait for a much bigger reward .
Women , by contrast , made equally rational decisions whether they had been shown pictures of handsome men or those of average attractiveness .
“ We have not elucidated the psychological mechanisms mediating our results , ” says Margo Wilson .
“ But we hypothesise that viewing pictures of pretty women was mildly arousing , activating neural mechanisms associated with cues of sexual opportunity . ”
Tommaso Pizzari , an evolutionary biologist at Leeds University , offers another possible explanation : “ If there ’s the prospect of getting a very attractive partner it may pay a man to take more risks than if an average partner was available . ”
He told New Scientist : “ If this is a response to sexual selection then you would expect men who are less attractive to take more risks .
If you have many attractive potential partners then it does not pay to take risks .
If you are less attractive , with few potential partners , then it pays to take risks . ”

How much life insurance do I need ?
That is the same question I asked myself not too long ago triggered by the birth of my son .
Personally , I think the best way to answer this question is to educate yourself by reading articles like this one , use a few online calculators to get a rough idea , and then actually meet 2 - 3 life insurance agents , or financial planners , to flesh out the details .
Here is the process we went through for our own insurance .
Life Insurance Needs Worksheet
To determine how much coverage my wife and I should buy , we completed the Life Insurance Needs Worksheet provided by an insurance agent .
The worksheet examines the four general factors :
Date of Birth —
As we get older , life insurance becomes more expensive , because of ( 1 ) we are more likely to die as we get older , and ( 2 ) there are fewer payments for us to make ( i.e. , in case we buy whole life insurance where we pay the premium until 65 ) .
Gender —
Even if my wife and I are the same age , her premium will always be lower than mine because ( 1 ) women live longer on average than men , and ( 2 ) men have more risk factors .
Health —
There are several health classifications .
When we went through the process the first time with Liberty Mutual , they had classes such as Elite , Premium , Standard , Sub -Standard , etc .
People with the best health profile gets the best rate .
The sales agent felt that my wife and I should be eligible for Elite because we were of average weights for our heights , and our blood pressure and cholesterol levels were normal .
Smoking vs. Non-Smoking .
The worksheet also examines seven specific factors :
Final Expenses Fund —
This is the amount we need immediately to cover final expenses — e.g. , funeral plot , embalming , casket , etc .
He estimated this to be about $ 15,000 per person .
Brip Blap has an excellent piece on preparing for the cost of dying .
Emergency Fund —
This is for unexpected bills and expenses .
I thought it was strange that the emergency fund was included in the worksheet , and the sales agent did , in fact , said to skip and ignore it .
Personally , I believe everyone should have an emergency fund , and it should n’t be part of your death benefits .
Outstanding Debts —
If a spouse dies , the surviving spouse could become responsible for the debts .
If both die , the estate is responsible for paying any unpaid debts .
So this is something we have to factor into the coverage we need .
Mortgage and Rent Payment Fund —
This is the mortgage payoff amount , or an amount sufficient to cover ten years of rent .
Education Fund —
This is meant to cover our son ’s college expenses partially .
The agent recommended $ 100,000 to cover four years of public college , but I believe this amount should be closer to $ 200,000 — however , I did stick with his suggestion for this exercise .
Income Replacement Fund —
This is the extra money to keep the living spouse , or the beneficiaries afloat for a few years — it ’s not meant to be a lifetime income replacement .
The recommended amount is five years of current income .
However , the sales agent said two years is the minimum , and that ’s what he suggested we start off with .
Current Liquid Assets and Life Insurance —
This is the amount of assets that can be readily converted to cash .
For our purpose , the sales agent recommended that we exclude the term life policy from my job and our retirement savings , e.g. , 401( k ) and IRA accounts .
Factors Amount Final Expenses Fund $ 15,000 Emergency Fund $ 25,000 Outstanding Debts $ 12,000 Mortgage and Rent Payments Funds $ 188,000 Education Fund $ 200,000 Income Replacement Fund $ 250,000 Current Liquid Assets and Life Insurance $ 310,000 Total Coverage $ 380,000
Once we completed the worksheet , it was a simple addition of # 1 through # 6 and subtract item # 7 .
It turned out that I should buy $ 380,000 to cover my wife and our son , and she should buy $ 290,000 to cover our son and me .
Life Insurance Calculator
That was ten years ago .
Now you can search the net and find a calculator like this one at Life Happens .
For example , this calculator also goes through a similar process and ask a few questions to help you determine how much life insurance you need .
This one is a relatively simple 5 - step process .
Although this type of calculator makes it convenient to estimate your needs , I personally feel that it is definitely worthwhile to meet 2 - 3 insurance agents and go through the process in person .
This way , you can also hear what they recommend and why .
Options and Premiums
After we determined the coverage amount , we explored the following options for term life insurance and the associated monthly premium .
Description My Policy
$ 380,000 Her Policy
$ 290,000 20 years term , elite $ 30.69 $ 20.58 20 years term , preferred $ 37.53 $ 22.93 30 years term , elite $ 47.45 $ 28.94 30 years term , preferred $ 61.81 $ 33.63
He also recommended that we look at whole life policy as a supplement to the term life policy .
However , he suggested a smaller amount like $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 to supplement our term life policy .
I appreciated that he openly said buying any more than that in whole life is just a waste of money .
Here are the options :
Description My Policy Her Policy $ 50,000 whole life – pay to 65 , standard
( there ’s no elite option ) $ 65.16 $ 41.27 $ 100,000 whole life – pay to 65 , elite
( minimum coverage to qualify for the elite ) $ 115.00 $ 67.95
Interesting Points
Our conversation brought up a few interesting points , not all of which we have the answer to .
When I mentioned life insurance through work , the sales agent made a good point which I agreed with : the policy ends when I lose my job — and life insurance is something I do n’t want to be without .
— and life insurance is something I do n’t want to be without .
The sales agent mentioned that , on average , Americans buy seven life insurance products through their lifetime to supplement , or replace an existing one .
Life insurance payout is tax - free to beneficiaries .
This means that you ’ll need less coverage to replace lost income .
For instance , if you want to replace $ 100,0000 , you ’ll probably need only $ 80,000 .
Here ’s a helpful marginal tax rate calculator .
If we ca n’t qualify for the elite , the sales agent suggested waiting a few weeks to get our health stats in order .
As you can see , it ’s worth the wait for the differences in saving .
Bottom Line
I certainly think it is useful to understand the important components to consider when determining how much life insurance you need to have .
Online calculators make it much easier to figure out the amount , or at least put you in the right ballpark .
Overall , the best bet is to talk to a professional .
The key is the find the right agent or planner with a fiduciary duty to help you figure out the correct amount and the right kind of policy ( or policies ) for your needs .

When you have to visit a public restroom , you usually find a line of women , so you smile politely and take your place .
Once it 's your turn , you check for feet under the stall doors .
Every stall is occupied .
Finally , a door opens and you dash in , nearly knocking down the woman leaving the stall .
You get in to find the door wo n't latch .
It does n't matter , the wait has been so long you are about to wet your pants !
The dispenser for the modern " seat covers " ( invented by someone 's Mom , no doubt ) is handy , but empty .
You would hang your purse on the door hook , if there was one , but there is n't - so you carefully , but quickly drape it around your neck , ( Mom would turn over in her grave if you put it on the FLOOR ! ) , yank down your pants , and assume " The Stance " .
In this position your aging , toneless thigh muscles begin to shake .
You 'd love to sit down , but you certainly had n't taken time to wipe the seat or lay toilet paper on it , so you hold " The Stance " .
To take your mind off your trembling thighs , you reach for what you discover to be the empty toilet paper dispenser .
In your mind , you can hear your mother 's voice saying , " Honey , if you had tried to clean the seat , you would have KNOWN there was no toilet paper ! "
Your thighs shake more .
You remember the tiny tissue that you blew your nose on yesterday - the one that 's still in your purse .
( Oh yeah , the purse around your neck , that now , you have to hold up trying not to strangle yourself at the same time ) .
That would have to do .
You crumple it in the puffiest way possible .
It 's smaller than your thumbnail .
Someone pushes your door open because the latch does n't work .
The door hits your purse , which is hanging around your neck in front of your chest , and you and your purse topple backwards against the tank of the toilet .
" Occupied ! " you scream , as you reach for the door , dropping your precious , tiny , crumpled tissue in a puddle on the floor , lost your footing altogether , and slide down directly onto the TOILET SEAT .
It is wet of course .
You bolt up , knowing all too well that it 's too late .
Your bare bottom has made contact with every imaginable germ and life form on the uncovered seat because YOU never laid down toilet paper - not that there was any , even if you had taken time to try .
You know that your mother would be utterly appalled if she knew , because , you 're certain her bare bottom never touched a public toilet seat because , frankly , dear , " You just do n't KNOW what kind of diseases you could get .
" By this time , the automatic sensor on the back of the toilet is so confused that it flushes , propelling a stream of water like a fire hose against the inside of the bowl that sprays a fine mist of water that covers your butt and runs down your legs and into your shoes .
The flush somehow sucks everything down with such force that you grab onto the empty toilet paper dispenser for fear of being dragged in too .
At this point , you give up .
You 're soaked by the spewing water and the wet toilet seat .
You 're exhausted .
You try to wipe with a gum wrapper you found in your pocket and then slink out inconspicuously to the sinks .
You can't figure out how to operate the faucets with the automatic sensors , so you wipe your hands with spit and a dry paper towel and walk past the line of women still waiting .
You are no longer able to smile politely to them .
A kind soul at the very end of the line points out a piece of toilet papet trailing from your shoe .
( Where was that when you NEEDED it ? ? )
You yank the paper from your shoe , plunk it in the woman 's hand and tell her warmly , " Here , you just might need this .
" As you exit , you spot your hubby , who has long since entered , used , and left the men 's restroom .
Annoyed , he asks , " What took you so long , and why is your purse hanging around your neck ?
" This is dedicated to women everywhere who deal with public restrooms .
It finally explains to the men what really does take us so long .
It also answers their other commonly asked questions about why women go to the restroom in pairs .
It 's so the other gal can hold the door , hang onto your purse and hand you Kleenex under the door !
The Democratic Party is finding itself in a very strange position .
They ’re approaching a potential situation where neither of their candidates have enough elected delegates to secure the nomination , and the race will turn to the superdelegates to decide .
Primary results can then be trumped by the say - so of the “ party elites ” .
Thus , the party who complained that Al Gore “ really won ” the 2000 election due to the popular vote may nominate Hillary Clinton , who now looks unlikely to win the national Democrat popular vote or the elected delegate count .
The schadenfreude of watching the Democratic Party put into a position of acting undemocratically notwithstanding , this case is very interesting on its own merits .
It has a parallel with our own Constitution and the 17th Amendment , and thus I find myself cheering on the “ antidemocratic ” forces within the party rather than those who would rely completely on the popular vote .
In the days of our Founding Fathers , “ democracy ” was a four - letter word .
Democracy is mob rule , and unchecked democracy can lead down a very nasty road .
America was never intended to be a democracy , it was intended to be a Republic strictly limited by the bounds of the Constitution , with democratic processes implemented to elect [ some of ] the leaders of that republic .
Even so , our Founding Fathers chose against the direct election of Senators , because they wanted a counterbalance to the power of the democratically - elected House .
Particularly , they are a check on the growth of central power , a way for the States to retain powers that 50%+1 of the members of the House of Representatives wanted to give to the central government .
The democratic party is designed in much the same way .
Some delegates are elected popularly , and tasked with voting based on certain rules in accordance with what “ the masses ” want .
On top of this are superdelegates , whose mandate is different : do what is best for the party .
If the scenario plays out in the most interesting way , with Barack Obama leading in both the popular vote and the elected delegate count , there will be loud calls for the superdelegates to vote along the same lines as the popular vote .
The specific purpose of the superdelegates , however , is to be the brake on bad decisions of the popular vote if they believe it to be necessary .
The superdelegates have a mandate , and if they believe that the popular vote is contrary to the goals of the party itself , they are obligated to follow their belief , not the popular vote .
This is an unpopular position to take , of course , because we ’ve been raised to believe that democracy is– in and of itself– a worthwhile end .
Democracy , though , is a means and not an end .
Democracy is only justified as a means if it reaches the “ right ” ends , and there is enough evidence throughout history to show that democracy often leads towards ugly , nasty results ( slavery , segregation , and Jim Crow being a few clear examples ) .
All this does n’t mean that I ’m implying that the superdelegates , if the situation breaks such that Obama leads the popular vote and elected delegate count , should n’t vote for him .
However , it is important that the superdelegates follow their conscience and do what they believe best for the party , not simply parrot the popular vote for its own sake .
The superdelegates should view such things as the preferences revealed by the popular vote as only one aspect in their decision .
Other crucial aspects to consider would be the questions of which candidate more closely lines up with core Democratic party policies and which is more likely to defeat the Republican in November .
This calculation may cause their vote to line up with the leader of the popular vote and elected delegate count , or it may not .
Either way , the superdelegates should not allow themselves to be railroaded into making a vote they do n’t believe is the correct move for the party .
I pointed out quite a while ago that Libertarianism and Democracy are not mutually exclusive , but that it often lines up that way , as the incentives of government tend towards government power and away from individual liberty , and this is no different in a democratic form of government .
Likewise , it must be pointed out that the Democratic Party has its own goals as an organization , and it is the obligation of members of the party to see that those goals are realized within the organizational rules they ’ve enacted , even if it means that primary voters get overruled .
Much as the original purpose of the Senate was to protect the interests and rights of States against those of the general populace , the superdelegates are tasked to protect the party from mistakes made by the Democratic primary voters .
What that means for their nomination vote is up to their own conscience , and should not be subject to any constraints saying they must “ follow the popular vote ” .
Last week , Mark blogged about reports that TSA agents in certain US airports were reportedly demanding that air travelers remove * all * electronics from their carry - on luggage ( not just laptops , but phones , cables , cameras , everything ) during screening .
Mark referenced Scott Beale 's post , and I believe Beale was the first to speak up about it .
He experienced this at SFO , but many others traveling in or out of SFO around the same time ( myself included ) , did not — so everyone was confused .
Today , on the newfangled Official TSA Blog ( RSS ) , there 's a super awkward apology of sorts , and an even more awkward but hearty back - slap to bloggers for bringing the issue to public attention .
That 's their logo , above .
Why awkward ?
For starters , there 's the title : " HOORAY BLOGGERS ! A Win for the Blogesphere . " ( sic ) .
Here 's what they say to the , erm , " blogesphere . "
Mr Boyle was hoping to prove the kindness of humanity
Mark Boyle , 28 , who set out four weeks ago with only T - shirts , a bandage and sandals , hoped to rely on the kindness of strangers for food and lodging .
But , because he could not speak French , people thought he was free - loading or an asylum seeker .
He now plans to walk around the coast of Britain instead , learning French as he goes , so he can try again next year .
Mr Boyle , a former organic food company boss , belongs to the Freeconomy movement which wants to get rid of money altogether .
Cold and tired
In his online diary at the start of his journey to Porbander , Gandhi 's birthplace , he said he was given two free dinners on his first evening away in Glastonbury .
Later , he was joined in Dover by two companions , and the three managed to get to Calais .
But in one of his last entries , he wrote : " ... not only did no one not speak the language , they had also seen us as just a bunch of freeloading backpackers , which is the complete opposite of what the pilgrimage is really about .
" That really scared us and given that we now were pretty much out of food , had n't slept in days and were really cold , we had to reassess the whole situation . "
Mr Boyle said he could not explain in words the disappointment he felt at abandoning the journey and he apologised to his supporters .
But he added : " Whilst walking in the UK , I intend to learn French and to hit the continent again as soon as we feel we are ready . "

Guess The Author
A typical experience with the individual health care market :
I have commented before on the problems with central planning in health care .
I certainly am not convinced that a government - run system is the answer , but I do agree with Krugman that there are serious problems with our health insurance system , particularly in the market for individually - purchased ( non- group ) coverage .
After my husband quit his job earlier this year ( to become a full - time stay - at - home dad ) , we had a choice .
We could either buy health insurance from his former employer through a program called COBRA at a cost of more than $ 1,000 per month ( ! ) or we could go it alone in Maryland ’s individual market .
Given our financial circumstances , that “ choice ” was n’t much of a choice at all .
We had to go on our own .
We discovered that the most generous plans in Maryland ’s individual market cost $ 700 per month yet provide no more than $ 1,500 per year of prescription drug coverage–a drop in the bucket if someone in our family were to be diagnosed with a serious illness .
With health insurance choices like that , no wonder so many people opt to go uninsured .
The mystery writer ?
Michelle Malkin .
As I 've said before , if a neoconservative is a liberal who got mugged , and progressive is a Republican who got sick .
Well , a Republican who got sick , but whose livelihood is n't dependent on generating an unending stream of outrage for a hardcore conservative audience .
But can you really believe that the Michelle Malkin who wrote those paragraphs is the same one inveighing against subsidized health care for children of low - income , self - employed parents ?

What 's even odder is that her husband , Jesse Malkin , is something of an expert on health economics .

So , like , what does a Malkin want , anyway ?
I 'd say the French system would solve all her problems ....
Maybe she would just move there and try it out ??
Please ?

Yes .
This has been another edition of simple answers to simple questions about simple minds .
Posted by : pseudonymous in nc | Oct 10 , 2007 4:48:15 PM
It 's interesting to note that , in 2004 , Malkin concluded :
" Given our financial circumstances , that ' choice ' was n’t much of a choice at all . "
I have no way of knowing for sure ( and no , I 'm not advocating an investigation into the Malkin finances ) , but I strongly suspect that the Malkin family 's " financial circumstances " in 2004 were ( and have remained ) considerably better than that of the Frosts .
She was already , after all , an author and nationally syndicated columnist by then ( and her dreadful book on internment was only a month away from being published ) .
Yet when it came to health care , she complained of not really having a " choice " back then .
And what does she say of the Frosts today ?
What 's the " bottom line " for Malkin ?
The bottom line remains :
This family made choices .
Choices have consequences .
Interestingly , Malkin ended up with a rather unsatisfactory " very high - deductible plan " , a plan for which the Frosts probably could n't have qualified anyway ( given their pre-existing conditions ) , and even if they did , one which surely would have put them in the poor house if any of them met with an serious illness or accident .

More from Malkin 's archives , this time on privacy :
Why publish maps and specific street names and photographs of the private ( not anymore ) homes where the Vice President and Defense Secretary and their families spend their vacations ?
...
Because the " people " ( you know : Code Pink , Fred Phelps , jihadis ) have a " right to know , " right ? ...
I wonder how Pinch Sulzberger would react to citizen photographers trampling his driveway , snapping pics of his vacation home , and splashing them all over their blogs ?

While wingnut welfare is the gift that keeps giving , freelance wingnuttery -- columnist work , subbing work on Faux News , Regnery advances and royalty checks , Bathrobe Media ad income -- still generally does n't come with health bennies .
This is n't even about income .
It 's about ressentiment .
If the Frosts were earning $ 30,000 a year , the Malkinites would want them to be living in a double - wide trailer with a beater car , and then accuse them of being sponging lazy poor , with no ambition or entrepreneurial spirit .
The Frosts are not the GOP Elect , and thus their virtues are meaningless .
Posted by : pseudonymous in nc | Oct 10 , 2007 5:01:24 PM
I think the fascinating thing about the post is that Malkin has hinged her complaint about the Frost - after backpedaling significantly on their income and personal wealth claims - on the claim that they could get insurance more cheaply that the " $ 1200 " that Bonnie Frost claimed in the first article ... it 's odd then , that Malkin herself should know that the pricing is probably right .
And it underscores , I think , that a lot of people are not connecting the dots in healthcare - Malkin sees her own problems with insurance as somehow anomalous , and does n't see the Frosts as dealing with the same issue , and probably - which is key - under circumstances much more dire than her own .
I hope , Ezra that you 've contacted her about debating - and I hope , as a follow up , or in your invite , you mention this post .
I suspect she herself does n't realize that this is out there .

If the idea is to debate health care rather than make personal attacks , Ezra probably should n't mention it .
Of course , there 's almost no way he would do so before her , but still .
Posted by : Cyrus | Oct 10 , 2007 5:36:54 PM
If you have any hint of a pre-existing condition , you can't get health insurance at any price .

Ezra , you 're right on .
Keep hitting this , over and over .
It 's ironic indeed that someone like Malkin could possibly argue for internment of American citizens as well as better " choices " in a healthcare system .
Progressive she is not .
Though irony usually has very little to do with ideological fruitcakes .

Of course I can .
It 's called cognitive dissonance .
Posted by : Jestak | Oct 10 , 2007 6:59:09 PM
No , it is not cognitive dissonance , but something deeper and simpler .
" Conservatism " in this country is not an ideology at all .
It is about nothing but sheer naked greed .
Consequently , these fundamentally dishonest people will use any argument which serves their interest at the moment , without a concern in the world with its consistency with their previous or future utterances .
Thus , five Supreme Court justices threw everything they ever claimed to believe into the trash to make Bush President .
Thus , Conservatives use any shift in the economy , positive or negative , to argue for tax cuts .
Thus , they will turn their backs on any record of past failure to vote for whoever promises them the lowest taxes .
Thus , Bush instantly abandoned his claimed belief in small government and fiscal responsibility when he had a chance to help his friends feed at the public trough .
They care nothing for truth , only for wealth .
They will say anything to get it .

One can be against Single Payer or other forms of UHC and still not be happy with what exists today .
I do n't see anything in what she writes that contradicts a conservative 's view .
The individual market is screwed because there 's not a ton of individual 's in it , considering most people get their health insurance through an employee .
This has been a constant bicker of mine .
I do n’t know her deep feelings on healthcare , so I have no idea where she stands on reform .
But I see this often enough when I point out flaws in Single Payer : people automatically assume I ’m for the status quo , which is n’t the case

I wonder if her current insurance provider will cover treatment for that ?

Amazing .
In the older , more decent , traditional Republican Party circles , hateful harpies like Malkin and Coulter would never be invited or allowed to represent the party in public .
DECENT society would n't be caught dead in public with her , simply because she 's an incredibly TACKY human being .
Malkin and Coulter remind me of the high school cafeteria girls : only happy when they 're trashing someone else , perpetually stuck in the immaturity of one - liner put downs as " superiority . "
Pretty much the same reason Nancy Reagan could n't stand being around Barbara Bush .
THIS is what the Republican Party has become .
Sad , sad , sad .

The really funny thing about these righty - blog berserker episodes is that one never sees them coming .
Who would have predicted , beforehand , that an item on the back page of the mostly pro-war New Republic , or a gimmicky Dem response to the weekly presidential radio address , would be the occasion of a right - wing flash mob ?
It reminds me of descriptions I 've read ( not a gamer myself ) of World of Warcraft " raids " , such is the disparity between the provocation and the vehemence of the response .
Posted by : kth | Oct 10 , 2007 8:48:30 PM
I 've said it before to many of my contemporaries .
Many of these right - wing " hacks " do more than likely do not believe half the things that they say .
It 's a very simple equation : Look at what these people do and not what they say .
For all of O'reilly 's lamentation (s ) over the " far left 's " ways of living , we all know at least some of the way in which he lives his personal life .
Malkin in this iteration becomes much more discriminating about the private market " offerings " when her family 's personal money is involved , and seemingly can then see past her ideologies .
And please , let 's not even start on " El Rushbo " .
See , ultimately , these people are just appealing to a market .
They know what keeps the ears and the eyes glued , they specialize in red - meat to red -meat eaters .
I do n't blame them , I blame the regressive tards who have yet to see that they are being played for suckers .
Selah .

I live in British Columbia , one of the two Canadian provinces that charges its citizens directly for UHC , rather than taking it out of general tax revenue .
The premiums are $ 54 per month for a single person , $ 96 per month for a couple , or $ 108 per month for a family of three or more .
If your income is below a certain amount , you get financial assistance -- up to 100 % if necessary .
I do n't have to pay the full amount because my employer covers half .
Anyone is free to buy additional insurance for the services not covered by the provincial plan .
So I also have what 's called Extended Health Care , again subsidized by my employer .

When was it better ?
In the 1980s , when the Reagan administration was selling weapons to both Iran and Iraq at various times ?
Or maybe earlier , during the Nixon administration ?
Yeah , those are n't exactly analagous to the two minutes ' hate we 're seeing today , but still , if there was every anything admirable in the leadership of the Republican Party , I think it was before I was born .

EPA has set the limit for pollution - forming ozone in the air to 75 ppb , despite the unanimous advice of the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to set it between 60 - 70 ppb ( more here on the health effects of ozone ) .
This is hardly a surprise , given the Bush Administration ’s record .
But in this case , it ’s apparently not enough to make a single standard insufficiently protective ; administration officials have decided to take on the rulemaking requirements of the Clean Air Act .
The Washington Post ’s Juliet Eilperin explains :
Administrator Stephen L. Johnson also said he would push Congress to rewrite the nearly 37 - year - old Clean Air Act to allow regulators to take into consideration the cost and feasibility of controlling pollution when making decisions about air quality , something that is currently prohibited by the law .
In 2001 , the Supreme Court ruled that the government needed to base the ozone standard strictly on protecting public health , with no regard to cost .
…
Documents obtained by The Washington Post indicate that White House officials chafed at the idea that they could not factor costs into the ozone rule , which requires setting one standard for protecting health and a separate one for protecting public welfare , and that the president himself intervened in the process Monday .
In a March 6 memo to the EPA , Susan E. Dudley of the Office of Management and Budget questioned the need for two different ozone limits , noting that the Clean Air Act ’s definition of public welfare includes “ effects on environmental values . ”
The EPA ’s Marcus C. Peacock replied the next day that it is important to keep in mind that “ EPA cannot consider costs in setting a secondary standard . ”
Matt Madia expounds on the two - rule issue and the White House ’s involvement :
While EPA ’s decision to set a standard of .075 ppm had been a foregone conclusion , but officials wrangled over whether to set a separate secondary standard .
Under the Clean Air Act , EPA may set a secondary standard for the protection of public welfare .
( The primary standard is to focus on public health . )
In the past , EPA has chosen not to set a secondary standard for ozone ; but during this revision , the agency had prepared to set a more tailored , seasonal standard citing the vulnerability of certain plants sensitive to ozone ’s deleterious effects .
However , just days before EPA was ready to issue the new primary and secondary standards , Susan Dudley — the administrator of OMB ’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs who President Bush recess appointed last April — wrote to Johnson March 6 complaining EPA had not considered economics in proposing a new secondary standard and raising questions about the scientific justification for the decision .
Marcus Peacock , EPA ’s Deputy Administrator and Regulatory Policy Officer , shot back in a letter dated March 7 .
Peacock said EPA is prohibited from considering costs in setting the secondary standard , and that the agency had provided ample scientific rationale for its decision .
An internal memo dated March 11 shows EPA was ready to ignore Dudley ’s complaints and set a new seasonal secondary standard for ozone .
Apparently , that ’s when the head honcho stepped in .
According to Washington Post reporter Juliet Eilperin , “ The rule ’s preamble indicates Bush settled the dispute March 11 , saying the president concluded the secondary standard should be set ‘ to be identical to the new primary standard , the approach adopted when ozone standards were last promulgated . ’ ” The president ’s direct intervention in a rulemaking is rare and , in this case , damaging .
The Decider at work .
He also reminds us that in the months leading up to the decision , EPA and OMB had several closed - door meetings with from the oil , auto , and electric industries .
This seems like a good time to revisit a statement from a journal of the American Thoracic Society , written when EPA was considering the new ozone standard ( emphasis added ) :
Based on the strength of the scientific knowledge base regarding the adverse health effects of ozone air pollution , and the magnitude of public health impact such pollution has on the United States ’ population , especially on children , the American Thoracic Society has recommended that the EPA take action now to issue a stricter ozone standard of 0.060 ppm /8 hours .
This recommendation is consistent with that of a number of other prominent expert scientific panels , including the EPA ’s own Children ’s Health Protection Advisory Committee and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee .
Any action less stringent than a 0.060 - ppm standard will effectively represent a failure of the EPA to fulfill its mandate under the Clean Air Act .
It seems that the EPA has indeed failed to fulfill its mandate under the Clean Air Act .
And it seems that their response is to change the Act , magically transforming a failure into “ success . ”
The chancellor urged people to monitor their bank accounts
Alistair Darling
Two computer discs holding the personal details of all families in the UK with a child under 16 have gone missing .
The Child Benefit data on them includes name , address , date of birth , National Insurance number and , where relevant , bank details of 25 million people .
Chancellor Alistair Darling said there was no evidence the data had gone to criminals - but urged people to monitor bank accounts " for unusual activity " .
The Conservatives described the incident as a " catastrophic " failure .
CHILD BENEFIT HELPLINE 0845 302 1444
In an emergency statement to MPs , Mr Darling apologised for what he described as an " extremely serious failure on the part of HMRC to protect sensitive personal data entrusted to it in breach of its own guidelines " .
MPs gasped as Mr Darling told them : " The missing information contains details of all Child Benefit recipients : records for 25 million individuals and 7.25 million families . "
The police are not aware of any evidence that it has been used for fraudulent purposes or criminal activity
Alistair Darling
Chancellor
Point - by - point : Darling Q&A : Records lost
The chancellor blamed mistakes by junior officials at HMRC , who he said had ignored security procedures when they sent information to the National Audit Office ( NAO ) for auditing .
Mr Darling told MPs : " Two password protected discs containing a full copy of HMRC 's entire data in relation to the payment of child benefit was sent to the NAO , by HMRC 's internal post system operated by the courier TNT .
The package was not recorded or registered .
It appears the data has failed to reach the addressee in the NAO . "
He added : " The police tell me that they have no reason to believe that this data has found its way into the wrong hands .
" The police are not aware of any evidence that it has been used for fraudulent purposes or criminal activity . "
Fraud protection
The HMRC has set up a Child Benefit Helpline on 0845 302 1444 for customers who want more details .
The data was sent on 18 October and senior management at HMRC were told it was missing on 8 November and the chancellor on 10 November .
MISSING DATA INCLUDES ...
National insurance number Name , address and birth date Partner 's details Names , sex and age of children Bank / savings account details Mr Darling said banks were adamant that they wanted as much time to prepare for his announcement as possible .
He added : " If someone is the innocent victim of fraud as a result of this incident , people can be assured they have protection under the Banking Code so they will not suffer any financial loss as a result . "
Mr Darling said people should monitor their accounts " for any unusual activity " .
Chairman resigns
The Metropolitan Police are investigating the disappearance of the two discs and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) , which monitors HMRC , is investigating the security breach .
Uniformed officers were earlier checking HMRC 's offices in Washington , Tyne and Wear .
It is the latest and by far the most serious of a string of missing data incidents at HM Revenue and Customs .
WHAT CAN YOU DO ?
Check your bank statements for odd transactions Monitor your account if you bank online Change your account password if it is a date of birth or name Source : Apacs
How worried should you be ?
HMRC chairman Paul Gray resigned earlier after the latest incident came to light .
Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said : " Let us be clear about the scale of this catastrophic mistake - the names , the addresses and the dates of birth of every child in the country are sitting on two computer discs that are apparently lost in the post , and the bank account details and National Insurance numbers of 10 million parents , guardians and carers have gone missing .
" Half the country will be very anxious about the safety of their family and the security and the whole country will be wondering how on earth the government allowed this to happen . "
' Ancient ' computers
He urged the government to " get a grip " and said it was the " final blow for the ambitions of this government to create a national ID database " as " they simply can not be trusted with people 's personal information " .
Liberal Democrat Acting Leader Vince Cable said it was now the Treasury and not the Home Office that was " not fit for purpose " .
CHILD BENEFIT
Available to the parents , normally mother , of every child in UK under 16 Older children in full - time education still eligible Taken up by almost 100 %
It amounts to £ 18.10 a week for a first - born child For subsequent children - it amounts to £ 12.10 a week
Timeline : Benefit records loss " Why does HMRC still use CDs for data transmission in this day and age ?
The ancient museum pieces it is currently using for computing must be replaced .
" After this disaster how can the public possibly have confidence in the vast centralised databases needed for the compulsory ID card scheme .
" Where does the buck stop after this catalogue of disasters ? "
Giving his reaction , the Information Commissioner , Richard Thomas , said : " This is an extremely serious and disturbing security breach . "
Mr Thomas welcomed the Chancellor 's announcement of an independent review of the incident by Kieran Poynter of PricewaterhouseCoopers and said he would decide on further action once he has received the report .
" Searching questions need to be answered about systems , procedures and human error inside both HMRC and NAO , " said Mr Thomas .
The prime minister 's official spokeswoman said Gordon Brown has " full confidence " in Mr Darling .
She added that Mr Darling has not offered to resign .

The five billion euro man , Jérôme Kerviel , emerged yesterday as an unlikely and unwitting hero for the global age : the man who accidentally saved the world from recession .
He was also arrested .
Mr Kerviel , 31 , was taken into custody by police in Paris on suspicion of three different kinds of fraud .
He has reportedly told investigators that he is ready to explain – if he can – how his late - night " virtual " trading on share futures cost his bank , Société Générale , € 4.9bn ( £ 3.6bn ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The case for Mr Kerviel as a hero , as well as a suspected fraudster , is complicated – but not that complicated .
Société Générale 's chairman , Daniel Bouton , yesterday dismissed as " absurd " suggestions that his decision to dump more than € 50bn in unauthorised trades by Mr Kerviel early last week had plunged European stock exchanges into a tailspin .
Market experts pointed out , however , that heavy selling by SocGen on Monday – especially of German shares futures – reinforced a mood of panic and helped push all markets down .
This in turn jolted the US Federal Reserve into cutting its interest rates sharply on Tuesday , preventing a copycat crash on Wall Street and possibly also steering the world out of recession .
As a result , some respected US economists are now feting Mr Kerviel as an unwitting saviour .
" Merci , Jérôme , " said the influential economic analyst , Ed Yardeni , former head economist of Deutsche Bank Securities .
" The recession is almost over , thanks to Jérôme Kerviel in Paris and the panic reaction [ of the Fed ] in Washington ...
I cannot remember any precedent for such strong support for the economy before the evidence of a recession became manifest . "
But there are equally good reasons to be scared – and very scared – by the Kerviel saga .
A junior trader at his desk on the sixth floor of a building just west of Paris accidentally nudged the steering wheel of the entire world economy .
What does that tell us about the uncontrolled might of the immense sums of " electronic " money now being traded on futures and hedge funds ?
A young man earning € 100,000 a year was allegedly gripped by a belief that he had discovered a magic new trading formula .
He was able to make unauthorised trades on share futures worth at least € 50bn , equivalent to the GDP of Cuba or Slovenia .
For the whole of last year , Mr Kerviel was making massive , secret trades in late - night sessions at his desk – quite separately from his authorised work .
He made a profit that he could not easily explain to his bosses .
Instead of trying to steal the money and abscond , he set out this month to make a deliberate , off - setting " loss " .
As stock markets began to weaken 10 days ago , he found he had accidentally gone much further than he intended , so plunging his secret " business " into a € 1.4bn deficit .

Société Gé*érale finally grasped what was happening last weekend .
It tried to " unwind his positions " , or dump his deals , in the teeth of a falling market , last Monday and Tuesday .
By doing so , SocGen , France 's second largest bank and the world leader in financial futures , appears to have made the market tumble even further – increasing its own losses in the process .
This led one rival French banker to say yesterday that Mr Kerviel had himself actually lost " only " € 1.4bn : " The board of SocGen lost the rest . "
How all of that came to happen is now the subject of several , interlocking criminal and government inquiries in France .
Mr Kerviel was arrested yesterday afternoon at an undisclosed address in Paris , where he had been looked after by his mother and brother .
He was brought in a Renault Kangoo van to the offices of the Paris anti-fraud brigade at rue du Château - des - Rentiers in the 13th arrondissement on the Left Bank .
( A rentier in French is someone who makes profits from the work of others . )
He faces charges relating to the falsification and fraudulent use of bank records , and to computer fraud .
Police earlier visited the headquarters of SocGen in La Défense , the skyscraper park west of Paris , to gather computer records that would help them track Mr Kerviel 's actions .
On Friday night , they had raided his empty flat in Neuilly - sur - Seine , a wealthy suburb between Paris and La Défense .
Mr Kerviel , a Breton from a modest background , with a mediocre academic and business career , has not been seen publicly since the scandal broke on Thursday morning .
But it was soon learnt that his father had died less than a year ago , and that a relationship had later ended .
He is said not to have taken a holiday in eight months .
Quite apart from its failure to police the actions of its junior employee , SocGen faces a raft of awkward questions ?
French politicians , and even markets experts , have accused the bank of using the Kerviel case to " hide " much larger losses on the US sub - prime market than the € 2bn it admitted last week .
Share traders are furious that the bank allowed normal trading in its shares to proceed for three days without warning the market .
Questions are also likely to be asked about the behaviour of the French central bank .
SocGen has said that it warned the Banque de France last Sunday .
The European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve in Washington were apparently not warned of the coming storm until Wednesday .
But the greatest single outstanding question is how Mr Kerviel – a young man armed only with a computer screen – could bet € 50bn , 30 per cent more than the value of his bank , on the future direction of European stock markets .
How could his superiors not notice ?
The chairman of SocGen , Daniel Bouton , yesterday gave the fullest explanation so far of the astounding events of the past few days .
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro , he explained that Mr Kerviel had been playing an immense computer game with the markets – and the bank 's money – " for the whole of 2007 " .
Mr Kerviel used to work in the bank's " middle office " , checking on the legality of the trades undertaken in the " front office " .
Two years ago , he was promoted to the bank 's Delta One trading desk .
His job was to trade in " plain vanilla " ( ie , uncomplicated ) futures contracts on share movements on the Frankfurt , London and New York stock exchanges .
His brief was to bet simultaneously on upwards and downward movements and make a small profit on spotting and " arbitraging " tiny price differences between contracts .
He was performing this task in a competent and unspectacular way .
At the same time , Mr Bouton revealed , Mr Kerviel had created a quite separate multibillion - euro business , or experiment , or game , for himself – unknown to his employers .
In this separate world , he was buying thousands of genuine futures contracts betting on share price movements and faking the " hedging " contracts that were supposed to balance his risks .
He disguised his activities from the bank by using stolen passwords and log-ons and by constantly changing his positions before routine controls became due .
As far as the bank was concerned his position was " neutral " .
In reality , he was taking a massive bet throughout last year that stock markets would broadly fall .
Since they did broadly fall , he ended 2007 in a " winning " position but one that he could not reveal to the bank without admitting the huge risks , and illegal liberties , he had been taking .
He therefore set out , Mr Bouton said , " deliberately to take losing positions , so as to wipe out his previous potential gains " .
The problem was that Mr Kerviel 's " losing " positions were much too successful – something Mr Bouton described as a " Greek tragedy " but which might equally be called a French farce .
Last Friday week , as European stock markets headed downwards , " his losing position became immense " , Mr Bouton said .
Mr Kerviel 's overall position – neutral at the start of the day – plunged deeply into the red by the close of trading , to the tune of € 1.4bn .
His supervisors , finally , twigged that something was wrong .
Over last weekend , Mr Kerviel was grilled by senior bank officials .
In response , he claimed to have created " a new trading technique that was performing very well " .
The bank , appalled at what it found , decided to close down ( or sell off ) all his positions as soon as the markets commenced trading on Monday .
When European markets opened , they crashed , after the rout of Asian markets overnight .
Mr Bouton yesterday dismissed as " absurd " claims that SocGen had " caused " the European market crash .
He said the bank had been careful to respect the rule that institutions should trade at no more than 10 per cent of the volume of any one market .
It was precisely because the bank was so cautious – and honourable – that it lost so much money , he suggested .
By the time that all Mr Kerviel 's positions had been closed down on Wednesday , SocGen 's " loss " had exploded from € 1.4bn to € 4.9bn .
Mr Bouton also angrily rejected accusations that SocGen had " buried " other embarrassing losses by blaming then all on Mr Kerviel .
" I wish people would stop and think , " he said .
" We shifted into a new hole losses from an old hole .
How could that go unnoticed by our auditors ? "
Many other questions remain .
Most of all , what on earth was Jérôme Kerviel trying to achieve ?
And what , exactly were central bankers up to last week ?
Questions are now being asked about whether Ben Bernanke , the US Federal Reserve chairman , was told by SocGen or Europe 's central bankers that the bank was going to unwind its trading positions last Monday .
The French bank informed the Bank of France governor , Christian Noyer , on Sunday about the losses and it is understood that he informed Jean - Claude Trichet , chairman of the European Central Bank .
But the Fed denies being told of what was happening in Europe .
Senior banking sources in London are saying that it is " astonishing " if the ECB did not inform the Fed of what was going on .
Further , they say that if Mr Bernanke did not know , then his action in cutting rates can be seen as a panic reaction .
Rogue traders
Kerviel 's is the latest in a line of dizzying losses by unauthorised traders playing for colossal sums :

Two Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are requesting that the Justice Department ’s internal watchdog investigate whether Bush Administration officials who authorized waterboarding are guilty of any crimes themselves .
Sens. Richard Durbin ( D - IL ) and Sheldon Whitehouse ’s ( D - RI ) request comes as the CIA and White House finally admitted the use of waterboarding , and as Attorney General Michael Mukasey is standing with the Bush administration in refusing to open an investigation .
The senators say that Mukasey ’s refusal on grounds that the Justice Department had authorized the simulated drowning technique did not answer whether the authorizations themselves were legal .

Markos found a Geraldine Ferraro interview from February 27 , 2008 , on FOX News ’ John Gibson ’s radio show , where she said pretty much the exact same thing she said this week about Obama and race .
The thing is , it ’s nearly verbatim the same thing .
These are talking points that she rehearsed , and / or was given .
The question is by whom ?
FERRARO : If Barack Obama were a white man , would we be talking about this as a potential real problem for Hillary ?
If he were a woman …
GIBSON : You mean if he were John Edwards ?
FERRARO :
If he were a woman of any color , would he be in this position that he ’s in , absolutely not .
GIBSON : Geraldine , are you playing the race card ?
FERRARO : No , and that ’s the problem .
Every time you say the truth – I ’m the first person , John , and you know how honest I am , I am the first person who will say in 1984 if my name were Gerard instead of Geraldine , I would never have been picked as the vice presidential candidate .
Then look at what she said earlier this week :
If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman ( of any color ) he would not be in this position .
Now look at what she said earlier today :
“ If in 1984 my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro , I would never have been the nominee for VP . ”
In politics , those cute little zingers tend to be things you practice in advance .
They ’re intentional , they ’re talking points .
Ferraro planned this entire line of attack over 2 weeks ago .
The question is whether Hillary ’s campaign planned it for her , with her .

Afghanistan is being deprived of $ 10 bn ( £ 5 bn ) of promised aid , and 40 % of the money that has been delivered was spent on corporate profits and consultancy fees , according to a hard - hitting report by aid agencies released today .
The failure of western donors to keep their promises , compounded by corruption and inefficiency , is undermining the prospects for peace in Afghanistan , it warns .
Civil aid programmes are a fraction of what is spent by America , Britain and other countries on military operations there .
Much of the money earmarked for aid is diverted to political or military purposes .
The report by Acbar , an alliance of international aid agencies working in the country , including Oxfam , Christian Aid , Islamic Relief and Save the Children , says the international community has pledged $ 25 bn to Afghanistan since 2001 but only $ 15 bn has been delivered .
The US is the biggest donor to Afghanistan but is also responsible for one of the biggest shortfalls .
The US delivered only half of the $ 10.4bn it committed between 2002 and 2008 , according to the Afghan government , today 's report says .
Over the same period the European commission and Germany distributed less than two - thirds of their respective $ 1.7bn and $ 1.2bn commitments while the World Bank distributed just over half of the $ 1.6 bn it committed .
Britain pledged $ 1.45bn and distributed almost all , $ 1.3bn .
The report estimated that 40 % of the aid money spent in Afghanistan has found its way back to rich donor countries such as the US through corporate profits , consultants ' salaries and other costs , significantly inflating the cost of projects .
For example , a road between the centre of Kabul and the international airport cost over $ 2.3 m per kilometre in US aid money , at least four times the average cost of building a road in Afghanistan , today 's report says .
Afghanistan 's biggest donor , USAid , allocates nearly half its funds to five big contractors .
The US government has awarded major contracts , some worth hundreds of millions of dollars , to KBR , the Louis Berger group , Chemonics International , Bearing Point , and Dyncorp International , according to a study by the US - based Centre for Public Integrity quoted in today 's report .
Most full - time expatriate consultants working for private companies in Afghanistan cost between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 a year , including salary , allowances and associated costs , the report adds .
Some 90 % of all public spending in Afghanistan comes from international aid .
The huge shortfall hinders efforts to rebuild infrastructure damaged by over two decades of war , and the delivery of essential services such as education and health , the report says .
Matt Waldman , Oxfam 's Afghanistan policy adviser and the report 's author , said last night : " The reconstruction of Afghanistan requires a sustained and substantial commitment of aid - but donors have failed to meet their aid pledges to Afghanistan .
Too much aid from rich countries is wasted , ineffective or uncoordinated .
" Spending on tackling poverty is a fraction of what is spent on military operations .
While the US military is currently spending $ 100 m a day in Afghanistan , aid spent by all donors since 2001 is on average less than a tenth of that - just $ 7 m a day .
" Given the slow pace of progress in Afghanistan , and the links between poverty and conflict , the international community must urgently get its act together " .
The report says some degree of donor under - spending could be expected because of the lack of government capacity , large - scale corruption , and difficult security conditions .
But the size of the shortfall highlights the need for donors making better efforts to face up to the problem .
The report also shows that a disproportionate amount of aid follows the conflict and is being used for political and military objectives rather than reducing poverty .
" This is a short - sighted policy , " said Waldman .
" There must be strong support for development in the south but if other provinces are neglected then insecurity could spread . "
The report says the volume of aid , particularly to rural areas , should be increased , aid donors should be more open about what they want to provide and cooperate better with the Afghan government .
There should be better ways to measure the impact , efficiency , and relevance of aid money , and an independent commission to monitor the appropriateness and effectiveness of donors ' programmes , should be set up , it says .
As your longtime source for scurrilous rumors about candidate affairs , I feel obliged to weigh in on John McCain 's current predicament , even if I do n't have anything especially weighty to say .
My first reaction was , WTF was the Times thinking ?
It seemed like they had a reasonable story about McCain and lobbyists  which would have been pretty ho hum except for the fact that McCain poses as Mr. Ethics  that they could have dressed up , in paragraph 10 , with a fun anecdote : " McCain is so cozy with lobbyists , some of his advisors thought he was having an affair with one ! "
Instead they ran the story as if they had the goods on the affair , which they did n't , and then weakly tried to back it up with the lobbyist stuff .
Then I wondered if McCain had n't actually planted this story himself so that we'd all be talking about his , um , vigor .
It reminds me of a twist on the old doctor joke .
" As your straight - talking ethics candidate , I 've got bad news and good news .
The bad news is , I 'm in the pocket of big lobbyists . "
" Oh my God , that 's terrible !
What 's the good news ? "
" You see that hot blonde who 's half my age ?
I 'm fucking her . "

The UK has been considering a plan that would force Internet service providers to " cooperate " with content owners to curtail illegal file - swapping , and a new document released today by the UK government lays out the timeline for this plan .
If ISPs do n't voluntarily implement some sort of antipiracy system by April 2009 , the government will introduce its own legislation to make them do so .
It 's just one part of the government 's plan to make the UK a powerhouse in the creative industries .
The Department for Culture , Media , and Sport talked up its plan in a paper called " Creative Britain : New Talents for the New Economy " ( PDF ) , and it includes plenty of " carrots " for the creative industries .
The government plans to pump plenty of money into special schools focusing on arts and music , developing five new " centers of excellence " in various arts , and making sure there are at least 5,000 apprentice positions in the creative industries by 2013 .
All children will get access to five hours of " culture " ( art , music , theater , dance lessons ) a week .
Good stuff .
But the plan comes with plenty of " sticks , " as well .
One of these concerns file - sharing .
The 2006 Gowers Report on intellectual property in the UK recommended that some form of government regulation be drafted if ISPs and content owners could not voluntarily agree on a system to curtail illicit downloads .
That 's exactly the approach that the government is taking now , and the report still says that " we would encourage the adoption of voluntary or commercial agreements between the ISPs and all relevant sectors . "
But , on the assumption that this might not happen , the government will spend 2008 deciding on " regulatory arrangements " that it hopes to adopt in April 2009 if no voluntary agreement is forthcoming .
In addition to the pressure on ISPs , which is a bit like asking telephone companies to monitor every call in the country for evidence of illegal activity , the government also hopes to boost penalties for copyright infringement , fund expert police training to deal with intellectual property crimes , and launch various educational and enforcement campaigns .
" Fake Free London " hopes to make London free from counterfeit products by the time of the 2012 Olympic Games , while a new education program hopes to reach " children of all ages " in the school system .
Children as young as nine years old will also be taught to think about how they can " protect and profit from their ideas . "
It 's a fairly comprehensive plan in the sense that it mobilizes many different state sectors on behalf of the creative industries : education , police action , industry regulation .
Whether it will work is another question .
While many parts of the plan are unobjectionable or seem like excellent ideas , some of the enforcement material feels a bit weak .
The report uncritically quotes estimates of " losses " from illegal downloads , which are notoriously hard to quantify ( it 's difficult to know how many of those items would actually have been purchased ) and come from established players like the BSA and the IFPI .
The plan also asks for " proposals from the creative industries " for industry - funded " mobile specialized enforcement teams " who could crack down on piracy .
And it stresses the need to educate people about intellectual property issues , but the education that seems to be envisioned is all about adhering copyrights and learning to demand one 's maximum rights .
In other words , the plan looks like something drawn up by industry groups , with little sign that the huge amount of creativity represented by Creative Commoners will be considered , or that education will provide a robust education in fair dealing , or that any student will ever be told about the ways that being less - than - draconian with DRM , copyrights , and licensing can actually be a boon for many creative professionals .
The plan is still light enough on details that this may not be the case , but it would certainly not be unexpected given what we have seen around the world from government and industry - backed IP education initiatives .

Steve Litchfield looks at a new book on PyS60 - who 's it for and is it any good ?
Author : Juergen Scheible and Ville Tuulos
If you have even the slightest interest in creating applications for S60 smartphones then you 'll have heard of Nokia 's open source port of Python .
Essentially this takes the industry standard ( and supremely flexible ) Python programming language ( itself open source , i.e. free and extensible ) and adds a huge number of phone - specific modules and functions , plus a real - time interpreter .
If you remember Psion 's OPL , the simple language that enabled applications to be created quickly for their palmtops and later for Nokia 's 9210 and 9500 ( and assorted other Symbian OS phones ) , then there are distinct similarities in the overall concept .
Python differs from OPL in its form and function however .
It 's a harder language to get to grips with , not least because its object - oriented , but on the plus side the PyS60 modules mean that almost anything your smartphone can do is available in function form with a minimum of effort from Python .
Juergen Scheible , one of the authors of Mobile Python , new from Wiley , has been a leading evangelist for PyS60 since its inception , so he makes the natural lynchpin here .
Ville Tuulos is a new name to me , but there are plenty of others from the Python and Symbian worlds who also seem to have made contributions here .
Mobile Python 's subtitle is ' Rapid Prototyping of Applications on the Mobile Platform ' , but as with the earlier book on OPL , which had a similar title , a substantial number of Python programs will end up being THE applications , not just prototypes .
It 's important to get your head around the sheer power of PyS60 - about 20 % through the book , there 's a ten line code example that 's a fully working SMS Inbox search tool .
In ten lines !
The richness of the Python language and the PyS60 modules thus make writing a book teaching it all something of a challenge .
But it 's a challenge that has been taken up with gusto by the two main authors .
Mobile Python is NOT a reference book though - as the book goes on , there are more and more references to the main PyS60 documentation ( a set of PDF files on the web ) .
And it 's NOT a book for beginners .
Uncle Tom and your sister will give up after chapter 3 and so will you unless you 've done some programming on other computers in the past .
Although there are boxed ' Python Language Lessons ' every so often , these are intended more for alerting clued up home developers to the way in which Python does things .
I 'm coming to PyS60 from OPL , C and Fortran ( all pretty old procedural languages ) and found myself making reasonable progress but starting to struggle a little once into the meat of the book .
The problem is n't with the book itself , it 's with the Python language and the PyS60 implementation of it .
Python is just so darned flexible that modules and functions ( and this goes for the PyS60 parts too ) have in places been implemented seemingly at random , with little thought for consistency .
So some modules have sub functions , some have sub - sub - functions , some expect certain parameters or return different values and , to be honest , trying to keep it all in your head is just about impossible .
There are about half a dozen ways I can think of to do ' Hello World ' in Python and twice as many ways of implementing a simple event - driven application framework , none of which are any more ' official ' than any other .
It 's a bit overwhelming , to say the least .
Mobile Python approaches the problem in ' tutorial ' manner , introducing concepts and example code hand in hand , so that you 're always building code snippets which work and do something useful , hammering home the message about Python being a great language for creating applications quickly .
And you 'll be impressed how efficiently your S60 smartphone 's systems are accessed .
At one point in chapter 4 , a complete SMS server game is created ( Hangman ) , which users sending in guesses by SMS and receiving results in the same way .
All from Python on your phone in less than 50 lines of code !
The difficulty level of the PyS60 code rises fairly rapidly as the chapters progress , which is why you 'll need to have some prior programming experience and / or a real aptitude for this sort of thing .
The example applications ( all thankfully downloadable from the book 's web site - the typing 's not that arduous , but it does help reduce typos ! ) that come thick and fast throughout the bulk of the book should give you an idea of the PyS60 functionality which is demonstrated :
MP3 player / Camera with viewfinder / UFO game / GSM cell locator / Vocabulector ( a language learning aid ) / Bluetooth chat / GPS reader / Photo uploader / HTTP server / MopyMaps ( client for Yahoo maps ) / EventFu ( web 2.0 event guide ) / MobiLenin ( multi - device video interaction ) / MobileArtBlog ( an arty image composition gadget ) / Roombatics ( control of the Roomba vacuum cleaner )
Most of the latter examples above are existing real world applications and included for interest , to see how they work , rather than specially written code for the book itself .
As said above , Mobile Python does n't pretend to be a reference book - I guess that would make a good followup - and for every tasty function that gets introduced I 'm also tempted to wonder where the function fits into the overall module , what the other parameters are that are n't mentioned , why a function is called in a specific way , and so on .
As many questions are raised as examples given .
But I 'm not going to let that spoil my appreciation for Juergen and Ville getting this book out in the first place , full credit to them for managing to find the time , resources and backing in an age that so often publically endorses open source software but rarely puts real money or effort into doing anything with it .
Extras with the book include an appendix on Platform Security and application ( SIS ) building , one on setting up a ' Bluetooth console ' ( debugging PyS60 code from a PC ) , another with advice on debugging code , plus some tables and a reasonable index to all the major modules and functions mentioned .
That Mobile Python is the best book on PyS60 is n't in doubt , seeing as it's the only one .
But as someone who loves to tinker with Python in my spare time , I 've definitely found my imagination and enthusiasm fired - and I suspect this was exactly Juergen and Ville 's aim .

Shannon Matthews had been missing for three weeks
Neighbours celebrate Missing nine - year - old Shannon Matthews has been found alive , more than three weeks after going missing .
Police found her hidden in the base of a divan bed in a house in Batley Carr , West Yorkshire , a mile from her home .
Her stepfather 's uncle , 39 , said locally to use two names - Paul Drake and Mick Donovan - has been arrested on suspicion of abduction .
Shannon is under an emergency protection order and in police care while what happened is established .
Neighbours in Batley Carr said police smashed their way into the house and emerged carrying Shannon , who was last seen leaving Westmoor Junior School in Dewsbury on 19 February .
' Over the moon '
She was reunited briefly with her mother and medical checks were carried out on her .
West Yorkshire Police said officers would now begin to interview her .
A spokesman said : " This may be a long process but throughout this enquiry our main focus has been and continues to be Shannon 's welfare . "
Neighbours said Shannon looked " quite calm " as she was taken from the house and officers confirmed that she was OK .
Shannon 's father Leon Rose said he was " over the moon " .
During a search of the house , officers located Shannon Matthews who was found concealed in the base of a divan bed
West Yorkshire Police " Believe it or not , where she 's been found , I 'd actually been in that area a number of times and probably just walked straight past the house that she was in , " he said .
Earlier , a West Yorkshire Police statement said : " As part of ongoing investigations , detectives and specialist search officers attended a house at Lidgate Gardens , Batley Carr , Dewsbury , at 1230 GMT this afternoon .
Map of where Shannon was found " During a search of the house , officers located Shannon Matthews who was found concealed in the base of a divan bed .
" A 39 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of abduction at the address and is currently in custody at a West Yorkshire police station .
Dewsbury Moor residents celebrated Shannon 's discovery " Shannon is currently in the care of West Yorkshire Police .
Investigations are ongoing . "
Neighbour Christopher Heaps witnessed Shannon being brought out of the house by police .
He said he heard police breaking the door down then saw officers carrying Shannon in their arms .
" She was very calm and did n't look upset , " he said .
Children returning from school to houses in Shannon 's road were crying and hugging each other after hearing she had been found .
Mayor of Kirklees , Jean Calvert , said she was delighted Shannon had been found .
" It 's an immense relief for the family , relatives and friends of Shannon and those who 've supported the efforts to find her and have shown so much concern over what 's been a very traumatic few weeks for them and the local community , " she said .
More than 200 officers and 60 detectives have been involved in the search , which police said amounted to 10 % of West Yorkshire Police 's operational strength .
The force said the operation was its biggest since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper .
Officers have searched nearly 3,000 residential and commercial premises in the hunt for the schoolgirl .
The police hunt for Shannon had always focused on the local community .

Bhubaneswar
Eighteen stone pillars have been excavated ( Pics : Sanjib Mukherjee )
The remains have been discovered at Sisupalgarh near Bhubaneswar , capital of the eastern state of Orissa .
Researchers say the items found during the excavation point to a highly developed urban settlement .
The population of the city could have been in the region of 20,000 to 25,000 , the archaeologists claim .
The excavations include 18 stone pillars , pottery , terracotta ornaments and bangles , finger rings , ear spools and pendants made of clay .
But some historians and archaeologists in Orissa have expressed reservations about the claim of the researchers - they say it is too early to say anything about the population or periodicity of the area .
' Significance '
RK Mohanty of the department of archaeology , Deccan College , Pune , who is one of the two researchers involved in the excavations .
" The significance of this ancient city becomes clear when one bears in mind the fact that the population of classical Athens was barely 10,000 , " he said .
Mr Mohanty , along with Monica Smith of the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology , University of California , has been carrying out limited excavations at the site every year since 2005 with the permission of the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) .
Archaeologists say it was a planned urban settlement
The latest round of excavations ended last Monday and the new discoveries have been covered with special plastic material and earth to preserve them before further digging is taken up in subsequent years .
The first excavations at the site were carried out by Prof BB Lal as far back as in 1948 .
On the basis of the architectural pattern and artefacts discovered during the early excavations , Prof Lal concluded that this fort city flourished between 3rd century BC and 4th century AD .
On the basis of the new findings , Ms Smith and Mr Mohanty claim that the fortified city flourished from around 5th century BC and probably lasted well after the 4th century .
" We have employed geophysical survey , systematic surface collections and selected excavations in the 4.8 km perimeter of the fortified area and studied individual houses and civic as well as domestic architecture to arrive at the figure of 25,000 , " said Ms Smith .
" If anything , it is a conservative estimate . "
' Guesswork '
But some historians and archaeologists in Orissa have expressed reservations about the claim of the two researchers .
" At best , it is a guesswork .
Without excavating the entire area of the fortified city , it is not possible to determine its population or periodicity , " said BK Rath , former director of the state archaeology department .
" The actual area excavated so far is only a minuscule part of the city .
How does one determine the size of the average family in a period about which very little historical literature or evidence is available ?
Some historians say it 's too early to say anything conclusive about the place
" Besides , the comparison with Athens is odious since it was not a fortified city like Sisupalgarh , " he said .
Mr Rath , however , gives credit to Ms Smith and Mr Mohanty for having focussed attention on the problem of encroachment that is threatening to engulf a large part of the fortified city .
The major portion of the land that constitutes the ancient city is in private possession making an archaeological study difficult .
Besides , several urban settlements have sprung up in the vicinity of the area in the last few years owing to its proximity to the city of Bhubaneswar .
With a view to preserving this important archaeological site for future research , the ASI is now contemplating asking the state government for control over the land .
Lost
" This way , we can prevent further encroachment and develop the site as a tourist attraction , " said BR Mani , a senior ASI official .
There is also some concern about the preservation of the material which has been found during the excavation .
Well - known historian Karuna Sagar Behera voiced serious concern over the preservation of material unearthed from the site .
" Its is a shame that some gold coins and terracotta pottery found at the place during the first excavation in the late 1940s were subsequently lost , " he said .
" Measures should be taken to ensure that all the material excavated are properly preserved for future research . "
The project is being supported by the National Science Foundation of India , the National Geographic Society and the Cotsen Institute of Archaeology , California .
I have been trying out various representations for higher - order abstract syntax ( HOAS ) in Haskell , with an eye towards seeing what I can actually use to get real work done and I have run into a few unexpected headaches , and a couple of neat observations .
That said , I should probably start by explaining some terminology .
Encoding a language that binds variables in higher order abstract syntax generally involves constructing an abstract data type that contains functions .
A functor for representing expressions from Berendregdt 's lambda cube in HOAS goes something like ( ignoring any consolidation of binders and sorts )
data F a = Lam a ( a -> a ) | Pi a ( a -> a ) | App a a | Star | Box
There are a number of mathematical functors that are not instances has Haskell 's Functor class , such as the above .
If you do n't believe me that F is not a functor , try deriving an instance for fmap for F that satisfies the functor laws :
fmap id == id fmap ( f . g ) == fmap f . fmap g
The reason it can't be is that fmap can really only be defined for ' covariant endofunctors on the category of types ' .
Most covariant functors used in Haskell are among the so - called ' polynomial ' functors , meaning that they can be built up out of sums , products and constants .
data Maybe a = Just a | Nil -- covariant in a data ListF t a = Cons t a | Nil -- covariant in a
That said , polynomial functors are not the only covariant functors , because you can also have some functions in the type , as long as the type over which you are parameterized only occurs in ' positive ' position .
The informal way to think about it is that every time you have a parameter on the left of an ( -> ) in the type , the occurrence switches signs , starting positive , so for some Functors , you can have functions , as long as the parameter occurs only in positive positions .
Most of us know some instances of Functor that are covariant , but not polynomial such as :
newtype Reader e a = Reader ( e -> a ) -- covariant in a newtype Cont r a = Cont ( ( a -> r ) -> r ) -- covariant in a
On the other hand the following functors are not covariant , because the parameter occurs in negative position somewhere in the type .
data ContravariantSample a = Bar ( a -> Int ) -- contravariant data InvariantSample a = Baz ( a -> a ) -- invariant
You could go through and define a ' ContravariantFunctor ' type class if you really want :
class ContravariantFunctor f where cofmap :: ( b -> a ) -> f a -> f b
But for HOAS you tend to need terms like Lam ( a -> a ) that have both positive and negative occurrences of a to handle variable binding , so we 'll skip to a definition for an invariant functor , which we 'll choose to call an exponential functor in contrast to a polynomial , because category theory types like to refer to functions as exponentials , and use the notation ba to denote a function of type ( a -> b ) .
class ExpFunctor f where xmap :: ( a -> b ) -> ( b -> a ) -> f a -> f b
Now , obviously every Functor is trivially an ExpFunctor , witnessed by the default definition :
xmapF :: Functor f => ( a -> b ) -> ( b -> a ) -> f a -> f b xmapF = const .
fmap
And just as people are wont to do with Functor and Monad you could argue that in an ideal world the definition for Functor should change to class ExpFunctor f =>
Functor f , but since not that many people use these things , I doubt anyone would be interested in the change .
This is a sufficiently general definition that you can construct instances for exponential data types such as :
instance ExpFunctor
F where xmap f g ( Lam t k ) = Lam ( f t ) ( f . k . g ) xmap f g ( Pi t k ) = Pi ( f t ) ( f . k . g ) xmap f g ( App a b ) = App ( f a ) ( f b ) xmap f g Star = Star xmap f g Box = Box
As an aside we can define exponential functor composition , just like functor composition if we want to :
newtype O f g e = Comp { deComp :: f ( g e ) } instance ( Functor f , Functor g ) =>
Functor ( f ` O` g ) where fmap f = Comp . fmap ( fmap f ) .
deComp instance ( ExpFunctor f , ExpFunctor g ) =>
ExpFunctor ( f ` O` g ) where xmap f g = Comp .
xmap ( xmap f g ) ( xmap g f ) .
deComp
Typically we 'd like to represent the recursive part of a functor with another ADT .
This makes it easier to go through and apply things like catamorphisms and anamorphisms to them ( see Functional Programming with Bananas , Lenses , Envelopes and Barbed Wire for more information ) .
Catamorphisms are sometimes called bananas because of the notation from that paper .
A typical newtype used for explicit isorecursion is :
newtype Nu f =
Nu { old :: f ( Nu f ) } -- so its not funny
Now if f is a good old fashioned Functor , we can define a pretty straightforward idea of a catamorphism over Nu f .
I want to be able to handle ExpFunctor 's later , so we 'll leave the Functor constraint off of the class and move it to the instance .
class Cata f t | t -> f where cata :: ( f a -> a ) -> t -> a instance Functor f => Cata f ( Nu f ) where cata f = f . fmap ( cata f ) .
old
And given cata and fmap one can go through and build up a whole host of other recursion schemes , paramorphisms , zygomorphisms , histomorphisms , generalized catamorphisms , ... ; the menagerie is quite forbidding and these can be used to tear apart covariant functors with reckless abandon .
With the power of a paramorphism you rederive the notion of general recursion , and so you can basically write any recursive function you want .
( On the coalgebra side of the house there are anamorphisms , apomorphisms , and all sorts of other beasts for effectively generating covariant functors )
You can also use them on contravariant functors with some work , because it turns out you can ' square ' a contravariant functor to derive a covariant one .
newtype Square f a = Square ( f ( f a ) ) instance ContravariantFunctor f => Functor ( Square f ) where fmap f = Square .
cofmap ( cofmap f ) .
unSquare
The problem is that once you weaken from a Functor all the way to an ExpFunctor , most of that machinery goes out the window .
Cue the arrival of Erik Meijer and Graham Hutton .
They derived a kind of catamorphism for exponential functors back in 1995 in Bananas in Space .
cataMH :: ExpFunctor f => ( f a -> a ) -> ( a -> f a ) ->
Nu f -> a cataMH f g = f . xmap ( cataMH f g ) ( anaMH f g ) . old anaMH :: ExpFunctor f => ( f a -> a ) -> ( a -> f a ) -> a ->
Nu f anaMH f g = Nu . xmap ( anaMH f g ) ( cataMH f g ) . g
Note the similarity and differences between cataMH and the cata described above .
In order to satisfy the type of xmap you need not just an operation to fold your structure , but you need an ' unfold ' step as well ; to run the catamorphism backwards to satisfy the type of xmap , cataMH requires not just an ' algebra structure ' ( f a -> a ) for folding , but it also requires an inverse ' coalgebra structure ' ( a -> f a ) to unfold what it just did .
In other words , to use the Meijer / Hutton catamorphism to write a pretty printer , you have to write a parser as well ; to use it to eval , you must also be able to reify values back into programs .
Unfortunately we wo n't be able to get an instance of Cata out of the Meijer / Hutton catamorphism .
With it in hand , you can write a pretty powerful HOAS representation , but there are some huge caveats to the Meijer - Hutton catamorphism :
Some catamorphisms do n't have inverses !
Since a function in your embedded language is represented as a function in the ' meta - language '
Haskell , HOAS functions have the ability to host ' bad terms ' that do things that the underlying embedded language can't do like use case to inspect if they were given a lambda or an application as an argument on terms passed to them and do different things accordingly .
Using the inverse can be very slow
Fortunately , a year later Leonidas Fegaras and Tim Sheard realized that the main use of the ' unfold step ' above was to just undo the damage caused by the fold step and that a full inverse was n't needed , just a place holder ' place ' such that serves as a right - inverse such that :
cata f . place = id
The problem the reduces to the question of how to define place .
Fegaras and Sheard were willing ( and able ) to change every functor to include an extra member name Place and then define as part of each catamorphism that cata f ( Place x ) = x .
They then ensured that Place was n't abused by the programmer by a complicated type system that we really do n't have access to in Haskell .
So , if you are able to go into some as - yet - unwritten language where their tagged types exist , then your problems are solved for the most part and you can write general recursion over exponential functors without impossible to find inverses , bad terms or expensive inverse operations .
A compromise is to realize as much of the Fegaras / Sheard vision as you can reasonably type in Haskell .
As noted by Weirich and Washburn , you can move the ' Place ' term into the explicit recursion ADT yielding something like :
data Rec f a = Roll ( f ( Rec f a ) ) | Place a
This obviates the need to modify every single base functor you use to include a Place term -- admittedly at the cost of introducing another case analysis where a bottom can occur because the recursive data type is no longer a newtype .
We can then readily almost define a catamorphism for this type - ignoring the extra ' a ' term in Rec f a for the nonce .
cataFS :: ExpFunctor f => ( f a -> a ) -> Rec f a -> a cataFS f ( Roll x ) = f ( xmap ( cataFS f ) Place x ) cataFS f ( Place x ) = x
As an aside to build terms to feed to either of these recursive forms , you need to inject values by wrapping them in the recursive constructor :
lamMH :: Nu F -> ( Nu F -> Nu F ) ->
Nu F lamMH t k = Nu ( Lam t k ) lamFS :: Rec F a -> ( Rec F a -> Rec F a ) ->
Rec
F a lamFS t k = Roll ( Lam t k )
You 'll note a lot of similarity here , and also a superfluous term ' a ' floating around in the Fegaras Sheard definition , which is necessary for Place to work its magic .
Since I want to compare a few different ways to represent HOAS here , lets define :
class Rollable f t | t -> f where roll :: f t -> t instance Rollable f ( Nu f ) where roll =
Nu instance Rollable f ( Rec f a ) where roll = Roll
Then we can use one function for either recursion scheme that we want to use for our particular functor ' F ' .
lam :: Rollable F t => t -> ( t -> t ) -> t lam t f = roll ( Lam t f ) app :: Rollable F t => t -> t -> t app f a = roll ( App f a ) ...
The problem then comes down to the fact that when working with the Fegaras / Sheard form , you have a superfluous term ' a ' that can bite you when you go to apply two different catamorphisms to your HOAS term .
The first will fix your type to the return type of its catamorphism and you 'll be done for when you attempt to apply a different catamorphism that needs a different type .
One fix , as noted by Washburn and Weirich is to quantify over the a with an explicit forall when working with the Fegaras / Sheard catamorphism .
This has the nice side effect that it prevents illegal uses of ' Place ' .
Moreover , that explicit quantifier allows you to use different catamorphisms over the term .
So , now instead of being interested in terms of the type ' Rec f a ' we want terms of the type ' forall a .
Rec f a' , but then we run into another problem !
You can't define a typeclass instance for a type that has a leading explicit ' forall ' quantifier , and I for one really like to be able to use typeclasses like Show , Eq , etc over my types .
However , Shae Erisson and I noticed the fact that you can define the following strange , beautiful but legal newtype to box up the quantifier :
newtype ForAll f = ForAll { runForAll :: forall a. f a }
This lets us define a better catamorphism which does n't suffer from the monomorphism problems that the previous version did , and finally we get an instance of Cata for the FegarasSheard catamorphism .
instance ExpFunctor f => Cata f ( ForAll ( Rec f ) ) where cata f = cataFS f .
runForAll
A lambda calculus pretty printer in the style of Washburn and Weirich's Boxes Go Bananas goes something like the following ( although you need - fallow - undecidable - instances in GHC .
instance Cata F ( ForAll t ) =>
Show ( ForAll t ) where show x = cata phi x vars where phi ( Lam t k ) ( v:vars ) = " ( \\ \\ " ++ v ++ " : " + t vars ++ " . " ++ k ( const v ) vars ++ " ) " phi ( App a b ) vars = " ( " ++ a vars ++ " " ++ b vars ++ " ) " ... vars = [ [ i ] | i < - [ ' a '..'z ' ] ] ++ [ i : show j | j <- [ 1 .. ] , i <- [ ' a '..'z ' ] ]
All is not roses , however .
We still have n't ruled out bad functions that inspect the functor they are given .
Washburn and Weirich go off and change the form of the recursion data type yet again to yield an explicit elimination form with some benefits and costs , which I can represent here as :
type Rec' f a = ( f a -> a ) -> a
As an interesting aside , you may notice some similarities to the type of the continuation monad :
newtype Cont r a = Cont ( ( a -> r ) -> r )
type Rec ' ' w a = Cont a ( w a )
I 'll have more to say about this curious use of a monad later on , but unfortunately Rec and Rec ' ' can't be used with ForAll as they stand , so we have to introduce yet another newtype so that they can be partially applied -- thankfully these are free at runtime !
newtype Elim f a = Elim { unElim :: Cont a ( f a ) } elim = Elim .
Cont runElim = runCont .
unElim
Now , we can define the relevant typeclasses needed to support all the Fegaras and Sheard machinery for this type :
instance ExpFunctor f => Rollable f ( Elim f a ) where roll x = elim $ \f -> f $ xmap ( cata f ) place x instance Placeable Elim where place = elim .
const instance Cata f ( ForAll ( Elim f ) ) where cata f x = runElim ( runForAll x ) f
After all of that , we basically get the ' iteration library interface ' of Boxes Go Bananas packaged up so that we can play with these representations more or less interchangeably .
Now for the problem .
Weirich and Washburn 's encoding as an elimination form protect the user from bad case analysis by denying you the ability to inspect terms with case at all .
This is immediately apparent by the signature of Rec' f a above :
In their encoding :
cata x f = f x
In other words , the only thing you can do to a term is apply a catamorphism to it .
They even say as much somewhere in the paper .
No sweat , we can go rederive all of the other stuff thats defined in terms of catamorphism , right ?
paramorphisms , zygomorphisms , histomorphisms , generalized catamorphisms , and then we can do anything we want , right ?
Unfortunately , here is where we run out of steam .
A catamorphism is n't strong enough to encode general recursion without fmap .
In order to rederive general recursion from a catamorphism you need at least a paramorphism .
Normally we can define a paramorphism in terms of our catamorphism with the use of fmap , but as we are working over merely an exponential functor we do not have fmap !
I ran headlong into this wall , while trying to derive a minimalist dependently - typed lambda calculus implementation using the Boxes Go Bananas encoding , because typechecking requires normal form reduction , which could be cleanly encoded as a paramorphism , but which could n't seem to be represented in the Boxes Go Bananas style .
Depending on how bad we want to be , we can get out of the Washburn / Weirich or Fegaras / Sheard sandboxes and into one of the others .
Though curiously we can't get back out of the Meijer / Hutton - style unless we have a full Functor .
reroll :: ( Cata f t , Rollable f t' ) => t -> t ' reroll = cata roll -- | safe $ $ hoas - expression safe :: ( forall a . Elim f a ) ->
ForAll ( Elim f ) safe = ForAll -- | unsafe $ $ hoas - expression unsafe :: ( forall a. Rec f a ) ->
ForAll ( Rec f ) unsafe = ForAll -- | cast to Meijer / Hutton toMH :: ( Cata f t , Functor f ) => t ->
Nu f toMH = cata Nu -- | cast to Washburn / Weirich toWW :: ( Cata f t , ExpFunctor f ) => t -> ForAll ( Elim f ) toWW x = ForAll ( reroll x ) -- | cast to Fegaras / Sheard toFS :: ( Cata f t , ExpFunctor f ) => t ->
ForAll ( Rec f ) to FS x = ForAll ( reroll x )
It seems we can get to a point where the System fragment of Haskell protects us from ourselves , preventing bad case analysis and abuse of the place term , but in the process we give up general recursion .
For now , I think I have to hop out to at least the Fegaras and Sheard encoding to get any work done .

In the wake of recent press reports about the junior high school student allegedly raped by a US marine , there have been many angry foreign residents of Japan complaining that the Japanese media are making this into a bigger deal than it is ; that rapes occur every day and that the media would not respond as zealously should it have been a Japanese national accused of this crime .
There have been cries that this type of media reaction ultimately boils down to xenophobia and they also fail to forget the “ innocent until proven guilty ” law .
However , although it can be said that the Japanese media harangue suspects before they are tried , many forget that this US military rape issue is on a wider scale .
Firstly , there are political implications – the Okinawan officials have voiced their anger and Prime Minister Fukuda , appearing before a Diet committee Tuesday , described the incident as “ unforgivable . ”
For anti-base Okinawans , such incidents are important in the campaign to get Tokyo either to ask the US to leave , or get more compensation for carrying the military burden : 70 % of US military personnel in Japan are in Okinawa .
The issue is also historical .
This new case has rekindled memories of the 1995 gang rape of a 12 - year - old Okinawa girl by three US servicemen , an incident that triggered mass resentment against the US military presence in Okinawa .
The problem was that the US military was not made by law to hand over the suspected rapist to Japanese authorities and the struggle that the Japanese police faced in the handover caused outrage from Japan .
The US marines refused to handover rape suspects unless they are indicted and this refusal could be seen time and time again through the many rape cases that Okinawa has faced throughout the years and gives the impression that the US forces would overtly protect their troops regardless of morals .
Similarly , when a US army helicopter crashed in to Okinawa International University a few years ago , local police were not allowed to be involved in the investigation .
This time , the US forces have announced that a task force will review and reinforce its sexual harassment and assault prevention programs but cleaning up the reputation of the US forces in Japan will be near impossible should a repetition of cases like these continue .

The " alien " is actually a blurry detail in a huge panoramic photograph snapped on the edge of Mars ' Gusev crater by NASA 's Spirit rover in early November , and posted on NASA 's Web site on Jan .
2 .
Naturally , it took the Photoshop skills of dedicated bloggers to find the " humanoid . "

If that does n't work , try this .
The figure is near the bottom left corner .
" NASA scientists have been puzzled by the peculiarly life - like image , " declared the Times of London , despite the apparent fact that no one from NASA has had any comment .
The skeptical Web site BadAstronomy.com , however , scoffed , " Puhlllleeeeze .
A man ?
It 's a tiny rock only a few inches high .
It 's only a few feet from the rover ! "
Other British papers saw the humo ( u ) r in the story , with the Sun theorizing that it was Detective Gene Hunt , the drunken , sexist policeman from the BBC time - traveling crime series " Life on Mars . "
" It 's Usama bin Laden ! " declared one Times of London commenter .
" All this time we thought he was in Pakistan . "

The changes that have occurred at CNN in just the past few months is alarming .
We all know that Faux News , The Republican Leaning Channel , has constantly bent , spun , and distorted the truth since Bush came into power ; ABC was n’t much better , but CNN used to be the one channel where an individual could actually find some news minus all of the government spin and propaganda .
Then they hired Glenn Beck , a right - wing Rethuglican who is attempting to catch - up with the likes of Ann Coulter , Rush Limbaugh , and the crowd at Faux News , headquarters for fascist USA ’s propaganda system .
This evening , I glanced at CNN ’s Political Ticker and read an article in regard to Mitt Romney and his unbridled disgust that Vladimir Putin had been chosen as Time Magazine ’s Man of the Year .
Reading the article and knowing what ’s happening to our own country was what was really disgusting , especially these quotes by Mitt Romney and John McCain that CNN does n’t discuss or offer commentary to the otherwise :
Romney : Man of Year choice ‘ disgusting ’
Excerpts : “ You know , he imprisoned his political opponents .
There have been a number of highly suspicious murders , ” Romney said on Beck ’s radio show .
“ He has squelched public dissent and free press . ”
And to suggest that someone like that is the Man of the Year is really disgusting .
I ’m just appalled . ”
“ Clearly General Petraeus is the person , or one of a few people , who would certainly merit that designation , ” the former Massachusetts governor added .
“ I noticed that Time Magazine made President Putin the Time Magazine ‘ Man of the Year , ’ ” McCain said , according to NBC .
“ I understand that probably , but my man of the year is one Gen. David Petraeus , our general who has brought success in Iraq . ”
( Items in green are those I added emphasis to . )
MORE
If only Vladimir Putin was the only one one that “ squelched public dissent and free press ” we would be OK , but anyone that gets their news from the Internet knows that George W. Bush has done the same thing , yet Romney criticizes Putin on the matter and does n’t say a word about our own cowardly press , or the many times that peaceful protesters have been arrested , and others added to a “ terrorist watch list ” just because they disagreed with the government .
You will also note that CNN also remains silent wile Romney makes quips that equally apply to the United States .
To add insult to injury , John McCain goes on to say that General Petraeus should be man of the year because he “ brought success in Iraq . ”
Oh , so Iraq in now a “ success ” ; by what parameters does Mitt Romney or John McCain decide that our mission in Iraq has been successful ?
According to icasualties.org , fourteen ( 14 ) U.S. soldiers have died in Iraq so far this month - and it is n’t over yet .
How many U.S. lives per month add - up to a “ success in Iraq ? ”
What about Basra ?
Based on what I ’ve read , Basra is no more of a success than anywhere else , except US troops are n’t there , and now the British are also gone .
This is an excerpt from Time Magazine online :
What the British Left Behind in Basra SIIC and the Sadrists are major players in the national government , and earlier this month a senior U.S. official laid the blame for the “ mess ” in Basra at their feet .
“ This government , the Shi’a parties , have failed to act responsibly , ” the official told reporters .
And while he pointed to signs that the various factions were trying to bring the situation under control — borne out to some extent by a recent announcement of a truce in the city — it is unlikely that those factions are ready to lay down their arms and cooperate .
Basra Province contains the lion ’s share of Iraq ’s oil and its only port .
It ’s a tempting prize for groups that have shown more enthusiasm for fighting than for compromise .
So Basra will continue to be a high - stakes front in the intra-Shi ’a fight for control of southern Iraq .
That fight has largely escaped the notice of Americans — both because U.S. troops are not on the front lines and because the violence has not reached the appalling levels seen in other parts of the country .
But the violence in southern Iraq gives the lie to the idea that simply relinquishing control of a province constitutes progress .
The local governments and security forces in these provinces do not represent some ideal of unified Iraqi control so much as they represent control by one faction or another .
Assassinations of provincial governors and battles involving the Iraqi police are manifestations of militia violence , not evidence that the Iraqi government is facing down terrorists or militants .

For the first time ever , NASA will beam a song -- The Beatles ' " Across the Universe " -- directly into deep space at 7 p.m. EST on Feb .
4 .
The transmission over NASA 's Deep Space Network will commemorate the 40th anniversary of the day The Beatles recorded the song , as well as the 50th anniversary of NASA 's founding and the group 's beginnings .
Two other anniversaries also are being honored :
The launch 50 years ago this week of Explorer 1 , the first U.S. satellite , and the founding 45 years ago of the Deep Space Network , an international network of antennas that supports missions to explore the universe .
The transmission is being aimed at the North Star , Polaris , which is located 431 light years away from Earth .
The song will travel across the universe at a speed of 186,000 miles per second .
Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney expressed excitement that the tune , which was principally written by fellow Beatle John Lennon , was being beamed into the cosmos .
" Amazing !
Well done , NASA ! " McCartney said in a message to the space agency .
" Send my love to the aliens .
All the best , Paul . "
Lennon 's widow , Yoko Ono , characterized the song 's transmission as a significant event .
" I see that this is the beginning of the new age in which we will communicate with billions of planets across the universe , " she said .
It is not the first time Beatles music has been used by NASA ; in November 2005 , McCartney performed the song " Good Day Sunshine " during a concert that was transmitted to the International Space Station .
" Here Comes the Sun , " " Ticket to Ride " and " A Hard Day 's Night " are among other Beatles ' songs that have been played to wake astronaut crews in orbit .
Feb. 4 has been declared " Across The Universe Day " by Beatles fans to commemorate the anniversaries .
As part of the celebration , the public around the world has been invited to participate in the event by simultaneously playing the song at the same time it is transmitted by NASA .
Many of the senior NASA scientists and engineers involved in the effort are among the group 's biggest fans .
" I 've been a Beatles fan for 45 years – as long as the Deep Space Network has been around , " said Dr. Barry Geldzahler , the network 's program executive at NASA Headquarters , Washington .
" What a joy , especially considering that ' Across the Universe ' is my personal favorite Beatles song . "

Chronologically - challenged Brits think that Robin Hood , Biggles and Sherlock Holmes were real people while questioning whether the likes of Winston Churchill , Montgomery of Alamein and Mahatma Gandhi ever walked this Earth .
The shocking findings were uncovered by British TV station UKTV Gold , which is funny , as anyone who watches the channel knows that it broadcasts little else but " historical " material .
Over two thirds of Brits reckoned King Arthur was an actual real person , as opposed to a confection of half - remembered Celtic mythology embroidered by medieval writers .
Almost as many – 58 per cent – reckoned that Sherlock Holmes was a real personage , apparently oblivious to the fact that his " biography " is found in the fiction section of the local library .
( Er , what 's a library ? )
Robin Hood was described as authentic by 51 per cent of respondents – presumably because he's got an airport named after him - while 47 per cent seemed to think Eleanor Rigby was actually the fifth Beatle .
When it came to real historical figures , Richard the Lionheart was described as a myth by 47 per cent – which is bizarre as he is about the only real character in the Robin Hood myth .
Winston Churchill was doubted by 23 per cent , with a similar number thinking Florence Nightingale is nothing but a figment of a scriptwriter 's fevered imagination .
UKTV rejects the suggestion that UK citizens ' inability to distinguish fact from fiction bodes badly for the country .
Rather , it chose to claim that the figures are a simply a " fascinating insight " into the role that crap popular TV , film and fiction has had in this country over the last 50 years .
UKTV itself runs a channel devoted to history , which uses large chunks of its broadcast time to reruns , particularly of Sharpe , a saga set in the Napoleonic era detailing the exploits of fictional officer Richard Sharpe .
Perhaps it is thanks to this that a mere four per cent of the population think the Duke of Wellington is a fictional construct .
NB : UKTV Gold found that 34 per cent of the British public thought that Dick Turpin was real , making him number six in the chart of fictional characters .
The only problem being he was real , although he has been the subject of a number of TV series and a cracking Carry On movie . ®
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Prices of existing single - family homes slumped for the 18th month in a row in January , for a record annual drop , according to Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller home price index released on Tuesday .

The composite month - over - month index of 20 metropolitan areas fell 2.4 percent to 180.65 from December , bringing the measure down 10.7 percent from a year earlier and 12.5 percent from its July 2006 peak .
The 12 - month drop was the latest in a string of records for the statistic set as the housing market slumped .
The previous annual drop , in December , was 9.1 percent .
The latest annual decline was just over half of the 20 percent total decline expected by S&P ’s chief economist , David Wyss , said David Blitzer , a managing director at S&P .
Wyss expects prices to hit bottom in early 2009 , Blitzer said in a conference call .
“ Unfortunately , house prices continue to decline and the decline continues to be really nationwide , ” said Blitzer , who chairs S&P ’s index committee .
Falling home prices have broken the back of the U.S. housing market , which during the housing boom was increasingly financed with risky loans .
Homeowners , especially those with little or no equity in their property , are facing a record foreclosures , threatening the economy that some economists say is in recession .
House price depreciation accelerated in February , according to FBR Investment Management analyst Michael Youngblood , citing data from data provider LoanPerformance .
S&P said its composite month - over - month index of 10 metropolitan areas fell 2.3 percent to 196.06 for an 11.4 percent year - over - year drop .
That was also a record , surpassing the previous month ’s drop of 9.8 percent .
Home prices in Las Vegas and Miami fell the most of any region , at 19.3 percent year - over - year .
Phoenix , San Diego and Los Angeles also suffered double - digit drops , the S&P index shows .
“ The weakness is not contained to the bubble areas , ” said Michelle Meyer , an economist at investment bank Lehman Brothers in New York .
“ It has spread to the rest of the nation . ”
Another housing index published on Tuesday , from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , showed home prices fell nationally about 1.1 percent from December to January , and 3 percent compared with a year ago .
The OFHEO index tracks data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two largest providers of funding for U.S. home loans .
The S&P indexes include home sales financed by loans that may fall outside Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines , but are limited to 20 metropolitan areas .
Matthew Dillon posted another HAMMER filesystem update .
In this one , he goes into the current state and talks about a bit of what ’s planned for this filesystem ( boot support – yay ! ) .
He later went into details of historical filesystem access and snapshot usage .
An interesting point from a recent commit : a HAMMER filesystem is stable enough to use as /usr / obj during a buildworld .

At this year ’s CES , a company named Bug Labs introduced a new concept gadget , the BUG .
It ’s a modular device that can be adapted to your unique needs and preferences , and can even take the place of many of your most essential electronics .
In need of a phone , media player or digital camera ?
No problem , the Bug can do the job .
What about a GPS , computer , lawnmower or light saber ?
You can count on the Bug .
Ok , the Bug wo n’t really cut people in half or mow your lawn , but you get the idea … right ?
The principle behind the device is simple .
First , you start with a base module , the BUGBase , which is composed of a processor , some memory , a small display , a few input / output ports and a battery .
Then , if you want your BUG to accomplish a new function , just add the correspondent module .
Yes , we know , some of the smart phones out there can do all of the things we enumerated previously , but the beauty behind this concept is that the Bug is entirely open - source .
This means if you are a DIY kind of person and have basic technical knowledge , you should be able to make your own modules and add them to the BUGBase .
There ’s an added benefit :
You do n’t need to have a spendy contract with Cingular or another big - business wireless provider , one of the disadvantages of smart devices like the iPhone .
For the software side , all coding is made though Bug Labs ’ SDK , which can be downloaded for no charge from their site .
One thing is for sure , the BUG is n’t for everybody , but if you ’re a true computer or gadget lover , and have some Java skills in your background , then you ’ll definitely want to get your hands on one of these .
The base bundle sells for $ 549 and comes with the BUGbase and the BugMotion , BugLocate and the BUGcam2 MP modules .
You may find this a bit expensive , but hey , this should n’t stop the truly passionate geeks among you .
Russia 's First Deputy Prime Minister and presidential candidate Dmitry Medvedev , who is also chairman of Gazprom , speaks during a visit to the Volokolamskaya compressor plant outside Moscow February 11 , 2008 .

Novosti
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - President Vladimir Putin ’s preferred successor , Dmitry Medvedev , continues to dominate Russia ’s presidential election race with 62 percent support , an opinion poll showed on Tuesday .
Medvedev has declined to debate with any of the three other candidates but enjoys strong backing from both Putin and state - controlled media .
He leads the field by over 50 percentage points , three weeks before the March 2 vote , according to state - owned pollster VTsIOM .
Medvedev ’s rating was down one percentage point from the last VTsIOM poll published a week ago , but still far ahead of his nearest challenger , Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov , whose support gained one point to 8 percent .
Nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky was in third place with 7 percent and Andrei Bogdanov of the small Democratic Party fourth with 1 percent .
The survey was conducted on Feb. 9-10 among 1,600 Russian voters in 46 regions and has a 3.4 percent margin of error .
Sharks are disappearing from the world 's oceans .
The numbers of many large shark species have declined by more than half due to increased demand for shark fins and meat , recreational shark fisheries , as well as tuna and swordfish fisheries , where millions of sharks are taken as bycatch each year .
Now , the global status of large sharks has been assessed by the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , which is widely recognized as a highly comprehensive , scientific - based information source on the threat status of plants and animals .
" As a result of high and mostly unrestricted fishing pressure , many sharks are now considered to be at risk of extinction , " explained Julia Baum , a member of the IUCN 's Shark Specialist Group who will be speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Conference in Boston on February 17 .
" Of particular concern is the scalloped hammerhead shark , an iconic coastal species , which will be listed on the 2008 IUCN Red List as globally ' endangered ' due to overfishing and high demand for its valuable fins in the shark fin trade , " added Baum , who is an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
Baum pointed out that fishing for sharks in international waters is unrestricted , and she supports a recently adopted United Nations resolution calling for immediate shark catch limits as well as a meaningful ban on shark finning ( the practice of removing only a shark 's fins and dumping the still live but now helpless shark into the ocean to die ) .
Research at Dalhousie University over the past five years , conducted by Baum and the late Ransom Myers , demonstrated the magnitude of shark declines in the northwest Atlantic Ocean .
All species the team looked at had declined by over 50 per cent since the early 1970s .
For many large coastal shark species , the declines were much greater : tiger , scalloped hammerhead , bull and dusky shark populations have all plummeted by more than 95 per cent .
ABC : Fired officer claims woman's ' fall ' gave her black eyes , broken teeth David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This After Angela Garbarino was arrested in Shreveport , Louisiana last November on suspicion of drunk driving , she wound up lying on the police station floor in a pool of her own blood with two black eyes , a broken nose , two broken teeth , and other cuts and bruises .
Garbarino says that Officer Wiley Willis beat her up after turning off the police video camera .
Willis 's attorney insists that Garbarino slipped and fell when Willis tried to prevent her from leaving the room .
However , Garbarino says that the extent of her injuries are proof that she was beaten .
The police video obtained by ABC News shows Garbarino demanding the right to make a phone call .
" I have the right to call somebody right now and I know that , " she yells .
Officer Willis instead begins handcuffing her .
She wiggles away , he pulls her back sharply by her wrists , and she hits the wall and falls on the floor .
Willis pushes her down into a chair three successive times as she repeatedly stands up again , increasingly distraught and screaming , " Get away from me ! "
Willis is finally shown leaning over her and asking , " Do you understand me ? " to which she replies , " Yeah , I understand . "
Willis then walks over and turns off the camera .
When the video resumes , Garbarino is lying in the floor in a pool of her own blood .
There is an apparent cut in what ABC aired , but according to KTBS in Shreveport , Willis turns Garbarino on her back , telling her , " Lay down , dont move , " and she replies , " I can't believe you just did what you just did .
I really can't . "
Willis has since been dismissed from the police force .
KTBS states that " Willis was fired by Police Chief Henry Whitehorn earlier this month for how he treated Garbarino during the whole episode , not for her injuries . "
Willis is appealing his dismissal , and his attorney insists that his client was following procedures in turning off the camera .
According to KTBS , " Authorities familiar with Shreveport police policy said a person is read their rights and gets an explanation of what 's going to happen next .
That is followed by a sobriety test .
If the person refuses , the officer can turn off the tape and take them to an adjoining room , handcuff them to a bench , fill out the paperwork and charge them . "
However , experts suggested to ABC that Willis should have called for female backup when Garbarino began resisting .
One criminologist stated , " I think we have a situation where the arrested person is refusing to cooperate and the police officer apparently overreacted . "

Kosovo Serbs rally on their side of the main bridge in Mitrovica
Enlarge Image
EU states meeting in Brussels agreed that Kosovo should not set a precedent for other states , with Spain and others concerned about separatism .
Serbia has recalled its ambassador to the US in protest at recognition and threatened to withdraw other envoys .
Its president is to ask the UN to condemn the independence declaration .
Boris Tadic will ask the Security Council to annul the independence declaration and Belgrade is counting on Russia to veto Kosovo joining the UN as a new nation .
In Belgrade , about 10,000 students marched in protest , and Serb enclaves inside Kosovo also saw anti-independence rallies .
Serbian security forces were driven out of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign aimed at halting the violent repression of ethnic Albanian separatists .
The province has been under UN administration and Nato protection since then .
Pledges of support
Monday saw Washington formally recognise Kosovo as a " sovereign and independent state " .
STANCE ON RECOGNITION For : Germany , Italy , France , UK , Austria , US , Turkey , Albania , Afghanistan Against : Russia , Spain , Romania , Slovakia , Cyprus
In Brussels , pledges of recognition came after Monday 's meeting of foreign ministers of EU states .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said a desire to establish a unified position after " the disunity of the 1990s " had dominated the meeting in Brussels .
As for the UK 's formal recognition , he added :
" The plan is to do it this evening and diplomatic relations will then be established ... and in the course of the next days and weeks all the items of full diplomatic representation will be put into place . "
KOSOVO PROFILE

Full text : Kosovo declaration
In pictures : Celebrations
After a lot of soul - searching , the EU forged a semblance of unity , BBC European Affairs correspondent Oana Lungescu writes .
It adopted a compromise proposal from Spain , one of several countries which argue that Kosovo 's independence is a breach of international law and will boost separatists everywhere .
To ease those concerns , the EU 's statement says that Kosovo does not set a precedent and leaves it up to each member state to decide on their future relations .
Most EU countries led by the biggest among them will take this as a green light for recognition , our correspondent notes .
Some of the EU states which did not recognise independence have experienced separatist unrest of their own , such as Spain with its Basque region and Cyprus with its Greek - Turkish division .
The EU earlier agreed to send about 2,000 police , justice and civil administration officials to oversee Kosovo and help develop the province 's institutions .
' False state '
Speaking to Serbian TV from New York , the Serbian president , Mr Tadic said he intended to " demand from [ UN Secretary General ]
Ban Ki-moon the immediate annulment of the independence proclamation by the non-existent state in Kosovo " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is an ugly victory for demographic warfare SEQ , London
The recall of the Serbian ambassador to Washington was announced to parliament in Belgrade by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica .
" America violated international law for its own interests , " he said .
It was , he added , the " first urgent measure of the government which will be implemented in all countries that recognise unilateral independence " .
Serbia 's interior ministry filed criminal charges on Monday against Kosovo Albanian leaders instrumental in proclaiming independence .
It accused Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and two others of proclaiming a " false state " on Serbian territory .
Chanting and playing music , students marched in Belgrade under a huge banner reading " Kosovo is a part of Serbia and Serbia is a part of the world " .
The scenes were in stark contrast to riots that took place in the capital a few hours earlier when a few hundred people , mainly football hooligans , went on the rampage clashing with police and stoning embassies , the BBC's Nick Hawton reports .
The marchers did not say what route they were taking
Exiles on march More than 100 Tibetan exiles in India have been barred by from marching to Tibet to protest against China holding the Olympics , Indian police say .
The marchers left Dharamsala on the 49th anniversary of the Dalai Lama 's escape from Tibet after a failed uprising against Chinese rule .
But police in Dharamsala say they have been prevented from leaving the area .
The Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader , has called for greater pressure on China over its human rights record .
In Nepal , some 1,000 Tibetan exiles have clashed with police in Kathmandu while trying to march to the Chinese embassy .
Escape " We have issued a restraining order to the marchers not to leave the Kangra district and if they violate the order then all necessary actions will be taken , " district police chief Atul Phuljile told the AFP news agency .
In pictures : Tibet protests Mr Phuljile said the order had been issued at the behest of the central government in Delhi .
The planned six - month march from India to Tibet began on Monday to coincide with the anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet that forced the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader , into exile in 1959 .
The Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader , has called for greater pressure on China over its human rights record .
Tibet activists are hoping to use China 's hosting of the Olympics to publicise their cause .
' Great impact '
Before the marchers in India set off , the Dalai Lama said he approved of China hosting the games because it provided the world with a chance to pressurise the Beijing government to uphold the Olympic ideals of freedom of speech and equality .
" China should prove herself a good host by providing these freedoms .
Therefore , besides sending their athletes , the international community should remind the Chinese government of these issues , " the Dalai Lama said .
The Dalai Lama heads the Tibetan government in exile in Dharamsala , a northern Indian hill town .
The exiles say Tibetan identity has been suppressed
In hard - hitting remarks , the Dalai Lama also said that " repression continues to increase with numerous , unimaginable and gross violations of human rights , denial of religious freedom and the politicisation of religious issues " by China .
Tibetan exile groups say the march was one of several protest events in the run-up to the games in Beijing in August .
Organisers say they represent tens of thousands of Tibetan exiles , and want to draw attention to what they see as Chinese suppression of Tibetan identity .
Organisers had not given details of where or when they were going to try to cross into Tibet .
Tear gas Meanwhile police in the Nepalese capital , Kathmandu , say that up to 80 protesters have been arrested .
Eyewitnesses told the BBC between 1,000 to 3,000 Tibetan exiles and their supporters gathered at a large Tibetan Buddhist shrine , including many monks and nuns .
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathmandu says that police barred the way when some protesters tried to march towards the Chinese embassy , which lies in a different suburb .
Protests by Tibetans have also been held in other parts of the world , including the Greek capital , Athens , where protesters were prevented from getting into the site of Olympia , the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games .

What are these ?
London
AT first glance , it does n’t seem tragic that our leaders do n’t study Latin anymore .
But it is no coincidence that the professionalization of politics — which encourages budding politicians to think of education as mere career preparation — has occurred during an age of weak rhetoric , shifting moral values , clumsy grammar and a terror of historical references and eternal values that the Romans could teach us a thing or two about .
As they themselves might have said , “ Roma urbs aeterna ; Latina lingua aeterna . ” *
None of the leading presidential candidates majored in Latin .
Hillary Clinton studied political science at Wellesley , as did Barack Obama at Columbia .
Rudy Giuliani had a minor brush with the language during four years of theology at Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School in Brooklyn when he toyed with becoming a priest .
But then he went on to major in guess what ?
Political science .
How things have changed since the founding fathers .
Of the 7,000 books originally in Thomas Jefferson ’s library , only a couple of dozen are still at Monticello .
The rest were sold off by his descendants , and eventually bought back by the Library of Congress .
The best - thumbed of those remaining — on a glassed - in shelf in Jefferson ’s study — is a copy of Virgil ’s “ Aeneid . ”
Jefferson started learning Latin and Greek at age 9 at a school in Virginia run by a Scottish clergyman .
When he was at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg , a Greek grammar book was always by his side .
Tacitus and Homer were his favorites .
Aborigines who were taken from their families as children in a policy of forced racial assimilation will receive a historic apology from Australia 's new government Wednesday .
In what will be the first parliamentary act of his government , center - left prime minister Kevin Rudd will fulfill an election campaign promise when he stands up in parliament in Canberra , the capital , and says sorry to the so - called Stolen Generation .
The Labor leader said the apology would remove a " blight on the nation 's soul " and had the overwhelming support of Australians .
Supporters say it is of similar magnitude to America 's apology in 1988 for interning Japanese citizens during World War II .
Mr. Rudd 's speech will be shown on giant outdoor screens in Australia 's two largest cities , Melbourne and Sydney , and aired live on two national television networks .
The red , black , and gold Aboriginal flag will fly from landmarks across the country , including Sydney 's iconic Harbor Bridge .
About 13,000 people today identify themselves as either members of the Stolen Generation or relatives who were adversely affected by the long - standing policy .
Based on the premise that " full - blood " Aborigines were a race headed for extinction , up to 100,000 mixed - race children were taken from their parents between 1910 and 1970 .
The children , some of them babies , were often snatched from sobbing mothers by policemen or government officials .
They were then placed in the care of white foster parents or sent to institutions to be raised as domestic servants for white families .
Many encountered sexual abuse , neglect , and cruelty .
Rudd 's decision to apologize contrasts with the attitude of his conservative predecessor , John Howard , who during 11 years in office insisted that today 's Australians had no need to atone for past injustices .
Still , many Australians feel it is long overdue .
" It 's a sign of the maturing of Australia as a nation .
I think it will go down as one of the most significant moments in this country 's history , " says Jason Glanville , strategy director of Reconciliation Australia , an independent agency set up to improve relations between black and white Australians .
For Debra Hocking , Rudd 's words will go a little way toward healing the terrible wounds of her past .
A mixed - race Aborigine from Tasmania , she was removed from her parents as a baby , along with her four siblings .
The children were split up , with Ms. Hocking sent to a foster home where she suffered years of abuse .
" I was 18 months old when I was taken away , and I did n't meet my mum until I was 20 .
I grew up not even knowing her name – the authorities would n't tell me , " she recalls .
" Eventually I tracked her down but by then she was gravely ill .
We met twice , but two weeks later she died . "
She says there was no evidence of neglect in her family .
The policy " was bizarre , and very cruel , " she adds .
" Perhaps it was a deliberate attempt to breed out the Aboriginal race , by splitting up families . "
A member of a lobby group , the Stolen Generations Alliance , Hocking believes the government 's apology is of great symbolic importance .
" In just a few minutes Rudd will change the history of this country .
It will open the eyes of a lot of Australians and people around the world . "
Not all Aborigines agree , arguing that the apology wo n't improve their often appalling living conditions .
In what has been described as a national disgrace and international embarrassment , the life expectancy of Australia 's 450,000 indigenous people is 17 years shorter than the rest of the population .
They suffer shocking levels of alcoholism , child sexual abuse , and domestic violence .
The apology will be a largely meaningless gesture , says Leo Abbott , a community leader and member of the Aranda tribe in the Northern Territory .
" The proper way to say sorry is to fix up health , education , employment , and housing for Aboriginal communities , " he says .
Australia 's political leaders are also divided over the apology , with some conservative MPs uncomfortable with the label of Stolen Generation .
They maintain that many mixed race children were removed for their own safety from violent or neglectful families .
The opposition 's spokesman on Aboriginal affairs , Tony Abbott , insists that many of the removals were carried out with the best of intentions .
" Yes , some kids were stolen and this is shameful , but many were helped and some were rescued , " he said .
The issue of compensation is also highly contentious .
Some Aboriginal leaders have called for the setting up of a compensation fund of about $ 900 million or more , but the government has so far refused .
Reconciliation Australia hopes the government will eventually accept the idea of payouts , as some Australian states have done .
" These people were done a grave injustice .
Compensation is considered to be part of any reparations process , " says Mr. Glanville .
The Most Beautiful Insect
Winner : Sunset Moth from Malagasy
The wings of this insect actually do n’t have any pigmentation !
The colors that you are seeing are actually refraction of the light from micro-ribbon in the wings .
This moth is actually active during the day , while most moths of the same family are active during the night .
They are native to Madagascar and South America and their wings change color shifting from blue to gold - green and then to other shade of yellow as you change your viewing angle .
As you may have imagined , this butterfly is very wanted by collectors .
Most Dangerous
Ant
Winner : Black Bulldog Ant of Australia
Considering we all have seen ants and they are probably known for being totally inoffensive , this one not so much .
It has been known to literally kill humans .
They are dark brown and have black abdomen .
They are the most primitive of all ants and are very aggressive .
They are 1 inch in length and can go up to 2 inches in some case .
As their name implies , they are found only in Australia and on top of being aggressive , they are very fast .
Fastest Flying Insect
Winner : Horse Fly
It ’s fastest recorded speed has been up to 90 MPH .
Not only is this insect very fast , but it also has great control and maneuvers in the air .
It can turn and change directions at lightning speeds .
Even though they go very fast , they do n’t rely on these speeds hoping to just get lucky getting a prey , they know in advance their destination and what they will be doing .
They also have huge eyes ; so huge they are some of the biggest of all insects , and their vision cover almost a 360 degree angle !
Heaviest Insect
Winner : Goliath Beetle
Not only heavy , but also huge as you can notice .
They come from the family of scarab beetles ; the family of scarab beetles have over 30,000 species and scientists think there are as much that have n’t been discovered yet .
The first specie appeared over 300 million years ago , and it ’s the ability to adapt to the environment that these beetles have been around for so long .
The Goliath Beetle likes to eat dead plant and measure 2 to 4 - 1/3 inches and weigh 3 to 3 - 1/ 2 oz .
They play an important part in the ecosystem as a decomposer in the environment .
Most Annoying
Winner : No-See-Um
Zoomed
These are the very tiny flies that gather in groups and fly in no real directions .
They can pass through very fine opening when doors or windows are shut .
They live primarily where there are water sources .
Only the females bite and suck out blood ; it is to get proteins to develop their eggs .
Longest Insect
Winner : Giant Stick Insect
Yes , that thing is an insect !
A giant stick insect measure 163 mm , and if counting when their legs are outstretched , they measure 295 mm , almost a whole foot !
And in some cases , they can even reach 20 inches .
There are over 3000 species of stick insects found , and some of them even have wings and fly .
Can you imagine something of this size flying in your living room .
It is actually still a challenge to certain people as to how they can fly with such a big weight and small wings ; great aerodynamics is the explanation .
Loudest Insect
Winner : Brevisana brevis
This specie of cicadas can be heard for over one quarter of a mile away .
It is a real wonder of nature of how something so small can be so powerful to our ears .
At close range , the noise can reach 120 dB .
A comparative example would be a night in a discotheque , where the music usually reaches 100 dB .
Weirdest Shape
Winner : Thorn Bug
The size and color of this insect varies a lot , but usually , the adult thorn bug is about 0.5 inches high and of color green .
They are found in South and Central America , Mexico , and southern Florida .
This specie was almost unknown until almost 1950 .
Longest Living Insect
Winner : Queen of Termites
The Queen of Termites has been known to live as long as 50 years .
They have been on earth for over 200 million years .
Termites eat dead wood and by themselves alone , cause more damages to homes than fire and storms .
The queen lays between 5,000 to 7,000 eggs a day ; that ’s a lot of eggs for someone who can also live so long .
Speaking of lifespan , there are , on the other hand , mayflies that can live as much as only an hour .
Most Destructive
Winner : Desert Locus
While the above termites do a lot of damage to homes , it is nothing compared to the destructiveness of the Desert Locus .
They each eat about the equivalent mass of the weight of their body .
They eat almost every sort of crop and vegetation : leaves , flowers , rice , fruits , vegetables , seeds , palms … you name it .
2003 -2005 was one of the worst period for West Africa with the desert locus .
The desert locus had invaded over 20 countries , the cost of fighting them were over $ 400 million and the estimated damages to the harvest were over $ 2.5 billion .
Why Most Investors Do n’t Make Money In The Stock Market
So you want to make money in the stock market ?
The best way to start out is to educate yourself about investing , and the most favorable way to do this is to partake of free investment and trading resources from the best online brokers around .
I wholeheartedly believe that knowledge is power .
However , here ’s a reality that many people do n’t realize — that the average investor may not be doing too well with their stock investments .
There could be a variety of reasons for this — here are some of the thought patterns that people have about investing :
Personal beliefs :
The stock market is for gamblers !
The stock market is for gamblers !
Complicated behaviors : I ’m having too much fun trading my bucks away .
Buy high , sell low .
I ’m having too much fun trading my bucks away .
Buy high , sell low .
Lack of experience and information :
Why bother learning ?
There are pros for this sort of thing !
Why bother learning ?
There are pros for this sort of thing !
Interest :
The stock market is for geeks .
Too boring for me .
So given all these tendencies , what kind of results does the average investor yield ?
The Average Investor ’s Scorecard
# 1 Investor Performance
The sobering fact is that the typical equity mutual fund investor ’s portfolio has lagged inflation from 1984 to 2003 , while barely beating inflation over the last couple of decades , according to a study done by Dalbar , a Boston investment research company .
Numbers tracked from 1986 through 2005 show :
The average investor earned 3.9 % a year , before taxes !
Inflation grew 3.0 % a year .
The S&P 500 ( $ INX ) earned 11.9 % a year .
The average equity mutual fund returned 9.3 % a year .
These points are representative of the information provided by The Skilled Investor , who wrote about a formal study made from 1991 through 1997 that showed that most individual investors handled their investments poorly .
Interestingly , these seem to mirror the casual , empirical data I ’ve previously gathered .
On average , the portfolios of investors in this study held four stocks in 1991 and seven in 1997 .
About 25 % of accounts held only one stock , and about half held one or two stocks .
On a risk - adjusted basis , this lack of diversification was quite costly to these investors .
When compared to the broad market portfolio , 80 % to 90 % of these investors ’ portfolios underperformed the market over the period of the study .
# 2 Investor Knowledge
What else do we know about the average investor ?
Now the National Association of Securities Dealers ( NASD ) also conducted a survey that tested the knowledge of 1,086 investors who ’ve made at least one investment in the past and whose portfolios ranged from $ 10,000 to $ 500,000 .
Not bad numbers !
Still , the results were very surprising .
The survey covered some basic investing and financial questions and here were some unexpected findings :
Assumptions :
Over two - thirds of the survey respondents ( 69 % ) admitted to being at least “ somewhat knowledgeable ” about investing with only 12 % believing they were “ not at all knowledgeable . ” 60 % owned stocks and 60 % claimed they owned mutual funds .
Almost half of the respondents believed that stocks are insured against losses .
70 % of the survey respondents did not understand that when one buys stock on “ margin , ” he or she can lose ALL of the investment , even if the value of the shares does not go to zero .
80 % did not know the definition of a “ no load ” mutual fund .
The survey also suggested that many investors do not know the difference between loads ( sales charges ) and normal operating expenses of mutual funds .
60 % did not understand that if interest rates rise , most bonds lose money .
Almost 70 % of the survey respondents did not understand why municipal bonds offer lower pre-tax yields .
21 % replied that they expected annual returns of 15 % - 25 % from a broadly diversified U.S. stock mutual fund over the long run .
49 % of respondents did not know that stocks produced higher average returns than most other investments over the long term .
28 % did not understand the link between investment performance and risk .
Most interesting of all were the overall takeaways from the study :
Only 35 % of respondents scored a passing grade on the NASD survey .
97 % admitted they needed to be better educated about investing .
The NASD did provide a breakdown on which groups fared best in its survey .
The notable findings are : older respondents ( 50 + ) did better than younger ( 21 - 29 ) respondents
men did better than women
higher income ( $ 100,000 and greater ) did better than lower income ( less than $ 50,000 )
primary decision - makers did better than shared decision - makers
What ’s quite telling here is how the average investor actually underperforms the average mutual fund , most likely because of the investor ’s common behavior of switching from one fund to another , chasing returns while buying high and selling low .
If instead we stay put with a given investment , we ’d be tracking that investment ’s performance and perhaps have a better chance of matching benchmark returns .
Given the kind of showing we ’ve seen in the knowledge test , I suppose it ’s easy to understand why the average investor holds a portfolio that has returned 3.9 % over the last 20 years or so .
Explaining Poor Market Performance
So why are most people unable to make money in the markets ?
I ’ll boil it down to a few reasons : lack of information , inexperience and arrogance .
The stock market can eat you alive when you have n’t studied it enough and you decide to jump in without much understanding .
The stock market may also humble you if you think you ’re way too smart for it and decide to embark on the quest to beat it year after year .
I ’ve decided I ’d like to make money in the markets with the least amount of work possible , and a diversified portfolio of index funds should do the trick .
No rocket science here , but unfortunately , too many of my buddies just do n’t buy it .

The following is reprinted from The Best of Uncle John 's Bathroom Reader .
Sherlock Holmes ( R ) and Dr. Watson ( L ) , drawn by Sidney Paget Sherlock Holmes is one of the most widely recognized characters in all of English literature .
He is n't just a person , he 's a cultural icon .
His adventures are also some of our favorite reading .
In his honor , we 've done a little detective work and uncovered these facts .
THE DOCTOR IS IN The year was 1877 .
Dr. Joseph Bell , a brilliant surgeon and lecturer at Scotland 's prestigious Edinburgh University Medical School , was standing next to one of the hospital 's patients .
His students - including 18 - year - old named Arthur Conan Doyle - stood around him as he motioned to the patient and systematically ticked off his first observation about the case .
" You 'll notice , gentlemen , " Dr. Bell began , " that the man is clearly a left - handed cobbler . "
How could Dr. Bell tell a man 's occupation - and the fact that he was left - handed - from a single glance at someone he had never met before ?
Doyle and the rest of the students were amazed .
And this was n't the first time , either .
Bell made these amazing deductions every time he examined patients in front of the class .
Dr. Bell continued with his observations , this time pointing to the man 's pants .
" Notice the worn places in the corduroy breeches , where a cobbler rests his lapstone . "
It was the pants !
Dr. Bell read the man 's life story from a patch of worn corduroy .
It was amazing , and Arthur Conan Doyle would never forget it .
FROM BAD TO VERSE
Nine years later , in 1886 , Doctor Arthur Conan Doyle - who had put himself through medical school largely through the sale of short stories - turned again to writing to try to save his failing medical practice .
He decided to write a detective story using Dr. Bell as a model .
" I thought of my old teacher , " Doyle later recalled , " and his eerie tricks of spotting details .
If he were a detective , he would surely reduce this fascinating but unorganized business to something nearer to an exact science .
It was surely possible in real life , so why should I not make it plausible in fiction ?
It is all very well to say that a man is clever , but the reader wants to see examples of it - such examples as Bell gave us every day in the ( hospital ) wards .
The idea amused me . "
THE NAME GAME
Originally , Doyle named his detective Sherrinford Holmes , after Oliver Wendell Holmes - and named Holmes 's sidekick Ormand Sacker .
But during the three weeks it took to write the story , Doyle renamed the characters Sherlock Holmes , after a cricket player he had once played against , and Thomas John H. Watson , after Patrick Watson , a colleague of Dr. Bell's .
Doyle sent the manuscript for A Study in Scarlet to a publisher ... but it was returned unread .
So he sent it to a second , a third , a fourth , and a fifth .. and was rejected each time .
Finally , Ward , Lock & Company agreed to publish it in a magazine called Beeton 's Christmas Annual , where it was read by the English public and quickly forgotten .
BORN IN THE USA Fortunately for Doyle , a pirated version of the story was printed in the Lippincott magazine .
" The wife of the editor of Lippincott liked Study in Scarlet , " says Sherlock Holmes expert Ely Liebow , " and her husband arranged to dine with Doyle and a writer named Oscar Wilde " when he was visiting England .
It was one of the most productive business meetings in the history of English literature , Liebow recounts .
" At the end of the meal , the editor had commitments from Doyle for his second Holmes novel , The Sign of the Four , and from Wilde for The Picture of Dorian Gray . "
But it was n't until 1890 that Doyle made enough money from his writing to enable him to shut down his medical practice , and it was n't until the story Scandal in Bohemia was published in Strand magazine in 1891 that he really made it big .
" That story established his reputation , " Liebow says .
" Sherlock Holmes became very popular , and the money started pouring in . "
THE PERFECT CRIME
Just as actors resent being typecast , so too did Doyle come to resent Sherlock Holmes .
His interests turned to more " serious " works ... but the public continued to clamor for Holmes tales .
In 1893 , Doyle decided to kill Holmes off .
He sent him over Switzerland 's Reichenbach Falls wrestling with arch - villain Professor Moriarty .
Called The Final Problem , the story killed both characters .
The public was outraged - more than 20,000 people cancelled their subscriptions to the Strand - but Doyle still hoped it would be the end of Sherlock .
" I am weary of his name , " he signed to a friend .
BEYOND AND BACK
It was n't the end .
Public demand for Sherlock Holmes stories continued unabated .
Doyle succumbed to the pressure in 1902 and published The Hound of Baskervilles , in which Watson discovers a manuscript describing a previously unknown Holmes case .
But even this partial resurrection was n't enough for Holmes fans , so in 1903 Doyle gave in and brought Holmes back to life in The Adventure of the Empty House .
Why the change of heart ?
An American magazine offered him $ 5,000 per story , and a British publisher offered him almost $ 3,000 per story for the British rights , unheard of sums in those days .
CASE CLOSED Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would write a total 56 short stories and 4 novels featuring Sherlock Holmes , and , just as he feared , the general public came to associate him exclusively with that body of work .
Still , his fate was n't that terrible - his 1902 historical study of The Great Boer War won him great praise from historians and earned him a knighthood , and his 6 - volume history of World War I is considered a masterpiece , even though it never won him the fame his novels did .
Doyle became a very rich man - by the 1920s he was the highest - paid writer on Earth , and he left an estate so huge that his heirs were still suing each other over it well into the 1990s .
Note : How good a real - life sleuth was Dr. Joseph Bell ?
So good - at least according to legend - that he correctly identified " Jack the Ripper . "
" The story , " says Dr. Ely Liebow , " is that Bell and his friend analyzed the Ripper killings and put the name of the killer in an envelope .
They gave the envelope to the Edinburgh police , who sent it to London , where the crimes occurred .
The contents of the envelope were never divulged , but there were no more murders after they named the killer . "
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. often says that “ we need to impeach President Bush as a civics lesson . ”
Apparently , our Congress does not agree .
So if impeachment is “ off the table , ” what can We The People do to bring these two criminals to justice ?
Guest Blogger Jack Mosel suggests in this original Op - Ed piece that it is time to take action at the local level , highlighting the case of one Vermont town which is setting an example as to how it can be done – and calls for other cities around the world to follow suit .
It stands to reason , after all , that if upon leaving office , Bush and Cheney have nowhere to run , they will have nowhere to hide .
OP-ED : GEORGE W. BUSH AND DICK CHENEY SHOULD BE IN HANDCUFFS , NOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE
By Jack Mosel
Guest Blogger
“ Bush and Cheney : Arrested for Gross Violations of International and U.S. Law ! ”
A new proposal in the township of Brattleboro , Vermont — authorizing local law enforcement to arrest Bush and Cheney — would make this headline a reality , should either of them step inside the town ’s jurisdiction .
The Brattleboro proposal is to be voted on in the coming weeks at a town hall meeting .
This innovative solution is up for discussion thanks to the hard work of community activists , who petitioned citywide to have the motion put to a vote .
The petition — with more than 436 signatures , or at least the 5 percent of voters necessary to be considered — was duly submitted and the town Select Board voted 3 - 2 to put it on the ballot .
It goes to a town - wide vote March 4 .
“ This petition is as radical as the Declaration of Independence , and it draws on that tradition in claiming a universal jurisdiction when governments fail to do what they ’re supposed to do , ” said Kurt Daims , 54 , a retired machinist leading the drive .
Daims has been circulating documents that claim the community acquires a “ universal jurisdiction ” to take such steps “ when governments breach their highest duties . ”
“ We have the full power to issue indictments , conduct trials , incarcerate offenders and do all other acts which Independent jurisdictions may of right do , ” the statement says .
The measure asks : “ Shall the Selectboard instruct the Town Attorney to draft indictments against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for crimes against our Constitution , and publish said indictment for consideration by other municipalities ? ”
Fearful of the indictment , Bush and Cheney are mounting a counteroffensive .
But in town after town in Vermont , the people have voted to support impeachment recognizing that Bush and Cheney have committed high crimes and misdemeanors .
After a concerned citizen ’s call to 911 , the Tyranny Response Team does their patriotic duty .
JAIL TO THE CHIEF
The Brattleboro indictment of Bush and Cheney is reflective of the tide of opposition to the current administration .
The people of this country are refusing to let Bush leave office without facing charges for his criminal deeds .
Just this week , the New Hampshire State House held an impeachment hearing , which was flooded by activists and community members insisting that the state legislature take action .
Hollywood actor Ed Asner wrote a letter for the hearing expressing his support for the resolution , which indicts Bush for “ invading Iraq without just cause or provocation . ”
This , I submit , is the call for citizen activism for our voices to be heard on the subject of whether High Crimes and Misdemeanors are actually relevant as defined by the Constitution of the United States .
What I mean by that is simply put :
Does the activity of a collection of townships and state legislatures ( as of late Westchester County , NY included ) taking proactive legal steps towards indictments of our President and Vice President seem over - reactive ?
Or are they simply stepping up to the plate and doing the one thing Congress lacks the courage to do ?
This is n’t a question of a few isolated communities anymore .
City , County , and State governments are getting more done at the local level on this matter than the members of the actual House of Representatives , whose task it is to introduce Articles of Impeachment .
The ‘ Pyramid ’ is upside down …
Those folks in Washington work for us , not the other way around .
The elected officials in Washington , D.C. are going to have to take a stand and be accountable for either their ability to represent the best interest of their constituents and their country — or not .
On his perp walk down the runway , the Veep demonstrates the latest fall colors ; orange jumpsuits are all the rage this year .
THE CONSTITUTION IS A WAR CASUALTY
A small town in Vermont ’s resolution instructing their local police to arrest the President of the United States and the Vice President of the United States for Acts of Treason is awe inspiring …
Awe inspiring to the extent that it is embarrassing to our elected representatives in Washington who failed us .
Again .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I am proud of every local government which feels that they have no other choice but to do this .
I ’m quite sure that they would not pursue these activities if they did not have the legal authority to do so .
They have taken a bold stand for the rule of law and are sending a strong message to those in Congress , in cities around the country , and indeed around the world .
There is something burning foks …
It ’s the smell of a nearly 220 year - old parchment ( which our president calls “ just a goddamn piece of paper ! ” ) , printed from the actual blood of people like you and me .
The movement for a free Republic , the Revolutionary war we fought to win that freedom , and the signing of our Constitution in Philadelphia all those years ago is not so different from the activities which are currently going on in Brattleboro , Vermont , Concord , New Hampshire , or Westchester , New York .
( Home to both Sen. Hillary Clinton and Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. ) .
The Constitution is a War Casualty …
This is from the desk of ‘ The Decider ’ .
Our voices not being heard and the relentless refusal to not entertain the motions of Articles of Impeachment , is simply un-Patriotic , un - American and un-fair !
Why should we take a stand ?
Because it is n’t always about us , folks .
The rest of the world is watching and waiting to see what we are going to do about our situation .
They know that there are huge discrepancies afoot in our country ’s actions over the last 8 years … that our deeds do n’t live up to our words .
How are we going to save our face and continue to live up to the world ’s expectations of America being a great , successful , democratic power if we handicap ourselves by taking the word of a handful of people who unilaterally claim to know best for all of us ?
Whatever happened to the “ consent of the governed ? ”
When asked to testify for the 9/11 Commission about their prior knowledge of the attack on America , or about their activities on that day , both our president and our vice president balked , delayed , refused , and then finally ( sort of ) complied .
But only with conditions — such as no record of the discussion , no paper allowed in the room , no sworn statements in testimony and no public participation … and we let this happen .
I have serious questions … and to this day , they remain unanswered .
Obviously .
I am not a nut .
I am a father , a husband , an active community volunteer , an environmentalist by profession .
I am a New Yorker born and raised , and I am still outraged that this heinous crime was committed in my state .
I care about my country and the people I call Americans who live this dream with me , and above all , I am a realist .
The facts we ’ve been given about what happened on September 11th and why we went to war just do n’t add up .
The ones that do point to politicians at the highest levels of our own government needing to answer these questions , even if we have to arrest them in order to get to the truth .
The record needs to be straightened out for the sake of history , the true perpetrators must be brought to justice once and for all .
So that your children and mine can have the same great American dream of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness our forefathers gave us .

With Valentine 's
Day around the corner , do n't trust your instincts when it comes to selecting a mate .
Human decision making is seriously flawed - but it can be fixed with a few simple sums .
Be warned : this article deals primarily with shark attacks , the lottery , beer , and how to get a date using mathematics .
Is it a good decision to keep reading ?
Unfortunately , the answer is " you need to keep reading to find out . "
Sound irrational ?
Good - your massively irrational mind should have no problem with it , then .
Consider this : every year in the United States , when the Discovery Channel broadcasts " Shark Week " visits to Florida beaches decline .
Presumably , the network 's programming makes the waters no less safe ( assuming sharks are not , in fact , empowered by cable television ) .
DILEMMA SOLVER
Try Garth Sundem 's decision calculator ( link below ) for the following dilemmas : Should you apologise ?
Should you buy something ( or not ) ?
Should you join a gym ?
Garth 's decision calculator
However , after watching a week of kicking legs seen from below , the idea of shark attack is refreshed in our minds and we choose not to offer ourselves as bait .
This phenomenon is known as an availability heuristic - a heuristic being a rule - of - thumb .
Our rationality is subverted by easily available sensationalist images .
On the sunnier side of the availability heuristic is the lottery .
Should you invest £ 2 a day or use it to buy lottery tickets ?
Maths makes the decision obvious .
Suppose you invest two quid every day at the reasonable rate of 10 % .
It will take you almost exactly 50 years to accumulate £ 1 m .
To earn this same £ 1 m in the National Lottery , you would ( on average ) have to match five numbers and a bonus ball , at odds of 2,330,635 - to - 1 .
If you spent two quid a day for 50 years you would total just over 36,500 tickets and would thus have only a 1 - in - 63 chance of making that million pounds .
However , the available image of immediate wealth subverts this rationality .
Beer rating secret Alphabetically , the availability heuristic is only the first in a long line of psychological mechanisms that lead us into bad decisions .
Imagine - if you will - beer .
See , was n't that nice ?
Which beer do you like best ?
The most expensive ( and least dusty )
At your local pub , you have many beers to choose from .
Which is best ?
If you are like most human beings , the answer is " the most expensive one . "
A number of studies have shown that by switching price tags , you can switch preferences ( for obvious reasons , this is a favourite experiment among university psychology students ) .
And what about the power of suggestion ?
Imagine I handed you a cup of hot coffee and then asked your opinion about a person whom you had recently met ; now suppose I instead handed you a cup of ice - cold soda .
Experiments show that your opinion of this person would be different because you have been primed to feel warmth or coldness .
Add to the list ... framing ( how you present data is as important as the data itself )
impact bias ( overestimation of possible outcomes ) ,
confirmation bias ( recognising only data that supports your hypothesis )
loss aversion ( we stand to gain more than we would lose , but our fear of loss prevents us )
selective perception ( seeing what you want to see ) , and
rosy retrospection ( integral to the repeated experience of family Christmas ) ... and you seem doomed to blunder through life led by your brain 's clumsy irrationality .
Is there any hope for the human race ?
In the example of the lottery , mathematics offered incontrovertible rationality .
Might we be able to apply mathematics to other situations , as well ?
The secret to Errol 's smile ?
A hot cup of tea A rudimentary attempt at this is the list of plusses and minuses , in which one lists the positive aspects of a decision on one side of a chart and the negative aspects on the other , and then weighs these against each other as if on a scale ( the heavier side wins ) .
To add a layer of mathematics , if one factor on the list is more important than the others , we might multiply it by two .
If it is very important , we could even square or cube it .
Suppose you were sitting in the aforementioned pub , drinking the aforementioned beer ( perhaps while holding the aforementioned lottery ticket and worrying about the aforementioned shark ) , while sneaking peeks at a beautiful woman sitting at the bar .
What do you think would influence your chance of success with this woman ?
It will certainly help if you are attractive - especially in comparison to her ( you might say your chances increase in direct proportion to your looks / her looks ) ; it will also help if you are a witty conversationalist and willing to pursue the interaction aggressively , and hurt your chances drastically if she already has a boyfriend ( esp a large one ) .
Putting this into an equation , we could come up with the following ( W=Witty , G=Aggressive , Ay=Your Attractiveness , AH=Her Attractiveness , R=Her " Amount " of Current Relationship ; all variables from 1 - 10 with 10 being high ) :
You would , of course , have to evaluate the results on some type of scale , like the one here :
If ASK is less than zero you should lower your standards
If ASK is between zero and 1 , you have exactly a snowball 's chance in hell with her
If ASK is between 1 and 10 , game on !
If ASK is greater than 10 , consider her more attractive friend instead
In practice , using this equation ( and equations in general ) to make decisions can have an interesting secondary effect .
As described by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , by introducing tools to measure a situation , we can affect the situation itself .
To whit : one of my university students decided to apply this equation to calculate his chances with Girl X Of His Dreams .
Alas , the equation predicted little hope .
However , Girl X Of His Dreams was flattered that said student had cared enough to calculate his chances ( an endearing display of vulnerability , perhaps ? ) , and they ended up having dinner .
Beware , though - as described by the Uncertainty Principle , the introduction of this tool could easily have had negative consequences , turning a calculated sure thing into no chance at all ( if the girl had decided that anyone who uses an equation to determine their chances at love was decidedly creepy ) .
The moral is , perhaps equations can help you make decisions , as long as no one sees you doing it .

As usual , psychologists make what is screamingly obvious into a so - called science by using arcane terminology designed to create on air of esotericism around their subject .

There 's a little smoke and mirrors with the lottery calculation .
It 's not wrong but does neatly sidestep inflation .
In 50 years , your £ 1 m savings wo n't be worth much but the lottery prize will have inflated to roughly 7 times as much ( at 4 % pa ) .
Hence , the expected return is not nearly as bad as indirectly implied - although still unfavourable .
The chance of winning is still the same , of course .

This is excellent .
Very entertaining .
This equation should be tested on a broader audience .
As we become a rational society , this theory and equation could become award - winning .
A beautifull discover , as credible and amazing as newtons laws of Motion : " Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it .
" We need awake up call , an external force in the form of this equation to help us move .
Enough W and G , and offcourse AY can get us on our feet to approach the targeted object .
Genius .
Nikita , Canada
What a nonsense article .
The persistant use of these equations merely misleads people into thinking about maths the wrong way .
All of them are cobbled out of thin air , and none can do any calculations , as even if they were exact , the parameters are impossible to measure ie how do you define attractiveness ?
Also the use of the " uncertainty principle " as a tool to aid explanation is a bad choice .
Most of the people this article is targetting will not understand the true meaning of the uncertainty principle , and it 's questionable whether the author has any clue himself .
If it could n't get worse , it does when you find out it 's plugging this guy 's book .
BBC , stop selling out !
Rhys , Oxford Fantastic !
My first reaction was to snigger and think : " They should have better things to do , but it is funny . "
Then I found myself thinking : " Well hang on a minute , maybe they 're actually on to something here ? "
Using the equation as an example , many things that previously seemed totally random could actually become predictable ( well at least " 0.5r " , r being degree of randomness ) .
David B , Birmingham
All good ideas , but I think the " love calculator " needs some more thinking .
In fact it should be destroyed , you cannot determine if your right for each other from this as it is flawed .
You would need other variables showing what personality she is .
What time of the month it is possibly ?
Hormones and all that .
All in all trying to use a calculator for things like that is wrong , I think confidence is a good thing to have and if this equation says you 've got no chance well there is no point is there ?
Without using the calculation you may have more chance because you have nothing holding you back , instead you blindly proceed and hope for the best .
However , I will be investing £ 2 a day for 50 years , i've always wanted a yacht .

In the tradition of the Lincoln / Douglas Debates , Coalition for the Constitution hosted a Debate on Impeachment between Republican Bruce Fein ( pro-impeachment ) and Democrat Michael Tomasky ( anti-impeachment ) .
Find our more information at our website www.CoalitionfortheConstitution.com
The Debate was held on January 15 , 2008 at 7 pm , at the Carrboro Century Center and was be moderated by UNC Professor of Leadership and Public Policy , W. Hodding Carter III , and hosted by Orange County Commissioner Moses Carey .
The full debate can be seen here :
Impeachment is mentioned six times in the United States Constitution , including most clearly in Article II , section 3 which reads :
“ The President , Vice President and all civil officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . ”
Recently , privileged resolution HR 799 ( HR 333 re-introduced ) , Articles of Impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney , was introduced on the floor of the House .
Former presidential candidate Joe Biden has also raised the impeachment issue on the campaign trail in connection with a possible war with Iran .
Robert Wexler is also pushing for hearings at www.wexlerwantshearings.com
To help the public better understand the pros and cons of impeachment , the organizers have lined up two well - known political pundits to debate and answer those questions .
Bruce Fein is a lawyer , specializing in constitutional and international law , who served as an associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan .
He has recently been a strong advocate for the impeachment of current U.S. vice - president Dick Cheney and President George W Bush .
Fein graduated from Harvard Law School in 1972 .
In March 2007 , he founded the American Freedom Agenda with Bob Barr , David Keene and Richard Viguerie .
Fein is counsel to Ron Paul ’s campaign for the 2008 Presidential nomination .
One of his most scathing indictments of Dick Cheney appeared in his article for Slate.com entitled , “ Impeach Cheney , The Vice President has run utterly amok and must be stopped . ”
http://www.slate.com/id/2169292/
Michael Tomasky , is a progressive journalist who has recently written an article about impeachment , entitled , “ The Dumbest Move the Dems Could Make ” , which has been cited by the Democratic Leadership , and 4th District North Carolina Congressman , David Price , as the reasoning behind their refusal to support impeachment .
Tomasky has served as the executive editor of The American Prospect and is the author of Left for Dead : The Life , Death , and Possible Resurrection of Progressive Politics in America ( 1996 ) , a study of the intellectual collapse of the American left .

Enlarge By Philippe Desmazes , AFP / Getty Images Supporters gathered at the Socialist party headquarters in Madrid celebrate Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero 's re-election on Sunday .
MADRID , Spain ( AP )  Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero won re-election Sunday in a clear endorsement of a record of social change including the legalization of gay marriage and on - demand divorce , reforms once unthinkable in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Spain .
Zapatero also shifted Spanish foreign policy by pulling troops from Iraq in his first term , which he won three days after Islamic militants killed 191 people in a string of bombings against commuter trains .
Voters handed Zapatero his second term despite worries about a slumping economy , immigration and resurgent Basque separatists , blamed for gunning down a member of the prime minister 's party on Friday — timing that recalled the March 11 , 2004 Madrid attacks .
With 99.4 % of the vote counted , Zapatero 's Socialist party had 43.7 % , versus 40.1 % for the conservative Popular Party , according to the Interior Ministry .
In his next term , Zapatero 's main task will be to reboot the once booming but now slowing economy , shaken by the sub - prime mortgage crisis in the U.S. and a cooling construction sector .
" The Spanish people have spoken clearly and decided to start a new era , " Zapatero told euphoric supporters outside the party 's headquarters in Madrid .
" I will govern with a firm but open hand ... I will govern for all , but do so thinking most of all of those in need . "
While Zapatero's Socialist party picked up seats in the lower house , it fell short of a majority and will have to form some sort of an alliance with smaller regional parties in order to govern .
The opposition conservatives conceded defeat , but took solace from the fact their party also picked up seats , with both parties gaining at the expense of smaller leftist and regional groups .
" I called the candidate of the Socialist party and wished him luck for the good of Spain , " conservative candidate Mariano Rajoy told supporters in Madrid .
A large crowd of flag - waving supporters cheered loudly , making it difficult for him to speak .
Zapatero paid tribute to the slain politician , Isaias Carrasco , saying he should have been celebrating the victory with his family .
Carrasco 's killing , blamed on the Basque group ETA , jolted Spaniards and prompted both parties to cancel final campaign appearances .
Some in Spain had predicted the killing might prompt a wave of sympathy and a boost at the polls for Zapatero 's party , especially after the Socialist politician 's 20 - year - old daughter Sandra made an emotional appeal Saturday for people to defy ETA by turning out to vote en masse .
For Rajoy , his rival in Sunday 's vote and in 2004 , it was the second consecutive defeat , one likely to increase pressure on him to step down as party chief .
" I thought Rajoy would do better , he speaks with such conviction .
I 'm surprised he fell behind , " said Jose Eguren , a 29 - year - old security guard in the Basque city of Bilbao .
Many conservatives consider Zapatero's 2004 victory a fluke , and saw Sunday 's vote as their chance to correct it .
The prime minister 's victory was seen as finally giving him a legitimacy that critics say he has lacked .
He won in 2004 amid a wave of voter outrage at the ruling conservatives , who blamed the attacks on ETA even as evidence of Islamic involvement mounted .
The tactics were widely seen as a bid to deflect perceptions that the killings were al - Qaeda 's revenge for the government 's deeply unpopular support of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq .
Sunday 's results showed the Socialists on their way to winning 169 seats in the 350 - seat lower house , up from the current 164 but shy of the 176 seats needed for an outright majority .
The Popular Party was also shown picking up seats , raising its total from 148 to 154 .
Although he made a dramatic entrance with the withdrawal of troops from Iraq , Zapatero has since taken a back seat on the international stage .
Some say his reticence to make a bigger impression has weakened Spain 's standing abroad .
Others believe he may tend to foreign affairs with more emphasis this time round .
The campaign was marked by acrimony , with Rajoy hammering Zapatero on everything from immigration to the economy .
In two televised debates between the men , Rajoy used a form of the word " liar " to describe Zapatero more than 30 times ; he blamed Zapatero for not doing enough to spur the economy , which is cooling amid rising unemployment and an end to a boom in the construction sector .
Rajoy vowed to make immigrants sign a contract obliging them to respect Spanish customs and learn the language , a position Zapatero 's party called xenophobic .
The candidates also clashed on Zapatero 's willingness to grant more self - rule to Spain 's semiautonomous regions .
Conservatives warn that will tear the nation apart .
Under the Socialists Spain became the third country to legalize gay marriage and thousands of same - sex couples have wed since the law took effect in July 2005 , according to the Justice Ministry .
The government also pushed through laws including fast - track divorce and easier terms for medically assisted fertilization .
All of these issues have left Spain deeply polarized and these divisions will not go away soon , said Enrique Monreal , 35 , a publishing company employee .
" It will take several years for things to calm down .
Right now it is so tense you are nervous even talking to your neighbor , " Monreal said outside a polling station in Madrid .

Photographs and commentary about living in Manhattan .
We had a photo competition here in amdocs and one of the categories was “ dreams ” .
I did a lot of research on the net for an idea and one of the photographs which i found ( actually on a photoshop site ) was that of a guy appearing transparent in a photograph titled dreamy .
I liked the concept and wanted to get something similar done without photoshop , as the competition had strict guidelines about the use of photoshop .
Vidhya came up with the idea of “ Dreaming about you ” wherein she is seated appearing to be asleep and i appear in the photograph like a ghost which will give the indication that she is dreaming .
This is the final photograph which we came up with …
Of course , many questioned the validity of this photo , as it looked “ pretty obviously ” a photoshopped one !
But , this is the photo straight out of the camera ( converted to black and white ) .
So , here are the steps to duplicate this photo
This was taken in a totally dark room ( absolutely dark )
The camera was put in Shutter - Priority mode i.e. a mode where you can control the shutter speed and the camera handles everything else .
I used a shutter speed of 10 seconds .
This can be anything based on the effect you want .
When the room is dark , Vidhya goes and sits on the sofa .
Then , i click the shutter - release button ( basically , take the photograph ) .
Then , a light ( preferably a powerful one located such that it doesnt put Vidhya in a shadow ) is switched on for a fraction of a second and immediately switched off .
Because of this action , the room ( including Vidhya ) are exposed on the camera .
Then , i go into the frame , position myself .
Then , the light is switched on and off ( like the first time ) .
Here is the logic behind the photo : Since i and the background behind me got exposed during the 2 times the light was on , i appear to be transparent in the photograph .
Few things to get this photo right : Vidhya had to be dead - still during the 10 seconds .
Otherwise , her changed position would get exposed when the light is switched on the second time .
Get a background which can covey the transparency well .
We took a lot of attempts to get this right .
First , Vidhya was not happy with my position in the photograph and complained a lot about my posing skills .
Then , we moved around the props in the room till we were satisfied with the overall composition .
Sometimes the switching - on - and - off action was too fast resulting in a dark picture .
In other cases , the switching on happened a little earlier than expected resulting in my movements getting exposed in the photograph .
At one point i got bored with the same pose i was giving and we wanted a different look to the picture .
Lokesh and Sarvesh posed for us and it turned out to be a great photograph .
We wanted to submit this photograph calling it “ Nightmare ” .
It was a tough call for us deciding which one to submit for the competition .
This technique can be used to produce some very interesting pictures if you think out - of - the - box !
Look at the picture below where Lokesh posed and then i went into the scene with a keychain light and drew the horns on him .
Twenty - one Senate Democrats , Joe Lieberman and all but one Republican just approved $ 70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The Democrats had tried for weeks to tie funding for the wars to a withdrawal plan , but in the end the president got his way .
AP :
The Senate on Tuesday night passed a spending bill combining funding for 14 Cabinet departments with $ 70 billion for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
By a bipartisan 76 - 17 vote , senators approved the massive bill , which bundles 11 annual appropriations bills funding domestic agencies and the foreign aid budget for the budget year that began Oct.
1 .
Earlier , by a 70 - 25 vote in the Senate , President Bush and his GOP allies won a major victory in passing a measure providing $ 70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — without restrictions that Democrats had insisted on for weeks .

The sight of young people gathering on streets and in shopping centres is one of the things that can create alarm or suspicion in adults , who think such groups are going to be abusive or extreme in their behaviour .
But today 's report from the Good Childhood inquiry ought to challenge many popular misconceptions about young people and our shared public space .
Set up by the Children 's Society in 2006 , the inquiry has so far reported on children 's attitudes to friends , family and learning .
What may come as a surprise in today 's findings is that many young people themselves feel that they are not safe or welcome in public places , sometimes because of aggressive gangs colonising these places , but also sometimes because of unfriendly adults .
Hanging around in groups is often a way for many youngsters to feel secure , rather than a way of menacing anyone else .
And the discouragement of games in public places intensifies the problem .
The inquiry 's earlier reports had few surprises - children value their friends , want stable , loving families with a proper parental presence and expect schools to be supportive and free from bullying .
Perhaps today 's report will pose the toughest challenges so far .
Its findings are about lifestyle , and they deal with , among other things , attitudes to alcohol , drugs and sex , revealing that the vast majority of children and young people approach these issues with a high level of common sense .
But the lack of safe public space - where the young can go and gather , away from both school and home - is a striking and repeated complaint .
Leisure facilities targeted at the young are often hopelessly under - resourced and , for children living outside the urban or suburban environment , the cost of public transport means that the options are severely limited .
All parents know just how much of a flashpoint the question of having your own space can be .
But the issue is just as acute outside the home - perhaps especially for young people whose home circumstances do n't allow any real privacy .
The withdrawal of young people into e-communication , from computer games to permanently attached mobile phones , is much lamented and maligned , but is partly about the desire to be inside a protected space from which adults are excluded .
If the world comes to be seen as territory where the casual presence of the young is not welcome , it is not surprising that the indoor , electronic world is more attractive .
But , as the report 's findings show , children still value actual physical companionship - which is why they want places to meet that really belong to them , or at least do n't belong to adults who want to exercise constant and critical scrutiny .
This ought to make us think a bit about what makes public space feel unfriendly to the young - and to realise that this includes the attitudes of some adults .
The use of ultrasonic dispersal devices - the Mosquito , audible only to those under a certain age - is a sad example of an indiscriminate and knee - jerk response to a perceived problem , which only deals at best with symptoms , not causes .
The Buzz Off campaign against these devices , which is strongly endorsed by the children 's commissioner , deserves wide support .
Open space , in park or street , is something we in the UK have not been good at handling in the past decades .
Some urban development has created desolate and uncared - for cityscapes , in which people do not want to spend time and which are distant from where anyone lives .
An uncared - for environment invites vandalism , and a downward spiral is set in motion .
Our Victorian ancestors thought a good civic landscape had parks , dignified public buildings and reliable public transport - all things that gave people a feeling of proud ownership in their community .
If we now hear young people lamenting the lack of safety in , and availability of what should be , public space , it is a predictable result of years of indifference to its importance for us all .
Political parties agree on the need to reclaim public space - making parks and playgrounds safer with non-intrusive adult supervision .
The urgent need for investment in decaying youth centres and the provision of new , possibly mobile , facilities is also recognised .
A few years ago the Soul in the City project drew in thousands of young volunteers in Manchester and then in London , reclaiming uncared - for space , such as half - derelict adventure playgrounds .
One of the recurring challenges is to find a way of safeguarding young people 's space without policing it in an intrusive or humiliating way .
Adults must think twice before assuming that every group of under - 20s in a street or mall is likely to be a threat .
We must work out what skills are required to provide realistic supervision , what voluntary help may be needed to support safe environments and what transport policies might best serve the needs of isolated young people in rural areas .
The issues raised in the inquiry 's report concern us all .
A comprehensive look at our expectations of urban life and space , and at how we can tackle the isolation of rural living , will help young and old alike .
The inquiry can hardly do its work if we are n't prepared to look into what makes a good adult life too .

CLOSE-UP : MITT ROMNEY CLOSE-UP : MITT ROMNEY
In - depth : Romney news , video , photos , timeline , more ... Mitt Romney on the campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights Read about each of Romney 's 2008 wins : Wyoming | Michigan | Utah | North Dakota | Minnesota | Massachusetts | Alaska | Colorado | Maine | Nevada CAMPAIGN ISSUES : 2008 CAMPAIGN ISSUES : 2008 Click on the titles to learn more about where the presidential candidates stand on the issues :
WAR IN IRAQ
The war in Iraq is the dominant issue in the 2008 race for the White House .
The early primary votes will be cast as the conflict completes its fifth year .
The next president will be the first to take the oath of office during an ongoing war since Richard Nixon in 1969 .
IMMIGRATION
Immigration is a highly divisive issue , as concerns about terrorism amplify the debate about border security .
Congress has failed to enact immigration legislation because of differences between supporters of tougher enforcement to limit illegal entry into the country and advocates of amnesty for illegal immigrants .
HEALTH CARE
Polls indicate that health care is one of the most important issues to voters heading into the 2008 presidential elections .
The rising cost of health insurance and the growing number of uninsured give the issue added urgency .
Several candidates have called for universal health care ; others have said these plans amount to socialized medicine .
EDUCATION
White House hopefuls are divided on the federal government 's role in education as Congress considers changes to President Bush 's signature schools law , the No Child Left Behind Act , and how to make college affordable .
ABORTION
In 1973 , the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in the landmark case Roe v. Wade and the ruling has been the subject of heated political debate ever since .
Presidential candidates over the years have weighed in on a variety of abortion - related topics .
GAY CIVIL RIGHTS
The issue of civil rights for gay men and lesbians -- including the definition of marriage , service in the military and protection against hate crimes -- has long divided the two major political parties .
It 's not as simple as saying Democrats are for them , and Republicans are against them .
AUGUSTA , Maine ( AP )  Mitt Romney won the presidential preference voting contest by Maine Republicans in the party 's municipal caucuses , which were heavily attended across the state .
Romney , the former Massachusetts governor , had a little over half of the vote with about two - thirds of the towns holding caucuses reporting Saturday .
John McCain worked to keep his vote above 20 % , trailed by Ron Paul and Mike Huckabee .
AFTER MAINE : Romney looks ahead " This is a people 's victory , " Romney said .
" And an indication that conservative change is something the American people want to see , " he said , calling the Maine results a " harbinger " of Tuesday 's results and said , " You will see a growing movement to get behind my candidacy . "
The non-binding votes , the first step toward electing 18 Maine delegates to the Republican National Convention , took place in schools , fire stations and town halls across the state .
Despite a sleet storm the night before that left much of the state coated with slush and ice Saturday morning , cars jammed the parking lot outside an Augusta elementary school where Kennebec County municipalities were caucusing .
Signs promoting the candidates were jabbed in snowbanks , and inside the school gym speeches were given on behalf of candidates as around 300 party members listened and occasionally broke into cheers .
Kim Pettengill , who has been a party activist for more than three decades , said Saturday 's was the largest Kennebec County caucus turnout since 1980 , the year Ronald Reagan won his first Republican nomination for president .
Party Executive Director Julie O'Brien said other counties reported similarly heavy turnouts .
Republican caucuses were being held in about 410 Maine municipalities , most on Saturday .
A few dozen towns , especially in northern Maine 's Aroostook County , held caucuses Friday , and a few more were set for Sunday and later this month .
The Maine Democrats hold their presidential preference votes at municipal caucuses on Feb. 10 .

Man Builds Himself a Billion Dollar Home Mukesh Ambani's home will have a helipad , health club and 600 servants .
MUMBAI , India , Jan. 29 , 2008  --
Up a winding , tree - lined street away from the constant chaos of India 's financial capital lies the construction site for what is believed to be the most expensive home in the world .
The house -- more like a tower , really -- is estimated to cost $ 1 billion , and its future resident , Mukesh Ambani , is India 's richest man .
And what will make up the dream home of the man who Conde Nast 's Portfolio magazine calls India 's first rupee trillionaire ?
Perhaps it would be easier to answer what it does n't have , because the dream home seems to be missing nothing .
Publications ranging from Portfolio to the The Guardian have run features on the skyscraper home , citing various amenities , which include , of course , a swimming pool , multiple " safe " rooms and 600 servants .
Along with a health club , the abode will reportedly have a home theater and a helipad , and the tower will include six floors for 168 car parking spaces .
At 570 feet tall , the home 's 27 stories will look more like 60 because the ceilings are so high , according to The Guardian .
All of this for one family consisting of Ambani , his wife , Neeta , their three children and Ambiani 's mother .
Criticism of Lavish Display
The glass house -- named Antilia after a mythical island -- was designed by Chicago architecture firm Perkins & Will .
The giant home under construction .
In a city where about 6 million people live in slums , where apartments that rent for $ 20,000 a month can claim views of both the Arabian Sea and homeless people relieving themselves , where the rich live among their poor servants , Ambani 's display of wealth has drawn criticism .
One local newspaper columnist called it " an edifice to his ego . "
Others have likened Ambani to ostentatious and wasteful Indian rulers of the past .
Forbes magazine has listed Ambiani -- with a net worth of $ 22 billion -- as the 14th - wealthiest man in the world , whose Reliance Industries Ltd. is India 's largest private companyr .
In November , the Mumbai Mirror reported he bought his wife a luxury jet -- estimated at $ 60 million -- for her 44th birthday .
But outside the construction site , where a crane hovers above the concrete and steel , and workers ride elevators to reach the upper levels , it seems that Ambani 's wealth is not resented but revered .
" We are proud of him , " said Bhavanesh Asar , a 30 - year - old IT project manager .
What about the fact that it is so big ?
So high ?
So … ostentatiously large for such a small family ?
Asar shook off the criticism .
He pointed to a neighboring apartment building that also towered above the trees .
" He has money .
Why not ?
Bill Gates lives on a 58 - acre property for one family .
[ Ambani ] has funds , so why not ? " he said .
Suruinder Singh , 31 , who lives in the neighborhood , echoed the opinion .
" If you have the idea and you have the funds , then go for it .
Why not ? " he said .
The home is expected to be ready for the Ambanis to move into next year .
Currently , the family lives in a mere 14 - story building called Sea Wind .
1. ) N OT KISSING FIRST .
Avoiding her lips and diving straight for the erogenous zones makes her feel like you 're paying by the hour and trying to get your money 's worth by cutting out nonessentials .
A proper passionate kiss is the ultimate form of foreplay ( BUT BY NO MEANS THE ONLY ONE ! ) .
2. ) BLOWING TOO HARD IN HER EAR .
Admit it , some kid at school told you girls love this .
Well , there 's a difference between being erotic and blowing as if you 're trying to extinguish the candles on your 50th birthday cake .
Knock it off !
3. ) NOT SHAVING .
You often forget you have a porcupine strapped to your chin which you rake repeatedly across your partner 's face and thighs .
When she turns her head from side to side , it 's not passion , it 's pain damn it !
4. ) SQUEEZING HER BREAST .
Most men act like a housewife testing a melon for ripeness when they get their hand on a pair .
Stroke , caress , and sooth them .
5. ) BITING HER NIPPLES .
Why do men fasten onto a woman 's nipples , then clamp down like they 're trying to deflate her body via her breasts ?
Nipples are highly sensitive .
They can't stand up to chewing .
Lick and suck them gently .
Flicking your tongue across them is good .
Pretending they 're a doggie toy is not .
6. ) TWIDDLING HER NIPPLES .
Stop doing that thing where you twiddle the nipples between finger and thumb like you 're trying to find a radio station in a hilly area .
Focus on the whole breasts , not just the exclamation points .
7. ) IGNORING THE OTHER PARTS OF HER BODY .
A woman is not a highway with just three turnoffs : Breastville East and West , and the Midtown Tunnel .
There are vast areas of her body which you 've ignored far too often as you go bombing straight into downtown Vagina .
So start paying them some attention !
8. ) GETTING THE HAND TRAPPED .
Poor manual dexterity in the underskirt region can result in tangled fingers and underpants .
If you 're going to be that aggressive , just ask her to take the damn things off .
9. ) LEAVING HER A LITTLE PRESENT .
Condom disposal is the man 's responsibility .
You wore it , you store it .
10 . ) ATTACKING THE CLITORIS .
Direct pressure is very unpleasant , ....
And remember ..
It is not the on button for you to hit repeatedly !
So , gently rotate your fingers along side of it .
11 . ) STOPPING FOR A BREAK .
Women , unlike men , do n't pick up where they left off .
If you stop , they plummet back to square one very fast .
If you can tell she 's not there , keep going at all costs , numb jaw or not .
12 . ) UNDRESSING HER AWKWARDLY .
Women hate looking stupid , but stupid she will look when naked at the waist with a sweater stuck over her head .
Unwrap her like an elegant present , not a kid 's toy .
13 . ) GIVING HER A WEDGIE DURING FOREPLAY .
Stroking her gently through her panties can be very sexy .
Pulling the material up between her thighs and yanking it back and forth is not .
14 . ) BEING OBSESSED WITH THE VAGINA .
Although most men can find the clitoris without maps , they still believe that the vagina is where it 's all at .
No sooner is your hand down there than you 're trying to stuff stolen bank notes up a chimney .
This is okay in principle , but if you 're not careful , it can hurt - so do n't get carried away .
It 's best to pay more attention to her clitoris and the exterior of her vagina at first , then gently slip a finger inside her and see if she likes it .
15 . ) MASSAGING TOO ROUGHLY .
You 're attempting to give her a sensual , relaxing massage to get her in the mood .
Hands and fingertips are okay ; elbows and knees are not .
16 . ) UNDRESSING PREMATURELY .
Do n't force the issue by stripping before she 's at least made some move toward getting your stuff off , even if it 's just undoing a couple of buttons .
There is no turn off like the one where you are passionately kissing and in 2 seconds you have whipped it out or worse yet , have completely stripped .
17 . ) TAKING YOUR PANTS OFF FIRST .
A man in socks and underpants is at his worst .
Lose the socks fist .
18 . ) GOING TOO FAST .
When you get to the penis - in - vagina situation , the worst thing you can do is pump away like an industrial power tool - she 'll soon feel like an assembly line worker made obsolete by your technology .
Slow is the key !
In the beginning build up slowly , with clean , straight , regular movements .
19 . ) GOING TOO HARD .
If you bash your great triangular hipbones into her thigh or stomach , the pain is equal to two weeks of horseback riding concentrated into a few seconds .
20 . ) COMING TOO SOON .
Every man 's fear .
With reason .
If you shoot before you see the whites of her eyes , make sure you have a backup plan to ensure her pleasure too .
21 . ) NOT COMING SOON ENOUGH .
It may appear to you that humping for an hour without climaxing is the mark of a sex god , but to her it's more likely the mark of a numb vagina .
At least buy some intriguing wall hangings , so she has something to hold her interest while you 're playing Marathon Man .
22 . ) ASKING IF SHE HAS COME .
You really ought to be able to tell .
Most women make noise .
But if you really do n't know , do n't ask
23 . ) PERFORMING ORAL SEX TOO GENTLY .
In the beginning this is cool .
Very seductive , but do n't act like a giant cat at a saucer of milk .
Get your whole mouth down there , and concentrate on gently rotating or flicking your tongue on her clitoris .
24 . ) NUDGING HER HEAD DOWN .
Men persist in doing this until she 's eyeball - to - penis , hoping that it will lead very swiftly to mouth - to - penis .
All women hate this .
It 's about three steps from being dragged to a cave by their hair .
If you want her to use her mouth , use yours first ; try talking seductively to her , and if all else fails reciprocation is the key !
25 . ) NOT WARNING HER BEFORE YOU CLIMAX .
Sperm tastes like seawater mixed with egg white .
Not everybody likes it .
When she 's performing oral sex , warn her before you cum so she can do what 's necessary .
26 . ) MOVING AROUND DURING FELLATIO .
Do n't thrust .
She 'll do all the moving during fellatio .
You just lie there .
And do n't grab her head .
27 . ) TAKING ETIQUETTE ADVICE FROM PORN MOVIES .
In X - rated movies , women seem to love it when men ejaculate all over them .
In real life , it is disgusting and a sure - fire way to put an end to your oral fantasies !
28 . ) MAKING HER RIDE ON TOP FOR AGES .
Asking her to be on top is fine .
Lying there grunting while she does all the hard work is not .
Caress her gently around the torso area , so that she does n't feel quite so much like the captain of a schooner .
And let her have a rest .
29 . ) ATTEMPTING ANAL SEX AND PRETENDING IT WAS AN ACCIDENT .
This is how men earn a reputation for not being able to follow directions .
If you want to put it there , ask her first or test the waters with your finger .
And do n't think that being drunk is an excuse .
30 . ) TAKING PICTURES .
When a man says , " Can I take a photo of you ? " she 'll hear the words " __to show my buddies . "
At least let her have custody of them .
31 . ) NOT BEING IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH .
Imagination is anything from pouring honey on her and licking it off to Fruit , vegetables , ice and feathers are all handy props ; hot candle wax and permanent dye are a no no .
32 . ) SLAPPING YOUR STOMACH AGAINST HERS .
There is no less erotic sound .
It 's as sexy as a belching contest .
33 . ) ARRANGING HER IN STUPID POSES .
If she wants to do advanced yoga in bed , fine , but unless she 's a Romanian gymnast , do n't get too ambitious .
Ask yourself if you want a sexual partner with snapped hamstrings .
34 . ) LOOKING FOR HER PROSTATE .
Read this carefully : Anal stimulation feels good for men because THEY HAVE A PROSTATE !
Women do n't .
35 . ) GIVING LOVE BITES .
It is highly erotic to exert some gentle suction on the sides of the neck , if you do it carefully .
No woman wants to have to wear turtlenecks and jaunty scarves for weeks on end .... and it looks pretty silly when its summer .
36 . ) BARKING INSTRUCTIONS .
Do n't shout encouragement like a coach with a megaphone .
It 's not a big turn -on .
37 . ) TALKING DIRTY .
It makes you sound like a lonely magazine editor calling a 1-900 line .
If she likes nasty talk , she 'll let you know .
38 . ) NOT CARING WHETHER SHE COMES .
You have to finish the job .
Keep on trying until you get it right , and she might even do the same for you .
39 . ) SQUASHING HER .
Men generally weigh more than women , so if you lie on her a bit too heavily , she will turn blue .
40 . ) THANKING HER .
Never thank a woman for having sex with you .

WASHINGTON  Vice President Dick Cheney on Thursday vigorously defended the use of harsh interrogation techniques on a few suspected terrorists , saying that the methods made up “ a tougher program , for tougher customers ” and might have averted another attack on the United States .
“ A small number of terrorists , high - value targets , held overseas have gone through an interrogation program run by the C.I.A. , ” Mr. Cheney said in an address to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington , around the same time that the head of the Central Intelligence Agency said one of the most controversial interrogation methods , “ waterboarding , ” may be illegal under current law .
The “ high - value targets ” included Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the mastermind of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Mr. Cheney recalled .
“ He and others were questioned at a time when another attack on this country was believed to be imminent .
It ’s a good thing we had them in custody , and it ’s a good thing we found out what they knew , ” the vice president said , drawing applause .
Mr. Cheney did not use the term “ waterboarding , ” which simulates the feeling of drowning in the subject .
But the C.I.A. director , Michael V. Hayden , acknowledged recently that Mr. Mohammed was one of three suspects on whom the harsh technique was used several years ago .
llustration of the effect of intervening matter in the cosmos on the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) .
On the right , the CMB is released shortly after the Big Bang , with tiny ripples in temperature due to fluctuations in the early Universe .
As this radiation traverses the Universe , filled with a web of galaxies , clusters , superclusters and voids , it experiences slight perturbations .
In the direction of the giant newly - discovered void , the WMAP satellite ( top left ) sees a cold spot , while the VLA ( bottom left ) sees fewer radio galaxies .

University of Minnesota astronomers have found an enormous hole in the Universe , nearly a billion light - years across , empty of both normal matter such as stars , galaxies and gas , as well as the mysterious , unseen “ dark matter . ”
While earlier studies have shown holes , or voids , in the large - scale structure of the Universe , this new discovery dwarfs them all .
“ Not only has no one ever found a void this big , but we never even expected to find one this size , ” said Lawrence Rudnick of the University of Minnesota astronomy professor .
Rudnick , along with grad student Shea Brown and associate professor Liliya Williams , also of the University of Minnesota , reported their findings in a paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal .
Astronomers have known for years that , on large scales , the Universe has voids largely empty of matter .
However , most of these voids are much smaller than the one found by Rudnick and his colleagues .
In addition , the number of discovered voids decreases as the size increases .
“ What we ’ve found is not normal , based on either observational studies or on computer simulations of the large - scale evolution of the Universe , ” Williams said .
The astronomers drew their conclusion by studying data from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey ( NVSS ) , a project that imaged the entire sky visible to the Very Large Array ( VLA ) radio telescope , part of the National Science Foundation 's National Radio Astronomy Observatory ( NRAO ) .
Their study of the NVSS data showed a remarkable drop in the number of galaxies in a region of sky in the constellation Eridanus , southwest of Orion .
“ We already knew there was something different about this spot in the sky , ” Rudnick said .
The region had been dubbed the “ WMAP Cold Spot , ” because it stood out in a map of the Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) radiation made by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotopy Probe ( WMAP ) satellite , launched by NASA in 2001 .
The CMB , faint radio waves that are the remnant radiation from the Big Bang , is the earliest “ baby picture ” available of the Universe .
Irregularities in the CMB show structures that existed only a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang .
The WMAP satellite measured temperature differences in the CMB that are only millionths of a degree .
The cold region in Eridanus was discovered in 2004 .
Astronomers wondered if the cold spot was intrinsic to the CMB , and thus indicated some structure in the very early Universe , or whether it could be caused by something more nearby through which the CMB had to pass on its way to Earth .
Finding the dearth of galaxies in that region by studying NVSS data resolved that question .
“ Although our surprising results need independent confirmation , the slightly lower temperature of the CMB in this region appears to be caused by a huge hole devoid of nearly all matter roughly 6 - 10 billion light - years from Earth , ” Rudnick said .
How does a lack of matter cause a lower temperature in the Big Bang ’s remnant radiation as seen from Earth "
The answer lies in dark energy , which became a dominant force in the Universe very recently , when the Universe was already three - quarters of the size it is today .
Dark energy works opposite gravity and is speeding up the expansion of the Universe .
Thanks to dark energy , CMB photons that pass through a large void just before arriving at Earth have less energy than those that pass through an area with a normal distribution of matter in the last leg of their journey .
In a simple expansion of the universe , without dark energy , photons approaching a large mass -- such as a supercluster of galaxies -- pick up energy from its gravity .
As they pull away , the gravity saps their energy , and they wind up with the same energy as when they started .
But photons passing through matter - rich space when dark energy became dominant do n't fall back to their original energy level .
Dark energy counteracts the influence of gravity and so the large masses do n’t sap as much energy from the photons as they pull away .
Thus , these photons arrive at Earth with a slightly higher energy , or temperature , than they would in a dark energy - free Universe .
Conversely , photons passing through a large void experience a loss of energy .
The acceleration of the Universe 's expansion , and thus dark energy , were discovered less than a decade ago .
The physical properties of dark energy are unknown , though it is by far the most abundant form of energy in the Universe today .
Learning its nature is one of the most fundamental current problems in astrophysics .

PRESSURED INTO SILENCE PRESSURED INTO SILENCE
Ways police departments say witnesses are pressured : Implicit threats , looks or gestures : 80 % Explicit threats of violence : 63 % Actual physical violence : 53 % Property damage : 45 % Other : 14 % Note : 71 % indicated more than one Source : Police Executive Research Forum Survey Heather Fong By Robert Galbraith , Reuters WASHINGTON 
Witnesses to killings and other violent crimes refuse to cooperate in law enforcement investigations with such regularity that their silence is driving down the rate of solved murders throughout the country , police officials say .
In a survey of 76 police agencies released this month by the Police Executive Research Forum , a national police advocacy group , 78 % cited a decreased willingness to testify among witnesses , and 45 % reported a drop in the rate of solved cases .
Trenton , N.J. , Police Director Joseph Santiago says the lack of cooperation extends to child murders and other crimes that once generated public outrage .
" We 're not getting information from the average person anymore , " Santiago says .
Even as violent crime plunged to historic lows during the past decade , authorities say the murder clearance rate also dropped — from a high of 69 % in 1998 to 60 % in 2006 , the last full year measured by the FBI .
A case is cleared when there is an arrest , the suspect is charged and the case is referred for prosecution .
FBI spokesman John Miller says criminals have successfully " marketed a climate of fear " in some places to silence potential witnesses — " a powerful force and not one that some police executives are trained to deal with , " Miller says .
San Francisco Police Chief Heather
Fong says the phenomenon is not confined to any one region .
Cities in which police cite persistent problems with witness cooperation : • In Minneapolis , Police Chief Tim Dolan says investigators encounter reluctant witnesses in 30 % of murder investigations and more than 50 % of other violent crime inquiries .
Dolan says the clearance decline is due in part to " codes of silence " that are increasingly common in cities where gangs use threats of retaliation to block law enforcement .
•
In Washington , incidents of witness intimidation were up 45 % last year , says Cynthia Wright , chief of the local U.S. attorney 's Victim - Witness Assistance Unit . • In Boston , Police Commissioner Ed Davis says witnesses ' fear of retaliation was directly related to low murder clearance rates that hovered near 38 % in 2006 .
To bolster public cooperation , Davis says the department installed an anonymous text - messaging system last year .
It strips off the identity of the senders , who provide initial leads in building criminal cases .
Within the past two years , Davis doubled the number of investigators and supervisors dispatched to homicide scenes , allowing for more contacts with potential witnesses .
Since 2006 , the clearance rate has inched up to 40 % , and authorities hope to push it over 50 % by this year .
" The more certain punishment " for the suspect , " the more certain people will be about coming forward , " Davis said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. syphilis rate rose for the seventh straight year in 2007 , driven by a continued surge in cases among homosexual and bisexual men , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday .
Since 2000 , when the national syphilis rate sank to a low of 2.1 per 100,000 people after a decade of progress in the 1990s , the rate has soared by 76 percent , the CDC reported .
Homosexual and bisexual men accounted for 64 percent of syphilis cases in 2007 , up from about 5 percent in 1999 .
CDC officials expressed concern not only because the recent increases in this bacterial sexually transmitted disease follows years of declines , but also because syphilis can elevate a person ’s risk of being infected with the AIDS virus and the odds of giving it to someone else .
They also called rises among women and blacks troubling .
The overall national rate of syphilis rose by 12 percent in 2007 from 2006 , reaching 3.7 cases per 100,000 people , based on preliminary CDC data released at a meeting in Chicago .
The rate for men was 6.4 per 100,000 , a 14 percent rise from 2006 .
The number of syphilis cases nationwide jumped to 11,181 in 2007 from 9,756 in 2006 , with men accounting for six times as many cases as women .
Rates for men and women had been roughly equivalent a decade ago .
Syphilis hit the black community very hard , with rates six times higher for men and 13 times higher for women than among whites , the CDC said .
The rate for black men , 21.5 cases per 100,000 , has risen 99 percent since 2003 .
Syphilis rates have been surging in homosexual and bisexual men in the past decade , particularly among those who are highly sexually active with multiple sex partners .
RISKY BEHAVIOR
“ Having multiple sex partners and other high - risk behaviors like not using condoms do put you at higher risk for HIV and syphilis , ” CDC epidemiologist Dr. Hillard Weinstock said in a telephone interview .
“ Syphilis can increase the likelihood of HIV transmission two to fivefold .
And CDC recommends that sexually active men who have sex with men get tested for syphilis , HIV and other STDs at least annually , ” Weinstock added .
“ It is imperative that we make STD screening and treatment a central part of the medical care for gay and bisexual men , ” while also finding ways to avoid these infections including HIV in the first place , said Dr. Kevin Fenton , who heads the CDC ’s STD , AIDS , tuberculosis and viral hepatitis prevention effort .
Weinstock said despite the increases of this decade , syphilis rates remain lower than in the past .
After reaching 50,000 cases and a rate of 20.3 cases per 100,000 people in 1990 -- the highest rate since 1949 -- public health efforts helped drive down the rate to 2.1 per 100,000 people in 2000 .
“ We are concerned that the increases that we ’re seeing now could continue , ” Weinstock said .
Syphilis is passed person - to - person through direct contact with a syphilis sore .
Transmission of the organism occurs during vaginal , anal or oral sex .
Pregnant women with syphilis can pass it to their babies .

NORTH SHORE , Oahu --
Threading his way around surfboards scattered on the grass , Roy Powers wanders to the edge of the beachfront property rented by his sponsor , O'Neill clothing , and gazes out toward the Pacific Ocean where two dozen or so surfers are riding waves near the Banzai Pipeline .
Powers is in a fine mood today , which is not surprising .
He is quick to smile , just as quick to laugh ; the sort of engaging , good - humored optimist given to saying such things as , " All those pissed - off terrorists ?
They have to laugh too , do n't they ? "
[+]
Enlarge JOLI for ESPN.com
Why is Roy Powers smiling ?
He 's a professional surfer .
And Powers has reason to laugh .
As a top professional surfer he has sponsorship deals that pay him well into six figures .
He has a travel fund that covers his trips to surfing contests all over the world , including Australia , Tahiti , France and South America .
He owns a home about a mile from here plus a house on the Big Island he 's never seen .
He recently fulfilled a lifelong dream by winning the Reef Hawaiian Pro competition , guaranteeing himself a spot on the World Championship Tour next season .
And on this beautiful December day , he golfed in the morning , will surf a bit in the afternoon and has prime tickets for the next evening 's Hawaii Warriors football game with his father .
He is 26 , tan , lean , muscled and has never had to worry about his weight .
If you really want to appreciate how large Powers lives , consider this story he tells .
When he finally secured a date with a girl he had a crush on for years , he took her to a strip club in Honolulu , where he gave her 500 $ 1 bills and had her make it rain .
" It 's not classy , " he says , " but it worked . "
( Note : The above should only be attempted by trained professionals .
Do not attempt at home . )
" It 's probably one of the best lifestyles you can have , " Powers says of pro surfing .
" All the luxuries of Hollywood or any actor or any great person with privileges has , we have the same thing .
But it 's still under the radar .
We 're still able to touch water and have that freedom , that 'au natural ' stuff that people pay millions and millions of dollars to see and do -- we 're going to every one of those places .
We 're going to the south of France , Australia .
And the funniest thing is we 're in Australia with no parents .
None of that .
You 're with your boys , or your girlfriend , your friends .
You 've got a rental car , you 're racing around , surfing , eating good food , going to parties .
I mean c'mon , is this real ?
It 's not even real .
" I did an article with this Beverly Hills magazine .
They wanted to do something on a different luxury lifestyle and at the start the guy was like , ' Pro surfer ?
That does n't sound good ' and by the end the guy was tripping out .
' Your life sounds better than when we had a conversation with Floyd Mayweather or Tom Cruise . ' "

Waves the size of strip malls pound this coastline each winter , attracting pros from all over the world for the Triple Crown contest .
The men's Triple Crown begins with the Reef Hawaiian Pro in late November , continues with the O'Neill World Cup at Sunset Beach and climaxes with the Billabong Pipeline Masters in mid-December .
The women 's Triple Crown runs at the same time with the Reef Hawaiian Pro and the Roxy Pro Sunset , along with the Billabong Pro Maui ( the women 's contest does not include Pipeline ) .
" It 's the proving ground , " Powers says , pointing down the beach toward Pipeline .
" You come here to prove yourself to show you have the balls .
That 's where a wave can make you famous .
Or it can end your life .
It happens .
It 's real life out there . "
During the competition , the biggest sponsors rent out beachside homes ( at $ 500 - $ 1,500 per night ) for their surfers .
From one end of the beach to the other , surfers cram house after house , some luxurious , some not , some with ample beds , others requiring blankets on the floor .
Some are so close to the ocean the surfers merely need to wake up , pick up a board and walk out the back door and onto the beach .
" This is what you call extreme bachelor pad , " Powers says of the house rented by O'Neill .
" This is where good times happen . "

Enlarge JOLI for ESPN.com Nineteen - year - old South African Jordy Smith is regarded as surfing 's next big thing .
WITH THE SUN SINKING into the blue Pacific , Jordy Smith stands in the O'Neill house living room , microphone in hand , eyes focused on the TV screen , singing along to Eric Clapton 's " Wonderful Tonight . "
And he 's actually singing well , hitting the high notes with emotion and sending the karaoke meter skyward .
Jordy has a pretty decent voice .
" He 's got a great voice , " Powers says .
" If I was gay , I 'd be stoked . "
We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that 's walking around with me .
And then she asks me , " Do you feel all right ? "
And I say , " Yes , I feel wonderful tonight . "
Jordy has every reason to feel wonderful , not only tonight but every night .
At 19 , he is considered the next big thing in surfing ( literally so at 6 - foot - 2 , nearly 200 pounds ) , the LeBron James of the sport .
After a self - generated six - month free agency period in which he surfed with no sponsorship , he recently signed a multiyear deal with O'Neill rumored to be in seven figures .
In surfing , the big money comes not from competition but from sponsorships and endorsements .
While the O'Neill World Cup pays just $ 15,000 to the winner , the elite athletes can make $ 500,000 to $ 1 million a year from the clothing sponsors such as O'Neill , Quiksilver , Volcom and Billabong .
Surfing and singing karaoke on the North Shore is literally and spiritually as far as Smith could be from where he was two years ago while finishing up at a traditional boys - only prep school in Durban , South Africa .
Green blazers , ties and gray slacks were required ( though in the summer you could wear shorts just so long as you also wore gray knee - high socks ) .
Hair had to be trimmed short enough that it did n't touch the collar .
Shoes had to be shined , nails clipped , and flip - flops were n't allowed .
Discipline was so old - school it included a leather belt .
To make up for all the time he spent competing around the world , Smith would attend crash courses there from 7:30 a.m. until 3 p.m. each day , take two hours off , go back to class from 5 until 9 .
" It just gave me more fire to surf when I had the chance , '' he says .
" To surf all day , every day , when I had that chance . "
Or as his father , Graham , describes it , " What happens to you when you get out of [ that environment ] ?
" FREEDOM ! "
The best waves of your life are the ones where you do n't think you 're going to make it .
And when you make it ?
I do n't know , it 's hard to describe .
You 're sitting there thinking , ' Oh , my God , I 'm not going to make it , I 'm not going to make it .
Oh my God , this wave is going to pass me by and eat me .
And kill me . '

So what job did you have when you were 19 ?
For that matter , what did you do when you were 16 ?
While you may have studied geography in school , Garrett Parkes is seeing it in person , one spectacular beach at a time .
In the past year he has traveled to Bali , France , Portugal , Taiwan , the east coast of his native Australia and here to Hawaii , where the surf is so close that it literally washes up to the rental house 's foundation and back bedroom .
" You can't really top it , I do n't think , " Parkes says .
" You get to travel the world , hang with great , crazy people , meet people from different countries and cultures and surf .
It 's the perfect job , really . "
And just think how much fun Parkes would have if he had a driver 's license .
Parkes signed his first endorsement deal at age 10 with Quicksilver .
He declines to say how much his current deal pays but acknowledges it's more than the normal family earns .
His situation is n't even particularly rare .
Rosie Hodge had a deal with Roxy at age 9 .
" I remember trying to be cool and businesslike , " she says of the first negotiations .
" I just wanted a couple T - shirts and bikinis . "
John John Florence , the 15 - year - old wunderkind with the blonde tresses of a rock star , had a deal with O'Neill at age 5 .
The bidding was so fierce to sign Jordy that Nike had Tiger Woods call him one day .
" He just gave me advice on how he went about it when he was my age and tell me about the company he was with , " Jordy says .
" It was kind of baffling in the beginning .
You do n't know what to say because he 's such a high - profile guy , but you just kind of cruise with it . "
Traveling the world , staying in beach houses on someone else 's dime , receiving advice from Tiger , a seven - figure endorsement deal and a good voice it beats the normal teenage life of video games and pimples .
Jordy does n't even need to worry about applying sunscreen to his back .
" The girls on the beach do my back , " Jordy says .
" Never a shortage of girls to sunscreen my back . "
AS SEVERAL SURFERS LOUNGE about the O'Neill house , Graham Smith talks about a 100 - foot swell heading for the coast of Ireland .
" I read about it on the Internet this morning , " he says .
" They say it will wipe out the beaches . "
Ian Walsh , sitting on the couch across from Smith , hears the talk of a 100 - foot swell and his response , naturally , is to wonder whether he should fly to Ireland and surf it .
In addition to competing , Walsh chases big waves all over the world at a moment 's notice .
That commercial showing Shaun White jetting around the world from Vancouver to Japan to Norway for the best snow ?
" My life is EXACTLY like that commercial , " says Walsh , 24 .
" I 'll be on the phone making 30 - 40 phone calls , lining up people to shoot it , booking the helicopter for the video "
About a month ago , Walsh was in Hawaii competing when he heard of a monstrous swell heading for Tahiti , the sort of wave that should include an upside - down luxury cruise ship with Ernest Borgnine , Shelley Winters and Red Buttons on board in New Year 's Eve party hats .
He tracked the swell for five days , checking to see if it was holding its size and worthiness .
He was debating whether or not to chase it when his brother , Luke , said , " Why not ? "
[+]
Enlarge JOLI for ESPN.com Ian Walsh says he 's felt himself dying twice during spills .
Unable to counter this unimpeachable logic , Walsh packed his bags and booked his flight on the way to the airport .
He flew five hours to Los Angeles , where he met fellow surfer Shane Dorian , then caught a flight a couple hours later to Tahiti .
They flew 10 hours , landed , gathered their gear , grabbed a couple of hours of sleep , woke at 4:30 and were on the ocean by 6 .
A couple of hours later , Walsh caught the best wave of his life , a wave so colossal he wo n't even guess at its height , though from photos it makes Fenway 's Green Monster look small .
Walsh caught a flight back to Los Angeles , changed planes and returned to Hawaii .
" I was on the plane longer that I was there , " he says .
Walsh is professional , businesslike and a good cook .
And he feels a deep need to surf waves so large their photos look generated by Industrial Light and Magic .
" The best waves of your life are the ones where you do n't think you 're going to make it , " he says .
" And when you make it ?
I do n't know , it 's hard to describe .
You 're sitting there thinking , ' Oh , my God , I 'm not going to make it , I 'm not going to make it .
Oh my God , this wave is going to pass me by and eat me .
And kill me . '
And then you make it and it 's ' Let 's do it again .
Only on a bigger wave . ' "
Not too surprisingly , Walsh says he was n't able to get insurance last year .
He pulls out a thick wad of old boarding passes .
This , he says , will provide an idea of how many miles he flies .
He fans them like a magician spreading a deck of cards .
Los Angeles , Maui , Tokyo , Paris , Singapore , Kauai , Sydney , Bali , Honolulu , San Jose , Tahiti
Very impressive .
And all those flights are just from the past year ?
No , Walsh says , " That 's like just the last couple months .
Just since summer . "

Lean and blonde with a scruffy beard , the 22 - year - old is the very epitome of a surfer dude in Hawaii .
" The only thing I 'm missing , " he says , " is a girl in a hula skirt and a coconut shell bikini . "
Not for long .
Minutes later he is sitting at the edge of the lawn , looking at the surf while a gorgeous young woman in a very small bikini sits in the chair next to him .
She does n't have a grass skirt or a coconut - shell bra , but she 's close enough .
Sitting with them is Walsh , and his manager , Travis Clarke .
Standing behind them taking in all this is Walsh 's brother , Luke .
Luke , 22 , dropped off the pro circuit a couple of years ago to go to college .
The reasons why become clearer after listening to him describe a trip to France in 2004 .
He was there to compete at Biarritz , which sounds great , except he and two fellow surfers booked a hotel for only the first two nights ( " It was really ill - planned " ) and unfortunately there was a huge , international festival in town and every hotel within 50 miles was booked .
" So we got kicked out of the hotel .
We loaded up all of our stuff .
Some gypsy packed us up into his car .
It was crazy .
He 's like , ' Your only option is to sleep on the beach . ' "

For pros like Rosie Hodge , the surfing circuit means a lot of packing and a lot of plane flights .
Which they did , and that would have been fine , only the first night they awoke to a thunderstorm of biblical proportions .
The next night , someone stole his backpack , which carried his money , credit cards and passport .
And then the three lost their first heats of the contest .
They borrowed some money and took the train to Paris to get a replacement passport at the U.S embassy .
He says he did eventually win a competition , which paid him a whopping $ 300 .
Luke wound up flying back to the States , where he earned his keep teaching lessons , competing and working in a surf shop on the Jersey shore until returning home to Maui , with perhaps $ 200 of massive earnings .
Even then he might have stayed with pro surfing -- despite the daunting $ 20,000 he estimates for annual travel expenses on the Men 's Qualifying Series -- had he not had an appendectomy that left him unable to compete for two months .
With nothing to do but think about life , he decided that college might be a better career choice .
So he enrolled at the University of Hawaii , where he majors in marketing .
He 's considering working in the surf industry , perhaps managing his brother .
" It 's hard sometimes , '' he says .
" I 'll be stuck in town working on some term papers and Ian will be doing exactly this , sitting on the beach relaxing .
But all the advice I get is it will work out in the end . "
That 's probably sound advice , because pro surfing definitely is n't all hula girls and coconut shells .
A POWERFUL STORM with hurricane - force winds roared across the island two nights earlier and there still are downed cables and homes without power as Melanie Bartels rushes to prepare for the Billabong championship on Maui .
It 's a short flight from Oahu , but depending on the surf conditions for the event , she could be gone anywhere from four to 10 days .
And in addition to getting ready for the trip , she has a job interview .
Bartels , 25 , won the Roxy Sunset contest last year .
This year , she lost her sponsor and does n't know whether she 'll be able to continue .
She has a son , Ezekial , and a few more responsibilities than the average young surfer .
According to the Association of Surfing Professionals Web site , she won $ 27,700 in prize money this year .

Enlarge JOLI for ESPN.com Melanie Bartels shows why she 's one of the top female surfers in the world .
But she has trouble making a living on the tour .
" Right now , I just have to get another job .
Anything that will pay , " she says over the phone , declining a more extensive interview due to a lack of time .
" I need some income .
It 's so hard when you do n't have a sponsor .
It 's tough , man .
This will be the first year without a sponsor and the real world is hitting me . "
As Luke Walsh learned the hard way , most pros do not earn hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Many struggle just to get by .
According to the ASP , the 200th - ranked surfer on the Qualifying Series , Clancy Dawson , earned $ 3,300 in prize money last year .
The 500th won nothing at all .
It 's even tighter on the women 's circuit , where sponsorship and prize money are considerably less than the men receive -- a very few make $ 500,000 , a few others earn in the low six figures and many earn far less .
" There are girls who do n't even have a sponsor , " says Chelsea Hedges , ranked seventh in the world , " and they 're traveling just on their prize money to get from one event to the next or they 're maxing out their credit cards . "
While Hedges and Hodge enjoyed a lovely house by Sunset Beach for the Roxy Pro courtesy of their Roxy / Quiksilver sponsor , Samantha Cornish and two other surfers paid for a rental house on their own .
Cornish is ranked fourth in the WCT standings but she competed without a sponsor this year .
She earned $ 48,100 in prize money , which does n't go all that far when you fly all over the globe and stay at some of the world 's most popular beaches .
" Of course , there have been times when I 've felt I would like a job where I get paid more , " Cornish says .
" But there 's something inside me that wants to win the world title .
There are only a few us in the whole world who can do this , and I 'm fortunate to be one of them . "
And at least English is Cornish 's first language .
Brazil 's Pedro Henrique and William Cardoso squeeze themselves and about a dozen boards into a small bedroom at Bruno Lemos ' North Shore house .
A photographer with a passion for surfing , Lemos moved to Hawaii from Brazil in 1991 .
In recent years he has offered Brazilian surfers inexpensive rent in his surf - themed home ( there are boards attached to the living room ceiling ) during the Triple Crown so they can reduce travel expenses .
Robson Silva is also staying in the house and Lemos says one year he had three surfers staying in a bedroom and another in the living room .
" It 's so expensive here -- it helps out a lot , " Lemos says while cooking up a pot of pasta for the house dinner .
" All of the rich guys have a studio in the back of their house .
Renting them out is a major part of their income . "
Henrique is fortunate to have a sponsorship which , he says , pays him roughly $ 3,000 a month .
From that he must pay his considerable travel expenses -- and his airline ticket to Hawaii alone cost $ 1,800 .
He also pays 20 percent of his salary to the management agency that represents him .
What is left over goes back to his wife , Carol , and 2 - year - old daughter , Ariel , in Brazil .
He won $ 12,200 this year .
" It 's not easy , " he says .
" For some guys , we have to be on the CT to win the prize money to help with travel and send home .
Maybe we can buy a car or a house .
With the guys on the QS , it 's a little bit harder because they pay less . "
Thus , Henrique and Cardoso are happy to accept their space in this home .
While Lemos ' son sleeps in his parents ' room , the two world - class surfers share his bedroom , sleeping on bunk beds .
A SIGN POSTED IN THE SAND warns of the dangerous surf near the world - famous Pipeline , but a more powerful warning is attached to the chain - link fence at the beach entrance .
Candles , flowers and a photo montage are dedicated to some of the surfers who met their death at Pipeline , including popular Tahitian pro Malik Joyeux , who drowned here two years ago in what is described by one lifeguard as " really nice conditions . "
" More people die at Pipeline than all the other surf spots in the world put together , " Alexander says .
" It is so shallow , so intense and it comes from deep water and hits a really shallow reef and jacks up really fast .
A lot of people die out there .
I 've lost friends out there .
I had one friend who had half his face ripped off by the coral reef .
He had four kids and a wife . "

The backyard is littered with surfboards .
But the view is fantastic .
This is the other side of surfing :
It is a dangerous sport .
Facing a 97 - mile fastball or an angry 280 - pound defensive lineman is no day at the beach , but then , neither is a day at these beaches .
As lifeguards keep a protective eye on the competition at Sunset and the event announcer warns spectators to stay far up the sand , word spreads that Peter Davi has died that same afternoon while surfing big waves off the California coast .
The previous day a huge wave on Maui ripped open a gash the length of Brett Lickle 's thigh , requiring Laird Hamilton to strip off his own surf shorts for a tourniquet to save him .
Ian Walsh says he twice has come so close to drowning that he could feel his extremities go numb from the last remaining oxygen rushing to his brain and heart .
Pro surfing no longer seems like such a great lifestyle .
Walsh 's parents live on Maui just miles from Jaws , the massive break where Ian once surfed a 69 - foot wave .
His mother , Kitty , worries every time she hears an ambulance .
" The sirens go by and you just wait and listen , " she says .
" Where did the siren start , how far did the ambulance go ?
And you then see rescue helicopters fly by .
You just close your eyes and hope . "
She says Ian is supposed to call as soon he leaves the beach to let her know he 's all right .
" It 's pretty frightening as a parent . "
THE OCEAN GIVES and the ocean takes away .
And sometimes it does both .
Hurricane Iniki struck Kauai in 1992 , when Powers was 12 years old .
The storm devastated the island but he also recalls making the most of the situation when the National Guard arrived after the storm .
" I had military guys driving me to the beach to surf in their Humvees .
How rad is that ?
They would give me their rations for lunch . "
Powers worked hard for many years to gain a spot on the CT , traveling far from home , sacrificing family gatherings , missing life 's normal social activities .
And having finally qualified for the tour , he failed to make the cut again after his first season .
This left even the relentlessly cheerful surfer crying on the sand with a towel over his head .
He contemplated quitting , even considered trying out for the Los Angeles Galaxy soccer team , but fought on , rededicated himself and surfed well enough this year on the QS to requalify for the CT with his victory at the Reef Hawaiian Pro .
" I can't be a failure , " he says .
" If I quit and fail , it 's not just me I 'm doing that to .
Because it 's not just me I 'm doing this for .
I 'm doing it for my parents , for my town , for being a Hawaiian .
That 's how legends are made .
It 's the people who overcome all the obstacles and then come out on top . "
You must make the most of the waves you get .
" The ocean can deny you a window , " Graham Smith says .
" There are so many variables .
Catching the right wave .
Doing the right maneuvers at the right time .
It 's not like a game of tennis , where the nets do n't move or soccer , where the goals do n't move .
It 's overwhelming .
You can paddle toward a wave you think will be good and you could have paddled off the best wave of the day .
A lot of it is just pot luck . "
Luck and work and experience and patience .
Take the World Cup final at Sunset .
As the minutes wear down in the final , Makua Rothman needs a 9.01 ride ( out of 10 ) from the judges to catch Leonardo Neves of Brazil for the championship .
The three other surfers in the group paddle farther out in search of a last strong wave , but Rothman , 23 , virtually grew up at Sunset Beach and knows that he needs to be in closer .
He also knows how to handle the conditions , having once surfed what was described as the biggest wave ever successfully ridden at Jaws .
So he lines himself up with a friend 's house near the shore and waits .
And waits .
And with two minutes left in the competition , Rothman catches a beautiful wave and rides it magnificently , zipping through its barrel and carving its face for a score of 9.5 .
It beats not only Neves but 2007 world champion Mick Fanning as well .
And when the event ends , his friends rush to the edge of the surf , lift Rothman on their shoulders and carry him off the beach in triumph .
" It means everything to me , " Rothman says of the victory .
" I grew up right here .
I bled , cried , got my ass kicked -- everything -- right here on this beach . "
As the pros scatter following the contest , a handful of surfers steal into the waves with their boards .
The competition may be over , but the waves are still there .
The ocean can be challenging , thrilling and lethal , and the only way to experience it is to get on a board and ride .
" Surfing is like the ocean , " Powers says .
" Ups and downs .
Wishy washy .
Good waves , bad waves .
You 're what the ocean provides .
If the waves are good , life is good . "
And if the waves are bad , you do the best you can .
In other words , it 's a lot like life itself .
Only with awesome sunsets .
" It 's all a journey , " Powers says .
" It 's all a ride . "

It had to happen .
I just got back from a show and for the first time in 35 years of performing - no -one in the room of over a hundred people had a cigarette .
Normally , I borrow a pack of cigarettes and reproduce a signed silk handkerchief from them , but no - one had a pack on them .
No - one even pointed to a smoker and dobbed him in .
Thank goodness for MagicSports .
I had someone select a bread roll from the table and produced the silk from that instead .
Then I improvised a three minute routine to replace the sequence I normally do with the cigarettes .
As much as I love doing the cigarette tricks , I guess I 'm really going to have to phase them out .
Even Al Cappuccino is having to use dummy cigarettes in his act nowdays .
Luckily I have a lot of new material in the wings that 's been waiting for an opening like this ... who knows what trick is going to get it 's big break next : Jumbo Sidekick , Linking Coathangers , Virtual Card Trick ...
It 's just so hard to say goodbye to a routine you 've been honing for so many years ... and especially one that blends so seamlessly between two others .
Words fail me at a time like this .
There 's really nothing left to say but
Scientists say they 've found a new explanation – and a perhaps a path to a new cure – for heart disease .
In a study published today in Science , researchers led by UCLA molecular medicine professor Douglas Wallace modified a single mitochondrial gene in mice .
Their hearts quickly wore out and broke down .
Mitochondrial defects , which accumulate naturally during the course of a lifetime , have previously been found in diseased human heart tissue .
However , it was n't clear whether the defects were a cause or an effect of heart disease .
The UCLA findings offer direct evidence of a causal connection .
By finding ways to rejuvenate or protect these cellular power generators , it may be possible to prevent heart disease , which kills over 600,000 Americans every year – and that could be just the start .
" This provides strong support for the concept that aging and age - related diseases are associated with a decline in mitochondrial functional associated with the age - related destruction of mitochondrial DNA , " said Wallace in an email .
Mitochondria are structures called organelles , separate from the
DNA - containing cell nucleus but vital to cellular functioning .
They convert chemical energy provided by the food we eat into a form usable by our cells .
The process goes on constantly in every cell in our bodies , but over time the parts run down .
Stray oxygen molecules with an especially unstable configuration latch on to DNA in both the nucleus and , more dangerously , in mitochondria themselves .
Mitochondria have their own genes – just seventeen altogether , but of paramount importance , and just a few mutations can cause malfunction , even shutdown .
To model the effects of this degeneration , the researchers added a mutation to mitochondria in a mouse egg .
Once fertilized , the egg developed into a mouse riddled with defective mitochondria and , it turned out , defective hearts .
Compared to normal mice , their cardiac tissue was thick and weak , robbed of its natural strength – the same problems found in human heart disease .
The mice developed their disease after just a year ; normal mice do n't have heart problems until they 're at least two years old , said Wallace .
As with any rodent study , certain caveats are required , but other scientists have found high mitochondrial mutation rates in diseased human hearts .
The* Science * study fits with those findings , suggesting that the connection is direct .
Even more tantalizingly , Wallace and other mitochondrial medicine researchers believe that other age - related diseases , from diabetes and
Alzheimer 's to cancer , have the same mitochondrial roots .
They 're now searching for ways of fixing that damage with mitochondria - targeting drugs .
Among these are resveratrol , a compound that 's gained notoriety among longevity hackers and was recently shown to prevent diabetes in mice .
If the drugs work , they could change the way people live – and die .
And if they make it from the lab to people , things really get interesting : who owns them ?

Men accused of being homosexual are tortured by police , HRW alleges
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) decried the " ignorance and injustice " of a case in which a group of arrested men were given HIV tests without their consent .
They were also subjected to anal tests to " prove " their homosexual conduct .
Two of the men tested HIV - positive and are now handcuffed to hospital beds for 23 hours a day , HRW said .
" These men have been subjected to anal examination without their consent which amounts to torture , " Gasser Abdel - Razek , HRW 's acting director of regional relations in the Middle East , told the BBC on Wednesday .
" Egypt should release the men unconditionally and put a system in place that does not deal with HIV - positive individuals as criminals but as patients who require medical care and attention . "
Egypt's Interior Ministry had no immediate comment on the case .
' Ignorance and injustice '
Two of the men were arrested in October after a scuffle in central Cairo and when one said he was HIV - positive they were taken to the police branch which deals with issues of public morality .
Both men claim they were beaten for refusing to sign statements written by the police .
These cases show Egyptian police acting on the dangerous belief that HIV is ... a crime to be punished
Scott Long , Human Rights Watch
Two more men were arrested when police found their photographs and contact numbers in the wallets of those detained .
All four men , who have not been identified , remain in custody pending a prosecutor 's decision on possible charges .
Scott Long , director of the US - based group 's Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , and Transgender Rights Programme , said the arrests " embody both ignorance and injustice " .
" These cases show Egyptian police acting on the dangerous belief that HIV is not a condition to be treated but a crime to be punished , " he said .
' Habitual debauchery ' convictions
Four further arrests were made in November when police raided the flat of one of those being held , which had been placed under surveillance .
Those four men were sentenced to one year in jail in January having been convicted of " habitual debauchery " , which Human Rights Watch says is a euphemism used to penalise consensual homosexual acts .
Their lawyers claimed the prosecution had produced no evidence against the defendants , who pleaded not guilty .
While not explicitly referred to in Egypt 's legal code , homosexuality can be punished under several different laws covering obscenity , prostitution and debauchery .
Egypt has come under repeated criticism by both human rights groups and the international community for its treatment of homosexual people .
Leno to Paul : ' You should be kicking someone 's ass right now ' David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

In a freewheeling sit-down with the Tonight Show's Jay Leno just a day ahead of the New Hampshire primary , Republican presidential hopeful Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) called out Fox News , skewered GOP rival Rudy Giuliani and looked across the aisle to praise fellow presidential long shot Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
Kicking off the interview with a discussion of his exclusion from Sunday evening 's Republican presidential debate on the Fox News , Paul accused the network of not airing views that deviated from the Republican mainstream .
" Maybe they 're intimidated , maybe they 're frightened , " said Paul .
" Maybe they do n't want to know the truth ... you know I 've been trying to figure out what to do .
And I thought , ' Well , maybe I ought to sue them .'... I 've decided what to sue them over , and that is for fraud .
Because of this ' fair and balanced idea .
Leno , who expressed disappointment that Paul had been snubbed from the forum , said the candidate had a right to be mad .
" You do n't seem like that type , " said the host , " but it seems like you should be kicking somebody 's ass right now . "
Turning his attention to party rivals for the GOP presidential nod , Paul said he feared that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was losing support because of his Mormon faith .
" One thing I 'm a little bit afraid of is that they might be doing that for religious reasons , and I do n't like that , " he said . " I disagree with Romney on some of the issues , and he 's gone after me on the stage , but that should n't be the reason that he does n't do well . "
But Paul had no kind words for former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , with whom the congressman shared a heated exchange about the nature of terrorism during a Republican debate in May of last year .
When Paul had asserted that US policy was in part to blame for the Sept. 11 attacks , Giuliani demanded that the candidate retract his statement .
" You know when we had a little confrontation early on in the debates with Mayor Giuliani , you know -- and he was confused about what causes terrorism -- I sent him some books , " Paul told Leno .
" And I said ' Please read these books . '
But so far , it does n't sound like he 's read his books .
He has n't done his homework . "
Pressed by Leno as to whom he would support among Democratic contenders , Paul said that Kucinich had his respect -- though certainly not his vote .
" He understands civil liberties , " said Paul .
" He understands a lot about foreign policy ... I have a lot of respect for him , but we would disagree on economic policy . "
The respect is apparently mutual .
In November , Kucinich told supporters he was " thinking about Ron Paul " as a running mate should he win the Democratic nomination .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Democratic - led House of Representatives defied President George W. Bush on Friday and recessed without replacing an expiring spy law with one that would shield telephone companies from lawsuits .
With the temporary law set to expire on Saturday , Bush accused Democrats of undermining U.S. security .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer denied it and accused Bush of election - year fear - mongering .
Hoyer said he and fellow Democrats were reaching out to Republicans , and hoped to soon agree on a bill to replace the expiring law passed by Congress in August that expanded the power of U.S. authorities track suspected terrorists without a court order .
“ We will not , however , be stampeded , ” Hoyer said .
Bush met with congressional Republican leaders at the White House on Friday morning and took aim at House Democrats .
“ When they come back from that 12 - day recess , the House leaders must understand that the decision they made to block good legislation has made it harder for us to protect you , the American people , ” Bush said .
“ We expect now to get a good bill to my desk -- which is the Senate bill -- to my desk as soon as possible , ” Bush said before he departed on a six - day trip to Africa that he had considered delaying to try to resolve the stalemate over the eavesdropping bill .
The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to replace the “ Protect America Act . ”
But House Democratic leaders refused to bring it up for a vote , and Bush and his fellow Republicans along with some Democrats rejected a brief extension of the law .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat , joined Hoyer at a Capitol Hill news conference and said lawmakers were searching for common ground .

“ We are wrestling with what to me is the key question of retroactive immunity ” for telephone companies that participated in Bush ’s warrantless domestic spying program , Conyers said .
“ We have , I think , the beginnings of what could lead to a positive resolution , ” Conyers said without elaboration .
AFTER SEPT .
11
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act requires that the government receive the approval of a secret court to conduct surveillance in the United States of suspected foreign enemy targets .
But after September 11 , Bush authorized warrantless surveillance of communications between people in the United States and others overseas if one had suspected terrorist ties .
About 40 civil lawsuits have been filed accusing AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and Sprint Nextel Corp of violating Americans ’ privacy rights in the surveillance program .
Some lawmakers have suggested a secret court review of phone companies ’ actions before they could be granted immunity .
Democrats also disputed Bush ’s contention that the expiration of the law would place the United States at increased risk .
They noted that spy operations begun under the “ Protect America Act ” could continue for up to a year .
They also noted that new ones could begin with an emergency court order .
The administration contends , however , that obtaining court orders could be time - consuming and result in authorities failing to track and lose enemy targets .
Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said in a Washington Post opinion piece on Friday it was getting harder to win surveillance cooperation from phone companies due to the uncertainty over new legislation .
McConnell said if Congress does not grant immunity “ it will severely degrade the capabilities of our Intelligence Community to carry out its core missions of providing warning and protecting the country . ”
Sen . Edward Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat , denounced those remarks , saying , “ It ’s nothing more than a scare tactic designed to avoid legal and political accountability and keep Americans in the dark about the administration ’s massive lawbreaking . ”
Democratic Underground
With Little Notice , Sen. Leahy ( D - VT ) Pushes Through Repeal of a Scary Bush Power Grab
by odum
Gone virtually unnoticed by the media was a true rarity : a Bush power grab , pushed through by the previous Republican Congress actually rolled back .
Of the many disturbing things this President and his GOP Congress did , this was one of the more chilling .
Passed and signed into law in a very hush - hush manner , the law opens up the door for Bush to use the National Guard and other military forces domestically for almost any purpose he might deem appropriate .
………………………
What could happen under the new law ?
As just one example , let ’s say hundreds of demonstrators in Boston engaged in civil disobedience , sitting - in on the Boston Common to protest the country ’s policies in Iraq , and traffic ground to a halt .
Under the new law , the president could order in the Massachusetts National Guard to clear out the protesters even if the Massachusetts governor opposed this .
Indeed , the president could order the Guard of any state into any other state - even if the governors of both states objected .
In the end , Leahy got the right people front and center before his committee .
From Newsday :
Upon learning of the change , infuriated governors , National Guard
associations and local law enforcement groups mounted a campaign to
repeal the language , which they say usurps state authority and damages
domestic disaster response .
Spurred by belated public awareness of the law , lawmakers from both
sides of the aisle raised objections .
“ This law authorizes the president to essentially strip the control of a
state Guard unit from a state ’s governor without consent , ” Leahy said
during an April 24 hearing the Judiciary Committee held on the issue .
“ No governor was consulted , no debate , no hearing , nothing took place , ”
North Carolina Gov. Michael F. Easley , a Democrat , said at the April
hearing , adding that the law would hurt disaster response .
The repeal went into the latest Defense authorization , and quietly , and with little notice , a Bush power - grab was actually rolled back .
How often does that happen ?

Leaving his Upper Peninsula house on Nov. 9 , 1986 , a cold Sunday night , Frederick Freeman drove down to metro Detroit through Wisconsin , Illinois and Indiana .
He needed to limit his time on Michigan 's roadways .
He was a wanted man in this state .
Stopping at roadside pay phones , he checked in frequently with his pregnant girlfriend , Michelle Woodworth , back at the couple 's rented house in Rock , about 20 miles north of Escanaba .
He called from restaurants , gas stations and rest stops for any news .
The only information Freeman had came from a lawyer in Escanaba and was wrong .
The attorney , a friend 's father , told Freeman he was wanted for murder in his hometown of Flint .
Freeman thought the victim was a childhood friend who had recently left Escanaba after he and Freeman had a falling out .
Freeman also called Flint police to ask them what he could do to help prove his innocence .
After all , he'd been in the Upper Peninsula for several weeks and could n't have killed anyone downstate , he says .
Flint police finally told him to stop calling .
They did n't have him on record as a suspect for anything and did n't have a murder victim with the name he was giving .
Freeman reached a female friend 's house in suburban Detroit after two days of driving his red Mercury Marquis , happy to have avoided cops .
At 23 years of age , he was no stranger to the law .
He had a conviction for bad checks in Washington state and an assault charge pending in suburban Detroit after a tussle with his ex-wife 's boyfriend .
He also had a pending perjury charge in Ann Arbor for using a friend 's driver 's license .
He 'd been living under two aliases to avoid arrest .
He 'd been getting by up North by selling vitamins .
When he called Woodworth on Thursday , Nov. 13 , she told him Port Huron police were at their home with a warrant .
He was a murder suspect .
She was scared .
Freeman asked to talk to one of the officers .
It was n't his childhood friend who was dead , a detective named John Bowns told Freeman , it was Scott Macklem who 'd been gunned down .
Macklem , 20 , was the son of the mayor of Croswell , a small town northwest of Port Huron , and was engaged to a woman named Crystal Merrill who was expecting his child .
Freeman had lived recently in the Port Huron area , and had a relationship with Merrill for a few weeks the previous spring ; they met when he rented some videos from the Port Huron store where she was a clerk .
Freeman knew Merrill had previously dated Macklem , but he had n't spoken to her since July , and he'd moved north around Labor Day .
He says he did n't know of the couple 's renewed relationship , pregnancy and pending marriage .
Still , Merrill was Freeman 's only connection to the case , and he needed to know why police thought he 'd killed Macklem .
So Freeman called her that night from the pay phone in the back hallway of a Troy coffee shop .
She was at her parent 's farm in Croswell .
" I wish to god that phone call was recorded , " Freeman told Metro Times last month during an interview at the Saginaw Correctional Facility where he is serving a life sentence for the first - degree murder of Macklem .
He 's changed his name to Temujin Kensu to reflect his Buddhist faith .
" I said , ' What the hell is going on ? ' ... I was trying to find out why they thought I did this . "
The two talked for hours with a Sanilac County deputy listening in on a second phone in the house .
Merrill 's and Macklem 's parents were there as well as other officers .
The call began with Freeman offering condolences .
" I 'm sorry about Scott , I did not bear any malice for him , " he told Merrill .
Freeman has always contended he was in the Upper Peninsula the morning Macklem was gunned down in the St. Clair County Community College parking lot and he told Merrill as much during the telephone call .
" I did n't do this , " he says he told Merrill .
He reminded her he did n't own a gun .
He talked about several witnesses in Escanaba who would help prove he was there .
The officer listening in , Sanilac County Sgt. Dave Hall , later recalled Freeman discussing " several different reasons why he may not have been involved . "
During the call , Merrill informed Freeman she had told police about his martial arts training .
He had taken classes in tae kwon do , karate and kung fu beginning in grade school .
" I had a bunch of martial arts weapons , and she told her mom that I belong to some kind of mafia group or something , " Freeman told police following the phone call .
" She blew the whole thing out of proportion and made it sound like I 'm some kind of Japanese ninja mafia guy or something .
I never threatened Scott .
I never said a word about this guy . "
Freeman told Merrill that police were after the wrong guy .
" The police should look at somebody that Scott had made mad . "
Hall later remembered Freeman saying detectives should be looking for people who , " made [ Macklem ] mad or aggravated him .
That 's who I [ should ] be looking at . "
The conversation wandered between Macklem 's death , what Merrill had told police , the reasons why Freeman could n't have killed him and martial arts .
At one point , talk was winding down , but police told her to keep Freeman on the line .
Merrill says she cried , took time to go to the bathroom and talked about things that interested Freeman to keep him on the line while police traced the call and sent officers out for the arrest .
Freeman 's continued assertion of innocence is not his only argument that he was wrongfully convicted of first - degree murder in St. Clair County Circuit Court in May 1987 .
And he 's attracted a team of volunteer advocates who 've been digging into the case , some of them for 15 years .
They 've found that crucial evidence and testimony either were not considered , not believed or not known to the jury of seven women and five men that convicted Freeman .
The jurors also overlooked inconsistencies in testimony and evidence , ignored a lack of evidence in some cases , did n't hear from some key witnesses , including Freeman and Woodworth , and did n't know about other possible misconduct and conflicts of interest of police and attorneys involved in the trial .
These are some of the key elements of Freeman 's belated defense :
 No physical evidence would ever link Freeman to the crime .
Prints on a shotgun shell box found at the scene did n't match his .
One shell turned in to police weeks later had no prints and was a different gauge than the one that killed Macklem .
Freeman 's clothing did n't have gunshot residue .
The shotgun used to kill Macklem was never found nor was Freeman ever proven  or even reasonably suspected  to have owned a shotgun .
 Freeman had an alibi corroborated by several people .
Two witnesses confirmed he was in Escanaba having car trouble between midnight and 1:30 a.m. the day of the shooting .
Freeman 's girlfriend , Woodworth , told police they were at home in Rock the morning of the murder and slept until at least 9 a.m. before heading into Escanaba .
Two witnesses confirmed Freeman was in Escanaba by noon and four more testified he was there during the afternoon .
Woodworth did not testify at trial , saying she was afraid .
Police had threatened her , she reported a few months before the trial , saying she could lose custody of her infant child by Freeman if she testified .
 The prosecution presented a wild theory to counter the alibi witnesses .
St. Clair County Prosecutor Robert Cleland , now a judge in U.S. District Court in Detroit , told the jury it would have been possible for Freeman to charter a private plane to fly between Port Huron and Escanaba .
He introduced no pilot , no receipt of Freeman paying for the flight , no flight plan or other record of the journey , nor did he provide an explanation of how Freeman , who had little money , could have paid for the flight .
 The single eyewitness to put Freeman at the shooting scene identified him under a questionable police lineup procedure .
That witness , who had seen a man driving from near the murder site , recognized two of the six people in the lineup as police officers .
Another woman who saw a man driving away could not identify Freeman as that man .
A witness who saw a " suspicious " man in the parking lot an hour before the shooting picked a different man out of the lineup although he had earlier picked Freeman out of a series of mug shots .
 A jailhouse snitch lied about Freeman confessing and then received help from the St. Clair County prosecutor 's office .
A few weeks before his trial , Freeman shared a jail cell for a few hours in Port Huron with Philip Joplin , a career criminal .
Joplin testified at Freeman 's trial that Freeman confessed to killing Macklem .
Joplin would later recant in a letter and on videotape , saying he had lied to get a better deal on his sentence .
Another man who was in the cell at the time testified that Joplin , who died in 1998 , was lying about Freeman 's confession .
" [ Freeman ] was saying that he did n't do it , " Booker Brown , the other prisoner , said at Freeman 's trial .
Documents show Freeman 's trial judge and a St. Clair County assistant prosecutor assisted Joplin with a preferred placement in the Department of Corrections .
In front of the jury Joplin denied getting any deal .
 The star witness was Crystal Merrill , who 'd dated Freeman briefly before getting back together with Macklem .
Merrill spent the first two days of trial on the stand , testifying that Freeman raped her on their first date but that she continued to see him for several weeks , never telling anyone about the alleged assault .
She described his cache of ninja weaponry and a way he said he could make door keys from clay .
She said Freeman was a " higher up " at a secret organization that fought prostitution and drugs where he could " call contracts out on anybody . "
She said he had listening devices and could hear conversations across parking lots and camped out in cornfields around her family farm to learn what kind of tractors they owned .
" He told me he could read my mind , " she said .
Most of her testimony would go unsubstantiated by other witnesses .
 Freeman 's defense attorney and the lead investigator had a history that presented a conflict of interest .
David Dean , Freeman 's attorney , had previously represented the lead detective , John Bowns , after he was fired from the Port Huron police department .
Court records show that , in 1981 , a special agent for the Michigan State Police was conducting an investigation at the Midway Inn , a Port Huron motel where sports betting , bookmaking and high stakes poker games were suspected .
The State Police investigator reported that Bowns was there but the officer made no arrests and reported no suspected violations of gambling or liquor laws .
In 1982 , Bowns was fired for conduct unbecoming a police officer and neglect of duty .
Dean would represent him in a legal battle for unemployment benefits , which they lost .
Bowns was reinstated with Port Huron police about a year before the Macklem murder .
 Dean was a cocaine user , and drug abuse led to problems in the courtroom for him .
He pleaded no contest in a bust , a year before Macklem 's murder , for using coke in an Ohio park .
In 1990 , he was forced to withdraw as the court - appointed lawyer for a murder defendant who testified he had sold drugs to Dean .
In 1991 , one of Dean 's clients earned a new trial for a 1989 murder ; a judge ruled that Dean 's substance abuse had affected his status as defense counsel in that case .
During those proceedings , Dean 's assistant testified that Dean was using drugs at the time of Freeman 's case .
In 1993 , the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission Board suspended Dean from practicing law and ordered substance abuse counseling .
According to newspaper reports , board investigators charged that Dean had purchased cocaine or had it purchased for him at least 19 times during the summer of 1990 .
In 2001 , the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board denied Dean 's reinstatement petition .
Dean , who now lives in Florida , recently told Metro Times he has n't used in a decade and was not using at all during the Freeman trial .
 Freeman 's team has identified another man as the shooter .
A man Freeman met in prison says he knows who shot Macklem .
The motive , he says : a dispute over cocaine dealing .
Freeman 's investigators and lawyers have confirmed new information from this source and can place the new suspect in the same circles as Macklem and in the Port Huron area about the time of the murder .
As far as they know , police never questioned him .
But that 1986 evening , as Freeman spoke to Merrill , the cops had locked in on Freeman as their only suspect , court records and newspaper accounts show .
Merrill , who was working at Macklem 's father 's insurance office in Croswell at the time of the shooting , had told police she suspected Freeman as the shooter at the hospital just hours after Macklem died .
Investigators never had another suspect , they eventually admitted during trial .
They pursued their case against a single person of interest .
Nothing from Macklem 's background was investigated .
Since then , Freeman 's volunteer advocates  former FBI agents and Michigan State Police investigators , attorneys , private investigators , a documentary filmmaker and a veteran television journalist , Bill Proctor from WXYZ - TV ( Channel 7 )  have uncovered what they say is evidence of widespread corruption in the Port Huron and St. Clair County criminal justice systems at the time of Macklem 's killing and that ties Macklem 's death to his involvement in cocaine dealing .
Having exhausted his state appeals , Freeman this year filed a habeas corpus motion in U.S. District Court in Detroit that will force a judge there to determine if the conviction and imprisonment violate Freeman 's constitutional rights .
His team is hopeful about the petition 's chances , which is before Judge Denise Page Hood .
" There was n't the evidence to convict him .
It just was n't there , " says Hank Glaspie , a 24 - year FBI special agent who has worked pro bono for Freeman 's release .
" There 's a lot more information behind what appeared at trial .
...
It 's some scary shit . "
Glaspie and the team have identified a new suspect as the alleged shooter , and he is a man who is free and living in metro Detroit .
These volunteer investigators have detailed inconsistencies in the police investigation and prosecutors ' arguments and documented new or different testimony of key witnesses that would have helped Freeman 's case .
Some of it they wo n't talk about on the record .
Former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Brennan read the 13 - day trial transcript this year after learning of the case from a student at Cooley Law School in Lansing .
" Reading the trial transcript as an outsider , you just had this smell of the whole thing , " he says .
" I do n't see how they could convict the guy .
...
Had I been the trial judge , I hope I would have had the guts to throw the case out . "
But the Michigan criminal justice system has taken no real second look at Freeman 's case .
And Freeman is left wondering what happened to his right to a fair trial and if he will ever be freed .
The Crime
Twenty - year - old Scott Macklem was living with his parents and routinely drove his 1973 Plymouth Turismo along two - lane country roads to reach St. Clair County Community College .
The Macklem family was well - known in Croswell , a farming community with about 2,000 residents then .
Scott Macklem 's father , Gary Macklem , had been mayor since 1982 , and the Macklem family name appears in local newspapers as far back as 1878 .
During the fall semester in 1986 , Scott Macklem was a general business student and worked as a stock clerk at a men's clothing store in Port Huron .
In 1984 , the year he graduated from Croswell - Lexington High School , other students voted him " most popular " and " best dressed . "
He 'd been captain of the basketball and golf teams .
But that fall 1986 semester , his algebra teacher would testify at trial , Macklem 's attendance had been irregular .
The morning he was killed he was scheduled for an 8 a .m. gym class , but he did n't attend .
Instead , at about 8:55 a.m. , he was at the side of his car in a campus parking lot when a shot rang out .
Other students heard it , possibly echoing off buildings .
A shotgun blast tore through Macklem , ripping a one - inch hole in the left side of his jacket , traveling through his back rib cage and continuing upward through his lungs .
It penetrated both lungs , grazed his heart , damaged his spleen and liver and fractured two ribs .
Medical staff at Port Huron Hospital , where he was pronounced dead , would remove a filler wad from the shell of a 12 - gauge or larger shotgun and seven pieces of buckshot , according to a Michigan State Police lab report .
An autopsy later that day showed he had died of " internal injuries and hemorrhage due to gunshot wound . "
He would be buried in the Croswell cemetery where 25 other Macklems rest today .
Forensic tests on Macklem 's red jacket , lavender sweater and striped shirt would indicate the shotgun had been fired from about 6 feet away .
His car keys were found in the driver 's door , his gym bag on the ground .
He was on his left side with an arm outstretched when a student attempted CPR before emergency medical workers arrived .
The student described to police a " deep gurgle sound coming from down deep within the victim " as he did mouth - to - mouth resuscitation , according to reports .
Several witnesses heard the shots but their descriptions of people and cars in the area would conflict .
Some matched Freeman , others did n't .
Wanda Crowe , a 45 - year - old student , noticed a woman in a red sweater walk " right by " Macklem 's car about the time the shot went off .
Because the woman " made no effort to help Macklem , " it stuck in Crowe 's mind that whatever was happening was some kind of hoax .
Crowe also told police she saw someone sitting in a bright yellow car directly across from hers .
" She turned in a plate number and we do n't know if it was run or not , " according to police notes at the time .
The report submitted the day of the murder by lead investigator Bowns makes no mention of the car or the plate .
Another woman , Jean Anter , approached Det. Harry Hudson at the scene when police arrived after the shooting .
A full - time student during the day , she worked at the St. Clair Inn as a waitress with a 5 to 11 p.m. shift .
When she got out of her car that morning , she noticed a tan or brown medium - sized vehicle driven by a white male through the parking lot at what she thought was a " faster than normal rate of speed , " Anter said .
As she walked , she saw Macklem walking by his vehicle but crouched over .
" Help me , help me .
I 'm hurt , " she heard him say .
She continued toward class but noticed a blond - haired woman getting into a car parked on the opposite side of the curb from Macklem 's car .
Of the four students police interviewed in the parking lot shortly after the shooting , three reported seeing a white man driving a car that was either medium - sized or small and tan , brown or reddish brown in color .
Two of the four said they saw a woman near where Macklem was found , possibly driving away .
In the weeks and months after the murder , police would eventually talk to additional witnesses or reinterview the original witnesses about the parking lot scene .
Five mentioned seeing a woman and four mentioned seeing a man either near Macklem or driving a car away from the lot .
The witnesses gave descriptions of cars in the lot just after the shots that included seven colors : yellow , blue , tan or brown , gold , black and reddish brown .
Port Huron Police Officer James Carmody was one of several officers dispatched to the scene who talked to students there .
He met Kathleen Ballard and Rene Gobeyn , who shared a morning philosophy class .
Ballard , who worked an afternoon shift at a Wendy 's restaurant , parked about 60 feet away from Macklem 's car that morning .
As she walked through the parking lot , she heard what she thought was a firecracker .
When she got closer to Macklem 's body , she saw a " small " vehicle pulling out of the parking spot next to his car .
From what she saw , the driver was attempting to conceal his face , but she could tell it was a white male , maybe 19 years old , with dark hair .
She told police the car was a Horizon or Chevette and reddish brown in color but she did n't see the plate .
After Freeman was arrested and placed in a lineup , Ballard would be " unable to select anyone , " according to a police report .
Her classmate , Gobeyn , eventually would be crucial to the prosecution 's case but his first statement to police was similar to other students ' that morning .
In his initial interview with Carmody , according to the report , Gobeyn said the man driving the car was white and about 25 years old .
Gobeyn said the man appeared to be wearing an olive - green army jacket and a dark blue ski mask that was folded up over his forehead and may have had red trim around the mouth .
" No further information on the physical of the driver , " the report noted .
Gobeyn described the car to Carmody as being " a small , possibly foreign make vehicle .
A pinkish - tan or dark tan in color , " according to the report .
" His first impression was that it may have been a Mazda , " Carmody recorded .
Because he had heard gunfire and then saw the car coming from the direction of the shot , Gobeyn told police he made a mental note of the license plate of the car .
He wrote it on a folder when he reached his classroom .
When interviewed , he gave it to officers .
But a computer check failed to find a license plate matching Gobeyn 's information .
According to Carmody 's testimony at Freeman 's preliminary examination three weeks later , Gobeyn had mentioned a beard on the driver .
There was no record of that detail the day of the shooting .
At about 11:50 a.m. , Carmody went to Port Huron Hospital to turn over information to Bowns , who was " in charge of the case , " according to Carmody 's initial report .
The Macklem family was at the hospital where they were " notified of the incident . "
Bowns got the blood - soaked shotgun shell wad from the doctor and eventually tagged it and put it in the Port Huron Police Department 's property room to dry .
He spoke to Merrill , Macklem 's pregnant fiancee , who had known Macklem since kindergarten .
" She stated that she went out with the suspect in this matter , " Bowns wrote .
Crystal Merrill described her ex-boyfriend as " real heavy into ninja " and " always talking about going to kill someone or hurt someone .
She stated at one time he beat her up just to see what her reaction would be , and to see how she could defend herself , " according to Bowns ' report .
Merrill said she feared the man she named as his alias John LaMar and that he was " capable of doing anything . "
She described him as " strong " and " muscular " and having " no fear of anybody . "
Later Merrill would call Freeman possessive and say he had wanted to marry her .
She said he could read her mind and that he kept his chest tattoos puffed up " with some kind of quills . "
She would describe Freeman a few weeks later as a man who was enough in love with her to murder another man .
While Merrill talked to Bowns the first time at the hospital , her 16 - year - old sister , Tracy , approached Carmody and said she knew the suspect whom her sister had dated .
The Merrill sisters felt LaMar was responsible for the shooting , they told police .
Based on the teens ' statements , Port Huron police had a suspect and they referred to him that way in police reports and to the media from then until trial .
Tracy Merrill had been to LaMar 's house , she told Carmody .
She did n't know the address but she could take the officer there .
As they drove to it , Tracy Merrill told Carmody about her sister and LaMar .
They had dated about six months earlier , and Tracy thought LaMar was a little unusual .
Her parents did not like Crystal going out with him .
Tracy went to find her sister at LaMar 's house one night because she was n't at the family 's farm to milk the cows in the morning .
The teen told Carmody that another of Crystal 's boyfriends , someone named Arnell , " had been beat up by this John LaMar . "
Later records show that Arnell Hope told police he " had never knowingly met this LaMar . "
Hope did not testify at trial .
After finding the house with Tracy , Carmody dropped the teen back at the hospital and called the owner of the property , Karen Shieman .
On the phone , Shieman told Carmody about the tenant she also knew as John LaMar who had rented the house on April 17 .
She knew him as he had described himself when he arranged to rent from her : an engineer who did computer work over the phone and was a minister 's son and law - abiding religious person .
She rented him the house and would come to know Shelly LaMar who came from Flint and moved in with LaMar the next weekend .
Neighbors started telling Shieman her tenant was a little odd by their estimations , she told Carmody .
He practiced karate in the yard .
He used karate - style weapons .
He had two or three cars around , including a small red sports car .
They heard John and Shelly fight and suspected he beat her , Shieman told Carmody .
Around Labor Day , the couple moved out .
While going through " junk " they left behind , Shieman found papers she believed identified LaMar as Frederick Freeman .
She kept them and now she told police about them and other related incidents .
On Nov. 2 , a man had contacted Shieman saying he was the father of the woman she knew as Shelly LaMar .
The young woman was actually Michelle Woodworth , he said , and John LaMar 's real name was Frederick Thomas Freeman and he was wanted in Washington for parole violations .
Carmody included this in his report that afternoon .
Within about 20 minutes of calling Shieman , Carmody found an investigator at the Olympia Police Department in Washington and asked about Freeman .
He was told of Freeman 's bad check charge and suspected assaults and breaking - and - entering incidents on the West Coast .
Carmody found the two felony warrants in Michigan for Freeman .
One was for perjury in Ann Arbor , the other was for aggravated assault in Pleasant Ridge .
A caution was attached :
The subject might use martial arts weapons .
Captured
By the end of the week , Port Huron police had located Freeman in the Upper Peninsula .
According to records obtained recently by Metro Times from the Delta County Sheriff Department , Port Huron police contacted officers there two days after the shooting and told them a suspect in a Port Huron homicide may be in their area .
Records from Escanaba Public Safety show Bowns contacted officers there as well .
A supplementary report from Escanaba police stated Freeman was an " expert in martial arts " and that he and two other people were evicted from an Escanaba house on Oct.
8 .
Surveillance began .
According to court records , police in the Upper Peninsula had Freeman 's landlord identify him from photos , presumably mug shots from his arrests in Washington and Pleasant Ridge .
Posing as deer hunters looking for a place to hunt , state troopers and a sheriff 's deputy visited Freeman 's residence in Rock on Nov. 10 .
Woodworth told them her " husband " would be back later , according to reports .
On Nov. 12 Port Huron police got a warrant for Freeman that notes the complainant was " Sgt. Bowns on info / belief . "
On Nov. 13 , a Delta County judge issued a search warrant for Freeman 's person .
That was the night Freeman called Merrill from the Troy coffee shop after talking to Bowns who was at the house in Rock .
Freeman clearly remembers his last moment of freedom .
He leaned back from the phone to ask a server for another cup of coffee .
He realized other customers and employees had left the shop .
Then , Troy officers , alerted by Port Huron police , approached Freeman .
They were backed by a SWAT team .
" They walked up and said , ' We do n't know what 's going on , ' " Freeman says .
They handcuffed and searched Freeman , saying , " We got a report that you 've got a lot of weaponry . "
Police found nothing .
The police report from the time notes , " Officers were advised to use extreme caution as suspect is a martial arts expert and may be armed with poison darts . "
Merrill had told Port Huron police Freeman was a ninja who carried poison darts in the tongue of his shoes .
Transported to Port Huron the next day , Freeman found himself the only suspect in the murder of a man he insists he did n't know .
As he freely talked to any police officer or attorney he could , he told them how he'd been 450 miles away from the scene of Macklem 's death .
He 'd have people testify to that .
He did n't know the victim .
He 'd dated Merrill earlier that year , but he had n't seen or spoken to her in months since he , not she , ended the relationship .
The day of the murder , he'd been in the Upper Peninsula , trying to get his broken - down car to run , going to a martial arts school and hanging out with friends .
In a taped interview conducted as officers drove him Nov. 14 from Troy to Port Huron , Freeman made the same claims he would for the next 20 years .
" What makes me mad is I know where I was .
I can prove where I was so I know they 've got nothing against me except that Crystal said I did it .
Crystal told them that I 'm some underground guy , " Freeman said .
" I never threatened Scott .
I never said a word about this guy . "
Later that afternoon  the beginning of Freeman 's two decades behind bars  Port Huron Police got a report from the Michigan State Police .
An anonymous caller reported seeing the suspect in the Macklem shooting driving a red Ford Escort on Interstate 94 between Port Huron and Mount Clemens that afternoon .
The caller told police he knew of Freeman and learned he was a suspect from newspaper reports .
It could n't have been Freeman , he was in custody .
A man who closely resembled Freeman was out there , driving a red Ford Escort , which was one of the car models described leaving the scene of the shooting .
Nearly 20 years later , another source would claim to give Freeman 's team of investigators the name of Macklem 's killer .
The red Ford Escort described in the November 1986 police report would link to him .

In Part 2 of this story , Frederick Freeman 's long shot for freedom and the unlikely team of advocates trying to see justice in this case .

I was reading a post on Lifehacker about how if you are in the tech field , or are just the " computer geek " of the family that you will most likely be sucked into fixing your family members computer .
It happens to me not just at Thanksgiving , but pretty much any time I go to one of my relatives ' houses .
Honestly , it does n't really bother me too badly .
I actually love this stuff .
When I come across a computer infected with some nasty viruses I sort of feel like Keanu Reeves in the movie Constantine .
With that in mind , here is my list of essential cleanup and optimization tools you can use to fix the in - laws computers this Thanksgiving .
Spybot Search & Destroy - I have written about this one before .
It is great , and the latest version has many added security features to help " immunize " your in - laws computers and keep them safe .
Avast !
Antivirus -
My all time personal favorite .
If there is a virus , this sucker will catch it and eliminate it .
Comodo Internet Security - I have been using this for quite a while now , and I love it .
It just works .
Simple as that .
Firefox - Lets face it , Internet Exploder just is n't that secure .
Firefox is simply a better internet browser for security .
CCleaner - CCleaner is sort of like the built in Windows disk clean up utility ... On steroids .
Besides cleaning up the junk on your computer , it also has a really great registry cleaner too among other things .
Spyware Blaster -
This one is good because it pro actively works to keep spyware from being installed in the first place .
JKDefrag - I particularly like this one , because it comes with a screen saver feature which is great because your in laws never have to think about defragging .
Whenever they step away from the computer and the screen saver comes on the defrag process will begin .
Here are some alternatives to some of the above , if you do n't like those ones :
AVG Free Antivirus -
Often rated as the number one free antivirus available
Zone Alarm Firewall - Another good free firewall solution with proven protection .
Windows Defender - Some have mixed feeling on this one , but for the most part it is pretty good .
I do like that it has automatic update features , so you can set it and forget it .
Once your in - laws computers are cleaned up , defragged , and virus free , do n't forget to install all of the latest patches and service packs , and turn on their automatic updates .
If everything goes well , their computers should stay running smoothly .
That is until the next time you visit .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Jazz legend John Coltrane routinely pushed his tenor saxophone into the altissimo range , notes far above the instrument ’s normal range , and now Australian scientists know how he did it .
A man plays the saxophone in New York 's Central Park October 12 , 2007 .
Physicists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney said professional saxophone players can tune their vocal tract -- the tube formed by the lips , mouth , tongue , throat and vocal folds or cords -- to produce extremely high notes .

Physicists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney said professional saxophone players can tune their vocal tract -- the tube formed by the lips , mouth , tongue , throat and vocal folds or cords -- to produce those extremely high notes .
Their research may solve a long - standing debate among scientists and musicians about how much of the player ’s own vocal instrument contributes to the sound , said Joe Wolfe , a physics professor who supervised the research .
As in speech , changes in the shape of the mouth and tongue and vibrations in the air in the vocal tract can be enhanced or inhibited at different frequency .
But scientists and musicians have differed about how this was applied to reed instruments like the saxophone .
“ No one really knew : it is difficult for players to be quantitative or even explicit about what they do with their vocal tracts , and it is difficult to make precise measurements inside the vocal tract during playing , ” Wolfe said in an e-mail .
To study this , Wolfe and colleagues attached a thin probe to the mouthpiece of a tenor saxophone that measured acoustics inside the vocal tract while the saxophone was being played by both professionals and amateurs .
Professional players tuned the resonance in their vocal tracts slightly higher when they played these ultra- high notes , they report in Friday ’s issue of the journal Science .
Adjusting the muscles and shape of their vocal tracts allowed them to play notes higher than those they were actually fingering on the instrument .
Amateur saxophonists did not make those adjustments and were unable to play above the instrument ’s normal range .
“ You have to hear the sound in your head before you can produce it , ” said Linda Van Dyke of Oak Park , Illinois , who has taught saxophone and clarinet for the past 25 years .
“ I ask my kids to sing through their horns a lot . ”
Hitting those high notes is not something she attempts to teach .
“ Those students who have done it have experimented on their own and figured other ways to get there , ” she said .
Wolfe said it usually takes saxophone players years to learn how to modify the vocal tract appropriately .
“ We can not say whether anyone can learn it .
However , nearly everyone learns , at an early age , how to produce , reliably , the dozens of different vocal tract configurations required to speak one or more languages , ” he said .
Some 93 % of those polled called themselves " moderate " Muslims
The poll by Gallup of more than 50,000 Muslims in 35 nations found most wanted the West to instead focus on changing its negative view of Muslims and Islam .
The huge survey began following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US .
The overwhelming majority of those asked condemned them and subsequent attacks , citing religious reasons .
The poll , which claims to represent the views of 90 % the world 's 1.3 billion Muslims , is to be published next month as part of a book entitled Who Speaks For Islam ?
What A Billion Muslims Really Think .
New policies
According to the book , the survey of the world 's Muslim community was commissioned by Gallup 's chairman , Jim Clifton , shortly after US President George W Bush asked in a 2001 speech : " Why do they hate us ? "
The radicals are better educated , have better jobs , and are more hopeful with regard to the future than mainstream Muslims - but they 're more cynical about whether they 'll ever get it
John Esposito
Author , Who Speaks For Islam ?
Mr Bush wondered why radical Islamist militant groups such as al - Qaeda hated democratically elected governments , as well as " our freedom of religion , our freedom of speech , our freedom to vote and assembly and disagree with each other " .
But one of the book 's authors , John Esposito , says the survey 's results suggest Muslims - ironically even many of the 7 % classing themselves as " radical " - in fact admire the West for its democracy and freedoms .
However , they do not want such things imposed on them .
" Muslims want self - determination , but not an American - imposed and defined democracy .
They do n't want secularism or theocracy , " said the professor of Islamic Studies at Georgetown University in Washington .
" What the majority wants is democracy with religious values . "
The poll sought to answer a question asked by George Bush
Bush address to Congress
Mr Esposito said " radical " Muslims believed in democracy even more than many of the moderate Muslims questioned .
" The radicals are better educated , have better jobs , and are more hopeful with regard to the future than mainstream Muslims , " he added .
" But they 're more cynical about whether they 'll ever get it . "
The research also indicates most Muslims want guarantees of freedom of speech and would not want religious leaders to have a role in drafting constitutions .
Those polled also said the most important thing the West could do to improve relations with Muslim societies was to change its negative views towards Muslims and respect Islam .
The authors said the conflict between Islam and the West was not inevitable , but needed decision makers to listen and consider new policies if the extremists on both sides were not to gain ground .
AS the race for the Democratic presidential nomination nears its end and attention turns to the role of so - called superdelegates in choosing the nominee , it is instructive to look at why my party created this class of delegates .
After the 1980 presidential election , the Democratic Party was in disarray .
That year , Senator Ted Kennedy had challenged President Jimmy Carter for the presidential nomination , and Mr. Kennedy took the fight to the convention floor by proposing 23 amendments to the party platform .
When it was all over , members of Congress who were concerned about their re-election walked away from the president and from the party .
The rest of the campaign was plagued by infighting .
In 1982 , we tried to remedy some of the party ’s internal problems by creating the Hunt Commission , which reformed the way the party selects its presidential nominees .
Because I was then the vice chairwoman of the House Democratic Caucus , Tip O’Neill , the speaker of the House , appointed me as his representative to the commission .
The commission considered several reforms , but one of the most significant was the creation of superdelegates , the reform in which I was most involved .
Democrats had to figure out a way to unify our party .
What better way , we reasoned , than to get elected officials involved in writing the platform , sitting on the credentials committee and helping to write the rules that the party would play by ?
みなさんは、 「ニセ脆弱性」という言葉を耳にしたことがあるでしょうか。
これは、見かけは脆弱性のようだけれども、実は、脆弱性とはとても言えないもののことで、「疑似エクスプロイト」や「似非ゼロデイ」などとも呼ばれます。
「 そんなものがどこにあるんだ」とお思いの方も、例として、「サニタイジング」や、「hiddenは危険」や、「非接触スキミング」などの名前を挙げれば、「ああ、そういうもののことか」と納得されるかもしれません。それとも、かえって、「え？」と驚かれるでしょうか。
例えば、皆さんもよくご存知のように、「サニタイジングは脆弱性対策にいい」と盛んに言われ、ひところは大手コーディネーション機関もこぞって解説を出すほどのブームになりました。サニタイジングがよく語られたのは、もちろん、サニタイジングの対策効果に裏づけがあると信じた人が多かったからでしょう。CERT/CCやIPAなどでも頻繁に取り上げられましたから、それを疑えという方が無理な話かもしれません。
今は、共通鍵暗号を使った製品に、人気が出てきているようです。しかし、実のところ、共通鍵暗号を忌避したところで、せいぜいお守り程度の効果しか期待できません。
今、このような、脆弱性のようで脆弱性ではない、「ニセ脆弱性」が蔓延しています。
たとえば、オレオレ証明書がブームになったのは、「共通鍵暗号は危険で、公開鍵暗号は安全」という説明を、多くの人が知識として受け入れたからです。
しかし、仮に科学者に、 「共通鍵暗号は危険なのですか」とたずねてみても、そのような単純な二分法では答えてくれないはずです。
「 共通鍵暗号といっても使い方がいろいろあるので中には安全なものも危険なものもあるでしょうし危険といっても運用で回避できるものもあるでしょうし、ぶつぶつぶつぶつ……」と、まあ、歯切れの悪い答えしか返ってこないでしょう。
それが科学的な誠実さだからしょうがないのです。ところが「ニセ脆弱性」は断言してくれます。「公開鍵は良いといったら良いし、共通鍵は悪いといったら悪い」のです。また、hiddenを使うとなぜ良くないのかといえば、「価格が壊れるから」です。
そうではなく、脆弱性報告は、合理的な立証のプロセス、それを大事にするべきなのです。
なんちゃって 。

Martin Fowler is writing a book about Domain Specific Languages and , because you could never accuse Martin of a lack of ambition , he ’s trying to write it in a reasonably ( implementation ) language agnostic fashion .
It ’s fairly easy to write an implementation language agnostic book about old school DSLs , what used to be called little languages - there ’s a fairly well established literature and theory to do with lexing , parsing and interpreting .
These are all about algorithms , and algorithms are implementation language neutral by their very nature .
Where Martin has his work cut out for him is trying to talk about what he calls ‘ internal DSLs ’ and what I ’ve been calling ‘ pidgins ’ .
These are the sorts of languages where you do n’t write a lexer or parser but instead build a family of objects , methods , functions or whatever other bits and pieces your host language provides in order to create a part of your program that , while it is directly interpreted by the host language , feels like it ’s written in some new dialect .
The Lisp family of languages can be said to be all about this .
A good ‘ bottom up ’ lisp programmer will shape a language to fit the problem space , essentially building a new lisp which makes it easy to solve the problem at hand .
Lisp ’s minimal syntax , powerful macros and the way it blurs the boundary between code and data really support this style .
Once you move from Lisp to more ‘ syntaxy ’ languages , things get hairier .
As Martin himself says
Another issue with book code is to beware of using obscure features of the language , where obscure means for my general reader rather than even someone fluent in the language I ’m using . [ … ] this is much harder for a DSL book .
Internal DSLs tend to rely on abusing the native syntax in order to get readability .
Much of this abuse involves quirky corners of the language .
Again I have to balance showing readable DSL code against wallowing in quirk .
He ’s dead right .
When I ’m thinking about writing a pidgin in Ruby for instance , my first thought is usually to start with some kind of tabula rasa object which I can use to instance_eval a block .
That lets me start to shape my language by lexically scoping the change :
in_pidgin do ... end
But , though it ’s easy to illustrate what I ’d do with my tabula rasa , the implementation is somewhat tricky , and the tricks needed are unique to Ruby .
That sort of construct ’s not really available to someone trying to write a pidgin in Java or Perl .
In Perl , there are other odd corners of the language that can be abused to good effect .
Dynamic scoping can let you ‘ inject ’ methods into a block even though there ’s no Perl equivalent to instance_eval , or you can do some quite staggering things with the otherwise really annoying Perl function prototypes .
For instance , here ’s part of a Jifty definition of a persistent object :
column title => type is ' text ' , label is ' Title ' , default is ' Untitled post ' ; column body => type is ' text ' , label is ' Content ' , render_as ' Textarea ' ;
Does n’t look much like Perl does it ?
But it ’s parsed and executed by perl with no source filters or eval STRING in sight .
And there ’s no unsightly : symbols scattered about the place either come to that .
These things all work by making the language do something unexpected , and generally , the way to do that is by knowing your host language inside out and playing with it .
One of Damian Conway ’s more inspired moments in recent years was List :: Maker , in which the good doctor managed to find a corner of Perl where he could wedge a proper old school , complete with full on parser to build the AST , Little Language right in the heart of Perl without it looking like he was taking a plain old string and interpreting it .
So , having found this odd little corner , he proceeded to implement a remarkably neat tool for building complex lists that are beyond the capabilities of Perl ’s .. operator .
@odds = < 1..100 : N % 2 != 0 > ; @primes = < 3,5..99 > : is_prime( N ) > ; @available = < 1..$max : ! allocated {N} >
You may not think that ’s all that sexy , but , and trust me on this , it ’s just gorgeous .
Yet more proof that Damian Conway is an ( evil ) genius .
Frankly , once you ’ve seen the best of the pidgins available in Perl , some of highly praised ‘ DSLs ’ in Ruby start to look a bit ordinary .
Ruby makes a great deal of stuff that a pidgin breeder needs to do really easy .
In Perl it ’s often rather hard with a huge amount of hoopage to deal with .
But some of the things that are hard in Perl are impossible in Ruby .
Anyhoo… coming back to my point .
I do find myself wondering if Martin ’s bitten off more than he can chew in attempting to write a book that covers implementing pidgins without getting bogged down in the nitty gritty of individual languages .
The problem he ’s facing is that different languages do n’t just have different quirks , they have different idioms too .
What reads naturally in the context of a Ruby program will read very weirdly in , say Java or a lisp .
Any patterns of implementation beyond broad ( but important ) strokes like “ Play to your host language ’s strengths ” will surely end up as language specific patterns .
Designing and implementing a good pidgin is hard .
Doing it effectively means getting down and dirty with your host language and its runtime structures .
And that ’s not the sort of thing you can cover effectively in a language agnostic book .
Martin , if you ’re reading this , good luck .
I think you ’re going to need it .
I look forward to being proved wrong .
BACK in the 1970s , Germans , Frenchmen , and Italians worked slightly more hours on average than Americans .
These days , Americans work about 30 % more hours than their European counterparts .
Is Europe degenerating into a huge retirement village ?
Are Americans deranged by the rat-race ?
What gives ?
It 's simple , really .
Work is worth more in the United States , so people there work more .
According to the economists Claudio Michelacci and Josep Pijoan - Mas of Spain 's Centre for Monetary and Financial Studies , the difference between work - happy Americans and lolling Europeans is n't a cultural gap about the value of leisure and work / life balance .
It 's incentives :
Getting promoted in the current job , and obtaining better jobs requires hard work , and workers are ready to do it only if the endeavour is worth it .
When this return falls , hours worked fall .
This is the case of Europe over the last three decades .
While the pursuit of the American dream makes Americans work hard , the sluggish economic performance of Europe discourages European workers from working longer hours .
So rather than blaming Europeans for devoting too much time to leisure activities , it may be worth liberalising European markets further .
As they emphasise , European workers are n't less productive ; it 's just that a smaller proportion of Europeans work , and they work fewer hours .
And this has a big effect on national output :
GDP per capita is today 30 % higher in the US than in France or Germany , while productivity , measured by GDP per hour worked , is roughly equal .
This means that Americans are today richer than Europeans not because they are more productive but simply because they work more .
A good bit of this gap in labour participation and therefore output is attributable to relatively high European tax rates .
As 2004 economics Nobel Prize - winner Edward Prescott noted in this 2005 Wall Street Journal op -ed :
So , why did the European labor supply decrease by a third from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s ?
Because the marginal effective tax rate was increased to 60 % from 40 % .
People chose to work less than before .
Consequently , tax revenues fell .
You ca n’t raise revenues by taxing people beyond their willingness to pay .
And you ca n’t expect an economy to grow when people do n’t have the incentive to work , or when entrepreneurs lack the incentive to take a chance .
Remember that the next time someone tries to tell you supply - side effects of taxation are " crackpot " .

Russia ’s envoy to NATO charged Friday that Kosovo ’s independence fight was funded by local drug - lords as Moscow steps up last - ditch rhetoric aimed at warning the international community against recognising the independence of the former Serb province .
“ Drug money is being used at present for development of a political strand on Kosovo ’s independence , ” said Russia ’s newly appointed NATO ambassador Dmitry Rogozin on Friday .
The former firebrand nationalist lawmaker called recognition of Kosovo a “ strategic mistake ” and said the move would further complicate Russia ’s relations with NATO .
Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to be present at the next NATO summit in Romania in April , where the so - called “ Kosovo Precedent ” has taken centre stage over Russia ’s opposition to a planned US missile - defence base in Eastern Europe and NATO ’s eastward expansion .
Russia maintains that the Kosovo Precedent will lead to an eruption of separatist movements around the world , but analysts said Friday that Moscow also regrets its loss of influence in Serbia , with which it has long had close ties .
Rogozin said Thursday that Moscow was concerned over NATO overstepping its UN mandate in Kosovo and over reports that Kosovo had sealed its border with Serbia .
“ Moscow is worried by the possibility of the appearance of alien military bases in the province , ” Rogozin said via video link with Brussels .
NATO ’s peacekeeping mission of over 16,000 troops holds responsibility for patrolling the border in Kosovo .
“ If the European Union works out a single position and NATO goes beyond its current mandate in Kosovo , there will be a conflict between these organizations and the United Nations , ” Russia ’s NATO ambassador said .
Rogozin underlined that NATO must retain its “ neutrality ” and not get involved in “ international politics . ”
He complained that NATO and the European Union were breaking international law and ignoring Russia ’s concerns about the move toward recognizing Kosovo .
“ We , I think , will need to assume that in order to be respected we have to resort to brute military force , ” Rogozin said Thursday , despite assurances that Russia would not initiate a confrontation with NATO .

7 Habits of Highly Innovative People
Have you ever looked at super creative or innovative people , and felt they are special beings blessed with gifts ?
Have you felt that you are not as fortunate ?
I used to feel this way .
I have since learned that creativity is more about psychology than intellect , and there are no secrets to being creative .
Actually , there is no such thing as “ being more creative ” , you are already a creative being .
I ’m sure we can all relate to moments when we felt stuck trying to tap into our own creativity .
Did you know that this block is merely your mind at work ?
Your mind is creating all sorts of assumptions , self - imposed constraints and self - limiting inhibitions .
I have found that we can remove these assumptions just by being in the moment ; start doing , and stop thinking .
Here are seven habits found in highly innovative and creative people that I ’ve organized and summarized from Scott Berkun ‘s “ the myths of innovation “ .
1. Persistence – Innovation involves more than just great ideas .
We need faith , hard work and a laser sharp focus for the end result to keep persisting for our vision in the face of roadblocks .
We tend to see the end result of a creative idea in awe , but what we do n’t see are the actions , hard work and persistence behind the scene to make the vision a reality .
“ Invention is 1 % inspiration , 99 % perspiration “ ,
– Thomas A. Edison
2. Remove Self - Limiting Inhibitions – Under the spell of inhibition , we feel limited and stuck .
We need to free ourselves from these mind - created constraints by removing assumptions and restrictions .
This is what we refer to when we say “ think outside the box ” .
Encourage ourselves to be open to new ideas and solutions without setting limiting beliefs .
Remember , innovation is more about psychology than intellect .
3. Take Risks , Make Mistakes – I believe that part of the reason why we create self - imposed inhibition is due to our fear of failure .
Expect that some ideas will fail in the process of learning .
Build prototypes often , test them out on people , gather feedback , and make incremental changes .
Rather than treating the mistakes as failures , think of them as experiments .
“ Experiment is the expected failure to deliberately learn something . ” ( Scott Berkun ) .
Instead of punishing yourself for the failures , accept them , then take your newfound knowledge and put it towards finding the best solution .
Live up to your goal of producing the best result , but understand you might hit roadblocks along the way .
“ I have not failed .
I ’ve just found 10,000 ways that wo n’t work . “
– Thomas A. Edison
4. Escape – Our environment can and does effect how we feel .
The more relaxed and calm we are internally , the more receptive we are to tap into our flowing creativity .
This is why ideas sometimes come to us in the shower or while we ’re alone .
Each of us have different triggers to access our creative energy .
I get into the ‘ creative zone ’ from sitting at my dining table , with a warm cup of chai , and my noise - canceling headphones .
Many great thinkers go on long walks to help them solve problems .
Experiment and find what works for you .
5. Writing Things Down – Many innovators and creative people keep a journal to jot down ideas and thoughts .
Some keep a sketch book , scrap book , post - it notes , loose paper .
They all have a method to capture their thoughts , to think on paper , to drop their inhibitions and start the creative process .
Leonardo Da Vinci ’s famous notebook was purchased by Bill Gates for $ 30.8 Million dollars .
6. Find Patterns & Create Combinations – Ideas come from other ideas .
Did you know that Edison was n’t the first one who came up with the invention of the light bulb ?
He was the first to build a workable carbon filament inside a glass bulb , that made light bulbs last longer .
You can increase your exposure to new ideas , look for patterns and see how you can combine ideas to improve upon existing solutions .
7. Curiosity – Many innovators are just curious people who are inquisitive , and like to solve problems .
Practice seeing things differently .
For example ,
When seeing the solution to a problem , ask yourself , “ What are some alternative ways to doing this ? ” .
Ask a lot of questions and challenge the norms or existing methods .
Here are some techniques you can apply to cultivate creativity :
Keep a Journal – Practice writing every thought , idea , and inspiration down .
Practice , brainstorming and thinking on paper .
– Practice writing every thought , idea , and inspiration down .
Practice , brainstorming and thinking on paper .
Solve the Opposite Problem – Scott talked about this technique .
The idea is to invent and brainstorm by solving the opposite problem that you are trying to solve .
So , for example , if you are trying to create “ The best laptop design ” , then start with ideas to create “ The worst laptop design ” .
For each idea you come up with , flip it .
For example , if “ heavy and clunky ” is one idea for “ The worst laptop design ” , then flipping that might give me “ light and sleek ” which can be used in “ The best laptop design ” .
This technique works especially well when brainstorming in a group .
The technique sounds so silly that people will become playful when answering .
Humor brings down inhibition and encourages people to say things out aloud .
People feel less insecure and more open .

Find A Creative Environment – Find a relaxing or inspiring environment that triggers your creativity .
Try different spots until you find some that really bring out the best in you .
I alternate between my living room ( which I have carefully decorated ) and a couple of local coffee shops .

Do something fun –
If you ’re stuck on something , shift your thoughts by going to do something fun and completely different .
Come back to it with a fresh mind .

Partnering – Find creative partnerships with another .
New ideas can surface as a result of two forces that would not have been arrived by a single person .
Brainstorm together .

‘ Commit to Failure ’ – “ Commit yourself to taking enough risks that you will fail some of the time .
If you ’re not failing , we ’re not doing something sufficiently difficult or creative . ”
- Scott Berkun
– “ Commit yourself to taking enough risks that you will fail some of the time .
If you ’re not failing , we ’re not doing something sufficiently difficult or creative . ”
- Scott Berkun Talk to Someone About
It – I have found that when I try to articulate a particular problem to someone , that I ’ll somehow articulate my solution , as well .
When explaining my situation , I ’m not expecting them to solve my problem , but rather act as a ‘ bouncing board ’ for ideas .

** Plan for Roadblocks - Commit to efforts to overcome potential setbacks .
It ’s worthwhile to identify and have a plan for non-creative items that may inhibit creative thinking .
Scott talked about the most common roadblocks people face : Loss of motivation , ran out of money , unable to convince key person .
What do you think are some common trait of innovative people ?

Those dust - caked frontier towns depicted in Western movies are no exaggeration :
The West has become a much dustier place over the past few hundred years .
Westward U.S expansion and changes in humans ' land use have made the West five times dustier in the past two centuries than it had been in the past 5,000 years , a new study of lakebed sediments finds .
" There seems to be a perception that dusty conditions in the West are just the nature of the region , " said lead researcher Jason Neff of the University of Colorado at Boulder .
" We have shown here that the increase in dust since the 1800s is a direct result of human activity and not part of the natural system . "
Dust deposits Researchers analyzed sediment records from dust blown into alpine lakes in southwest Colorado 's San Juan Mountains over several thousand years .
They found a sharp rise in dust deposits coinciding with the boom in railroad , ranching and livestock activity that began in the middle of the 19th century .
" From about 1860 to 1900 , the dust deposition rates shot up so high that we initially thought there was a mistake in our data , " Neff said .
" But the evidence clearly shows the western U.S. had its own Dust Bowl beginning in the 1800s when the railroads went in and cattle and sheep were introduced into the rangelands . "
While droughts can trigger erosion of soils and increased dust deposition in lakes , western U.S. droughts in the past two centuries have been mild compared to those over the past 2,000 years , Neff said , likely ruling droughts out as the cause of the rise in dust .
Radiocarbon dating of soil cores taken from the lake beds indicates that the dust pile - up began around the time of more intensive land use , primarily grazing .
" There were an estimated 40 million head of livestock on the western rangeland during the turn of the century , causing a massive and systematic degradation of the ecosystems , " Neff said .
Dust levels started to fall again around the passage of the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act that imposed restrictions on western grazing lands .
The results of the study , funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation , are detailed in the Feb. 24 issue of the journal Nature Geoscience .
Detrimental effects
The dust includes nutrients such as nitrogen , phosphorus and calcium — by - products of ranching , mining and agricultural activity — that can change the balance of plant growth in an ecosystem .
High dust levels can also cause respiratory problems in humans , Neff noted .
A 2007 study published in the journal Geophysical Researcher Letters , which Neff co-authored , linked wind - blown dust from disturbed lands to earlier snowmelt in the San Juans .
" The dust we see in these lakes is the same dust that causes earlier spring snowmelt here , so we can now definitively say that humans are in large part responsible for this melt , " said Neff .
With oil prices at record highs and gas heading to the $ 4 - a - gallon level , I was set to come roaring out of the gate today with a proposal that all vehicles be slapped with a conservation - promoting surcharge based on mileage , with proceeds going to public - transit projects .
As I visited several Westside gas stations this week , I felt confident this idea would help drivers eat their petro peas and carrots .
Some are already doing it .
L.A. resident Morton Miller , 81 , recently traded in a gas - slurping Jaguar convertible for a 2008 Toyota Prius that gets an estimated 48 miles per gallon in the city .
“ I want to be a green person , ” he told me as he filled his tank .
“ I saw the handwriting on the wall with gas prices . ”
But then I met Ontario resident Ignacio Villegas , 47 , a construction worker who spends about $ 90 every time he fills up his 2005 Chevy Avalanche , a heavy - duty truck that gets about 14 mpg in city driving .
Villegas showed me all the tools in his truck ’s bed .
Advertisement
“ What can I do ? ” he asked .
“ I ca n’t drive a little Toyota .
I need this for work .
It ’s not a luxury .
This is the only way . ”
Thud .
So much for my surcharge scheme .
Until I could address the legitimate needs of all the Ignacio Villegases out there , I had no business punishing them for simply trying to earn a living .
But clearly we need to do something .
Oil was trading Tuesday above $ 108 a barrel after earlier topping $ 109 .
At the pump , the national average for a gallon of regular gas hit a record $ 3.227 .
The average in California was $ 3.581 a gallon .
Advertisement
The United States imports about two - thirds of its oil , so we ca n’t do much about the supply side of the equation .
What we can control is demand , and we can do that via greater fuel efficiency , conservation and increased transit alternatives .
Here are a few suggestions , first at the national level and then for beleaguered Southern California , where decades of failure on the part of elected officials in giving people alternatives to their cars have left consumers especially vulnerable to soaring gas prices .
Mileage standards :
The most effective thing we can do as a nation to wean ourselves from our oil jones would be to significantly boost the minimum required mileage for new vehicles .
As of 2004 , new cars were required to get an average of 27.5 mpg and light trucks such as sport utility vehicles 20.7 mpg .
Late last year , Congress enacted the first major overhaul of so - called corporate average fuel economy , or
Advertisement
CAFE , standards in more than 30 years .
Automakers will now be required to raise average mileage for both cars and light trucks to 35 mpg by 2020 .
That ’s good , but not nearly good enough .
I say the nation ’s minimum mileage average should be no less than 50 mpg by 2020 .
Sure , automakers will whine that this is an unreasonable goal or that it would make their products too expensive for most consumers , but that ’s bull .
The Union of Concerned Scientists says existing technology , such as advanced metals and transmissions , could raise vehicle mileage to an average of 40 mpg without significantly affecting prices .
More important , why are we undervaluing good old - fashioned American ingenuity ?
If an ambitious CAFE standard of 50 mpg was our mandated goal , why would it be unreasonable to expect some of our most resourceful companies to meet it ?
Advertisement
If American automakers can’t do it , they have no business in this business .
I have no doubt the Japanese and South Koreans are ready and able to meet this challenge .
Congestion tax : Drivers obviously face different conditions on L.A. freeways from , say , conditions in rural Montana .
So a nationwide increase in gas taxes would be unfair .
I propose an urban congestion tax of at least $ 1.50 a gallon for all major metropolitan areas .
This would make gas more expensive and thus compel more people to seek alternative ways of getting around .
Advertisement
It would also raise much - needed revenue for public transportation .
Most proceeds from the congestion tax would be applied to local transit projects , such as L.A. 's long - long - awaited Subway to the Sea .
Because any such tax would be regressive in nature , hitting lower - income people disproportionately harder , a portion of the revenue should be applied to providing tax credits to people who fall below a certain income threshold -- say , $ 50,000 a year .
Lower speed limits : Fifty - five saves fuel and lives .
It was true then and it ’s true now .
Do n’t like it ?
Tough .
Oil subsidies : Nobody knows exactly how much the oil industry receives in government - funded tax breaks and other handouts .
Greenpeace estimates the total at $ 15 billion to $ 35 billion a year .
Whatever the amount , the companies do n’t need it .
Advertisement
Last year , Exxon Mobil pocketed $ 40.6 billion in profit , the most by any company ever .
Put another way , the oil giant earned nearly $ 1,300 every second throughout 2007 .
For its part , No. 2 Chevron ’s profit last year hit $ 18.7 billion .
Factor in results from Shell and ConocoPhillips , and the industry ’s four leading players collectively took in more than $ 100 billion .
Yes , yes , the industry will complain that oil is harder and more expensive to find nowadays , and that ’s true .
And it will point to its relatively modest profit margin of about 7.6 % of revenue , although that ’s a red herring ; the real number is the oil industry ’s very impressive 27 % return on equity , a more reliable measure of a capital - intensive company ’s performance .
Bottom line :
They can afford an end to government gimmes .
And is n’t that better than a windfall - profit tax ?
Advertisement
Telecommuting :
To get people off the roads in L.A. and elsewhere and thus ease the pain of runaway gas prices , businesses should be given tax breaks for encouraging and enabling employees to work from home .
In L.A. specifically , tax breaks also should be offered to businesses that create branch offices closer to workers ’ homes , thus easing commutes and gas costs .
A downtown company ( like , for instance , this newspaper ) does n’t need everyone under one roof .
People who live on the Westside should work , at least part of the time , out of a Westside office .
People in the Valley should work out of the Valley .
People in Orange County . . . you get the idea .
The technology ’s already in place .
It ’s crazy not to use it .
Advertisement
Public transportation : L.A. is choking to death in cars and our political leaders seem incapable of doing anything about it .
The city ’s limited metro system is slow and inconvenient , and the best we ’re otherwise offered are half - baked ideas like making Pico and Olympic boulevards one - way thoroughfares .
How ’s this : Close Olympic to all traffic weekdays from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7 p.m .
The road would be exclusively dedicated during these hours to express , rapid and local bus lines .
If a Subway to the Sea ca n’t get built , we can at least have a Busway to the Beach .
Windfall - profit tax :
What the hell , why not ?
A measly 1 % levy would have produced an extra $ 1 billion last year for public transportation and research into alternative fuel sources .
The oil majors can just figure out a way to scrape by on $ 99 billion in annual profit .

Facing a ten - day suspension of their business licenses after a first offense , and a permanent revocation of licenses after a second transgression , companies are laying workers off , reassessing their ability to do business and even moving out of state .
Reports Agence France - Presse : Unable to find jobs , or fearful that their loved ones will be caught and deported , illegal immigrants and their legal friends and relatives are fleeing the state in what the press has dubbed " Hispanic panic . "
In a state where illegals make up better than 10 % of the workforce , the exodus promises to have a major impact .
The vacancy rate in Tucson - area apartment complexes favored by illegal immigrants has jumped dramatically since the law went into effect .
According to the Of course , advocates of the sanctions law will say that this is exactly the result they were hoping for ; they Hispanics to flee the state ( usually , they 'll claim that they just want theones to leave ) .
But with workers leaving Arizona , taking their rent money , mortgage payments and shopping dollars with them , and with state employers facing rising labor costs -- if they can even find workers -- the economy is likely to take a major hit .
In fact , the University of Arizona predicts a $ 29 billion economic loss if illegal workers are successfully purged from the state ( full report here in PDF ) .
Of course , the law wo n't be universally successful .
Faced with a damned - if - you - do , damned - if - you - do n't choice , many businesses will just take their chances with illegal workers , and many will slip under the radar .
At least one immigration expert -- Marc Rosenblum of the University of New Orleans -- predicts major growth in the underground economy , with more workers than ever before getting paid off the books .
Black markets have dulled the economic effects of stupid policies in the past , and will likely do so this time around too .
But off - the - books workers will have less security and less money than they would if allowed to function in the official economy , and they 'll contribute less than they would otherwise .
That 's especially true since workers have the option of going where they 're welcome -- already there are reports that Mexicans intent on seeking work in the U.S. are bypassing the increasingly unfriendly border states .
Why take an uncertain cash job in unwelcoming Arizona when you can get a job with benefits in Oregon or Virginia ?
The real losers will be the people of Arizona -- the nativists tightening the screws , the workers and employers getting the shaft and the disinterested rest who find making a living increasingly treated as a privilege to be withdrawn at the whim of government officials .

Keith Olbermann discusses with GW University Law Professor Jonathan Turley about the recently announced Department of Justice investigation on the disappeared CIA torture tapes and how through conflicts and a lack of independence , the chance of justice actually being served has been hampered once again by the Bush Administration .
Many people in Congress and in the White House and at Justice Department are framing this as an obstruction investigation , as if what ’s on those tapes is an episode of “ Barney ” .
What ’s on those tapes is the original crime in the scandal and that ’s the crime of torturing people .
It is still — even after the last seven years — a crime to torture suspects . [..]
And so what most of us wanted was someone independent to come in , somebody who was not within this line of …this chain of command to investigate these things independently , but nobody seriously wants that .
And I ’m not talking about just Republicans .
This investigation now involves a range of crimes and a number of people that make it more serious than what originally triggered Watergate .
And I ca n’t imagine a case for a better call for a Special Counsel .
The following is reprinted from Uncle John 's Ahh - Inspiring Bathroom Reader Lots of companies have ad campaigns that flop , but Pepsi seems to have more than its share .
Here are a few classic bombs .
Keep On Truckin' For its " Pepsi 400 " contest in the summer of 2001 , Pepsi offered to send the holders of five winning tickets on an all - expenses - paid trip to Florida 's Daytona 400 auto race .
One of the five would get to drive home in the grand prize , a brand - new Dodge truck ; the other four would each get $ 375 worth of free gas .
There was just one problem : contest organizers accidentally printed 55 winning tickets instead of five .
Rather than risk alienating the winners - not to mention millions of Pepsi drinkers - Pepsi sent all 55 winners to Daytona , gave away five trucks instead of one , and spent $ 20,625 on free gas instead of $ 1,825 .
Estimated cost of error : about $ 400,000 .

In April 1996 , Pepsi canceled its " Pepsi Stuff " merchandise giveaway campaign months ahead of schedule .
Reason :
Too many winners .
The company underestimated how many people would redeem the points by 50 % , forcing it to spend $ 60 million more than expected on free merchandise .
" We 're outpacing our goals on awareness , " a company spokesperson explained .
Jet Lag Another disaster from the " Pepsi Stuff " campaign : 21 - year - old John Leonard tried to redeem seven million award points for the Harrier fighter jet he saw offered in a Pepsi Stuff TV ad .
The rules stipulated that contestants could buy points for 10 ¢ apiece , so that 's what he did .
Leonard ( who studied flawed promotions in business school ) raised $ 700,000 to buy the required points and then sent the money to Pepsi , along with a letter demanding they hand over the $ 50 million jet .
When Pepsi refused , claiming the offer was made " in jest , " Leonard filed suit in federal court .
Three years later , a judge ruled that " no objective person could reasonably have concluded that the commercial actually offered consumers a Harrier jet . "
Pepsi lucked out ... case dismissed .
The King of ( Soda ) Pop YouTube Clip of a Pepsi Ad featuring Michael Jackson from the 1980s Even Pepsi 's biggest successes can become colossal flops .
In 1983 they signed the largest individual sponsorship deal in history with pop singer Michael Jackson .
It was a multi - year deal and Pepsi made millions from it ... only to find itself linked to one of the most lurid scandals of the 1990s when Jackson abruptly cancelled his Pepsi- sponsored " Dangerous " tour in 1993 .
Jackson 's reasons for quitting : ( 1 ) stress generated by allegations that he had sexually molested a young boy , and ( 2 ) addiction to painkillers he took " to control pain from burns suffered while filming a Pepsi ad . "
The Name Game
In 1983 another Pepsi contest ran into budget trouble when the company offered $ 5 per letter to any customer who could spell their own last name using letters printed on Pepsi bottle caps and flip tops .
Pepsi hoped to control the number of cash prizes by releasing only a limited number of vowels ... but it failed to take into account people like Richard " no vowels " Vlk , who turned in 1,393 three - letter sets and pocketed $ 20,894 for his effort .
Vlk , a diabetic who does not drink Pepsi , collected the letters by taking out classified ads offering to split the winnings with anyone who sent him a matching set .
" I do n't even remember making one whole set myself , " he says .
" I did n't buy any Pepsi . "
( The company got even by mailing him his winnings in $ 15 increments , one check for each winning set . )
They Can See Clearly Now In 1992 Pepsi introduced Crystal Pepsi , an attempt to cash in on the booming popularity of see - through soft drinks like Clearly Canadian .
Sales were less than half of what Pepsi projected , even after the company reformulated the product .
Marketing experts point to two critical flaws that they say doomed Crystal Pepsi from the start : ( 1 ) customers balked at paying extra for a product that , because it was clear , was perceived to have fewer ingredients than regular Pepsi , and ( 2 ) after more than a century of conditioning , consumers want colas to be dark brown in color .
" Clear sodas are about as appetizing as brown water , " an industry analyst explains .
At Gitmo , even acquittal may not set you free Muriel Kane

Print This Email This On February 11 , the Pentagon announced it would be trying six Guantanamo detainees for war crimes and seeking the death penalty .
However , according to Russ Tuttle of The Nation , " the trials are rigged from the start . "
Tuttle interviewed Col. Morris Davis , the former chief prosecutor for the military commissions , who resigned last fall , calling the system " deeply politicized . "
Davis has suggested that the cases are being tried in 2008 purely because of the presidential election .
Davis told Tuttle that in 2005 , Pentagon general counsel William Haynes said to him , " We can't have acquittals .
If we 've been holding these guys for so long , how can we explain letting them get off ?
We can't have acquittals , we 've got to have convictions . "
The Nuremburg trials after World War II , which offer the main precedent for any Guantanamo proceedings , resulted in a number of acquittals , and this was important to the perception that justice had been done .
Davis and others fear that with the possibility of acquittals ruled out , any Gitmo trials will be seen as a sham .
However , it seems likely that even if any of the defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence , they would not be released .
At a March 21 , 2002 Defense Department briefing describing the plans for military commissions , Haynes was asked , " Do these procedures guarantee that if a defendant is acquitted , that the defendant will be set free ? "
Haynes responded , " If we had a trial right this minute , it is conceivable that somebody could be tried and acquitted of that charge , but may not necessarily automatically be released .
The people that we are detaining , for example , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba are enemy combatants that we captured on the battlefield seeking to harm U.S. soldiers or allies , and they 're dangerous people .
...
The people that we now hold in Guantanamo are held for a specific reason that is not tied specifically to any particular crime . "
In response to a follow - up question , Haynes further explained , " The people we 're holding in Guantanamo we 're holding because we found them to be enemy combatants .
...
We are within our rights , and I do n't think anyone disputes it , that we may hold enemy combatants for the duration of the conflict .
And the conflict is still going and we do n't see an end in sight right now . "
Haynes , who is a Bush administration appointee , stands in the unusual position of overseeing both the prosecution and the defense for the military commissions .
It was when Haynes was placed above him in the chain of command that Davis resigned .
Haynes has also been associated with the approval of torture and , according to writer Scott Horton , has tried to either politicize or sidestep the Judge Advocate General 's corps , which is charged with implementing the military commissions .
Ross Tuttle and Scott Horton both appeared on Democracy Now ! to further discuss the charges in Tuttle 's article .
Tuttle explained that he had called Col .
Davis for comment on a story about one particular detainee and simply asked him if he thought the detainees could get a fair trial .
He was n't surprised by Davis 's answer , but when he realized that " this really seems to be the first time that somebody at such a high level has made such a statement , " he concluded it was important to get it into print .
" Jim Haynes is not just anybody , " Horton emphasized .
" As the general counsel of the Department of Defense , he 's the person who stands near the apex of this process .
The prosecutors report to him .
The defense counsels report to him .
The judges report to him .
...
And he already has an established back record of intervening in these cases for political purposes . "
Scott Horton added that Davis is highly respected in the military and that his attitudes about military justice are normally extremely conservative , making his resignation and speaking out all the more extraordinary .
The JAG corps itself is highly professional and wary of any politicization of its proceedings and has repeatedly come into conflict with Haynes , especially over the torture memos .
The use of confessions obtained through torture will be of central concern when it comes to potential trials of detainees .
The Defense Department has disputed Davis 's previous assertions .

FACEBOOK wants to put your face on advertisements for products that you like .
Facebook.com is a social networking site that lets people accumulate “ friends ” and share preferences and play games with them .
Each member creates a home page where he or she can post photographs , likes and dislikes and updates about their activities .
Yesterday , in a twist on word - of - mouth marketing , Facebook began selling ads that display people ’s profile photos next to commercial messages that are shown to their friends about items they purchased or registered an opinion about .
For example , going forward , a Facebook user who rents a movie on Blockbuster.com will be asked if he would like to have his movie choice broadcast out to all his friends on Facebook .
And those friends would have no choice but to receive that movie message , along with an ad from Blockbuster .
Facebook says that many of its 50 million active users already tell friends about particular products or brands they like , and the only change will be that those communications might start to carry ad messages from the companies that sell them .
Facebook is letting advertisers set up their own profile pages at no charge and encouraging companies like Blockbuster , Condé Nast and Coca - Cola to share information with Facebook about the actions of Facebook members on their sites .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - “ Green ” construction could cut North America ’s climate - warming emissions faster and more cheaply than any other measure , environmental experts from Canada , Mexico and the United States reported on Thursday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Besides energy efficiency and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , environmentally - conscious buildings are healthier for the people who use them , the report ’s authors said .
The report was issued at a conference in Vancouver by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation , a panel set up by the United States , Canada and Mexico to address environmental concerns raised by the North American Free Trade Agreement .
Payback for increased construction costs would begin almost immediately , said John Westeinde , a partner in the Windmill Development Group in Ottawa and chairman of an advisory group that guided the report .
“ The investments made for climate change benefit in buildings have direct payback , generally from the point of view of reduced energy costs and water costs as well the indoor health environment and increased productivity of the inhabitants of those buildings , ” he said in an interview .
North America ’s buildings release more than 2,200 megatons , or about 35 percent of the continent ’s total , of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .
If the construction market quickly adopted current and emerging energy - saving technologies , that number could be cut by 1,700 megatonnes by 2030 , the report said .
But there are obstacles to putting green building techniques into widespread use .
One is the so - called split incentive policy , where those who construct environmentally - friendly buildings do not necessarily reap the benefits of using them .
Also , governments and other institutions separate capital and operating budgets instead of budgeting for the lifetime of a construction project , creating a disincentive to build “ green , ” the report found .
It recommended setting up task - forces in all three countries to tackle the issue , set clearly defined targets to spur more green building and foster environmentally - friendly construction already in the works .

A robotics expert at the University of Sheffield will today ( 27 February 2008 ) issue stark warnings over the threat posed to humanity by new robot weapons being developed by powers worldwide .
In a keynote address to the Royal United Services Institute ( RUSI ) , Professor Noel Sharkey , from the University 's Department of Computer Science , will express his concerns that we are beginning to see the first steps towards an international robot arms race .
He will warn that it may not be long before robots become a standard terrorist weapon to replace the suicide bomber .
Many nations are now involved in developing the technology for robot weapons , with the US Department of Defence ( DoD ) being the most significant player .
According to the Unmanned Systems Roadmap 2007 - 2013 ( published in December 2007 ) , the US propose to spend an estimated $ 4 billion by 2010 on unmanned systems technology .
The total spending is expected to rise above $ 24 billion .
Over 4,000 robots are currently deployed on the ground in Iraq and by October 2006 unmanned aircraft had flown 400,000 flight hours .
Currently there is always a human in the loop to decide on the use of lethal force .
However , this is set to change with the US giving priority to autonomous weapons - robots that will decide on where , when and who to kill .
Others are now embarking on robot weapons programmes in Europe and other allied countries such as Canada , South Korea , South Africa , Singapore and Israel .
China , Russia and India are also embarking on the development of unmanned aerial combat vehicle .
The US DoD report is unsure about the activity in China but admits that they have strong infrastructure capability for parallel developments in robot weapons .
Professor Sharkey , who is famously known for his roles as chief judge on the TV series Robot Wars and as onscreen expert for the BBC´s TechnoGames , said : " The trouble is that we can't really put the genie back in the bottle .
Once the new weapons are out there , they will be fairly easy to copy .
How long is it going to be before the terrorists get in on the act " "
" With the current prices of robot construction falling dramatically and the availability of ready - made components for the amateur market , it would n't require a lot of skill to make autonomous robot weapons . "
Professor Sharkey is reluctant to explain how such robots could be made but he points out that a small GPS guided drone with autopilot could be made for around £ 250 .
The robotics expert is also concerned with a number of ethical issues that arise from the use of autonomous weapons .
He added : " Current robots are dumb machines with very limited sensing capability .
What this means is that it is not possible to guarantee discrimination between combatants and innocents or a proportional use of force as required by the current Laws of War .
" It seems clear that there is an urgent need for the international community to assess the risks of these new weapons now rather than after they have crept their way into common use . "
Professor Sharkey 's talk will be at a one - day conference at RUSI in Whitehall on 27 February 2008 .

How much would you pay to live in an equitable society in which people get what they deserve and deserve what they get ?
Economists at Carnegie Mellon University and the Free University of Berlin have developed a mathematical model to measure the value that people place on distributive justice – whether goods are distributed fairly among all members of society .
are willing to sacrifice about 20 percent of their disposable income to live in an equitable society – but they also found that the value a person places on equity is substantially affected by their race and educational background .
Whites place a higher value on equity than non-whites , and equity is valued more by those with high levels of education than those with less education .
The paper was written by Christina Fong , research scientist in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon , and Giacomo Corneo at the Free University of Berlin , and it is being published in the Journal of Public Economics .
“ In many countries , a large share of the government ’s budget is devoted to redistributing income , supposedly for equity reasons .
Since governmental redistribution is costly for society , some knowledge of society ’s willingness to pay for distributive justice is required in order to evaluate whether that public good is efficiently provided , ” the authors write .
Distributive justice can be guided by one of three principles : need , in which income is distributed to individuals based on their needs ; equality , in which income is shared equally by all members of a society ; or equity , in which income is distributed based on a person ’s effort .
Whether a person believes we live in an equitable society depends in large measure on whether they believe that labor markets are inherently fair .
Do people succeed mostly because of their own hard work , or do people often fail because of bad luck or circumstances beyond their control ?
Fong and Corneo analyzed data from the 1998 Gallup poll titled “ Haves and Have - Nots , ” which gauged respondents ’ attitudes toward wealth and poverty as well as government welfare policies .
The Gallup poll included questions about why the respondents believed that people became rich or poor , and whether government should redistribute wealth .
The survey did not explicitly ask what monetary value the respondents placed on distributive justice , so Fong and Corneo developed their model to use the survey data to answer that question .
Simply asking people outright how much they would pay to achieve an economically just society poses many problems .
For example , someone who believes that justice is important to them could exaggerate their response to a question about how much they ’d be willing to sacrifice to achieve , because there is no actual cost involved , but an artificially strong response may affect policy makers .
People also tend to state higher values of items that they are considering giving up , and lower values of things they are looking to acquire .
For the purposes of their model , Fong and Corneo assume that people hold one of two diametrically opposed beliefs : a laissez - faire view of the economy in which labor markets are inherently fair , rewarding hard work alone and that any form of income redistribution ( e.g. via income taxes and welfare ) is unjust ; or a belief that labor markets are unjust and reward people based on luck .
People who have a laissez - faire attitude toward the economy would give up 20 percent of their income to live in a society in which government does not transfer income from the rich to the poor .
On the contrary , those who hold the opposite belief would give up 20 percent of their income to live in a society in which the government does transfer income to the poor .
In reality , of course , many people do not hold such black - and - white views , and the authors write that further research might examine how more nuanced perceptions affect the value a person places on distributive justice .
The authors also found that education and race significantly influenced the value a person placed on an equitable distribution of income .
Educated whites placed the highest value on equity , while non-educated non-whites valued it the least , regardless of a person ’s personal income .
This does not mean that non-whites or those with less education do not value distributive justice , which , again , can be based on principles other than equity – namely , equality or need .

Sony is the last of the big music labels to offer DRM - free tracks
Sony has announced a deal to put its entire catalogue of tracks on the Amazon MP3 store by the end of January .
All of the songs on Amazon 's store will be free of controversial Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) controls .
In early January Sony announced a plan to sell gift cards that let customers download albums free of DRM .
Copy control
The deal means Amazon is now the only company offering tracks from all four big music companies free of DRM .
This makes the Amazon store a more significant rival for Apple iTunes which has long had a commanding lead over rivals in the downloadable music market .
All the 3.1 million tracks in the Amazon store are free of DRM software .
In contrast , only songs from EMI and some independent labels are available via Apple 's iTunes without copy controls .
In February 2007 , Apple boss Steve Jobs called on record labels to stop using DRM in a bid to boost the popularity of downloadable music .
The Amazon MP3 store , which launched in September 2007 , is only available in the US .
There have been no announcements about when or whether the service will be expanded overseas .
Songs prepared in the MP3 format can be played on any portable music player .
Tracks protected with DRM software are typically bound to one service or a particular portable player .
Although sales of downloadable tracks have doubled in a year in countries such as the UK , many music fans have been frustrated by the limits that DRM places on what they can do with the songs they have bought .
The copy protection systems have been used in an attempt to limit piracy and stop people getting hold of music via illegal file - sharing .
DIGG THIS
Computers work .
We complain about them , but that ’s because most of the time they work so fast that we do n’t even notice them in the background .
And they get cheaper by the second .
They get cheaper so fast that we can see the prices of memory and processor speed falling even without adjusting for inflation .
Health care , on the other hand , gets more expensive all the time , even for techniques that were invented decades ago .
Computers get twice as fast every two years , but technology for carbon - based organisms improves at a snail ’s pace .
Why ?
Biology is n’t all that complex .
After all , our cells only have the equivalent of about 2.8 gigabytes of ( very slow ) DNA memory storage .
The viruses that kill us often get by with 12 kilobytes .
Your cellphone has more memory than most pathogens , and cellphone design mutates more over the course of a year than the flu .
A Thought Experiment : The Federal Data Administration
Let ’s put medical research and biotech under the Federal computer regulatory agencies … oh , that ’s right , there are n’t any .
Meanwhile , let ’s see how Steve Jobs and Bill Gates would fare under … the FDA !
Yes , the FDA ; the Federal Data Administration .
Every processor , peripheral , program , printer , and power cord will now need FDA approval .
This will take about 19 years of trials on lab rats and human nerd volunteers , at an average cost of $ 802 million dollars per item ( according to a Tufts University study on drug approval back in 2001 ; the time and cost is probably less than twice that now , right ? ) .
Any change of any kind to any chip , peripheral , or line of code will of course require a complete re-approval .
And what about those guys who run the computer industry ?
They ’re… dropouts !
Steve Jobs , Bill Gates , Larry Ellison … the whole industry is dominated by billionaire dropouts .
How have we gotten along so long without credentialed professionals ?
To make the computer industry run like the health care industry , state licensing boards will require American Mainframe Association ( AMA ) membership for all computer professionals .
Every programmer will have to pass a four - year pre-mainframe undergraduate degree , four years of Mainframe School , then internships , residencies , and so on until they are gray enough to program responsibly ( or die of old age ) .
Now when you have a computing need , you will have to go to one of these AMA professionals and sit in a cold waiting room full of computer viruses .
Then you will receive a prescription to receive FDA - approved hardware and software ( within the prescribing and cost regulations of an HMO , see below ) .
The IRS will make buying computers tax - deductible for employers , but not for you .
Employees will be forced to buy computers through Hardware Maintenance Organizations ( HMOs ) run by their employers .
To lose your job will mean to lose your computer , your ISP , and your primary - care AMA programmer .
The Data Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) will combat the smuggling of illegal data - processing paraphernalia , such as that used in so - called " video games " or " iPods . "
The DEA would also have the responsibility of ensuring that no unapproved data crosses our borders .
And then there would be the National Institute of Hardware ( NIH ) , which would pour billions into the academic study of advanced vacuum tube designs …
OK .
No one would really be stupid enough to try to run the computer industry like this .
We love our computers too much , so we do n’t let government regulate them .
We leave our computers to the free market , even though they control nuclear weapons , air traffic control , our cars ’ antilock brakes , and lots of other stuff that ’s more immediately dangerous to our health than medicine .
The free market is n’t perfect , but it ’s constantly driven to improve .
With all its imperfections , freedom is still safer than stagnation .
Can Market Medicine Be Safe ?
Most people can see that the market works best for computers .
There are few calls for nationalization of Apple or Intel .
But when it comes to health care , it is just assumed that only government can provide safety … in spite of its record of both approving dangerous drugs and stalling valuable therapies .
Of course we need impartial testing of drugs and medical protocols .
Do we really think we get that under the current system ?
Is the FDA somehow exempt from the law that every regulatory agency is captured by the industry it " regulates " ?
I ’d feel a lot better if the next Celebrex or Thalidomide were also going to be tested by competing companies and nonprofits , instead of essentially by the prospective manufacturer under the " supervision " of the FDA .
Maybe Underwriters ’ Laboratories , the AMA , a few universities , etc. could expand into the job .
In any case , even if you think the FDA is exempt from the evolutionary laws that govern bureaucracies , there is no advantage to preventing competition .
If some people wish to use only the FDA approval system , fine .
That should n’t restrict anyone else with an incurable disease from using a medicine approved by the AMA , or UL , or the Mayo Clinic .
Any group should be allowed to make lists of " approved " drugs and protocols , and patients and doctors should be allowed to choose .
The FDA and the patent office have created a medical system that is driven by drug companies .
Do drug companies have all the right incentives to find the downsides of their patented product pipelines ?
I ’m not at all anti-drug - company ; they do good work , but would n’t medical systems driven by ( say ) life insurance companies , or hospital chains , or academic research , each have their own advantages ?
Again , competition is the key to progress .
Then there ’s biological terrorism .
If the survival of our nation depends on the speed at which we develop new cures for artificially engineered viruses … do we want to bet on our current system of government agencies and committees , or on the market ?
The Best of Bill Walker
AT&T and Verizon Wireless want to go up against other current mobile operators and some possible future competitors , including Google , in next month 's auction for 700MHz wireless spectrum around the U.S .
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday released lists of accepted and incomplete applications for the auction , in which it will sell licenses to frequencies that are set to be vacated by analog TV stations .
It has accepted 96 applications and reported 170 as incomplete .
The latter need to be completed by Jan .
4 .
AT&T and Verizon are not surprise entrants but are the country 's biggest mobile operators .
If either carrier won a portion of the spectrum that has been designated for use by any device and any service , it would have to open up its network more than any big U.S. operator ever has .
Verizon has already unveiled part of a plan to further open its network .
They were on the list of incomplete applications , along with smaller mobile operators Alltel and MetroPCS .
Cable operator Cox Communications , an archrival of the telecommunications giants , is also preparing an application .
And cellular technology giant Qualcomm , which is already building a mobile entertainment network on vacated TV channels , is also gearing up to bid .
Would - be bidders with incomplete applications have until Jan. 4 to complete their paperwork .
Google earlier this year offered to participate in the auction in return for the FCC imposing open - network requirements .
The booming Internet company 's involvement could drive up bids all around , helping the government reap its hoped - for $ 10 billion payday for the spectrum .
Google 's application has already been accepted , the FCC said Tuesday .
So has that of Towerstream , a wireless broadband provider to businesses .
One surprise applicant yet to complete its papers is oil giant Chevron .
Participation by Chevron in the auction comes " out of the blue , " said analyst Jack Gold of J. Gold Associates .
However , oil companies and utilities are big wireless users , so he can see why Chevron might be interested .
Chevron , like Google , is unlikely to actually build a network , though , he said .
" I can see them potentially winning but then becoming landlords , renting it out , " he said .
For both companies , that decision would n't be based on the cost of building a network but on the experience required : Neither company has any history of constructing and operating a wireless network , a complicated undertaking .
Also Tuesday , the agency extended the Dec. 28 deadline for upfront payments in the auction to Jan. 4 and pushed back a mock auction until Jan. 22 .
The auction itself is set to begin Jan. 24 .
Nancy Gohring , in Seattle , contributed to this report .
A fundamental rule of the internet :
Trying stuff is cheaper than deciding whether to try it .
( Compare the cost of paying and feeding someone to do a few weeks of [ Perl or PHP ] hacking to the full cost of the meetings that went into a big company decision . )
Do n’t overplan something .
Just do it half - assed to start with , then throw more people at it to fix it if it works .
Actually , it ’s more like they are paying the banks to take the billions .
When they auction off $ 30 billion at 3.010 % and inflation is running closer to 4 % , they are acting the way the banks were acting towards home buyers leading up to the housing crash .
It did n’t seem possible that anyone could be worse than Mr Bubble , but Bernanke is indeed worse .
Creating the bubbles of tomorrow , with your tax dollars .
The British Olympic Association said it would look again at the wording of the agreement after a furious outcry from human rights groups and Opposition politicians .
The angry reaction came after it emerged officials have inserted a new clause in the contract Olympians must sign before competing in this summer 's games insisting they must not comment on politically - sensitive issues during the Games .
Athletes who breach the contract could face being sent home .
It read : " ( Athletes ) are not to comment on any politically sensitive issues . "
It also refers athletes , likely to include marathon runner Paula Radcliffe and the Queen 's granddaughter , Zara Phillips , to Section 51 of the IOC charter which restricts demonstrations of " political propaganda " on Olympic sites .
Initially , BOA bosses denied trying to gag competitors , insisting they were free to answer questions but should not use the Games as a soapbox for political concerns .
But chief executive Simon Clegg later conceded that the contract would need to be amended to make its intentions clearer .
" I accept that the interpretation of one part of the draft BOA 's Team Members Agreement appears to have gone beyond the provision of the Olympic Charter .
This is not our intention nor is it our desire to restrict athletes ' freedom of speech and the final agreement will reflect this , " he said in a statement .
The row - back came after response to the move , revealed in the Mail on Sunday , was unfailingly critical .
The Liberal Democrat leader told BBC1's Politics Show the decision was a " real abdication of our moral responsibility " .
Shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the BOA to withdraw the " ridiculous contract " .
A spokesman for the human rights group Liberty said : " It would be both un -British and un-Olympian to attempt to muzzle the speech and conscience of athletes attending these Games . "
Amnesty International campaigns director Tim Hancock said : " People in China ca n't speak out about human rights without fear of reprisals ; people in Britain can .
It 's up to each individual to decide what they think and what they say about China 's human rights record and that goes for athletes too . "
You Feel What You Eat Nutritional experts say many foods can influence the way we feel .
March 5 , 2008  --
Food , glorious food !
Even in the dingy back - alley orphanage of Dickensian London , this refrain from the opening song of the musical " Oliver ! " has the power to lift the hungry and penniless orphans from their depression into ecstatic song .
But even for the rest of us , food can often change our frame of mind .
Hundreds of expert answers to common questions on mind and mood can be found at the ABC News OnCall + Mind and Mood section , here .
" Food really does have a lot of power , " said Bonnie Taub - Dix , a registered dietician and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association .
" Use it properly and have a well - balanced diet and you really can improve your mood . "
Studies have shown that some foods , like turkey , whole grain breads , and sugary snacks , have definite effects on the brain , raising and lowering mood - altering chemicals .
" Not only does your food affect your mood , your mood affects the food you 'll choose , " Taub - Dix said .
" Unfortunately , the average consumer is n't eating a healthy enough diet , let alone a diet that will put them in a good mood . "
According to the National Institutes of Health , 20.9 million Americans suffer from mood disorders and 14.8 million experience depression .
These rising rates of depression and other mood disorders parallels the rise of obesity in the U.S .
Since the mid-1970s , the prevalence of overweight and obese people , aged 20 - 74 , increased from 15 percent to 32.9 percent , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
More than one - third of U.S. adults — over 72 million people — were obese in 2005 .
Though no studies show that mood disorders and increased obesity are directly related , many agree that there is some correlation .
" It is hard to establish cause and effect , " said Robert Thayer , a professor of psychology at California State University at Long Beach .
" But it 's not by chance that stress has been going up and depression has been going up and obesity is going up . "
But Lona Sandon , a registered dietician and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association , points out that distinguishing between a bad mood and a clinical disorder is important .
" Attempting to treat clinical depression on your own through food is not a good idea , " she said .
" Also , treating a bad mood with foods can leave you with unwanted excess weight and negative feelings about food . "
The most effective way to stabilize mood is to eat a balanced diet of protein , carbohydrates , fruits and vegetables , and limit sugar , fat , and alcohol .
Coupled with exercise , this regime will keep levels of endorphins , the brain 's feel - good chemicals , steady .
But some still swear by the curative effects of an intensely healthy diet .
" I 've seen people make dramatic improvements in depression and anxiety within a week of making some simple dietary changes , " said Trudy Scott , a nutritionist and spokesperson for the National Association of Nutrition Professionals .
Although their efficacy varies from person to person , the following are some foods that are known to affect your mood .
Salmon
Whether it 's baked , broiled or raw sashimi , eating salmon and other oily fish like mackerel and sardines can bring a smile to your face .
These fish are rich in omega - 3 fatty acids , the latest wunderkind of the mood world .
Though they may be best known for their heart - healthy qualities , omega - 3s are also good for boosting your mood .
" They are probably the hottest thing presently in terms of helping the brain heal and helping mood through eating properly , " said George Pratt , a clinical psychologist in private practice at Scripps Memorial Hospital in LaJolla , Calif .
The body uses omega - 3 fatty acids for building neurotransmitters like serotonin in the brain , and some studies have shown that eating plenty of these fats has depression - preventing qualities .
If fish is not part of your diet , you can find these nourishing oils in flaxseeds and walnuts .
In fact , countries where oily fish are a part of the diet , such as Japan , have lower rates of depression than other countries .
These countries often have a healthier diet and lifestyle overall , but their omega - 3 intake is higher as well .
So , depending on your mood , swallow that spoonful of cod liver oil , just as your grandmother said .
Milk
Milk .
It does a body good .
This was the slogan for a 1980s ad campaign , urging kids and teens to drink milk to stay healthy .
But the commercials , featuring sassy young kids growing up into handsome men and women , did not touch on how milk is good for the mind as well as the body .
Milk is rich in calcium and the amino acid tryptophan .
Beyond its bone - building properties , calcium is known to calm nerves when feeling stressed or anxious .
Tryptophan is important for producing serotonin , which elevates mood .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends drinking three glasses of milk each day .
If you can't stomach cow juice , however , some almonds , also rich in calcium and tryptophan , will do the trick when you feel stressed or down .
Coffee
Coffee can boost mood on many levels .
In the morning , the aroma of a rich Columbian roast can be enough to make you feel more alert .
After two cups , the mind is alert , the eyes are bright , and the tail is bushy .
Of course , the sensory effects of coffee , and other warm beverages , like tea or cocoa , can lift your spirits .
But the caffeine is the key ingredient when it comes to how a cup of java can affect your mood .
The chemical can induce feelings of happiness and euphoria .
" A small amount of coffee or caffeine may help you feel more energized and alert , " said the ADA 's Sandon .
" Too much may backfire , leaving you feeling more stressed and jittery . "
Excess amounts of caffeine — say , more than four or five cups each day — can have effects on their own .
The body becomes accustomed to the caffeine boost , and when it does n't receive it , can go through withdrawal - like symptoms , which can lead to irritability and depression .
Drinking caffeine after noon can interfere with sleep patterns , leading to further risk of fatigue and depression .
The effect of caffeine is magnified in people with an existing mental condition .
" A patient with bipolar disorder may react positively to coffee when depressed , where as mania could be exacerbated , " said Carla Wolper , a nutritionist at the Obesity Research Center at St. Luke 's Hospital in New York .
The expert verdict : A small amount of caffeine in the morning is permissible , beneficial , even .
More than that , however , and your mood is at risk .
Chocolate
Of the five lucky children with golden tickets who made it into Willy Wonka 's magnificent chocolate factory , only the hero was sweet tempered and happy .
Perhaps he got started early on the promised lifetime supply of chocolate .
Research has shown cocoa beans to be rich in a variety of mood - lifting ingredients .
These chemicals are most concentrated in dark chocolate , which is why it is recommended over the milk or white varieties .
Dark chocolate is high in polyphenols , which are shown to improve cognitive function , said Pratt .
Chocolate also contains phenylethylamines , a neurotransmitter that , in low levels , is associated with depression and in high levels can be associated with schizophrenia .
Phenylethylamines work by releasing endorphins in the brain and promote feelings of attraction and giddiness .
" Both sex and dark chocolate activate the same parts of the brain , " Pratt said .
" Why not combine them ? "
Besides the chemically stimulating properties of chocolate , the sweet flavor and fat content can activate their own pleasure centers in the brain .
No wonder Wonka 's Oompa Loompa 's wanted to be paid in cocoa beans .
Alcohol
Most high school children learn , through drug and alcohol education , that alcohol is a depressant — literally .
Alcohol can dull your central nervous system and impair important brain functions .
But that 's not the only thing alcohol can dull .
" Sugar and alcohol elate momentarily while they shoot excessive sugar into the system … but the resultant insulin response drives the blood sugar to dive low , creating brain and ultimate mood changes such as anxiety , depression , hopelessness , and / or sadness , " said Adele Puhn , a clinical nutritionist who has written extensively about diet .
When taken responsibly , a small quantity of alcohol can have calming , sedative effects .
But while a glass of red wine with dinner may have a soothing effect after a hard day at work , downing martinis or scotch will do the opposite .
" Alcohol will help you go to sleep , but you will wake up rapidly , " Pratt said , when the alcohol is converted to sugar in the body .
Sleep disruption can contribute to feeling tired , anxious , and depressed .
" You just want to be very kind and loving to yourself . "
Brazil Nuts
If an apple a day keeps the doctor away , some brazil nuts each day might keep the psychiatrist at bay .
Brazil nuts , native to South America , are rich in the mineral selenium .
Though scientists are not certain of the mechanism , selenium is essential for maintaining a good mood and getting enough selenium may prevent depression .
These rich nuts are also a good source of B vitamins , magnesium , and zinc , which can help calm stressed nerves and keep you alert .
Whey
Perhaps the spider that frightened Little Miss Muffet away was hip to the nutritional value of her curds and whey .
Whey is the natural byproduct of cheese .
It is the thin , slightly cloudy liquid that is left behind once milk has been curdled and strained .
The mood benefits of whey come from the high concentration of tryptophan , that essential amino acid that gets converted to serotonin in the brain and lifts your mood .
If the thought of liquid whey does not set your mouth watering , it is often sold as whey protein , a powdered supplement found in health stores .
Spinach
Maybe spinach helped Popeye the sailor strengthen up to fight for his love , Olive Oyl , but spinach has more effect on mood than Popeye let on .
Spinach is a potent green .
Part of the family that includes kale and chard , spinach is a rich source of several minerals that are good for anxiety and depression .
People with anxiety might benefit from a cup of cooked spinach , according to Trudy Scott , a nutritionist and spokesperson for the National Association of Nutrition Professionals .
Spinach contains magnesium , a mineral with relaxing and calming effects .
Green leafy vegetables are also high in folic acid , low levels of which have been linked to depression in several studies .
Comfort Foods
Comfort foods are different for everyone .
It may be a pasta dish eaten as a child or a sweet given as a reward for doing well in school .
But the effect of these foods is always the same : they make you feel good .
" There 's no question that when we eat something that really pleases us … presumably it sets off certain reward centers in the brain , " said Alan Gelenberg , emeritus professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona .
" It is not dissimilar to the centers associated with drug abuse and sex . "
Because of the strong emotional component , comfort foods increase the production and release of the pleasure neurotransmitters , serotonin and dopamine , in the brain to give a sense of well - being and even euphoria .
Comfort foods may be simple in themselves : mashed potatoes , macaroni and cheese , chocolate cake , ice cream .
In general , though , these foods taste good and immediately distract from a bad mood .
But most often , we crave carbohydrate - rich foods when our mood is low because they are easy to digest and quickly release serotonin for a calming effect .
" They do n't require much work for the body to break down , " said the ADA 's Taub - Dix .
" Your body is saying , ' do me a favor , let 's just take it easy , I do n't want to work hard . ' "
But this urge can backfire when unchecked .
Overeating calorie - and fat - laden food can result in weight gain which can also cause poor self - image and depression .
But Gelenberg said the best way to head this off this scenario is to maintain a balanced diet and be physically active .
" Then you can feel good and have selected number of treats as a favor to yourself , " Gelenberg said .
Fast Food
Unequivocally , fast foods are mood downers .
While it may be cheap , fast , or just easy to reach for a donut , a bag of chips , or a hamburger , eventually , your mood will pay the price .
The immediate effects of a high - fat or sugary snack can be misleading .
Often , they give a quick burst of energy and may reduce tension .
But these effects run in reverse rapidly , said Robert Thayer , a professor of psychology at California State University at Long Beach .
" They shift to increase tension and reduce energy , " he said .
Fast food and junk food are usually the most processed foods , where the nutrients are refined to the point where they are absorbed immediately or not at all , leaving no long - term sustenance for the body to feed off of .
" It is addictive to eat that sort of lipid - laden diet , " Gelenberg said .
Besides the poor nutrient content , fast food often contains many additives and preservatives that can affect mood negatively .
Food colorings and preservatives , like benzoate , and added flavorings like monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) , can cause anxiety , according to Scott .
Studies have shown that the omega - 6 fatty acids often found in these foods , can compete with omega - 3 fatty acids and an imbalance between the two can lead to obesity and depression .
Since Americans often do n't get enough omega - 3s in their diets , consuming too many fast food items puts them at risk for mood problems .
" Most of us are busy … and many people put themselves last , " Pratt said .
" Fast food is horrible — for the salt content alone , never mind the fat and calories — but when we 're stressed we 're looking for rapid solutions ...
Emotionally centering yourself will be immensely helpful . "
Why all the Democrat Voter Fraud Accusations ?
Since 2000 , it seems as though every time a Democrat loses an election it is due to voter fraud .
It started with Al Gore , and continued with John Kerry .
Why is this ?
This primary season in New Hampshire Hillary Clinton won even though polls showed Obama with a ten point lead .
Naturally the accusations of voter fraud surfaced .
How could the polls be wrong ?
There were claims that busloads of out of staters were being brought in to vote .
Many stories were told of there being more cars at polling stations with Massachusetts plates than New Hampshire plates .
This is the main reason why same day registration should be stopped and you should need to show an ID to vote .
But that is an argument for another day , and another post .
Next came Nevada .
First Clinton supporters filed a lawsuit two days before the caucus to prevent what they thought were caucuses that would vote for Obama from having a voice .
Next , I turn on the television and I see Bill Clinton telling every reporter that will listen that he personally saw his wife ’s supporters not being allowed into caucuses .
It seems that Democrats can’t accept defeat graciously , in Clinton ’s case he was setting up an excuse for defeat just in case it happened , now that it did n’t he just looks foolish .
So why is this ?
Why is it only Democrats ?
Why do Republicans take their loses and move on without accusations of voter fraud .
In 2006 , when Republicans were swept out of power , were there any complaints ?
None that I remember .
I have a theory , and here it is .
For the past , I do n’t know , 15 years - maybe 20 , there has been a mindset instilled into the American children that there are no winners and losers .
This mindset has been inculcated into their heads for years and years .
On the soccer field parents can’t keep score because we do n’t want the losers being sent away in shame .
It will hurt them emotionally for the rest of their lives if they lose a soccer game .
Over time this thought process of protecting the child has reached levels of absurdity .
Some schools are no longer correcting tests in red , they are using purple because red is too traumatising to a child .
Red pens will scar children for life .
There are children who ca n’t read or write being pushed through school anyway .
Why .
because there is a belief out there that holding a child back will traumatise him or her more than not being able to read or write .
So they are sent to the next grade in hopes that they can catch up there .
They can ’t , they fall further behind .
Then there is the whole idea of outcome based education .
If a child believes that 2+2=5 than we are to let him or her believe 2+2=5 until they figure out on their own why 2+2=4 .
This is because telling a child that he / she is wrong is , you guessed it , too traumatising for the child .
All this type of no consequences for you actions , everybody always wins , nobody ever loses attitude has been preached by liberals for all these years .
Children grow up and go into the real world unprepared for failure because they have been taught that there is no failure .
My theory is that they have been spouting this garbage for so long now that they have actually indoctrinated themselves into this mentality .
They have been teaching children that nobody ever loses , that we are all winners for so long now that they actually believe it .
Now we have had three Democrat contests , we wo n’t count Michigan because it did n’t count , and two accusations of voter fraud .
I believe they have forgotten how to lose with class and dignity all because they forgot that life actually does have winners and losers .
What makes this so fun is that all the other accusations were levied against Republicans , now we have two Democrats fighting with each other about who the system is going to fuck over .
I love it .
Democrat candidates head into the primary season as unprepared for failure as our children enter society unprepared for failure .
Democrats have forgotten that somebody has to lose .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain could follow France in cutting Internet access to users who repeatedly download music or films illegally .
An undated file photo of a woman typing on a computer keyboard .
REUTERS / Files
The government had given the music and film industries a year to come to a voluntary agreement with Internet Service Providers over how to tackle illegal file sharing , but that timeframe expired at the end of 2007 .
With no sign of an agreement in place , it is due to publish its options in a strategy document in the coming weeks and a separate consultation later in the year to examine how it can cut down on piracy .
One suggestion put forward by the music industry is to adopt the French model , where warning messages are sent to those who frequently download music or films illegally .
If the messages are ignored , users can have their accounts suspended or closed altogether .
The body representing Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) says they would prefer a voluntary agreement but the music industry argues it has been forced to demand legal action after rampant Internet piracy rocked its traditional revenue model .
A report in the Times newspaper on Tuesday suggested ISPs could be legally required to take action against users who accessed pirated material .
An alternative system would be based on filtering , which could block illegal files from being downloaded .
Global music sales were down around 10 percent in 2007 and the international music trade body , the IFPI group , estimates that tens of billions of illegal tracks were swapped in the year .
But John Kennedy , the head of the IFPI , said the mood was turning towards ISPs having to take more responsibility for cracking down on illegal activity .
“ It is simply not acceptable for ISPs to turn a blind eye to the piracy on their networks which is at such a rate that there are 20 illegal music downloads for every legal track sold , ” he said in a statement .
“ Record companies have licensed more than six million tracks to over 500 legal services and consumers can now legitimately get access to music online in a wide variety of ways .
“ If the French and British governments take action and others follow , there will be more room for the legal market to grow as services will not have to compete with the ‘ something for nothing ’ deal available on the illegal networks that do not invest a penny in generating new music . ”
A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport declined to comment on what options would feature in the strategy report .
Renewables to Boom or Bust ?
February 18th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Timothy Hurst recently wrote an article about U.S. Investors and renewable energy .
This post is designed as a complement to that news story .
Renewable energy has attracted a lot of attention lately as the world looks for cleaner ways to power our world .
Wind and solar stand as the most recognizable clean , green dynamos , but they still struggle to compete with traditional and entrenched power producers .
True to conventional economic values , competition is everything .
Yet , in the U.S.A . these technologies have survived in the dog - eat - dog industry for decades mostly without the aid of government subsidies ( unlike coal and oil ) , and many claim that renewables could take off with just a little help from Uncle Sam .
What are the obstacles ?
Are government subsidies the only saving grace for renewables ?
This post hopes to shed some light on the topic and burn through the conflicting noise that surrounds this fundamental and controversial industry .
It seems like I ’m always reading articles about improvements , investments , and the promise of renewable energy .
For a more practical perspective , I recently asked a successful businessman , who sometimes works with solar panels , for his opinion .
Did he think that solar was going to boom in the next few years ?
His opinion was that the industry would need more government subsidies to really take off .
Even with high oil prices , it was still simply too expensive to invest on a small scale .
You might regain your initial investment in 15 + years in ideal conditions .
Even in states with incentives to support renewable energy , it ’s expensive .
His view echoed my cousin ’s frustration .
Yet despite the initial cost , renewables are still an attractive option .
As expensive as it may be to buy and install solar panels , it ’s also very expensive ( $ 1.8 - billion and rising ) to build a new coal - fired power plant with “ clean coal ” technologies .
Hidden costs also plague coal power plants : the cost to clean up mercury emissions , the water required to operate , and in some places , the cost of carbon credits .
Finally , the bottom line : how much does it cost to generate each kilowatt hour ?
Compare two graphs , one for coal and one for solar , and you may be surprised .
But what about the cry for “ subsidies ! ” ?
I ’ll state right out that I do n’t intend to offer an analysis , or interpretation of U.S. energy subsidies .
There is enough information out there to fill a multitude of posts , and books have already been published on the issue .
Boiled down , the federal government tends to support traditional oil and coal over renewables like solar and wind .
Ethanol has received a lot of attention and support from the Bush administration , but studies show that it poses its own problems .
There is a new proposal to extend renewable energy subsidies after similar measures were shot down in the last energy bill .
There ’s increasing pressure for Uncle Sam and other international governments to lend a hand or even tax carbon .
Subsidies could help make renewables not just competitive , but accessible and profitable – much in the same way subsidies currently reduce the price of gasoline for consumers .
But are subsidies the one and only answer ?
How long can we afford to wait for the government to draft and pass complicated and contentious legislation ?
Enter Google .
This year Google announced that it would invest millions in renewable energies to support R&D and building facilities .
The idea seemed so attractive that it started a craze : this week , “ U.S. institutional investors … pledged $ 10 billion dollars over two years in renewable energy technologies and project development , energy efficiency , green building and clean technologies ” ( my emphasis ) .
These are investors we ’re talking about – people who assess risk and intend to make a profit .
With a multi-billion dollar injection into the industry , maybe some of the new advances I get so excited over will leap off the drawing board and into our lives .
But we need not wait for new technology to save us .
I agree with Peter A. Darbee , Chairman , CEO and President of PG&E Corporation when he says the technology is already available .
“ In conversations with other business leaders , I have heard more times than I can count that it ’s impossible or impractical to make much headway on greenhouse gases until we have better technology , ” Darbee said .
“ That is not the case .
It ’s a red herring … .
The biggest obstacle right now is a lack of will — not invention . ”
In case you do n’t know , PG&E stands for Pacific Gas & Electric company .
They are a major energy provider that supports renewable energy .
Looking at all of this information , I admit that I feel a little overwhelmed .
I ’m not an economist but I ’ve come away with the strong sense that renewables are valuable for more than their guilt - free eco-friendly qualities .
Right now , they stand firmly on the cusp of competitiveness with other forms of electricity generation , and constant improvements in technology will push them into the forefront of the industry even if legislation and subsidies do not .
This fact is proved by commitments of large international corporations to invest not millions , but billions of dollars into the development and implementation of renewable technologies .
Even if we cannot agree on the politics of renewables , I think we can agree that investments on this scale signal an economic shift .
Renewable technologies have already been around for decades , but now it seems certain that they ’ll move into the spotlight of our energy generation as the promise of their benefit comes to outweigh crumbling economic obstacles .
Admittedly this article is limited as it has focused on comparing solar to oil and coal .
I had difficulty finding the statistics and numbers I wanted for wind power .
Other options of energy production , such as non -food ethanol , plasma gasification , hydrogen , wave or tidal power , and other technologies are either controversial , still under development , or both .
They may play a larger role in the future , but I wanted to limit my scope for the sake of simplicity and brevity .
Do you have any ideas , opinions , links , or comments ?

unicode branch is merged to trunk
From : Miles Bader Subject : unicode branch is merged to trunk Date : Sat , 02 Feb 2008 01:13:36 +0900
There are two CVS tags bracketing the merge , " before - merge - unicode - to - trunk " , and " merge- unicode - to - trunk " .
The only processing of ChangeLogs I did was to _prepend_ the ChangeLog.unicode files to the corresponding ChangeLogs , munge the dates in the ChangeLog entries ( to be today ) , and delete ChangeLog.unicode files .
I did n't do anything with " etc/NEWS.unicode " , as the structure of " etc/ NEWS " seems to be complicated enough that some effort will be required to merge them .

Scientists created a device that is not larger than a few molecules and that is claimed to mimic how the most complicated computer – human brain works .
The computer can perform 16 times more operations than a common computer transistor .
Researchers expect the device to complete even 1,000 times more operations .
The tiny computer is made of a duroquinone , a molecule looking like a hexagonal plate with four cones attached to it .
Duroquinone is less than a nanometer large , which is hundreds times smaller than a wavelength of a visible light .
The device is formed with 17 duroquinone molecules with one molecule positioned in the center and 16 others making up a ring .
This wonder sits on a gold surface .
The computer is operated with the help of electrical impulses transmitted through the electrically conductive needle .
The central molecule shifts around in different ways , causing the 16 surrounding molecules shift too .
Anirban Bandyopadhyay , an artificial intelligence and molecular electronics expert at the National Institute for Materials Science at Tsukuba in Japan , explained that the work of the device resembles the way brain cells interact .
A pulse sent to a central molecule , having four cones and linked to another 16 duroquinones will result in almost 4.3 billion different operations if compared to two different outcomes a normal computer transistor can perform .
Having a good notebook computer is a lot like having an external brain .

Your 'e looking at the oldest surviving map of Britain , dating from around 1360 .
And , give or take a bit of poetic licence north of the border , it 's startlingly accurate .
There are the Severn , Thames and Humber , the loop of the Wear in Durham and the Thames estuary , all easily recognisable .
Scroll down for more ...
As are the more than 600 cities , towns and villages , almost 200 rivers , and a rudimentary road network marked with thin red lines and extending to some 3,000 miles .
Along with countless hills , mountains , lakes , forests - New Forest and Sherwood - and even Hadrian 's Wall , labelled with its popular name , murus pictorum , the Picts ' Wall .
The significance is enormous , as a new book reveals .
" It is the first modern map of Britain and the oldest surviving map which shows the coastline in recognisable form , " says author Nick Millea , map librarian at Oxford University 's Bodleian Library .
" All previous maps gave a theological interpretation , showing how Britain fitted into the Christian world .
" The Hereford Mappa Mundi from approximately the same time has Jerusalem as the centre of the world .
" Geography just was n't important . "
Named after topographer Richard Gough - who bought it in 1774 for half - a- crown ( 121/2 p ) and bequeathed it to the Bodleian Library - the map is drawn in pen , ink and coloured washes on two skins of vellum and measures almost 4ft long by 2ft wide .
Almost as surprising as the detail and the accuracy ( if you discount misshapen Scotland ) is the startling orientation - the original map was drafted to face east towards Jerusalem , rather than the north , because its topographers had not entirely abandoned their theological way of thinking .
Scroll down for more ...
In its correct position it looks rather like an old mildewed boot with Wales as the heel , Scotland as the toe and East Anglia sticking up into the air .
" There are 600 - odd places and , if you compare it with a modern map , most of them are in pretty much the right spot , " says Millea .
" We do n't know whether they did the coastline first then filled in the interior , or whether it was done by word of mouth - a verbal map - so they put in London then worked outwards , adding places they knew . "
Nick Crane , topographer and presenter of TV series Map Man , thinks they may have used an astrolabe - a highly technical instrument used by classical astronomers , navigators and astrologers which involved checking the horizon , the stars , the sun and all sorts of angles .
" This could be the beginning of mathematical map - making - some of the points of latitude have probably been measured through astronomy , " he says .
But why do they get Scotland so wrong ?
The Clyde and Forth and Edinburgh are recognisable , but the rest is all a bit of a mess .
" It was created at a time when Scotland was a foreign country and little was known about it so they improvised , " says Millea .
" That 's why there are so few place names north of the border . "
While the map in the Bodleian Library dates from the mid-14th century , experts think it was copied from an earlier map , from around 1280 , which did n't survive .
" Geographically , it fits with the time of Edward I .
All the castles of his conquest of Wales are there .
" And the few Scottish place names shown were around at the time of Edward I , but not much later . "
This may account for a few mistakes .
Cardigan Bay is missing .
Cornwall extends too far west , Orkney 's too big and Dartmouth and part of central Wales are shown as lakes rather than upland areas .
Lewes in Sussex pops up twice .
But regardless of these errors , the Gough map represents a massive leap forward .
As well as showing the geography , it gives a snapshot of England and Wales at the time and an idea of the contrasting fortunes of places .
Some towns , such as Blakeney in Norfolk which was once a thriving port , are now tiny settlements compared with their apparent importance in the 14th century .
In contrast Manchester appears to be no bigger than Charlesworth , a little village in the Peak District .
The Gough map is one of this country 's most important historical documents - it formed the basis for almost all the maps of Britain for 200 years .
And with its green rivers , red- roofed cathedrals , and extraordinary detail , it is surely one of the most aesthetically pleasing .

But what William the Conqueror did n't have in the Domesday Book was an easy way of searching its reams of data .
It has taken more than 900 years , but at last the internet has provided a solution .
An academic at Hull University has produced the world 's first complete , freely available online version .
Professor John Palmer , whose work on the Domesday Book stretches back 25 years , has transformed its handwritten parchment pages into a database with searchable indexes , a detailed commentary and the ability to organise all its statistics in a tabulated format .
The Domesday Book , the oldest and most famous public record , was based on the 1086 great survey of England which investigated ' how the country was occupied , and with what sort of people ... how much each had ... and how much it was worth ' .
It covered 13,418 settlements south of the rivers Ribble and Tees .
As with the Last Judgment , all were called to account - hence the name , Domesday , Day of Judgment .
There would be nothing like it in England again until the censuses of the 19th century .
But for nearly 1,000 years it has been inaccessible to most people and difficult to understand .
There are costly CD - Rom translations , and the National Archives provides online searches , but Palmer set out to create a new format to bring the book into the digital age .
Whereas the original has information listed under headings , Palmer has coded and tagged terms so they can be automatically retrieved and analysed .
His software makes it possible to isolate certain variables and conduct several searches at once .
The results can be displayed as a map , table or translated text , or as a combination of formats .
The three - year project was funded by a £ 250,000 grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council .
Palmer , who worked on the project with his son , Matt , said : ' My interest in Domesday began in about 1980 as a teaching project .
My son was getting interested in computing at the same time .
It developed into a research < interest for the 900th anniversary in 1986 , but computers were n't powerful enough then .
In the mid-Nineties , the improvements in computers revived my interest and I managed to get some funding .'
Written in Latin , the Domesday Book is the starting point of history for the majority of towns and villages in England .
It lists places , landowners and tenants , tax assessments , cultivated land , numbers of oxen and plough teams , property values , legal claims , illegal activity and social classes such as freemen , villeins , smallholders , cottagers , slaves , priests and burgesses .
The total value of all property in England in 1086 was calculated at £ 75,000 - which in today 's money would be £ 1 trillion .
The dozen wealthiest individuals were each richer than any later billionaires in English history , with fortunes ranging from the equivalent of £ 56bn to £ 104bn today .
Palmer said : ' No English medieval historian can ignore the book because it 's such an important source for social and economic medieval history .
It 's like a giant skyscraper surrounded by mud huts in terms of significance .
If you want to know how many pigs there were in each county , the Domesday Book is the best record there is of who owned what , right down to people who owned a few shillings .
' Anyone who looks at it is stunned by the speed and coverage : it was completed within a year and Englishmen were generally in awe of it .
All through the Middle Ages it was used as the permanent record : there were all sorts of appeals to it to resolve property disputes . '

In 1997 Wayne Dumond raped a high school cheerleader , who was a distant relative of Bill Clinton .
Before his trial Dumond was assaulted , castrated , and left for dead .
Despite the attack Dumond was sentenced to life plus twenty years .
Huckabee would later claim that Dumond had no prior record , which was either a lie on Huckabee 's part or demonstrates how little Huckabee knew about the case .
Dumond had become the darling for some Christian radio celebrities who are close to Huckabee .
It may be that public pressure that caused Democratic governor Jim Guy Tucker commute Dumond 's sentence to 39 years , which was a real gift .
But that commutation that was n't good enough for the new Governor Huckabee .
Initially Huckabee considered a pardon , but public outcry and the victim 's outrage was such that Huckabee withdrew that plan .
Instead he lobbied the parole board to release Dumond , although he was n't to be considered for such a release for years .
The parole board is appointed by the governor , almost all admit that they took the extraordinary step to benefit Dumond because Huckabee pressured them to do it , but Huckabee lies about his role .
From the link above :
Only six weeks after Dumond moved to Missouri , Carol Sue Shields , of Parkville , Mo. , was found murdered in a friend ’s home .
She had been sexually assaulted and suffocated .
In late June 2001 , Missouri authorities charged Dumond with the first - degree murder of Shields .
The Clay County , Mo. , prosecutor ’s office asserted that skin found under Shield ’s fingernails , the result of an apparent struggle with her murderer , contained DNA that matched Dumond ’s .
Missouri authorities also say that Dumond is the leading suspect in the rape and murder of a second woman , Sara Andrasek , of Platte County , Mo. , though he has not yet been charged with that crime .
Andrasek was 23 .
Like Shields , Andrasek had her brassiere cut from her body ; Dumond cut Stevens ’ bra off before he raped her .
" It ’s as if he wanted to leave us his calling card , " a Missouri law enforcement officer said .
These stories a just the tip of the Huckabee iceberg .
Although this is about his family , it is sufficiently creepy to be included anyway .
David Huckabee , while his father was governor , was kicked out of Boy Scout camp when he and a buddy caputred a stray dog , hanged it from a tree , then tortured it to death .
That same son was recently arrested at the airport in Little Rock when he attempted to carry a gun and ammunition onto a plane .
This could go on forever , there is quite a bit more for those interested .
Google " Huckabee gifts " " Huckabee ethics complaints , " " Huckabee light fixtures , " " Huckabee office furniture , " " and " Huckabee gift registry " for more .
The point is the man is as crooked as a dog 's hind leg .
The bottom line is that Huckabee is a temperamental , lying , crook , who may sincerely feel a Christian obligation to help the poor .
Investigators say the tainted Maxtor portable hard disc , made by Seagate , uploads information saved on the computer automatically to Web sites in Beijing
A shipment of Maxtor external HDDs , produced in Thailand by US - based Seagate and sold in Taiwan , has been found to be infected with Autorun trojans designed to gather sensitive data from machines connected to the storage devices .
According to local reports , the Taiwanese government suspects Chinese involvement , as the devices are commonly used in government operations to provide data storage .
Large amounts of sensitive government data are thought to have been harvested and passed on to web - sites based in China .
Following findings by the Investigation Bureau that portable hard discs produced by US hard drive manufacturer Seagate Technology that were sold in Taiwan contained Trojan horse viruses , further investigations suggested that “ contamination ” took place when the products were in the hands of Chinese subcontractors during the manufacturing process .
On Saturday , Seagate Technology LLC , the manufacturer of the Maxtor portable hard drive , said on its Web site ( www.seagate.com) that Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 hard drives sold after August could be infected with the virus .
Anti-virus software manufacturer Kaspersky Labs also issued a similar warning .
The hard drive has been temporarily pulled off the shelves and is no longer available for purchase …

Both Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton expressed anger after it was revealed this month that the tapes had been destroyed .
However , the report by Mr. Zelikow gives them new evidence to buttress their views about the C.I.A. ’s actions and is likely to put new pressure on the Bush administration over its handling of the matter .
Mr. Zelikow served as counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice from 2005 to the end of 2006 .
In an interview on Friday , Mr. McLaughlin said that agency officials had always been candid with the commission , and that information from the C.I.A. proved central to their work .
“ We were n’t playing games with them , and we were n’t holding anything back , ” he said .
The memorandum recounts a December 2003 meeting between Mr. Kean , Mr. Hamilton and George J. Tenet , then the director of central intelligence .
At the meeting , it says , Mr. Hamilton told Mr. Tenet that the C.I.A. should provide all relevant documents “ even if the commission had not specifically asked for them . ”
According to the memorandum , Mr. Tenet responded by alluding to several documents that he thought would be helpful to the commission , but made no mention of existing videotapes of interrogations .
The memorandum does not draw any conclusions about whether the withholding of the videotapes was unlawful , but it notes that federal law penalizes anyone who “ knowingly and willfully ” withholds or “ covers up ” a “ material fact ” from a federal inquiry or makes “ any materially false statement ” to investigators .
Mark Mansfield , the C.I.A. spokesman , said that the agency had gone to “ great lengths ” to meet the commission ’s requests , and that commission members had been provided with detailed information obtained from interrogations of agency detainees .
“ Because it was thought the commission could ask about the tapes at some point , they were not destroyed while the commission was active , ” Mr. Mansfield said .
Much of Australia is suffering the worst drought in living memory
Though located in a remote corner of the planet , the fields of Australia 's food bowl are central to the worldwide price of wheat .
In this part of rural New South Wales , water - starved farms and cavernous empty grain silos have the potential to create a ripple effect which spreads around the globe .
And that is precisely what is happening right now .
Low yield
After America , Australia is normally the second largest exporter of grain , and in a good year it would hope to harvest about 25 million tonnes .
But the country remains in the grip of the worst drought in a century , which is why the 2006 crop yielded only 9.8 m tonnes .
Global wheat stocks are at their lowest levels since 1979 , and the ongoing Australian drought is one of the reasons why .
To get a sense of the scale of the problem , I visited the Tottenham , a small agriculture community in rural New South Wales about a five - hour drive from Sydney , which is home to a massive grain storage complex .
Its most impressive silo looks like a space - age dome and has an interior the size of a medieval cathedral .
Now it feels like a giant echo chamber .
Almost empty
Normally at this time of the year it would be half - full of grain , much of it waiting for export .
But now it is virtually empty .
Many farmers have experienced their second failed crop in a row
The grain scattered on its floor would not even fill a single bag .
There is a bunker outside which is the size of two football fields , which boasts an even larger capacity .
Again , it is only a tenth full .
It provides a vivid snapshot of the problem confronting Australian farmers and their customers around the world .
At the very moment when the emerging giants , India and China , are looking to this part of the world to satisfy their food needs , the Australian food bowl is unable to deliver .
Losing money
George Grieg has been farming the land near Tottenham for nearly 50 years , and has rarely known it so bad .
Last year 's crop amounted to a third of his normal harvest .
The year before was even worse - a sixth .
For the past two years he has not even managed to recoup the costs of planting and nurturing his acreage .
The sums simply do not add up , and many farmers are being forced into greater debt at a time when interest rates in Australia are at a 12 - year high .
At least a wet southern summer has given them hope of a better crop this time round .
Selling the farm
And given that global wheat prices are so high , it is tempting for farmers to borrow more in their hope that their gamble pays off with a bumper harvest .
" It really is back to the bank manager , " says George , explaining how that conversation will now go : " ' OK , this is THE crop .
Everyone is talking it up .
Let 's have a go at it . '
" But it 's borrowed money that 's doing it .
And if it does n't come off and there are too many more [ poor years ] , then you have to sell the farm . "
But who is going to buy the farms ?
" There are already two or three farms in the district which are up for sale and should have been sold .
But people just do n't have the money to buy them , " explains George .
With global wheat prices at record highs , one bumper crop would alleviate much of the financial burden and help many local farmers pay off their debts .
But their hopes have been dashed before .
Last year saw one of the best starts to a growing season for years , but dry weather in recent weeks has forced the Australian government to slash its crop forecasts by 30 % .
The Famine in Ukraine : 1932 - 1933
Ukrainian communities around the world are campaigning for global recognition of a horror that killed an estimated seven to 10 million Ukrainians during the Holodomor , the devastating famine that swept the nation during 1931 - 1932 as a direct result of Stalin 's collectivisation and the Soviet Union 's determination to wipe out Ukrainian nationalism .
The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in the release of previously top secret archives on the great horror .
On the 75th anniversary of the famine , Ukrainians want the world to know what happened .
The deep seas are often considered to be the last great , unexplored regions on Earth .
Every year hundreds of hitherto unknown creatures are discovered ranging from tiny crustaceans to monster fish , and hundreds , even thousands , remain hidden awaiting our cameras .
Here are 15 of the most unusual deep water denizens .
15 . Ocean Sunfish
The ocean sunfish ( Mola mola ) is the heaviest bony fish in the world , with an average weight of 1000 kilograms .
The species is native to tropical and temperate waters around the globe .
14 . Megamouth Shark
This shark is an extremely rare and unusual species of deep water shark .
Discovered in 1976 , only a few have ever been seen , with 39 specimens known to have been caught or sighted as of 2007 and three recordings on film .
Like the basking shark and whale shark , it is a filter feeder , and swims with its enormous mouth wide open , filtering water for plankton and jellyfish .
13 . Chimaera
This strange cartilaginous fish uses its long snout to scan over the sea floor for the electrical impulses of its prey that bury in the muddy sea floor , just like a metal detector .
12 . Fangtooth
This fish , also called an ogrefish , while understandably named for their disproportionately large , fang - like teeth and unapproachable visage , are actually quite small and harmless to humans : the larger of the two species , the common fangtooth , reaches a maximum length of just 16 centimetres ( 6 inches ) ; the shortthorn fangooth is about half this size .
11 . Pelican Eel
The pelican eel ’s most notable feature is its enormous mouth , much larger than its body .
The mouth is loosely - hinged , and can be opened wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than itself .
The pouch - like lower jaw resembles that of a pelican , hence its name .
10 . Blue - Ringed Octopus
The blue - ringed octopus is the size of a golf ball , but its venom is powerful enough to kill humans .
There is no known antidote .
9. Viperfish
With a fearsome grin fit for a movie monster , the viperfish is a real - life predator that lurks in one of the world ’s most remote locations .
8. Grenadiers
This large species has a rounded head and a mouth which faces forward to catch squid and fish that swim up off the sea floor .
As in most other rattails , the males of this species have a special drum machine on their swim bladder that is used to attract females .
7. Vampire Squid
The Vampire Squid is covered entirely in light - producing organs called photophores .
The animal has great control over the organs , capable of producing disorienting flashes of light for fractions of a second to several minutes in duration .
6. Glass Squid
With its polka - dot mantle and wide - eyed expression , this glass creature represents a lighter side of the inky ocean deep .
5. Giant Squid
The elusive giant squid , known to science as Architeuthis dux , is one of the world ’s largest animals , reaching a length of up to 60 feet .
It is the largest known invertebrate in the world .
4. Giant Isopod
These creatures are thought to be abundant in cold , deep waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean .
3. Football Fish
The species holds pride of place as the first deep - sea angler ever found .
The original specimen washed ashore in Greenland in 1833 ; at 22 inches long , it is still the largest one on record .
Since no females of this species have ever been found bearing parasitic males , biologists assume they are fertilized by free - swimming mates .
2. Pacific Blackdragon
Female blackdragons are about two feet ( 61 cm ) long and have fanglike teeth and a long chin whisker .
The males are small , about three inches ( 8 cm ) in length , and brownish in color .
They have no teeth , no chin barbel and no stomach .
Unable to eat , the male lives only long enough to mate .
1. Amphipod
The unusual animal , called Phronima , an Amphipod , is one of the many strange species recently found on an expedition to a deep - sea mountain range in the North Atlantic .
Frequently in life , the simplest and most obvious things get the job done , but we get caught up in meaningless complexities which do n't only solve the problem , they PERPETUATE the problem .
Bush 's Oils Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ( and next Iran ? ) are problems which must be solved since they are murdering millions ( yes , millions ) of innocent people and will inevitably lead to WW3 .
The expense of these Oil Wars , plus astronomical tax breaks for America 's Greek God like elites are bankrupting our country ( they 're certainly bankrupting all the rest of us poor slobs ) and bleeding away funding for education , science , retirements , national infrastructure maintenance & repair , health care , and much more .
Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reed have turned out to be virtual Republican moles since anything that microscopically resembles liberal / progressive values gets buried alive by these two traitors in a heartbeat .
We could go on and on , but the DLC Hillary Clinton / Bush Doll is now the front running Democratic ( whatever that means ) candidate , but of all the dem candidate , she is the closest to being a literal clone of George W. Bush .
Plus , even Bill Clinton keeps following the money and has spent considerable time and energy sucking up to Daddy Bush .
Lastly , the neocon lobby ( which has NEVER lobbied for the well being and national security of the United States of America ) , has totally high jacked American foreign and domestic policy , so the " land of the free and the home of the brave " has been reduced to a tail wagged this profoundly un American cabal .
But this depressing list is something practically all Americans ( dems , pug , and independents included ) are well familiar with .
Said differently , the conflict is not between Republican and Democrats ( our ONE party dem / pug system ) , but between a significant majority of American citizens and the Washington trash ( on BOTH sides of the aisle ) that is giving away the farm of our Constitutional Republic to Nazi - like fascists and 70 IQ religious fanatics who think the world is going to go Armageddon " boom " in the next week or two -- yeah , the rest of the planet is really worried about that , are n't they ?
And behind it all ( as it was in the beginning , is now , and ever shall be ? ) are the vampire elites .
The sad , brutal truth is that the United States of America is a Dictatorship of the Rich abjectly controlled by the 1 % or less of international elites .
This planetary " secret society " of elites are the literal gods and goddesses of planet Earth and NOTHING protects and perpetuates them more than the " game of politics " .

Less than a year ago it was a struggle to keep up with the Joneses .
Now the Joneses are not spending .
The new struggle is to keep down with the Joneses .
This theme is discussed in Consumers cut back on small pleasures .
Such small luxuries seemed almost necessities in happier economic times .
But no more for lots of folks , including those and other USA TODAY readers who described how they 've changed their habits .
The murky financial outlook and recession fears are factors .
Another driver : fear of being out of step with a cultural mind - set that increasingly says less is more .
If your best friend and next - door neighbors are cutting back on little luxuries , should n't you be , too ?
" For years , we had the opposite .
It was all about keeping up with the Joneses .
Now , the Joneses are starting to cut back , " says Ellie Kay , author of 12 personal finance books .
" There 's a sense that prices are rising — and will continue to rise — but wages will not , " says Ken Goldstein , economist at The Conference Board .
" This is squeezing household budgets whether they 're $ 200 per week or $ 200,000 per year .
Folks are looking closely at anything they do n't have to purchase now . "
" The new status is n't how much you 've got , but your ability to show what you do n't spend , " says futurist Watts Wacker , who advises businesses on trends .
" This is a seminal moment .
It 's not a fad that will die out when the economy picks up . "
Trends guru Faith Popcorn puts it this way : " It 's cooler not to spend . "
Borrowers Abandon Mortgages
As home prices plummet , growing numbers of borrowers are winding up owing more on their homes than the homes are worth , raising concerns that a new group of homeowners -- those who can afford to pay their mortgages but have decided not to -- are starting to walk away from their homes .
In the Phoenix area , where home prices were off 15 % in the fourth - quarter when compared with a year ago , accountant Steven Ulrich says several of his clients have recently said they plan to walk away .
One client 's home is now worth $ 100,000 less than the mortgage and the other is $ 60,000 underwater .
" It surprised me , " said Mr. Ulrich , who works at The Focus Group in Scottsdale .
" I 'd never had people doing that before , if they had to it was something they were forced into .
But these people are choosing it as a strategy , and I think it 's going to be happening a lot more . "
Some financial advisers are even encouraging homeowners who are upside down to consider foreclosure , which they see as a purely financial decision with limited negative consequences .
YouWalkAway.com , a Web site started in January that offers foreclosure counseling to homeowners , advises that borrowers who default on one mortgage can typically get another mortgage between two and four years after a foreclosure .
Then , " before you know it , you will have this behind you and a fresh start ! " the site says .
Facing Default , Some Walk Out on New Homes
When Raymond Zulueta went into default on his mortgage last year , he did what a lot of people do .
He worried .
“ I was terrified , ” said Mr. Zulueta , who services automated teller machines for an armored car company in the San Francisco area .
Then in January he learned about a new company in San Diego called You Walk Away that does just what its name says .
For $ 995 , it helps people walk away from their homes , ceding them to the banks in foreclosure .
Last week he moved into a three - bedroom rental home for $ 1,200 a month , less than half the cost of his mortgage .
The old house is now the lender ’s problem .
“ They took the negativity out of my life , ” Mr. Zulueta said of You Walk Away .
“ I was stressing over nothing . ”
In recent months top executives from Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase and Wachovia have all described a new willingness by borrowers to walk away from mortgages .
Carrie Newhouse , a real estate agent who also works as a loss mitigation consultant for mortgage lenders in Minneapolis - St.
Paul , said she saw many homeowners who looked at foreclosure as a first option , preferable to dealing with their lender .
“ I ’ve had people say to me , ‘ My house is n’t worth what I owe , why should I continue to make payments on it ? ’ ” Mrs. Newhouse said .
The same sorts of loans that drove the real estate boom now change the nature of foreclosure , giving borrowers incentives to walk away , said Todd Sinai , an associate professor of real estate at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania .
“ There ’s a whole lot of people who would ’ve been stuck as renters without these exotic loan products , ” Professor Sinai said .
“ Now it ’s like they can do their renting from the bank , and if house values go up , they become the owner .
If they go down , you have the choice to give the house back to the bank .
You are n’t any worse off than renting , and you got a chance to do extremely well .
If it ’s heads I win , tails the bank loses , it ’s worth the gamble . ”

Hoffman : Pursuing perfect phony name in Little League Pursuing the perfect phony name
It 's getting harder to find a good , funny , phony - baloney company .
Part of the job of being a Little League manager is lassoing a sponsor for your team .
Player registration fees cover only a portion of the cost of Little League .
That 's where sponsors step in and make up the difference .
In return , the players wear the sponsor 's name on the backs of their jerseys .
It 's like having 12 pint - size , base - stealing billboards running around the neighborhood .
It 's good advertising .
Such good advertising that sometimes companies have to flip a coin to see who gets to sponsor a certain team .
Four years ago , I found a very strange sponsor .
The company agreed to subsidize my team — on one condition .
We do n't wear the company 's name on our jerseys .
I do n't ask .
I do n't question .
I 'm good with this arrangement .

The sponsor told me , " Make up a phony company , do whatever you want , just do n't use our name . "
That 's what I did .
Three years ago , I put Vandelay Industries — the import - export latex business from Seinfeld — on our uniforms .
Everybody in the Seinfeld generation loved that jersey .
I could have sold merchandise on the side .
The following year , I submitted the Acme Invisible Paint Co. from Roadrunner cartoons .
Another classic , although this one took some explaining to people .
If you have to explain 'em , maybe they 're not so funny .
Kids and grown - ups do n't laugh at the same stuff .
Last year , my team was sponsored by the Krusty Krab , the undersea snack bar from SpongeBob SquarePants .
The players picked it .
Frankly , I was n't crazy about the Krab .
Like Larry Dierker when he managed the Astros , I let the players run the clubhouse .
That was then ... now baseball season is around the corner .
Tryouts are this week .
I need to pick another fake company fast .
My first thought was the Bada Bing go - go joint from The Sopranos .
That 's the nightclub where Tony Soprano and his mob buddies plot their little escapades .
Bada
Bing would be very funny .
Oops , scratch the Bing .
While the gang is back planning who gets whacked , there 's naughty dancing out front .
Little League would not approve .
In the past , I 've thought about the Daily Planet , the paper that Superman worked for .
It 's too close to home .
I could do another Seinfeld reference — Monk 's Diner or Top of the Muffin or Kruger Industrial Smoothing .
I like Serenity Now , too .
I 'm going to start screaming that during games .
Or H&H Bagels , Mendy's , the New York Yankees or J. Peterman — except those are real businesses .
I 'd be sniffing a lawsuit .
Anyway , enough Seinfeld .
I need to move on with my life .
Arnold 's Drive - In from Happy Days ?
Nah , old reference lost on young viewers .
I know ...
Dewey , Cheatem and Howe , the law firm from The Three Stooges .
Nope , wrong message for the kids .
Besides , half the teams in my Little League are sponsored by lawyers , and how would anybody tell the difference ?
The Korova Milkbar from A Clockwork Orange is too hip for the room .
Besides , now it 's a real place .
That happens a lot to fake companies in movies .
Dunder Mifflin from The Office ?
It 's too soon .
Wally World from National Lampoon 's Vacation !
Everybody loves that movie .
That 's the leader in the clubhouse now .
WJM - TV in Minneapolis ( The Mary Tyler Moore Show ) or WKRP in Cincinnati ?
The shows have n't held up well .
Besides , half the people who work for real television and radio stations in Houston are loopier than those characters .
A few people have suggested Moe 's Tavern from The Simpsons .
Ca n't do anything alcohol - related .
The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , also from The Simpsons , might start a political debate .
Not the time or place .

by Hugh Fitzgerald ( Feb. 2008 )
I t is no mystery as to why Christian missionaries might be having their greatest success in the Kabyle .
In Algeria , that remains the Berber heartland .
It is where the Berbers are concentrated , that is those who were not forcibly transformed , during the centuries of Arab rule ( interrupted by 132 years of French rule ) into " Arabs . "
( How many of those " Arabs " who now persecute the Berbers realize that they themselves are a generation , or two , or five removed from their clearly Berber origins ? )
The cause of the Berbers is hardly known in this country .
The writer Kateb Yacine , a Berber who refused to write in Arabic , but chose French , is celebrated in France , especially among Berbers -- but unknown in this country , and his anti-Arab rage is not likely to cause his books to be included in the syllabuses of courses on " Francophone " literature given that so many such courses are now taught by French - speaking Arabs .
What is that cause ?
In the first place , it is linguistic and cultural .
In Algeria , where the French rightly saw the Berbers as superior to the Arabs -- one French general wrote a book about the " Europeanness " of the Berbers -- the Berbers were not discriminated against , but as soon as the French left , the forced arabisation of the Berbers started up at once , as if the French interregnum , with the wider possibilities that French education made possible to both Berbers and Arabs , had never existed .
Older people in Algeria speak and use French ; the younger ones are forgetting .
And meanwhile , the Berbers were forbidden to use their own language , Tamazight , in their schools or in their institutions , and even , at times , they could be punished for using it among themselves , on the street .
Berber culture was officially ignored .
About twenty years ago , news of agitation began to reach the outside world .
There were riots in Tizi -Ouzou that were reported in France , but hardly anywhere else in the Western world .
In America , of course , we had all been sufficiently subject to ARAMCO propaganda ( performed as a " public service " by the big oil companies , as part of their propaganda payoff to the Saudis for allowing them to find , produce , and then pay exorbitantly for the oil that happens to lie under the malevolent sands of " Saudi " Arabia ) , to believe that there is something called " the Arab world " and in this " Arab world " there are no Copts , no Armenians , no Assyrians , no Chaldeans , no Turkmen , no Mandeans , no Maronites , and of course no Berbers , no Jews ( no , there never were any Jews in North Africa or the Middle East -- they all came to Israel , you see , from Europe ) , for everyone in the Arab world was an " Arab . "
The discovery or re-discovery of a Berber identity ( and how many of those North African " Arabs " should begin to realize that they are Berbers ? ) is or could be an important weapon in unsettling the world of Islam , and perhaps causing the Maghreb to see itself , as it should not as " Arab " but as the victim of Arab imperialism .
For what is Islam if not a vehicle of Arab imperialism , and what are the Berbers , if not the victims of that Arab imperialism , an imperialism far more potent and long - lasting than the European kind , for it attempts to efface the historic identity of whole peoples ?
And it makes perfect sense that Berbers in the Kabyle would , having felt along their pulses the Arab imperialism of which Islam is the vehicle , would be more open to the efforts of Christian missionaries , or more likely , are not so much responding to missionary activity , but to their own observations as to what Christianity is like , and what Islam has brought them .
In this respect , one should not underestimate the fact that Berbers now live in France , that they make up most of the membership of such groups as the " maghrebins laiques , " and that they , not the Arabs whose ethnic identity is so bound up with Islam , are capable , in some cases , not of identifying with the Arabs , but more closely with the French .
And those Berbers communicate with Berbers at home , or through the Internet .
And sometimes they return , to Algeria and Morocco , to see their families , and bring with them their own observations on the relative merits of the Islamic world , a world suffused with Islam , and the non-Islamic world , the one they have experienced in France .
The more the non-Arab Muslims of the world , and 80 % of the world 's Muslims are not Arab , come to realize -- and it would not be hard to help them to realize , for they will not be able to deny the facts , having experienced so much of it themselves -- that Islam is a vehicle for that Arab supremacism , the more likely it is that at least some of them will fall away .
And others , who may stick with a kind of " non-Arab " Islam ( as if such were possible ) will , in so doing , at least help to divide , and therefore to weaken , the Camp of Islam .
Ideally , one would wish this Total System , that has held so many hundreds of millions in thrall , and thwarted over so many centuries so much human potential ( think of the art , think of the science , that might have resulted in the absence of the dead hand of Islam on so many people , prevented from so many forms of artistic expression , so many avenues for free and skeptical inquiry that are necessary for the enterprise of science , so much dull fanaticism , so much boredom , so much violence , in posse and in esse ) will be seen , by Berbers , by Kurds , by people in the subcontinent ( why should Muslims in India not " rediscover " their own history , their Hindu , or Buddhist , or other non-Muslim roots ? ) , by those in Malaysia and the East Indies , with its rich pre-Islamic , Hindu and Buddhist past ?
Meanwhile , start reading those Berber sites .
And hope that the French state , instead of Sarkozy 's folly of " integrating " its Muslims by government - supported mosques , will try to work on the Berbers , work to make them see the light , work to help them to achieve their own destiny , one different from , and superior to , that of the Arabs whose method of domination comes from , is supplied by , Islam , Islam , Islam .
We should help those in North Africa ( and in France ) who know , are well aware , of their Berber identity .
And they will point out , in the ways that they think most effective , that many of those " Arabs " are in fact one or two or five generations away from being Berbers .
DNA is coming to the rescue .
There is a genetic marker that , in studies by French geneticists in Tunisia , shows that Berbers and Arabs can be easily distinguished .
Some who proudly identify themselves as " Arabs " will resist .
But others may listen .
And as they recognize the violence , the " culture of death " of Islam , as in Algeria , perhaps those who wish to make a break from Islam , and recognize that such a break is hardest of all for Arabs , and that another identity needs to be accepted , invented , believed in , will manage to discover , and embrace , their Berber " roots . "
It seems fanciful , just as it seems fanciful that Iranians , those who are not merely disgusted with the mullahs running things , but are coming to be disgusted with Islam -- that " gift of the Arabs " --- itself , may wish to rediscover Zoroastrianism .
Not because of any particular wonderfulness in what Zoroastrianism has to offer , but simply because it offers another identity ( see Bernard Lewis 's excellent " The Multiple Identities of the Middle East " ) , in a part of the world , and among people , who believe that " everyone simply has to be something . "
And that " something " cannot be , as it is in the advanced West , a collection of ideas or ideals -- as an American might define himself as loyal to the American Constitution , and wishing to defend the political and legal institutions of this country , fortunately fashioned by an inimitable group of geniuses , and fortunately , not yet made complete hash even by those who embody the degradation of the democratic dogma .
Many Frenchmen wrote about the differences they perceived between Arabs and Berbers .
French photographers routinely took pictures of Berbers in their Berber dress ; the Arabs were much less willing .
French military men wrote about the Berbers as " un peuple europeen . "
Some Berbers came not to resist their definition as " Arabs " the way some Copts and Maronites have had a false " Arab identity " pushed on them , or have semi-accepted it , an " identity " constructed out of nothing more than the fact that they are speakers , " users , " of Arabic , and may have Arabic names forced on them over time .
Indeed , there are differences between Arabs who have become Christians ( as a few did in the 19th and early 20th centuries ) and those Arabic - using Christians -- Maronites , Copts , Assyrians , Chaldeans -- who are not Arabs , but some of whom have , in order to survive in an ever - threatening Muslim sea , had to find their role as " Arabs " or even , in the manner of the Christian Syrian Michel Aflaq ( one of the founders of Ba'athism ) , hyper - Arabs , as promoters of an Arab identity , pan-Arabism , the whole works -- as an alternative to Islam ( they were fooling themselves , because pan-Arabism for Muslim Arabs was never a real alternative to Islam , but merely a temporary goal , a subset , of the goal of a reunified Muslim world ) .
Not every ill that befell the non-Muslims in the Muslim world , or non-Arabs in the Muslim Arab world , can be attributed to colonial powers .
There were French then , during the time of the " presence francaise " that brought schools , hospitals , modern agriculture , and other elements of modern civilization , to North Africa ( in Morocco and Tunisia , over about half - a- century ; in Algeria , over a 132 - year period ) who were quite capable of distinguishing Berbers from Arabs , and it was not their pressure that caused some Berbers to forget their own identity , any more than it was France as the guarantor of the Christians in Lebanon and Syria who caused some to make themselves hyper -Arabs .
Aflaq founded the Ba'ath party with two associates not when the French seemed to be there to stay , but when it was clear that they would , in a few years , be leaving .
Aflaq 's " Ba'athism " came to dominate only two countries , and for two similar reasons .
The first was Syria , with a large Christian population , and with a powerful military caste , the Alawites , who were not regarded as orthodox Muslims , were indeed disliked by orthodox Muslims for the obvious elements of syncretism in their worship ( go to an Alawite village and see the pictures of Mary everywhere ) , Alawites who had been miserable under the Turkish rule but under that of the French formed part of the Troupes speciales , and were trained to fight , and when the French left , the Alawites remained in the army , and the air force ( Hafez al - Assad ) and gradually took over , in the way that people or groups always take over in the Muslim Middle East -- through the application , or threat , of military force .
In Syria Ba'athism disguises , is the facade , for the rule by the Alawites .
In Iraq , Ba'athism took a different turn .
There , the Sunnis knew that they were numerically far inferior to the Shi'a , but they were put in control of modern Iraq , by the British , and never lost their grip .
The Hashemite king , Feisal a Sunni , was put in control of Iraq , and aided throughout the 1920s by British troops , and such British civilians as the celebrated Gertrude Bell , until finally , the expense of suppressing the tribes , and the obvious hopelessness of it all , caused the British to leave .
It was Winston Churchill who described Mesopotamia ( Iraq ) as an " ungrateful volcano . "
And when the British left , the local Arabs solemnly promised not to harm the local Christians , and five months after the last British troops pulled out , Muslim Arabs killed up to 100,000 largely helpless Assyrians .
( William Saroyan wrote a book about it ) .
Everywhere Muslims spreading Islam are careful to present it as the vehicle for whatever grievance the potential local converts may have .
If it is black prisoners in the United States , then Islam is presented as the vehicle both of " social justice " ( see how Muslim ruling classes everywhere seize the national wealth , see how the poor are treated in Muslim countries ) , and against " racism . ”
And the Infidels do little or nothing .
Have you seen any campaigns of deliberate counter - Da’wa anywhere in the prisons or elsewhere ?
It would be easy to show , and to keep showing , perhaps by organizing the “ Lost Boys ” of the Sudan , that anti-black racism , of the purest and most virulent kind , is found among the Arabs .
Anyone who has studied in an Arab country returns amazed at what is said , and not a few are shaken .
Anyone who looks into the history of African slavery soon discovers that the Arab slave trade began earlier , and ended later , than that of the Europeans – or rather , ended formally later , but actually continues , in several countries , to this day .
Why is this not screamed from every housetop ?
Why have the countries of the advanced world , that have poured $ 400 billion into aid to black Africa , not tried to halt the spread of the most retrograde force , a force which encourages the habit of mental submission , and which , in its inshallah - fatalism , is in fact fatal to economic development , not tried to stop the spread of Islam ?
If they have the wellbeing of black Africans at heart , they must begin to understand , and to share their understanding , that Islam has been , is , and always will be , a force that hinders , with that inshallah - fatalism and that habit of mental submission , any possibility of either economic or intellectual development .
The evidence is there .
What sustained the Muslims for centuries , at a low level , was simply the accumulated intellectual capital of those peoples whom they conquered , and slowly leached of life , and of property as well .
Now North Africa and the Middle East are virtually without the non-Muslims who once provided a certain supply of Jizyah , and what sustains the Arabs and Muslims are two things , and only two things ; the new disguised Jizyah of Western foreign aid ( which should be ended , and used to meet the new expenses of monitoring Muslim populations in the West ) , and the manna of oil wealth , entirely undeserved , and the only conceivable way that the Arabs and Muslims might acquire great wealth – through an accident of geology .
Are the peoples of black Africa misled into thinking that they , too , somehow share in that wealth ?
There was a very large and intelligent , because it focused on small - scale , doable projects , aid effort by Israel in black Africa .
It was the most successful of all such foreign aid efforts .
It was widespread .
It was widely welcomed .
But it came to an end , after the Six - Day War , under Arab pressure , and bribery – the same bribery that caused several dozen African states , under Arab command , to break diplomatic relations with Israel .
Some of those African states no doubt thought that the Arabs would share just a little of that vast unearned wealth – if only to replace what Israel , a tiny country , had so remarkably provided .
It was not to be .
It will never be .
The Arabs are trying in Africa to dominate the Continent .
They are patient .
They are methodical .
In West Africa , where Islam is already dominant , as in uranium - rich Niger , they have transformed the easygoing , syncretistic practice of Islam to something much more akin to what can be seen in Saudi Arabia .
And everywhere mosques are becoming subject to the strictures of those who pay for them , or pay the imams – and that usually means the Saudis .
In some countries that once had a clear Christian majority , such as the Ivory Coast , the Christians are feeling besieged by Muslims who come in from the north , and the French government under Chirac supported not the local black Christians , and understood their fear , but rather attempted to appease the world ’s Muslims .
In East Africa , when the black Africans rose up against their Arab masters in Zanzibar and Pemba some decades ago ( the slave trade by the Arabs in East Africa had been centered there – indeed , the Sultan of Muscat and Oman had for a time ruled directly from Zanzibar ) , little was made of this in the West .
No one discussed the long history of the Arab slave trade , with its practice of castrating black children when they were first caught , and then taking them by slave coffle or dhow to the slave markets of Islam , a trip which about 10 % survived ( see “ The Hideous Trade ” by Jan Hogedorn ) .
And so the Arabs have continued their march southward .
The Sudan had very few Arabs in the southern part one hundred years ago .
But steadily they have taken territory , pushed back , killed , black Africans .
1.8 million non-Muslim blacks were killed , or deliberately starved to death , in the southern Sudan in the last two decades .
Not content with that , not content with having seized complete control of the oil wealth that lies under the Christian and animist areas of the artificial state of Sudan , the Arabs are now trying to seize , by mass murder , the lands as well of the Muslim , but non -“ Arab ” blacks of Darfur .
The campaign of mass rape , destruction of property , and killing of every man , woman and child they can get their hands on has been reported and reported , and reported .
It has been reported without any understanding of Islam as a vehicle for Arab supremacism ( the nicholas - kristofs of this world do not bother to figure out what is going on , what ideology prompts the Janjaweed and the Sudanese government that supports it , or the other Arab and Muslim governments that run interference for that Sudanese government ) , but are content with writing endless columns of easy anguish .
Egypt supports the Sudanese , while pretending not to , and so does the Arab League which welcomes the reduction , in the southern Sudan and from Darfur , of non-Arabs and non-Muslims to a state of hopelessness and surrender , where they continue to live at all .
For Egypt and the Arabs have their eyes not merely on the Sudan , but on Ethiopia , the famous Christian kingdom , now rapidly becoming Islamized .
Egypt has no intention of letting the Christian government of Ethiopia help its own people by , at long last , diverting some of the headwaters of the Nile for irrigation .
The Egyptians think the Nile belongs , from its very source onward , to them and only to them .
The water wars have been declared – but only by the Arab side .
Americans and other Infidel peoples should be supporting Ethiopian efforts to halt the spread of Islam , or of the purest kind of Islam , whether in Somalia or in Ethiopia itself , and to help Ethiopia remain a Christian kingdom that can help prevent the takeover of southern East Africa by Islam .
Muslims owe their loyalty to the umma al - islamiyya , to fellow Muslims .
It would make sense , in Africa , for the Americans not only to have handfuls of advisors and troops here and there , but to engage in propaganda .
This propaganda , which happens to be the truth simply megaphoned to make a point , should describe in vivid detail the history of the Arab slave trade .
It should explain to Africans that slavery is permanently sanctioned by both Qur’an and Sunnah , and can therefore never , within Islam , be banished .
It should detail the continuing racism of the Arabs .
And it should show how Islam stands in the way of economic and other kinds of development in two ways : in the encouragement of the habit of mental submission , central to Islam , and in the inshallah - fatalism that limits economic activity , and how Islam has relied on two kinds of manna : the Jizyah that is demanded from , or voluntarily supplied by , non-Muslims , and the oil wealth that has resulted from an accident of geology .
And despite the ten trillion dollars that the Arab and Muslim states have received from oil revenues since 1973 , not a single one has managed to create a real economy , not a single one has ceased to be hopelessly dependent on oil .
Islam , as it spreads , will merely guarantee that the countries and peoples of sub-Saharan Africa will be forced to endure the political , economic , social , moral , and intellectual failures of Muslim states and societies – failures whose source can be found in Islam itself .
Do we wish black Africa well , or ill ?
If we do wish to help the peoples of black Africa , preventing or halting the spread of Islam makes sense .
And it makes sense for us to help the Berbers regain their history , their language and their culture , and it makes sense for us , in other ways , as well .

WASHINGTON  Roger Clemens , in heated and sometimes indignant testimony , told a House oversight committee on Wednesday that his former teammate Andy Pettitte “ misremembers ” two conversations they had about human growth hormone , and that he was shocked to learn later that Mr. Pettitte had used the substance himself .
Mr. Clemens testified that in those conversations with Mr. Pettitte , he was talking about his wife ’s use of H.G.H. one time and on another occasion was referring to something he saw on a television show .
Mr. Clemens sought to rebut Mr. Pettitte ’s sworn and damaging statements to the committee that Mr. Clemens told him point blank that he had used H.G.H .
But Henry A. Waxman , the California Democrat who chairs the committee , clearly did not believe Mr. Clemens , and pointed out that Mr. Pettitte ’s wife , Laura , had also given an affidavit in which she confirmed that her husband told her about his conversation with Mr. Clemens shortly after it took place .
The account is crucial because Mr. Clemens , one of the most dominant pitchers of his era , gave a sworn deposition last week and testified under oath today that he never used H.G.H. or steroids .
Another Congressman , Elijah E. Cummings , a Democrat of Maryland , pounded Mr. Clemens over the statements Mr. Pettitte made under oath and impugned his credibility .
Jam reveninte en 1909 , li profitis el sia funkcio de direktoro de la 5 - a UK en Barcelono , por konigi al la tuta mondo la ekziston de la kataluna lingvo kaj de ĝia kulturo .
Lia partopreno kiel soldato en la Unua mondmilito estis volontula , same kiel aliaj katalunaj batalantoj , kvankam li estis rekrutita pro sia franca civitaneco , tamen li partoprenis kun Adrià Gual , en 1914 , en la preparaj laboroj de la 10 - a UK 1914 okazunta en Parizo .
Pujulà esperis ke lia batalo alportos ion al la liberiĝo de la eŭropeaj nacioj .
Li pasigis kvar jarojn en diversaj militfrontoj ĝis li estos malmobilizita de la franca armeo en 1919 .
Inter alie , li estis ano de kompanio de telefonistoj el kiu nur li kaj unu kompano transvivos , kaj li partoprenis en unua vico en korp - al - korpaj bataloj per bajonetoj , kiuj daŭris plurajn tagojn seninterrompe .
La 9 - an de marto li estis akceptita kun granda festo en Hotelode Barcelono .
Sed lia traŭmatiga sperto ĉe la fronto , kaj aliaj personaj konfliktoj , igis lin eliĝi el publika aktivado .
1. ( Pri Io Ajn , 4 aprilo 2019 ) La aŭtoro luktas pri la problemo adekvate difini la ĝenron sciencfikcian .
Li dubemas pri la difino en Vikipedio ; li ŝatas la difinon de Isaac Asimov .
Li mencias la verkonde Mary Shelley , kiun pluraj fakuloj fiksas la unua sciencfikcia verko .
Sed min ne kontentigas la konkludojn de la afiŝisto .
Mi mem traktis ĉi tiun aferon en mia anglalingva podkasto2.de Dirk Bindmann ( Promene , 2 aprilo 2019 ) Bindmann raportas , ke li " legis malnovan libron el 1924:de Immanuel Kant , tradukita de Paul Christaller .
( En 2017 aperis nova eldono de Fonto . )
Krom la tekston de Kant la libro enhavas ankaŭ biografieton de Kant , kiun verkis Theodor Lessing .
Tio estas rimarkinda , ĉar Theodor Lessing en Germanio estis sufiĉe konata filozofo [... ] " .
Menciataj ankaŭ estas la verkoj de Lessing kontraŭ antisemitismo kaj reakcia germana naciismo .
En 1933 Lessing fuĝis al Ĉeĥoslovakio .
Tie Lessing " fariĝis la unua viktimo , kiujn nazioj murdis sur teritorio de Ĉeĥoslovakio " .3. , tradukis Dorothea kaj Hans - Georg Kaiser ( cezartradukoj , 11 aprilo 2019 ) Kaptis mian atenton ĉi tiu bildo de( v. nur maŝintradukitan eron en ) .
Bedaŭrinde , malhoneste ligas Adorno kun Himmler , kaj tiu sencerbulo Kaiser same nek komprenas nek volas kompreni Adorno .
Samspece : Hochhuth same miskomprenigas la ideojn de , ankaŭ .
Oni atentu , ke Hochhuth estas disputata verkisto en Germanio .
( V. anglalingve . )
Apenaŭ ekzistas tekstoj en Esperanto de aŭ pri la Frankfurta Skolo .
Jen , ekzemple , eseo priBedaŭrinde , mankas ankaŭ sufiĉe da inteligentaj esperantistoj kaj tro abundas frenezuloj .
Sed eble tio kio plej alarmigas la sektorojn plej malmodernajn de la ŝtato - tiuj kiuj planas la politikajn kaj sociajn strategiojn - estas ĝuste la profundajn ŝanĝojn kiuj igas Katalunion spaco malpli hispaneca , kvankam ne nepre pli kataluna sed pli globala .
Fakte , tiuj kiuj sin nomas " konstituciistoj " , kiuj rigore dirite estus " unuigistoj " , en la senco ke ili aspiras roli kiel la monarkiaj protestantoj de Ulstero , manifestas profundan timon al kreskanta malgraviĝo en la publika debato kaj al perdo de influpovo ene de la kataluna socio .
Iamaniere , ili estas la pledantoj por " hispana Katalunio " senigita de kiu ajn signo de identeco kiu singularigu ĝin en komparo kun Madrido , Valadolido aŭ Sevilo , submetita al la ekonomiaj interesoj kaj al la kultura konceptiĝo de la hispana ĉefurbo .
Pro tio ilia obsedo kontraŭ la katalunaj lingvo , eduksistemo kaj amaskomunikiloj , krom la profunda minusvalorigo de la parto de Katalunio kiu ne situas for de la metropola areo de Barcelono .
Alivorte , la 117.000 loĝantoj de Katalunio naskiĝintaj en Ekstremaduro kunvivas kun 207.000 katalunoj naskiĝintaj en Maroko .
Laŭ la kontinua censado , estas 1,3 milionoj da loĝantoj naskiĝintaj en Hispanio , fronte al 1,4 milionoj naskiĝintaj eksterlande .
Tio implicas novan reinventadon de la kataluneco , kaj tio generas angoron ĉe kelkaj .
Speciale kiam grava parto de la politikaj gvidantoj de PP kaj C's montras sin malamike kontraŭ migrantoj ( ne la siajn , evidente ) , aŭ en unuigistaj manifestacioj ( al kiuj aliĝas kutime ekstremdekstruloj kiuj ofte agresis homojn afrik- aŭ aziaspektajn ) , la ideo pri iu Katalunio kies hispana distingilo ne malaperu sed mutaciu kaj evoluu pro kontakto kun aliaj kulturoj kaj kosmovidoj ŝajnas al ili herezon .
Ĉar konstateblas ke , tiu ĉi malamo kaj minusvalorigo de la kataluna singulareco , kaŝas iun timon al tio kion oni povus nomi elklasigon .
Ĉar en iu Kataluna Respubliko , ĉu ekstremadurano ne devus havi la samajn rajtojn kaj devojn kiel iu argeliano , iu argentinano aŭ iu ilerdano ?
Tiuj kiuj kredas ke la sola nacio , la hispana , estas la sola ekzistanta , determinita pro sangolinio kaj genealogio ( mi rememorigas ke en Hispanio regas la Ius Sanguinis , dum samtempe mi konas neniun sendependiston kiu ne konsideru grave starigi la Ius Solis ) , tiuj nervoziĝas antaŭ la egaleco kiun ili mem postulas .
Sed ekzistas aliaj faktoroj kiuj same generas angoron .
Mi jam klarigis ke , estas kataluno ĉiu kiu loĝas , laboras ( aŭ ne ) en Katalunio kaj ne estas malamika al ĝi .
Alivorte , estas kataluno ĉiu ajn kiu deziras ĝin esti .
Etna katalunio ne povus progresi .
Laŭ la Instituto pri Statistiko de Katalunio , nur 24 % de la katalunaj loĝantoj havas kvar geavojn naskiĝintaj en Katalunio ( kaj ĉ. 16 % havas " ok katalunajn familinomojn " ) .
Kontraste , laŭ la enketoj , la procento da sendependistoj de la lastaj jaroj moviĝas inter 45 % kaj 55 % , kio supreniras ĝis 60 % se ni kalkulas tiujn naskiĝintaj en Katalunio , kvankam ankaŭ inter la malpliaĝaj ol 40 - jaraj , kaj kreskanta .
Pliaj kuriozaĵoj , 31 % de la sendependistoj havas neniun avon naskiĝinta en Katalunio .
La procento kreskas ju pli la enketitoj difinas sin maldekstremaj aŭ posedas pli altan kulturedukon .
Tio pri la alta kulturnivelo ne signifas iu ajn " komplekson de superuleco " sed ŝuldiĝas al la fakto ke ili ofte estas homoj kiuj plej kontaktis kun la plureco de la lando .
Pro tio , se ne estus pro la fiintencoj de tiuj kiuj klopodas malprestiĝigi la sendependismon kaj la sendependistojn , komparante ilin al rasistoj aŭ supereculoj , la identeco ne rilatas al genealogio , eĉ ne al naskiĝorigino , sed simple al la propra volo , Nul katalunaj familinomoj , kiel en la kazo de la aŭtoro de ĉi artikolo aŭ kiel la kazo de Antonio Baños , aŭ David Fernández , donas al ni plenan liberecon por diri kion ajn ni volas .
Kiu estas kataluno ?
Ni refaru la demandon Kiu estas hispano ?
Preter la administracia dimensio , ĉu estas hispano la brita loĝanto de la Costa del Sol ( suda mediteranea marbordo ) kiu ne parolas kaj ne emas paroli eĉ unu vorton en la hispana , kiu ignoras la najbarojn , kiu vivas en sia propra mondo kaj plendas ke neniu parolas la anglan ?
La respondo estas evidenta .
Ĝuste pro tio , la kataluna identeco , fleksema kaj relativa , estas kontraŭa al esencismo .
Je la fino , la sendependeco rilatas al la dominanta respublikismo de la katalunoj .

Nia mondo vivas revolucion .
Tio estas tiel multe videbla , ke tiu frazo iĝis banalaĵo : tamen , kiel diris la D-rino Finn en la ( bonega ! ) serio The Orville , « banalaĵoj îĝas banaligitaj precize ĉar ili estas sufiĉe adekvataj por elteni senfinan ripeton » ( clichés become clichéd precisely because they 're valid enough to bear endless repetition ) .
Nu , nia mondo vivas revolucion , ĉio ŝanĝas rapidege , kaj Esperanto kaj esperantistoj ankaŭ , malgraŭ la grandega inertoforto kiu ŝajnigas — aŭ ŝajnigis — , ke nia movado estas nemovebla .
Inter la rapide ŝanĝantaj aĵoj , estas nia komunikrimedoj .
Pri tio mi jam sufiĉe longe parolis en mia lasta blogero , do mi ne ripetos tion , kaj simple konsilu al vi legi tiun afiŝon se vi ne iam faris .
Sed en tiu afiŝo , mi volas paroli pri tute alia konsekvenco de tio : la novaj komunikrimedoj estas granda ŝanco por la esperantistoj : mi povas diskuti kun eksterlandanoj facile kaj malmultekoste .
Vi kvazaŭ senpage povas legi tiun afiŝon , kvankam vi loĝas en Strasburgo apud mi , aŭ en Pekino aŭ Vaŝingtono , je la alia flanko de nia mondo .
La esperantistoj jam multe uzas tiujn novajn komunikrimedojn .
La grupo « Esperanto » ĉe Fejsbuko enhavas 21 536 membrojn hodiaŭ , la 21 an de marto 2019 , kaj ekzistas aliaj , por diskuti en Esperanto , sed pri apartaj temoj , el kiuj kelkaj havas pli ol 1000 membrojn , ne nepre ankaŭ membroj de la grupo « Esperanto » .
Multas la Esperantistoj en Twitter , kaj dekoj , se ne centoj , da mesaĝoj estas publikigitaj tie ciutage en nia kara lingvo .
Ĉe Reddit , estas hodiaŭ pli ol 11 500 subskribitoj al la subreddito « r / Esperanto » ( kaj estas ankaŭ aliaj esperantlingvaj subredditoj ) .
Plie , dekoj da « tradiciaj » dissendolistoj , ofte uzante YahooGroups , estas aktivaj ĉiutage , centoj ĉiumonate .
Miloj da blogoj kaj retpaĝaroj proponas al la esperantista legantaro pli da legaĵoj ĉiutage , ol eblas legi .
Ĉiuj tiuj ekzemploj estas nemovadaj retpaĝoj , kiujn la Esperantistoj ial elektis por diskuti .
Mi mem kreis mian blogon ĉe Blogpsot ĉar tiam , plejmulto el la esperantlingvaj blogoj uzis tiun servon ( ŝajne , tio iom ŝanĝiĝis por Wordpress , kaj tio estas bona novaĵo ) .
Estis ankaŭ provoj por krei sociaj retoj per kaj por esperantistoj , en kiuj nur esperantistoj estas .
Amikumu ( ne temas pri la fama aplikaĵo , eĉ se Chuck Smith estas la prizorganto de la du projektoj ) estis laŭ mia scio la unua provo , kiu daŭris kelkajn monatojn en 2007 - 2008 kaj havis , je la fermiĝo , 1700 membrojn , laŭ Vikipedio .
Esperanto.com estas sendube la plej fama el ili , sed , ŝajne ĝi ne plu funkcias hodiaŭ , kaj havis pli ol 8000 membrojn .
Lernu !
ne estas ĝenerala socia reto , sed destinita al lernantoj , estas multe uzata de komencantoj kaj progresantoj , sed forlasita poste ( mi mem lernis per ĝi kaj havas nostaligiajn memorojn , sed preskaŭ neniam plu vizitas ĝin ) ; ĝi tamen estas socia reto per kaj por esperantistoj , kaj tutcerte la plej sukcesa el ili .
La plej interesa el tiuj movadaj sociaj retoj estas laŭ mi la laste naskita : Nubo.re .
Lanĉita la 21 an de decembro 2018 , ĝi hodiaŭ festas sian trian monaton kaj havas preskaŭ 400 membrojn .
Ĝi uzas la sistemon OpenSource Social Network ( OSSN ) , kaj proponas preskaŭ ĉion , kion Fejsbuko proponas , sen la reklamoj kaj sen vendi viajn datumojn .
Ĉar la kodo estas libere travidebla , oni scias ekzakte tion , kion OSSN kaj Nubo .re faras .
Paroli kun aliaj esperantistoj eblas per tri vojoj .
Unue , vi povas publikigi ion en via profilo , kaj tiu mesaĝo aperos al ĉiuj viaj amikoj .
Due , ekzistas grupoj ( 36 hodiaŭ ) , al kiuj oni povas aliĝi : pri politiko , por vidi memeojn aŭ ŝercojn , por lingvokonstruistoj , pri komputado aŭ futbalo , por parolantoj de Tokipono , … probable ekzistas grupoj por vi , kaj se ne , vi povas krei iun facile kaj rapide .
Trie , estas forumoj , en kiuj vi povas diskuti kun ĉiuj membroj de la retejo .
Estas ankaŭ aliaj eblecoj , kiel prezenti la eventojn , sed mi ne ĉion provis .
Do , eblas fari multajn aĵojn .
Sed , pli multe estos la aktivaj membroj ( nun , el preskaŭ 400 membroj , nur deko estas aktiva ) , pli interesa estos la retpaĝaro .
Ni bezonas socian servon por kaj per esperantistoj , kaj Nubo .re estas tre bona paŝo tiudirekten .
La gravaj fortostre ĉoj de la kreantoj de tiu retpaĝaro ne estu vanaj .
Ni vivigu kaj vivtenu ĝin !
In recent weeks there have been unconfirmed reports that Acer is going to go head - to - head with Asus in the subnotebook market .
Today comes word that Acer is supposedly going to be in the lead in price in this competition .
Details on Acer ’s upcoming model are very sketchy , but the device is expected to be comparable to the second generation of the Asus Eee PC , a soon - to - be - released version with a larger display than the original .
DigiTimes is reporting that because Acer is a larger company , it can get lower prices for components , allowing it to produce a subnotebook for $ 250 to $ 300 , and sell it for $ 350 to $ 400 .
Asus , on the other hand , is going to ask $ 500 for the new version of the Eee PC .
Still , Asus is gong to have one advantage : the new Eee PC is going to debut next month , while Acer ’s device is n’t expected until later this year .
HP , Too
In the wake of the Eee PC ’s success , Acer is n’t the only company jumping on board the low - cost subnotebook bandwagon ; HP is reportedly working on one , too .
Images and details of the 2133 leaked out last month , showing that this model will have the same 8.9 - inch screen as the upcoming Asus and Acer models , and a similar size and shape .

Peter Rivera watched Thursday as a man pulled up to his home and took to Rivera 's car with an Exacto knife , a squeegee , and several square yards of blue - and - white vinyl .
About half an hour later Rivera 's 1998 Ford Ranger was a rolling advertisement for an online insurance company : " Keep your insurance rates in check .
LowestPremium.com . "
The text is mingled with a blue banner on either side of the car and 10 big , white checkmarks – all plastered around Rivera 's side - panels , tailgate , hood , and doors .
The job , covering only part of his car , is known as a " half - wrap . "
Rivera , a 34 - year - old Berkeley waiter who commutes to San Francisco each day , was n't an unwilling victim to this ad - jacking , of course .
About two weeks earlier , he and his roommate had caught sight of a quarter - page print ad in SF Weekly placed by San Diego - based Autowraps.com .
The ad said they could earn $ 400 a month by surrendering their vehicle to the same kind of ads seen on San Francisco 's MUNI buses and employee automobiles sporting their companies ' dot - com logos – not to mention the Yahoo - outfitted taxicabs seen in San Francisco and Los Angeles .
Both roommates soon signed up , and waited to be identified as 1,000 miles - per - month drivers with desirable travel habits .
If selected , some advertiser would pin hopes for plenty of roadside exposure on disposable - income types .
Rivera and roommate salivated at the prospect of just about breaking even on their car payment .
" I was totally into it , " Rivera said .
" I 'm still totally into it . "
His partial wrap , dictated by the advertiser , nets Rivera $ 250 per month for a three - month run .
A spate of premium cars , notably the 1999 Volkswagen Beetle and high - riding sport- utility vehicles , trucks , and vans win a $ 400 full - wrap rate .
Lesser vehicles get $ 300 a month .
" That 's free money , " Rivera said .
" My car payment 's not that much .
I have 0.9 percent financing , so basically I 'm getting a free car . "
Welcome to the business model built by Daniel Shifrin , founder and president of Autowraps.com .
" We 're really getting jazzed about this , " Shifrin said .
" This is a national phenomenon . "
Indeed , it seems to bring to life the hoax that was an Esquire magazine article about a supposed chance to get a free minivan draped in an ad for " Stay Fresh " sanitary napkins .
" People are calling like crazy , " Shifrin said .
So far , the database is filled with about 5,000 willing drivers hoping to get draped .
Nationwide , 150 cars have been wrapped in the company 's three - month soft - launch period , with many dot coms among the clients eager to stake out new territory in the new economy 's space - scarce ad world .
The name carries a hint as to Autowraps.com 's business , but if you stopped in at their website , you might think you 'd hit upon an environmentalist 's mission statement .
" Today the personal vehicle dominates the outdoor landscape more than any other time in history ....
The car is king of the outdoors .
The sheer physical dominance of the car coupled with the worst traffic congestion levels in history make " – and here comes the clincher – " the personal vehicle a natural medium for outdoor advertising . "
Shifrin said he simply saw an opportunity to capitalize , as Autowraps.com says , on " one of society 's most counterproductive inventions . "
" There are calamitous conditions out there , in traffic , " he said .
" I mean it 's terrible , we 're polluting the earth .
" But in the meantime people are stuck in their cars .
What can we do ?
We can bring them messages , we can entertain them , we can inform them , we can educate them – which I think is going to be better off for all of us . "
The underlying concept has been done before .
" Beetle Billboards " positioned ads atop Volkswagen beetles in the '70s .
And other companies have placed ads on drivers ' back windshields .
But thanks to thin and remarkably subtle vinyl adhesive able to wrap pre-printed images around cars ' curvy lines and corners , Autowraps has taken advertising to a new , and some might say , excessive level .
" Yahoo was excited about the product because the taxi ads it ran on its own were so successful , " Shifrin said .
" They said this is a great medium for us to continue with . "
And soon he had cars in Orange County , California , wrapped in Yahoo's purple and yellow " Do You Yahoo ? " theme .
Andrew Everett , a 31 - year - old physical therapist in Los Angeles , wears a full - wrap Yahoo ad with pride on his Jeep Cherokee , one of the premium $ 400 per month winners .
He now washes and drives his SUV all the more carefully , feeling almost like he 's working for Yahoo .
" I love it .
It does n't bother me at all , really .
I definitely wash my car more than I used to in the past , and not just because they want you to keep ( your ) car clean . "
That behavior is in fact stipulated , among other behaviors , in the driver 's contract with Autowraps.com : driving within the speed limit , obeying all traffic laws , and no " road rage " behavior .
Such unsightliness on the pavement would be a no - no when it comes to respectable brand management .
" ( The contract ) says you 're not going to flip people off and drive erratically and drive intoxicated , and this , that , and the other thing , " Rivera said .
Neither he nor Everett mind the idea of having a business agreement dictating their daily behavior .
It 's a good thing too , because Autowraps.com plans to monitor such behavior .
A percentage of the cars will be equipped with global positioning units that ensure not only that drivers are driving the 1,000 - mile - per - month minimum along the specified routes , but keeping within the speed limit too .
" We are extremely concerned with driver safety , " Shifrin said .
" We want responsible drivers who are willing to obey and follow all traffic regulations .
It seems like people understand our need for monitoring . "
When the driver turns his car over for regular inspection each month , the data on a GPS unit 's hard disk will let the company determine wehther the driver has been speeding excessively and sticking to his promised daily and weekend travel routine .
The GPS device will know where drivers have been , how long it took to get there , and equally important , where they parked .
" Impact parkers , " as they 're called in Autowraps terminology , park in high - visibility areas with lots of auto and foot traffic .
All the tracking is simply part of doing good business for Autowraps.com , which projects , in a good commuter , up to 750,000 " impressions " per month .
The reaction on and alongside the road seems to vary according to where people live and how snazzy their vinyl adhesive is .
Rivera , who drives in the Bay Area , said pedestrians and drivers that have seen wrapped buses and many a promotional dot - com gimmick using cars , blimps , and more , are almost immune to a car smothered in advertising .
" Quite frankly I think people are already starting to get sort of tuned - out to it , " Rivera said .
" I park in the street and people in the crosswalk would n't even look twice at my car . "
It tends to be his friends who want to know what the heck he 's done to his car .
In contrast , Los Angeles seems to take more notice of Everett 's flashy Yahoo get - up as it cruises down Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood , where he and his wife live .
The Yahoo scheme is apparently more eye - grabbing than what a somewhat disappointed Rivera says is a tame blue insurance ad .
Older people , in their 60s to 80s , will just glance over and keep driving , Everett said .
" But the younger folks , they just literally gawk .
They think it 's a company car .
You 'll run by one of the sidewalks , and they 'll yell out , ' Yahoo ! ' "
So is n't there something a bit creepy about ads taking over private property ?
Is nothing safe from the spread of the almighty forces of America 's marketing industry ?
" Some friends , when I pulled up , they were like , ' What the hell is that on your car ?
Did you start working for an insurance company ? '
I 'm like ' No , I 'm getting paid to have advertisements on my truck . '
And they 're like , ' Oh , are you gonna sell your soul next ? '
I said I already sold it .
It already belongs to someone . "
If they came to him with ads for certain companies he did n't believe in , Rivera said he would decline – maybe .
The company limits grounds for refusal to drivers who have moral issues with sex , alcohol , or tobacco ads .
" I might be against doing some kind of big cigarette ad , " Rivera said .
" But then again if they waved $ 400 bucks in my face , maybe my morals would be easily bought . "
Iran says its nuclear programme is only for peaceful purposes
He made the announcement in an interview for Dow Jones Newswires in Saudi Arabia where he is attending a petroleum exporters ' summit .
Gulf Arab states recently proposed setting up a consortium to provide nuclear fuel to Iran and others .
The scheme could allay fears Iran is enriching uranium for a nuclear bomb .
Iran has insisted that its right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme is not up for negotiation .
UN sanctions
Mr Ahmadinejad 's comments come after moves by Swiss President Micheline Calmy - Rey to facilitate talks between Iran and the US .
She said Switzerland recognised Iran 's right to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes .
" We will be talking with our [ Arab ] friends , " Mr Ahmadinejad told Dow Jones on the sidelines of the Opec summit .
The plan suggested by the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council foresees the creation of a multinational consortium to provide enriched uranium to power plants in Iran .
Nuclear fuel would be supplied to Iran and other Middle East states looking to build their own nuclear power programmes .
Iran is currently under limited UN sanctions for continuing to enrich uranium in defiance of UN Security Council calls to stop .
The US has imposed even tougher sanctions of its own .
Western powers are concerned because , while enriched uranium is used as fuel for nuclear reactors , highly enriched uranium can also be used to make nuclear bombs .
Iran hid an enrichment programme for 18 years , so the Council says that until Iran 's peaceful intentions can be fully established , it should stop enrichment and certain other nuclear activities .

This Week 's Finds in Mathematical Physics ( Week 260 )
John Baez
Since it 's Christmas Eve , I thought I 'd list some free books you can download .
I 'm a big fan of giving the world presents ... and I 'm not the only one .
But first , this week 's nebulae !
Here 's one called the Retina :
1 ) Retina Nebula , Hubble Heritage Project , http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/14/
This is actually a tube of ionized gas about a quarter of a light - year across and one light - year long .
It 's a planetary nebula produced by a dying star .
If you zoom in and look closely , you can see this star lurking in the middle , now a mere white dwarf .
The blue light is the most energetic , so it 's really hot where you see blue .
This blue light comes from singly ionized helium - helium where one electron has been knocked off .
The green light is a bit less energetic : that 's from doubly ionized oxygen .
The red light comes from even cooler regions : that 's from singly ionized nitrogen .
You can also see a lot of " dust lanes " in this photo .
They 're beautiful .
And they 're big !
The width of each one is about 160 times the distance between the Sun and the Earth .
The gas and dust in these lanes is about 1000 times higher than elsewhere .
But what creates them ?
Apparently , when the fast - moving glowing hot gas from the star crashes into the invisible gas in the surrounding interstellar space , the boundary gets sort of crumpled , and these dust lanes form .
It 's vaguely similar to the puffy surface of a cumulus cloud .
But here the mechanism is different , because it involves a " shock wave " : the hot gas is moving faster than the speed of sound as it hits the cold gas !
This effect is called a " Vishniac instability " , since in 1983 , the astrophysicist Ethan Vishniac showed that a shock wave moving in a sufficiently compressible medium would be subject to an instability of this sort , growing as the square root of time .
I 've never seen how Vishniac 's calculations work , so the mathematics underlying this beautiful phenomenon will have to wait for another day .
Note that this planetary nebula , like the others I 've shown you , is far from spherically symmetric .
Astrophysicists used to pretend stars were spherically symmetric .
But , that 's a bad approximation whenever anything really exciting happens ... just like in the old joke where the punchline is " consider a spherical cow " .
As I said , the Retina Nebula is actually shaped like a tube .
Viewed from either end , this tube would look very different - probably like the Ring Nebula :
2 ) Ring Nebula , Hubble Heritage Project , http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/01/
This is one light - year across .
Again we see He II blue light with a wavelength of 4686 angstroms , then O III green light at 5007 angstroms , then N II red light at 6584 angstroms .
You can also see the white dwarf as a tiny dot in the center ; it 's about 100,000 kelvin in temperature .
( In case you 're wondering , an " angstrom " is an obsolete but popular unit of distance , equal to 10 - 10 meters .
Just like the " parsec " , it 's a sign that astronomy is an old science .
Anders Jonas Ångström was one of the founders of spectroscopy , back around 1860 .
Archaic conventions may also explain why singly ionized helium is called " He II " , and so on .
Maybe the number zero had n't fully caught on . )
Next : free books !
At least around here , Christmas seems to be all about buying stuff and giving it away .
Giving is good .
But I think gifts have more soul if you make them yourself .
This is one of the great things about the internet : it lets us create things and give them to everyone in the world - or more precisely : everybody who wants them , and nobody who does n't .
In this spirit , here 's a roundup of free books on math and physics : gifts from their authors to you .
There are lots out there .
I 'll only list a few .
For more , try these sites :
3 ) George Cain , Online Mathematics Textbooks , http://www.math.gatech.edu/~cain/textbooks/onlinebooks.html
4 ) Free Online Mathematics Books , http://www.pspxworld.com/book/mathematics/
5 ) Alex Stefanov , Textbooks in Mathematics , http://users.ictp.it/~stefanov/mylist.html or ( with annoying ads , but more permanent )
http://us.geocities.com/alex_stef/mylist.html
Despite its title , Stefanov 's excellent site includes a lot of books on physics .
I can't find lists specifically devoted to free physics books , but there are a lot out there - including a lot on the arXiv .
Anyway , let 's dive in !
What if you 're dying to learn physics , but do n't know where to start ?
Start here :
6 ) Physics Books Online , http://www.sciencebooksonline.info/physics.html.
You 'll find plenty of free online books , starting from the basics and working up to advanced topics .
But to dig deeper into these mysteries , you 'll eventually need to learn a bunch of math .
Do you remember what Victor Weisskopf said when a student asked how much math a physicist needs to know ?
" More . "
This can be scary when you 're just getting started .
What if you do n't know calculus , for example ?
Simple : learn calculus !
This book is a classic - and it's free :
7 ) Gilbert Strang , Calculus , Wellesley - Cambridge Press , Cambridge , 1991 .
Also available at http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/resources/Strang/strangtext.htm
It really explains things clearly .
I may use it the next time I teach calculus .
We professors need to quit making our students buy expensive textbooks , and switch to free online books !
We could join forces and make wiki textbooks that are a lot better and more flexible than the budget - busting , back - breaking mammoths we currently inflict on our kids .
But there are already a lot of good texts available free online .
Or : what if you know calculus , but you 're still swimming through the undergraduate sea of differential equations , Fourier transforms , matrices , vectors and tensors ?
Then this should be really helpful :
8 ) James Nearing , Mathematical Tools for Physics , available at http://www.physics.miami.edu/~nearing/mathmethods/
Unlike the usual dry and formal textbook , it reads like a friendly uncle explaining things in plain English , trying to cut through the red tape and tell you how to actually think about this stuff .
For example , on page 3 he introduces the hyperbolic trig functions :
Where do hyperbolic functions come from ?
If you have a mass in equilibrium , the total force on it is zero .
If it 's in stable equilibrium then if you push it a little to one side and release it , the force will push it back to the center .
If it is unstable then when it 's a bit to one side it will be pushed farther away from the equilibrium point .
In the first case , it will oscillate about the equilibrium position and the function of time will be a circular trigonometric function - the common sines or cosines of time , Acos ( ωt ) .
If the point is unstable , the motion will be described by hyperbolic functions of time , sinh ( ωt ) instead of sin( ωt ) .
An ordinary ruler held at one end will swing back and forth , but if you try to balance it at the other end it will fall over .
That 's the difference between cos and cosh .
There are free online books at all levels ... so let 's soar a bit higher .
How about if you 're a more advanced student trying to learn general relativity ?
Here you go :
9 ) Sean M. Carroll , Lecture Notes on General Relativity , available as arXiv: gr-qc/9712019
How about quantum field theory ?
Then you 're in luck - there are two detailed books available online :
10 ) Warren Siegel , Fields , available as arXiv: hep - th/ 9912205
10 ) Mark Srednicki , Quantum Field Theory , Cambridge U. Press , Cambridge , 2007 .
Also available at http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html
Or what about algebraic topology ?
Again you 're in luck , since you can read both Allen Hatcher 's gentle introduction and Peter May 's high - powered " concise course " :
11 ) Allen Hatcher , Algebraic Topology , Cambridge U. Press , Cambridge , 2002 .
Also available at http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html
12 ) Peter May , A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology , U. of Chicago Press , Chicago , 1999 .
Also available at http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/CONCISE/ConciseRevised.pdf
May has a lot of more advanced topology books available at his website , too - like this classic , where he used operads to solve important problems involving loop spaces :
13 ) Peter May , The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces , Lecture Notes in Mathematics 271 , Springer , Berlin , 1972 .
Also available at http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/BOOKS/gils.pdf
Or say you want to learn about vector bundles and how they show up in physics , from the basics all the way to fancy stuff like D - branes and K - theory ?
Try this - it's a great sequel to Husemoller 's classic intro to fiber bundles :
14 ) Dale Husemoller , Michael Joachim , Branislav Jurco and Martin Schottenloher , Basic Bundle Theory and K - Cohomology Invariants , Lecture Notes in Physics 726 , Springer , Berlin , 2008 .
Also available at http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schotten/Texte/978-3-540-74955-4_Book_LNP726.pdf
The list goes on and on !
The American Mathematical Society will give you books for free if you prove that you 're not a robot by solving a little puzzle :
15 ) American Mathematical Society , Books Online By Subject , http://www.ams.org/online_bks/online_subject.html
Apparently they do n't want robots learning advanced math and putting us professors out of business by teaching with more charisma and flair .
( By the way : make sure to let them put cookies on your web browser , or they 'll send you an endless succession of these puzzles , without explaining why ! )
Since James Dolan and I plan to explain symmetric groups and their Hecke algebras in our online seminar , this particular book from the AMS caught my eye :
16 ) David M. Goldschmidt , Group Characters , Symmetric Functions , and the Hecke Algebra , AMS , Providence , Rhode Island , 1993 .
Also available as http://www.ams.org/online_bks/ulect4/
Since we 're also struggling to understand the Langlands program , this looks good too :
17 ) Armand Borel , Automorphic Forms , Representations , and L- functions , AMS , 2 volumes , Providence , Rhode Island , 1979 .
Also available at http://www.ams.org/online_bks/pspum331/ and http://www.ams.org/online_bks/pspum332/
It 's a serious collection of expository papers by bigshots like Borel , Cartier , Deligne , Jacquet , Knapp , Langlands , Lusztig , Tate , Tits , Zuckerman , and many more .
" Motives " are the mysterious virtual building blocks that algebraic varieties are built from .
If you 're ready to learn about motives - I 'm not sure I am - try this :
18 ) Marc Levine , Mixed Motives , AMS , Providence , Rhode Island , 1998 .
Also available at http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv57/
Or , if you 're interested in using category theory to make analysis clearer and more beautiful , try this :
19 ) Andreas Kriegl and Peter W. Michor , The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis , AMS , Providence , Rhode Island , 1997 .
Also available at http://www.ams.org/online_bks/surv53/
The focus is on getting and working with a " convenient category " of infinite - dimensional manifolds .
The idea of a " convenient category " goes back to topology : at some point , people realized they wanted this property to hold :
C ( X × Y , Z ) ≅ C( X , C(Y , Z ) )
Here C ( X , Y ) is the space of maps from X to Y .
So , the isomorphism above says that a map from X × Y to Z should correspond to a map from X to C( Y , Z ) .
A category with this property is called " cartesian closed " .
While it may not be obvious why , this property is so wonderful that people threw out the category of topological spaces and continuous maps and replaced it with a slightly different one , just to get this to hold .
Another sort of " convenient category " for differential geometry uses infinitesimals .
Again , you can learn about this in a free book :
20 ) Anders Kock , Synthetic Differential Geometry , Cambridge U. Press , Cambridge , 2006 .
Also available at http://home.imf.au.dk/kock/
This category is not just cartesian closed - it 's a topos !
If you do n't know what a topos is , never fear - more free books are coming to your rescue :

The first one is so gentle it makes a good introduction to category theory as a whole .
The second scared the bejeezus out of me for a decade , but now I like it .
I like Jordan algebras , so I was also pleased to see this classic offered for free at the AMS website :
23 ) Nathan Jacobson , Structure and Representations of Jordan Algebras , AMS , Providence , Rhode Island , 1968 .
Also available at http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll39/
Fans of exceptional Lie algebras will like the last two chapters , on " connections with Lie algebras " and " exceptional Jordan algebras " .
Speaking of Lie algebras , I 'd never seen this textbook before :
24 ) Shlomo Sternberg , Lie Algebras , http://www.math.harvard.edu/~shlomo/docs/lie_algebras.pdf
It 's a somewhat quirky introduction , not for beginners I think , but it features some nice special topics : character formulas , the Kostant Dirac operator , and a detailed study of the center of the universal enveloping algebra .
This intro to Lie groups is also a bit quirky , but if you like Feynman diagrams or spin networks , it 's irreplaceable :
25 ) Predrag Cvitanovic , Birdtracks , Lie's , and Exceptional Groups , available at http://www.nbi.dk/GroupTheory/
One of the great things about this book is that it classifies simple Lie groups according to their " skein relations " - properties of their representations , written out diagrammatically .
In so doing , Cvitanovic realized that there 's a " magic triangle " containing all the exceptional Lie groups .
This subsumes the " magic square " of Freudenthal and Tits , which I discussed in " week145 " and my octonion webpages .
This idea of Cvitanovic is closely related to the " exceptional series " of Lie groups - a pattern whose existence was conjectured by Deligne .
I love the term " exceptional series " .
It 's an oxymoron , since the exceptional groups were defined as those that do n't fit into any series .
But , it makes sense !
To see the exceptional series , it helps to do a mental backflip called " Tannaka - Krein duality " , where you focus on the category of representations of the Lie group , instead of the group itself .
Then , draw the morphisms in that category as diagrams , like Feynman diagrams !
Then see what identities they satisfy .
New patterns leap out : new series unify what had been " exceptions " .
Very briefly , the idea goes like this .
Suppose we have a Lie group G with Lie algebra L. The Lie bracket takes two elements x and y and spits out one element [ x , y ] , and it 's linear in each variable , so it gives a linear operator
L ⊗ L &rarr L
which is actually a morphism in the category of representations of G .
So , following the philosophy of Feynman diagrams , we can draw the bracket operation like this :
\ / \ / \ / | | |
[ y , x ] = - [ x , y ]
we just draw this :
\ / | | \ / | | / | | / \ | | / \ \ / \ / = - \ / \ / \ / | | | | | |
[ x , [y , z ] ] = [ [ x , y ] , z ] + [ y , [x , z ] ]
we just draw this :
\ \ / \ / / \ / / \ \ / \ / / \ / / \ \ / \ / / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / = \ / + / \ / \ / \ / / \ / | | \ / | | \ / | | \ / | | |
x y z x y z x y z \ \ / \ / / \ / / \ \ / \ / / \ / / \ \ / \ / / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / = \ / + / \ / \ / \ / / \ / | | \ / | | \ / | | \ / | | | [ x , [y , z ] ] [ [x , y ] , z ] [ y , [x , z ] ]
26 ) Greg Muller , Chord diagrams and Lie algebras , http://cornellmath.wordpress.com/2007/12/25/chord-diagrams-and-lie-algebras/
It then turns out that the exceptional Lie algebras F 4 , E 6 , E 7 and E 8 satisfy yet another identity :
\ / \ / \----/ | | | | = /----\ / \ / \ \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / | A ---- + A | + / \ | / \ / \ / \ / \ \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \____/ B / + B | | + B ____ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
I believe the main point of this identity , going back to Vogel 's paper " Algebraic structures on modules of diagrams " , is that for these Lie algebras , the square of the quadratic Casimir is the only degree - 4 Casimir .
I think there 's a lot more to be discovered here , in part by taking the gnarly computations people have done so far and making them more beautiful and conceptual .
So , I urge all fans of exceptional mathematics , diagrams , and categories to look at these :

This stuff has been on my mind recently , since I 've been working on exceptional groups and grand unified theories with my student John Huerta .
Also , my friend Tevian Dray has a student who just finished a thesis on a related topic :

Tony Smith pointed out something I already knew , but did n't make clear above : the idea that E 6 is secretly SL ( 3,O ) is far from new .

Not only from your brief list descrption , but also from reading the paper at pages 96 ff I get the impression that Wangberg is claiming the result E 6 = SL ( 3 , O ) .
Do you get the same impression ?
I hope not , and I hope that my impression is somehow mistaken , because the result E 6 = SL ( 3,O ) is ( and has been for some time ) well known and in the literature .
For example , in hep - th / 9309030 Martin Cederwall and Christian R. Preitschopf said : ...
It should be possible to realize E 6 = SL ( 3; O ) [ 18,24 ] on them in a " spinor - like " manner , much like SO ( 10 ) = SL ( 2;O ) acts on its 16 - dimensional spinor representations that play the role of homogeneous coordinates for OP1 ... ...

Please do n't misunderstand this message .
I think that Wangberg 's thesis is very interesting .
I am just trying to get a correct historical record .
Tony PS - In Sudbery 's 1984 paper , he not only says ( at page 950 ) " ... sl ( 3 , K ) ...
When K = O , this Lie algebra is a n on - compact form of the exceptional Lie algebra E 6 , the maximal compact subalgebra being F 4 ... " but he goes on to say " ... sp ( 6 , K ) ... when K = O it is a non-compact form of E 7 , the maximal compact subalgebra being E6 ⊕ so ( 2 ) . ... " .

As an enthusiastic New York Mets fan , I could n't wait to see how well my Metropolitans would play on MLB 2K8 .
I pre-ordered in anticipation of the 2008 baseball season and ran to the store on release date to test this puppy out .
With the wife and kids in bed around 9:30 I fired up my 360 .
This morning my bleary - eyed thoughts are simple :
The best thing I got from this purchase was the free Jose Reyes bobble head doll .
Continue Reading >>
From the minute the game loaded it was one issue or another .
The first stumbling block that I encountered was getting a revised roster .
The system shot me an error message saying " rosters not yet available . "
So I then try to trade a few minor leaguers to the Twins for Johan Santana ( much like the actual deal ) and was given the response that " This does n't make our team better . "
Who 's playing the game here , again ?
I then decide to start a franchise .
I go through the process and name myself GM which is where we encounter issue number two .
You would n't think simply entering a name would be a big deal but it felt like I was using an old typewriter and manually pushing every key .
It was not as simple as other games ( Call of Duty 4 ) where if you push down the analog stick you get caps .
Every movement was select CAPS , select R , select lower case , select next letter …
Batting is n't exactly easy on the eyes , or brain .
You pull back the right analog stick to get the batter to move his legs ; then you push the stick forward to swing the bat .
My first attempt went so terribly that I quit and played home run derby .
This practice helped me make better contact with the ball , but the most I could hit out of the park was three .
Pitching also pulls you through a three step process and I found myself throwing more meatballs than fastballs .
For example , to throw a curve ball you need to pull the right analog stick down , rotate it clockwise and then release .
If you do n't rotate or release properly , you could give up a home run .
To put things in perspective , I lost my first game 32 – 3 .
In the end , the game is just fair .
Maybe in two weeks my outlook will change , but so far no good .
I think pitching is going to require a few more games to get the rhythm down and batting a few more also .
I am honestly disappointed at this point , but at least it can't get much worse .

A team of scientists from Princeton University has devised a new experimental technique that produces some of the best functional images ever taken of the human brainstem , the most primitive area of the brain .
The scientists believe they may be opening the door to inquiries into a region that acts as the staging area for the brain chemicals whose overabundance or absence in other parts of the brain are at the root of many neuropsychiatric disorders , like addiction , schizophrenia and Parkinson 's disease .
Reporting in the Feb. 28 edition of Science , the scientists describe using functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brainstem activity in dehydrated humans .
The scanning technique allows researchers to watch the brain in action .
The subjects were participating in classical conditioning experiments in which they were presented with a visual clue , then , at varying intervals , given a drink .
The researchers were able to track changes in blood flow in areas of the brainstem associated with enhanced activity of the brain chemical dopamine -- as the person experienced either pleasure or disappointment at receiving or not receiving the reward .
" For a long time , scientists have tried looking at this area of the brain and have been unsuccessful -- it 's just too small , " said Kimberlee D'Ardenne , the lead author on the paper .
Until now , scientists wanting to use brain scans to study brain chemicals like dopamine were relegated to watching its effects in other more accessible parts of the brain , like the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum .
However , this was downstream of its source , and therefore possibly much less accurate , D'Ardenne said .
" We wanted to try because the brainstem is so important to activities in the rest of the brain , " said D'Ardenne , a postdoctoral student in the Department of Chemistry .
" We believe it could be a key to understanding all kinds of important behavior . "
For the research , D'Ardenne collaborated with Jonathan Cohen , co-director of the Princeton Neuroscience Institute , and Samuel McClure and Leigh Nystrom , other institute scientists .
They conducted the studies on the University 's own brain scanner located on campus in Green Hall .

Cohen noted that these findings provide a critical link between studies in non-human animals that have looked directly at the activity of dopamine cells in the brainstem and studies in humans of behaviors thought to be related to dopamine .
" It could also open up entirely new avenues of study , " he said .
The team was able to develop high - resolution images that tracked the activity of tiny clusters of dopamine neurons .
They weeded out distortions caused by many pulsing blood vessels in the brainstem .
They also employed computerized rules of thumb known as algorithms and imaging techniques to reduce the effects of head movement and combine images from different subjects .
The MRI device produces three - dimensional images that show what portions of the brain engage during actions and thought processes .
This allows the investigators to correlate physical processes with mental activities with unprecedented precision .
The brain stem , a tiny , root - shaped structure , is the lower part of the brain and sits atop the spinal cord .
The area controls brain functions necessary for survival , such as breathing , digestion , heart rate , blood pressure and arousal .
The brain structure also serves as the home base for the brain chemicals , also known as neuromodulators , such as dopamine , serotonin and norepinephrine .
The chemicals spring forth into other brain regions from there , zipping along routes called axons .
The team 's experiments confirmed results already seen in animal studies .
Blood flow increased in dopamine centers of the brainstem when test subjects were happily surprised with a reward .
However , there was no activity when participants received less than what they expected , a finding that is different from the results of previous studies looking farther downstream .
advertisement
" We are just at the beginning of understanding these crucial pathways , " D'Ardenne said .
" But it gives us a hint about what is possible to know . "
The tiny clumps of cells containing neuromodulator chemicals in the brainstem , called nuclei , have long been known to play a critical role in the regulation of brain function , and disturbances of these systems have been implicated in most psychiatric disorders , from addiction to schizophrenia , D'Ardenne said .
The Princeton group wants to understand how the brain 's physical structures give rise to the functions of the mind , a field known as cognitive neuroscience .
For years , neuroscientists focused on the brain while psychologists dealt with the mind .
The new field combines both and is being powered by scientific advances in brain imaging and gene manipulation that allows researchers to record and measure the activity of brain cells as humans or animals perform mental tasks .

What Does This Mean ?
There 's a new game in England and France for girls ages 9 to 16 , and it's so raunchy it makes Bratz dolls look positively Pollyanna - ish .
Called " Miss Bimbo " , the game is essentially an online competition in which each registered player is given a " Bimbo " all her own to take care of — sort of like those Tamagotchi pets , but , well , not .
According to Miss Bimbo rules , the goal of the game is to make your Bimbo the " the hottest of hot Bimbos , " which involves dating " that famous hottie , " becoming a " socialite and skyrocket[ing ] to the top of fame and popularity , " and even resorting " to meds or plastic surgery " , because girls should " Stop at nothing to become the reigning bimbo ! "
According to CNN , " Breast implants sell at 11,500 bimbo dollars and net the buyer 2,000 bimbo attitudes , making her more popular on the site . "

Parents are understandably up in arms over the game , which , after a launch last month , has , at the time of this writing , 204,714 " registered Bimbos . "
Bill Hibbard , a member of the parents ' rights group ParentKind , tells the Guardian , " It is one thing if a child recognises it as a silly and stupid game .
But the danger is that a nine - year - old fails to appreciate the irony and sees the bimbo as a cool role model .
Then the game becomes a hazard and a menace .
Children 's innocence should be protected as far as possible .
It depends on the background and mindset of the child but the danger is that after playing the game some will then aspire to have breast operations and take diet pills . "

Miss Bimbo , at first glance , is free for registrants , but when players run out of virtual bimbo money , they are given the option to buy Bimbo text messages which cost £ 1.50 ( $ 2.99 ) per message and give players extra dollars to spend on their Bimbos .
A French man has already sued Miss Bimbo's Gallic sister site after his daughter ran up a text message bill of over £ 100 ( $ 199 ) .
As for the creators of Miss Bimbo , well , the game 's 23 - year - old creator Nicolas Jacquart tells the Times of London , " The game is structured in such a way that it simply mirrors real life in a tongue - in - cheek way .
It is not a bad influence for young children .
They learn to take care of their bimbos . "
He continues : " The missions and goals for the bimbos are morally sound and teach children about the real world .
If they eat too much chocolate in the game , it is bad for their bimbos ' bodies and their happiness levels compared to if they eat fruit and vegetables , which reinforces positive healthy eating messages .
The breast operations are just one part of the game and we are not encouraging young girls to have them . "
Maybe we should teach Jacquart a lesson through the patented Jezebel justice system .
Perhaps some time cleaning bed pans on an eating disorder ward would do the trick ?

An emergency interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve is possible ahead of its March 18th policy meeting , according to a Goldman Sachs research note on Monday .
Goldman said its view on Fed policy changed on Friday .
The government reported on Friday that a second straight month of job losses and the Fed announced new steps to inject liquidity into the financial system as credit availability remains tight .
Goldman said the Fed would drop the benchmark federal funds target rate to 2 percent by late April , most likely in two 50 basis - point steps at the next two meetings .
“ We can not rule out an intermeeting rate cut today , ” the Monday note said .
When it comes to the Google search box , you already know the tricks : finding exact phrases matches using quotes like " so say we all " or searching a single site using site: lifehacker.com gmail .
But there are many more oblique , clever , and lesser - known search recipes and operators that work from that unassuming little input box .
Dozens of Google search guides detail the tips you already know , but today we 're skipping the obvious and highlighting our favorite obscure Google web search tricks .

What time is it in Bangkok right now ?
Ask Google .
Enter simply what time is it to get the local time in big cities around the world , or add the locale at the end of your query , like what time is it hong kong to get the local time there .
9 . Track flight status
Enter the airline and flight number into the Google search box and get back the arrival and departure times right inside Google 's search results .
8. Convert currency , metrics , bytes , and more
Advertisement
Google 's powerful built - in converter calculator can help you out whether you 're cooking dinner , traveling abroad , or building a PC .
Find out how many teaspoons are in a quarter cup ( quarter cup in teaspoons ) or how many seconds there are in a year ( seconds in a year ) or how many euros there are to five dollars ( 5 USD in Euro ) .
For the geekier set , bits in kilobytes ( 155473 bytes in kilobytes ) and numbers in hex or binary ( 19 in binary ) are also pretty useful .
7. Compare items with " better than " and find similar items with " reminds me of "
Advertisement
Reader Adam taps the wisdom of the crowds by searching for like items using key phrases .
He writes in :
Simply search for , in quotes : " better than _keyword_ "
Some example results :
Results 1 - 100 of about 550 English pages for " better than WinAmp " .
Results 1 - 57 of 57 English pages for " better than mIRC " .
Results 1 - 100 of about 17,500 English pages for " better than Digg " .
( Wow. Poor Digg . )
The results will almost always lead you to discovering alternatives to whatever it is you 're searching for .
Using the same concept , you can use this trick to discover new music or movies .
For example , " reminds me of _someband_ " or " sounds like _someband_ " will pull up artists people have thought sounded similar to the one you typed in .
This is also a great way to find good , no - name musicians you 'd probably never know of otherwise .
Examples :
Results 1 - 88 of 88 English pages for " reminds me of Metallica " .
Results 1 - 36 of 36 English pages for " similar to Garden State " .
Results 1 - 66 of 66 English pages for " sounds like The Shins " .
Just get creative and you 'll , without a doubt , find cool new stuff you probably never knew existed .

Bush has denounced Ahmadinejad at every turn .
He has offered to sanction him , embargo him , isolate him , even bomb him .
He has portrayed him as a monster of evil and " leading sponsor of terror " .
He has showered the Saudis and the Gulf states with $ 20bn of weapons to confront him " before it is too late " .
When Ahmadinejad thanked " divine intervention " for making him president in 2005 , he should also have thanked God for having first selected Bush .
To have Washington as your enemy in these parts is to have every man your friend .
The dwindling raggle - taggle army of neocons is currently trying to portray US strategy in the region as a success after all .
This is entirely based on news from Iraq , where General David Petraeus has reduced the death rate of Americans and Iraqis from the astronomical to the merely appalling .
Since this conflict is far too dangerous to report properly , world opinion is reliant on a notional monthly kill rate to measure progress .
Petraeus , or at least the exhausted citizens of Iraq , have thus offered the White House a respite from horror .
The tactics are exactly those that Petraeus 's predecessors rejected in the past four years of mayhem .
He has encouraged and armed local militias , good and bad , to defend their communities .
In Anbar province , this has meant backing Sunni sheikhs and former Ba'athist gangsters , styled " the awakening " , to face down the al - Qaida mafia .
This was suggested by British MI6 agents in 2003 and rejected by the Pentagon .
In Baghdad , the tactic has meant building fortified and ethnically cleansed ghettos , mostly in Sunni areas , and arming them against the former campaign of slaughter by the Shia militia / police , many of whom work for the interior ministry .
Within the ambit of American protection , this has meant a modified return to normality .
Petraeus has proved a wise commander .
His men do not go kicking their way into women 's bedrooms , shooting family parties and shelling villages , which was Donald Rumsfeld 's way of winning hearts and minds .
There is also a limit to how long any citizenry can remain in a state of medieval siege .
Markets will struggle to operate .
Schools will try to reopen .
Elsewhere , old habits die hard .
Last week the biggest bombing raid since the invasion was unleashed on a populated area in Diyala , north - east of Baghdad , causing as yet unrecorded devastation .
On Monday one of Iraq 's most distinguished judges was left unprotected and was assassinated .
Water and power supplies to the capital are said to be worse than ever .
No effort has been made to stave off the conflict likely to envelop oil - rich Kirkuk , let alone a simmering war on the Kurdish - Turkish border .
In other words , it remained unthinkable that Bush 's lap of honour round the region last week might include the city he supposedly " liberated " .
Sooner or later the Americans must withdraw from the enclaves they have de facto partitioned .
A new , homegrown , home - fought balance of power will be found in Iraq .
Petraeus 's strategy is certainly the best yet tried by the coalition , but it offers no long - term surety of law and order because it is backed by no political settlement .
It is worth noting that Basra , from whose civil chaos British troops withdrew in despair last year , has dropped from the radar .
It is strange what happens when alien forces withdraw from occupied lands .
Stripped of its post -9/11 retribution , bombast and militarism , American policy towards the Muslim world has been to promote democracy as the one sure means to prosperity and peace .
Condoleezza Rice and others declared in 2005 that " the bad old days of favouring stability over democracy are over " .
Even friends such as the Egyptians and the Saudis were mildly rebuked for turning a deaf ear to this message .
As policy , this was noble .
If America ( and Britain ) were ill - advised to call it a crusade , there are certainly worse causes to promote .
Yet Bush and Tony Blair were unaware of how their inevitably " neo- imperial " wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , coupled with American support for Israel 's expansionism , would render their crusade hopelessly hypocritical .
Muslim democracy is a moot concept , but it has made a sort of imprint on Iran , Palestine , Lebanon and even Iraq and Pakistan .
Yet it was not these leaders that Bush graced with a visit this past week .
He went to Kuwait , Abu Dhabi , Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Bahrain , where he was feted with gifts of gold , rubies , emeralds and diamonds .
It sure beat a walkabout in downtown Baghdad .
In Pakistan , Bush continues to back dictatorship and must suffer the resulting Taliban " blowback " in Afghanistan .
In Palestine he ignores the winner of an election , Hamas .
He appeases Hosni Mubarak 's dictatorship in Egypt and is craven to the autocrats of Saudi Arabia .
His spokesman , Steve Hadley , challenged on what such rulers contribute to democracy , could only bumble that " these folks are on board with the freedom agenda , and are pursuing it in their own fashion " .
Stability trumped democracy after all .
Insofar as any strategy lay behind the Bush trip , it was a hope that the monarchs of the Gulf might support the US in military action against Bush 's pet hate , Ahmadinejad .
Yet if there is one lesson these rulers know , it is to live at peace with the wilder regimes to their north and east .
Indeed , keeping them wild suits them fine .
Dubai is built on the funk money of the region .
The last thing the Gulf intends to do is help the US to yet another war , least of all with Iran .
Meanwhile , Bush cannot even see the final irony .
The one thing that might unseat Ahmadinejad is a poor showing against the moderates in the half - free parliamentary elections in March .
If his party does badly , there is a chance of a more reasonable regime taking over , reasonable on anything from Iraq to nuclear weapons .
At least it is worth waiting .
Yet Bush does everything to generate the paranoia on which Ahmadinejad bases his electoral appeal .
He threatens him with the constraint of war , and thus dilutes the constraint of democracy .
Does Bush not realise how attack from outside helps an embattled leader ?
Has he forgotten 9/11 ?

“ The Trillion Dollar Income Shift , PART 1 ″
by Jack Rasmus
copyright 2007
For three decades a ‘ Great Leveling ’ of incomes between classes in America occurred as the standard of living rose for tens of millions of American workers and their families from 1942 to the mid-1970s .
American working class families received a share of record gains in productivity .
Real wages rose .
Guaranteed retirement benefits — private pensions and social security — were greatly expanded .
Health insurance plans were negotiated .
Medicare was added for the aged .
K - 12 public education was truly free and public colleges and universities nearly so .
Unions represented 25 % - 35 % of the work force , and typically 60 % and more in key strategic sectors like construction , manufacturing , and transport .
The tax burden for workers rose relatively slowly and corporations and the wealthy still paid a fair share .
Then , after three decades , the hourglass of history was inverted .
Stood on its head .
The ‘ Great Leveling ’ of incomes became , after a brief interregnum from 1974 - 1978 , a ‘ Great Reversal ’ .
From the mid-1970s until the present a widening income gap began to open up , as it once had in the decade leading up to the Great Depression after 1929 .
Income inequality grew as income shifted from working class families to the wealthiest households and corporations .
From the early 1980s on income inequality widened , deepened , and accelerated until today well over $ 1 trillion in income is being transferred every year from the roughly 90 million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working class households .
How did this happen ?— a question more important perhaps than even the current income gap itself .
After expanding both in scope and magnitude since the late 1970s , today ’s widening income gap has finally begun to penetrate the periphery of public debate .
Driven by policies , corporate and government , that have enabled and made it possible , growing inequality of incomes in America can no longer be hidden from public scrutiny .
From thoughtful analyses of shifting income shares by young academic - economists like Emmanuel Saez of the University of California , Berkeley , to focused commentary on the topic by media- economists , like New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , to pop-art economists , pro-Business rebuttalists , and panicky editorial page writers of the Wall St. Journal — all acknowledge to one degree or another the growing inequality of incomes in the U.S .
Shifting Income to the Wealthiest 1 %
Income inequality in America today is not , as one might assume , about the upper 20 % or even 10 % wealthiest gaining at the expense of the rest .
It is about the very rich , the extremely rich , the mega - rich gaining an ever - increasing relative share of national income while the middle , the working class , and the poor stagnate or decline in terms of their share of that income .
It is about corporations and the wealthiest 1 % households ( the very rich ) , and even the top 0.1 % ( extremely rich ) and 0.01 % ( mega rich ) , accruing for themselves a greater relative share of income at the expense of the rest and , in particular , at the expense of the lower 80 % income groups in which fall virtually all the 90 million working class families and the government ’s estimated 108 million non-supervisory workers in the U.S. workforce .
There are approximately 114 million households in the U.S. today .
The wealthiest 1 % make up 1.4 million households .
They now receive between 19 % - 21.5 % of the annual Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) of the United States , depending on the source cited .
That ’s up from 8 % in 1980 .
Today ’s 19 % - 21.5 % also represents a nearly full recovery of the roughly 22 % share of national income the top 1 % received in 1928 just prior to the stock market crash of 1929 , the depression of the 1930s , and the ‘ Great Leveling ’ of class incomes that followed .
That same 1 % today also hold more than 35 % of all assets and wealth of the country — about $ 17 trillion .
They own 51 % of all stocks and 70 % of all bonds , own homes worth $ 3 million and have a net worth of $ 6 million .
The bottom 50 % of all households , nearly 60 million families — all working class — in comparison own only 2.5 % of the country ’s total assets and wealth .
The 0.1 % extremely rich , 140,000 households , did even better than the top 1 % and the 0.01 % mega-rich , only 14,000 households , did better than they , as data later in this article will illustrate .
Despite the 2001 Bush recession and the dot.com stock bust earlier this decade , since 2000 the number of millionaires in the U.S. rose from 6 to 7.5 million ( which excludes home asset values in the calculation ) , according to a 2006 report by the corporate research firm , the Boston Consulting Group .
One hundred new billionaires were also created since 2001 .
Meanwhile real weekly earnings of 100 million workers are less today than in 1980 when Ronald Reagan took office — a virtual quarter century pay freeze !
According to the U.S. Commerce Department the median ( midpoint ) households ( where male workers earn about $ 41,000 a year and female workers $ 31,000 a year ) have experienced a decline of 5.9 % in income the past five years alone .
Below the median , thirty - seven million workers and their families now live below the U.S. government ’s official poverty level and sixteen million of them earn less than $ 9,800 for a family of four .
Even workers above the median have done poorly .
Except for a few years in the late 1990s , even college educated workers ’ real wages have stagnated , growing less than a half of one percent a year from 1979 through 2005 and actually declining in 2004 - 05 .
For the first time since the U.S. government began to collect the data in 1947 , wages and salaries no longer constitute more than half of total national income .
In contrast , corporate profits are at their highest levels since World War II , having risen double digits every quarter in the last three and a half years alone and 21.3 % in the most recent year , 2005 , according to Dow - Jones ‘ Market Watch ’ .
Corporate profit margins are higher than they have been in more than half a century , according to Merrill Lynch economist , David Rosenberg .
After tax profits are now equal to 8.5 % of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product — that ’s more than a $ trillion dollars — and the highest since the end of World War II in 1945 .
A June 2006 report by the leading Investment Bank , Goldman Sachs , aptly summed it up : “ The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labor ’s share of national income .�?
It was once said by President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s that “ a rising ( economic ) tide lifts all boats �?.
But that was a different time .
A different America .
Today , under George W. Bush , we are told the economy has been booming .
And indeed GDP , the stock market , corporate profits , and the incomes of the wealthy have been rising .
But tens of millions of American families have been thrown overboard , left to tread water or drown , while the wealthiest passengers celebrate into the night in the ballrooms of the new Titanic economy in America .
The $ 1.09 Trillion Low - End Estimate
The most telling statistic of what it all means comes from the U.S. Department of Commerce .
It states that wages and salaries as of April 2006 constituted only 45.3 % of GDP , a decline from 50.0 % in 2001 and 53.6 % in 1970 .
Furthermore , as the U.S. government itself estimates , “ each percentage point now equals about $ 132 billion � ?!
In other words , the roughly 8.3 % drop ( 53.6 - 45.3 ) in labor ’s share by 2005 represents an annual shift in relative income today of about $ 1.09 trillion .
That ’s $ 1.09 trillion that now occurs every year , and is rising !
That $ 1.09 trillion shift is equivalent to every one of 108 million non-supervisory workers in the U.S. today writing out a check each year , every year , for $ 12,100 and signing it over to the other 24 million upper - class households — about 40 % of which would go to the wealthiest 1.4 million families .
And not yet included in the $ 1.09 trillion annual figure are additional income transfers from labor to corporations as a consequence of employers shifting a greater share of the costs of health care to their workers in recent years ; the destruction and only partial payouts to workers from the discontinuing of tens of thousands of defined benefit pension plans since the 1980s ; and the transfer of hundreds of billions more every year in workers ’ payroll tax payments ( i.e. deferred wages ) from the Social Security Trust fund to the U.S. general budget since the 1980s .
It is not surprising that the more prescient defenders of the status quo today see the looming potential threat in this situation .
Janet Yellen , President of the San Francisco district of the Federal Reserve Board , recently pointed out the growing inequality may well lead to resistance to globalization ( read : free trade and U.S. foreign direct investment ) , affect social cohesion , “ and could ultimately undermine democracy ’ .
In a somewhat less direct terms , the new Secretary of the U.S. Treasury , Henry Paulson , an ex-Goldman Sachs Investment Bank CEO transferred to the Bush economic team last summer , has raised similar concerns .
Recently some politicians have also begun to pick up on the theme of growing inequality , sensing as they campaigned in November ’s Congressional elections the growing popular discontent of millions who hear every day from Bush & company how great the economy is doing , but know they are personally losing economic ground .
As the newly elected Democratic Senator from Virginia , James Webb , no liberal by any means , put it in a recent editorial , “ wages and salaries are at all - time lows as a percentage of the national wealth� ?
and “ America ’s top tier has grown infinitely richer the past 25 years …
The tax codes protect them , just as they protect corporate America , through a vast system of loopholes .�?
Meanwhile , Fox News pundits squeal ‘ class war , you ’re talking class war ’ at such comments — as if that was n’t exactly what has been happening economically now for more than a quarter century to tens of millions of American workers and their families .
The Limitations of Government Data
Debate and discussion on income inequality in America today almost always refer to one or more of four U.S. government data sources .
Given the undeniable magnitude of the income gap , all show evidence of its existence and growth .
However , for different reasons all the four sources seriously underestimate that gap with the result that official estimates of income inequality in the U.S. are even more grossly understated .
The gap is even worse , much worse , than it is reported .
The four sources are the U.S. Census Bureau , the Congressional Budget Office , and the Federal Reserve Board and the Department of Labor surveys .
Except for one source , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , all conveniently do not estimate the income of the wealthiest 1 % households separately but lump them into broader groups with the result that the extreme concentration now occurring at the very top of the income scale is blurred and lost in a set of much larger numbers .
The Department of Labor goes so far as to define the “ rich� ? as the top third ( 33 % ) of households with annual income levels of only $ 70,000 a year .
With that logic , Bill Gates and your average dockworker are considered no different in terms of income .
A major failing of two of the survey sources , Federal Reserve and Department of Labor , is that they are based on interview surveys of the very rich and extremely rich ( the mega - rich of billionaires and their near - cousins are never bothered with such government survey requests ) .
Government representatives either call or visit in home with the wealthy and ask them to reveal their most private financial situation .
Why the super - rich would be inclined to thus reveal the details of their finances to government interviewers — after manipulating tax shelters and the like as most do and paying numerous lawyers and high - priced accountants large fees to hide their income — is an interesting and grossly naive assumption .
Several of the sources conveniently leave out capital gains income from the totals .
Capital gains income accounts typically for 5 % - 8 % of the IRS ’s total revenue collected in a given year , and Bush ’s first term tax cuts are calculated to yield $ 500 billion in accumulated capital gains tax savings , and therefore income windfall , for the wealthy in this decade .
The best of the four sources , the Congressional Budget Office , includes capital gains and provides for a view of the top 1 % but unfortunately grossly overestimates working family incomes , and correspondingly underestimates wealthy households ’ income , by arbitrarily defining 65 % of all business income as wages .
But even these shortcomings are only a part of the picture and problems involved when using the traditional four government sources for estimating and discussing income inequality and the income gap today in the U.S .
Hiding $ 7 Trillion Offshore
Collectively all the four sources share two additional serious shortcomings when it comes to estimating the shift of relative income from working class families since the late 1970s .
First , none of them make upward adjustments in income for the wealthiest households to account for increasing tax avoidance and non-reporting of income by the wealthy in recent years , and the consequent squirreling away of $ trillions of dollars in offshore tax shelters since the early 1980s .
In 1983 about $ 250 billion in income was reportedly diverted to emerging offshore shelters like the Cayman islands in the Caribbean .
According to no less a conservative source than Morgan Guaranty Trust , the preeminent investment bank of the super - rich , today about $ 7 trillion is stuffed away in offshore shelters from the Caribbean to the Channel Islands in Europe , to Cyprus in the middle east , to the Seyschelle islands off the coast of India , to Vanuatu , Palau , Indonesia and multiple points throughout the Pacific .
And that ’s only what ’s publicly reported .
It is not known exactly how much of that is American - originated tax avoidance and sheltering , but it is probably safe to assume at least 60 % , or around $ 4 trillion , represents holdings of U.S. corporations and the wealthiest households .
Not too many workers deposit their IRAs in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda nowadays .
It ’s all income of the wealthy that does n’t get reported to the IRS and is consequently not reflected in the income of the wealthiest households in the official government sources tracking income inequality in America .
Ignoring the Corporate Role
A second major shortcoming of official government sources is that none consider the relative shift in income from workers to corporations , despite the fact that working families ’ income is being shifted directly to corporations as well as indirectly through the tax system to wealthy individuals .
Most of the income held by the top 1 % households passes through corporations .
Corporations pay them interest , dividends , and it is the sale of corporate stocks , bonds and other assets and securities from which the wealthy receive the predominant share of their income .
Similarly , corporations compensate their CEOs and executive management the record - breaking amounts that show up in front - page headlines of newspapers on a regular basis .
In 1980 the average American CEO made 35 times the average pay of the worker in his company ; today that ratio is more than 500 times , according to the business news source , Reuters .
Since 1980 , and particularly in the last decade , CEOs , senior management , and others have been allotting for themselves record income gains .
In the last five years alone the senior managers ( top 5 positions ) of corporations in America have increased their share of corporate income by more than 100 % , from around 5 % of profits to more than 10 % of profits .
However , and this point is noteworthy , not all the income shifted from workers to corporations is immediately passed on to the wealthiest households in the form of dividends , interest , capital gains or to corporate senior management .
A significant part of corporate income is retained by corporations ; i.e. is not distributed to shareholders , not spent on capital investment , paid out in wages and salaries , or otherwise used for operations .
Corporate retained profits may thus be considered a form of ‘ deferred income ’ of the wealthiest households and individuals that will eventually be paid out to them in future years
And the retention of undistributed profits is at record levels today .
For example , in 2001 total corporate profits before taxes amounted to $ 767 billion .
In 2004 it had risen to $ 1.16 trillion .
$ 400 billion of that $ 1.16 trillion was retained in 2004 .
In 2005 pretax profits were $ 1.35 trillion and about $ 460 was retained .
The percentage of retained profits in recent years , in other words , is about one - third of total pretax profits .
And that one - third in recent years exceeds the long run historic average by about 40 % .
That excess over the long term average , at least $ 180 billion a year , should rightly be considered part of non-working class income that has been shifted from workers to non-working class households and being ‘ held in escrow ’ , as it were , by corporations for future distribution .
The widening income gap is therefore as much a shift in income from working families to corporations as it is to the wealthier households .
A significant element of corporate retained profits should consequently be included , factored into total calculations of the overall shift in relative income from workers and their families .
But none of the current discussion on the widening income gap considers the corporation ’s role in the shift of relative income shares .
The Emmanuel Saez & Thomas Picketty Analysis
An interesting first step in this latter direction has been taken recently by two young French economists , Thomas Picketty and Emmanual Saez , the latter now at the University of California , Berkeley .
In their seminal paper , “ Income Inequality in the United States , 1913 - 2002 � ?
( updated for 2003 ) , they created a database from U.S. Internal Revenue Service sources on taxes paid by family units dating back nearly a century .
Although their results and findings are subject to the various limitations of the IRS data , their database represents a significant advance over the four traditional government sources that have been used to illustrate income inequality in the U.S .
Picketty & Saez focus primarily on the evolution of incomes of the wealthiest 1 % families over the ninety year period .
Their basic conclusion is that there is a three decades fall and then three decades rise in the incomes of the wealthiest 1 % –i.e.
a Great Leveling of income differences between the wealthy and the rest , between 1942 - 1970 , followed by a Great Reversal and growing income inequality after 1978 once again .
Their second fundamental finding is that incomes within the top 1 % are concentrated and skewed strongly to the upper levels — the 0.1 % and 0.01 % of those top 1 % households .
A third is that the growing inequality since 1978 occurs only within the top 1 % households in America .
Other than some suggestive data for income inequality in the U.K. , the wealthy 1 % owners of capital incomes elsewhere in the industrial world have not experienced the same major shift in incomes in their favor since 1980 as has occurred in the U.S .
According to their data , after rising sharply in the 1920s the incomes of the wealthy drop significantly in the early years of the 1930s Depression , then further during World War II , and continue to drift downward thereafter until the early 1970s .
From 22.5 % of all incomes in 1929 , the income of the wealthiest households falls to 15.56 % of total income in 1932 , remains in the 16 % range during the Depression , then falls again sharply at the start of World War II in 1942 to 13.44 % of total incomes .
That decline continues from 1942 on for nearly three decades until 1970 when it stabilizes at only 9.09 % .
It then remains flat in the 9 % range throughout the 1970s reaching a low of 9.06 % in 1978 .
Thereafter the long , steady climb in income for the wealthiest 1 % begins anew , continuing for nearly thirty years from 1978 up to the present , at which point the wealthiest 1 % households have largely recovered in terms of income share to where they were in 1929 .
The picture is the same , and even more dramatic , for the wealthiest 0.1 % within the top 1 % , and even more so for the wealthiest 0.01 % within that 0.1 % .
In terms of today ’s households it means 140,000 families realized as much income as the remaining 1,260,000 households .
And 14,000 of those 140,000 earned in turn about half of the income of those 140,000 families .
It is a picture of extreme income concentration and gains at the very top .
Roughly the same picture prevails today , with the top 0.1 % earning about half of the total income of the top1 % and the 0.01 % earning in turn about half of the top 0.1 % households ’ income .
The incomes of the wealthiest 14,000 - 140,000 families are therefore driving the Great Reversal of income shares of the past thirty years , as well as the current widening income gap .
This overall picture is represented in the following table 1 :

The authors ’ data also show that the incomes of the wealthy 1 % have recovered from the 2001 recession , the economic shock of 9 - 11 , the dot.com bust of 2000 - 02 , and other negative developments earlier this decade .
Since 2003 the incomes of the wealthiest 1 % households are once again back on their long term expansion track that began in 1978 - 1982 .
In stark contrast , the 90 million working class families have not recovered at all from the 2001 recession and other economic effects , but have steadily fallen behind from 2001 through 2006 .
This dual fact is the defining economic characteristic and legacy of the George W. Bush presidency .
The following table 2 shows in absolute dollar terms ( adjusted for inflation in $ 2000 dollars ) how the wealthiest 1 % have fared since the ‘ Great Reversal ’ and widening income gap began .

Given the foregoing analysis of the income inequality gap ‘ from above ’ , the fundamental question becomes : what ’s behind it ?
What ’s determining the income shift of the wealthiest households the past six decades — three decades down and three decades back up ?
Unfortunately , that ’s a question that Picketty & Saez do n’t thoroughly address , despite their otherwise historic , excellent work revealing the movement of the wealthiest households ’ income over the past century .
The decline in the incomes of the wealthiest households , they argue , was due to the external shocks of depression and war .
However , causes for the historic recovery of the incomes of the wealthy since 1978 is less adequately addressed .
At times they briefly note the possible influence of major changes in the tax structure , such as during World War II or Reagan ’s 1986 tax cuts — the former reducing income inequality and the latter exacerbating it — as possible contributing causes for both the decline and then recovery in the incomes of the wealthy .
But their discussion focuses largely on income tax rates — and not to the proliferation of tax shelters , evasion , avoidance and fraud over the past 30 years and its role in the rise in the wealthy ’s income share .
This focus fails to account for the fact that the capital income gains produced by a quarter century of tax cuts for the rich are sheltered and shuffled offshore to the tune of $ 4 to $ 7 trillion to avoid their reporting to the IRS .
In a later published version of their work , Picketty & Saez do mention briefly the possibility that tax avoidance and tax evasion may be at play .
But income from tax shelters , evasion , avoidance and fraud simply do not show up in the IRS data used by the authors .
Therefore what ’s clearly yet to be added to their analysis is a thorough consideration of the proliferation of tax shelters , tax evasion schemes , and spreading tax fraud that have become rampant the past few decades , and the inclusion of that missing income in the overall estimation of the new income inequality in America .
Similarly , corporate profits gained at the expense of workers ’ income are also increasingly held and / or diverted offshore .
Like income sheltered offshore , the IRS data do not pick up the ‘ deferred ’ income not fully distributed by corporations to their wealthy shareholders .
Corporate retention of profits during World War II is generally acknowledged as having made a significant impact on the decline in incomes of the wealthiest 1 % during the 1940s , as Picketty & Saez themselves acknowledge .
And it appears profit retention in recent years is again at all time highs and may be contributing once again to the underestimating of capital incomes .
This contributing factor to income inequality is also not addressed in their analysis .
What the two above points mean is that widening income inequality may in fact be larger — in fact very much larger — than even that reported by the authors , not to mention the even more conservative four government sources .
Add $ 4 to $ 7 trillion in offshore tax shelters , today ’s runaway tax avoidance and evasion , hundreds of billions more every year in legally retained corporate profits , plus profits increasingly held offshore in violation of U.S. tax laws , unreported , and never repatriated by Multinational Corporations , and the real percent of national income going to the wealthiest households would certainly rise well above even reported levels .
Conservatively , the share of income of the wealthiest 1 % today is likely in the 22 % - 25 % range of total income .
That represents a return for the wealthiest households at least to the levels of the late 1920s , the halcyon years for their share of income on the eve of the Great Depression .
The Still Missing Link in the Debate on Income Inequality
Today ’s public debate on income inequality has focused on differences in estimating the actual size of the income gap , or else on solutions to the growing inequality that are totally unrelated to its roots causes and origins in recent corporate policies and practices .
Limiting discussion in this manner leaves out consideration of more fundamental questions such as : After narrowing for decades from the 1930s through the early 1970s , why did income inequality re-emerge thereafter ?
And why has it been widening progressively since the 1980s ?
Conspicuously missing in the discussion and debate on income inequality thus far today — by liberals and conservatives alike — is an analysis of those corporate and policies and practices that have been primarily responsible for the growing inequality since the 1970s — i.e. an analysis of policy from ‘ the bottom up ’ .
Part 2 of this article to follow in the subsequent issue of this magazine will attempt to identify and quantify the leading corporate policies since 1980 that have played a central role in the shift of more than $ 1 trillion annually today from the incomes of the 90 million working class families in America to the wealthiest households and corporations .
Part 2 will also consider the main positions taken by liberals and conservatives in the current public debate , showing how that debate has yet to address the fundamental causes of the growing inequality or to propose solutions based on those root causes .
The November 2006 Congressional elections and the retaking of the House and Senate by the Democratic Party places the question of income inequality in America , and policies responsible for it , once again at the forefront of agenda .
An opportunity exists to begin to do something about the growing inequality gap in America .
It remains to be seen , however , what will actually be done with the brief window of opportunity .
One cannot help but see the current transition period ahead , 2007 - 08 , in historical perspective and ask which road will be taken ?
Will the next few years , 2007 - 08 , represent a repeat of the similar transition period , 1976 - 1980 , during which great opportunities for defending and even advancing working class incomes were possible but were dissipated and lost , leading to a resurgence and new aggressiveness by corporate America and its right wing allies ?
Or will the next few years look more like 1946 - 50 , when working class families ’ wages , incomes , health care and retirement benefits improved significantly .
Whichever the outcome , accurately understanding the true root causes of that inequality , which lie in various corporate policies and practices of the last quarter century , is an absolute essential first step that has yet to be taken in the current public debate on the growing inequality of incomes in America .
“ The Trillion Dollar Income Shift , Part 2 ″
by Jack Rasmus
Copyright 2007
In Part 1 of this article in last month ’s issue it was shown how even conservative estimates based on U.S. government data reveal that income inequality in America today has reached extremes not seen since the 1920s .
More than $ 1 trillion a year in relative income shares is now being shifted annually — from roughly 90 million middle and working class families to the wealthiest households and corporations .
Corrections for limitations in the same government data suggest , furthermore , that the $ 1 trillion annual shift is likely a low end estimate .
The failure of government sources to consider massive offshore tax sheltering in recent decades , as well as the record high retention of profits by corporations in recent years , means the annual shift in income today may in fact be as high as $ 1.5 trillion a year or more .
Recent independent academic studies also briefly described in Part 1 show that the current decades - long growth in income inequality has been strongly skewed to the very high end — the gains in income accruing largely to the wealthiest 1 % , or 1.1 million of the roughly 114 million households in the U.S.
After four decades of narrowing income inequality in the U.S. from the 1930s through mid-1970s , IRS data shows that inequality of incomes has steadily grown since the late 1970s — accelerating under Reagan in the 1980s and once again even more rapidly under George W. Bush .
Notwithstanding the value of ‘ top down ’ academic studies of recent years , a thorough understanding of income inequality in the U.S. today requires a corroborating ‘ bottoms up ’ analysis of its root causes — causes which originate in various corporate and government policies and practices .
However , the current public debate on income inequality has yet to consider its root causes .
Part 2 therefore begins this task of identifying and quantifying those policies and practices that are responsible for the more than $ 1 trillion dollar annual shift in relative income annually today from 90 million working / middle class families to the wealthiest households and corporations in the U.S .
The Policy Origins of Income Inequality
The policies and practices responsible for today ’s widening income gap date back to the 1978 - 1982 period .
At that time , policies and practices — both corporate and government — underwent a fundamental shift .
The consequence of this shift has been a major restructuring of the U.S. economy since 1980 along a number of fronts .
That economic restructuring has assumed a number of forms , including a radical overhaul of jobs and job markets , widespread de-unionization , breakup of industry wide collective bargaining agreements , a realigning of the federal tax structure , a new free trade offensive by corporations and government , cost shifting of health care and pension plans , government assisted compression of the minimum wage and overtime pay , annual diversion of social security fund surpluses to the U.S. general budget to offset federal deficits , deregulation and privatization of entire industries — to name but the most significant .
Corporate lobbying and electoral strategies also underwent a fundamental overhaul between 1978 - 1982 , as new ways began to emerge that de-defined how the corporate elite functioned within the Republican Party .
Roughly a decade later , in the late 1980s , other changes also took place altering how corporate interests functioned within the Democrat Party .
The political reordering played a key role facilitating and enabling the economic restructuring .
New legislation and laws , executive orders , U.S. government rule making , federal agency decisions , etc. , subsequently followed the reordering of the political landscape , assisting the implementation of the new corporate policies and practices then emerging at the economic , industrial , and company ‘ shop floor ’ levels .
There has been a long term continuity in the new policies and practices that emerged after 1978 - 1982 .
Despite alternating Democratic or Republican administrations in both the Congress and the Presidency , the combination of policies that have defined the past quarter century have remained essentially unchanged since 1980 .
Over intervening years they have been simply adjusted , refocused , or given different relative emphases by the string of administrations and Congresses from Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush .
For example , during the Reagan period , 1980 - 88 , a relatively greater emphasis was placed on changing the tax structure , industry deregulation , shifting the power balance between unions and management , taking first steps to dismantling the post World War II retirement system , and encouraging job market restructuring .
During George Bush senior , 1988 - 1992 , the emphasis shifted in a relative sense to policies more strongly promoting U.S. corporations ’ foreign direct investment , trade , and on implementing ‘ neoliberal ’ policies in emerging offshore economies and markets .
Under Clinton , 1992 - 2000 , the focus centered largely on promoting and expanding free trade .
Additionally , the Clinton period was characterized by the introduction of new formulas for enabling health care cost shifting from corporations to workers , by accelerating the diversion of social security payroll taxes to the U.S. general budget to create the false appearance of declining federal budget deficits , and by passing government rules encouraging the further decline of the traditional private pension system .
Under George W. Bush , as under Reagan , once again tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy became the pre-eminent policy focus , while further expanding free trade assumed a close second policy priority , in particular in the case of U.S. - China trade .
In as much as government tax and trade policy have been among the largest contributing sources to the general income shift , the George W. Bush era has thus combined the worst of both the Reagan ( tax ) and Clinton ( trade ) eras in terms of income shifting policies .
Not surprisingly , the income inequality gap accelerated at the fastest rate during the Bush period , 2000 - 2006 .
Nor has the George W. Bush period been limited to a focus on tax and trade policies as means to shift income shares .
In addition to tax and trade - driven income inequality , under George W. Bush other new income - shifting policy initiatives were launched as well in areas health care cost shifting , retirement system restructuring , and legislated wage compression by government edict targeting overtime pay for millions of hourly paid workers .
While the above government - assisting tax , trade , wage and benefits policies were being implemented ‘ top down ’ between 1980 - 2006 , at the company and industry levels corporate policies and practices further contributing to the growing income inequality gap were being simultaneously overhauled from the ‘ bottom up ’ .
High on this ‘ bottom up ’ list was the corporate shift from full time , permanent jobs to part time , temporary , and independent contract work .
Growing consistently since the 1980s , today more than 44 million of the employed 137 million workforce in the U.S. are now part time , temporary and contract workers earning 60 - 70 % of the pay of full time workers and typically 20 % of benefits .
New company - industry driven de-unionization policies also launched in the 1980s have resulted after twenty five years in the decline of union membership from 22 % of the workforce in 1980 to barely 7 % in the private sector in 2006 .
Two decades of corporate job offshoring policies sent millions of high paying , decent benefit jobs in manufacturing , technology , and business professional services overseas , a loss filled with lower paying service ( which have been frequently part time , temp and contract ) jobs .
Corporate fringe benefits policies shifted fundamentally during the same period , resulting in the dismantling of more than 100,000 traditional pension plans and their replacement with cheaper cost 401 K plans ; the discontinuance and / or shifting of costs of health insurance plan coverage ; widespread unilateral corporate elimination of retirees health benefits ; reduction of paid vacation and other paid time off ; and other similar company - driven benefit cost reduction measures .
The two approaches — corporate policy changes at the company - industry level ( from ‘ the bottom up ’ ) and government policy changes ( from ‘ the top down ’ ) — worked in close concert with each other .
Government policy facilitated , enabled and accelerated the implementation of the company - industry economic restructuring .
For example :
Government corporate tax , depreciation , and free trade policies provided significant financial incentives to corporations for expanding offshoring of jobs and consequently dismantling and transferring abroad much of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. Government agency rule changes allowed corporations to extract pension fund surpluses for general business use and / or to delay properly funding pension plans .
Government bodies like the National Labor Relations Board directly aided corporate efforts to de-unionize , while government de-regulation and privatization of entire industries further decimated union membership ranks and undermined union bargaining effectiveness .
On the health front , government policy in the form of ‘ managed health care ’ under Clinton , and ‘ consumer driven health care ’ and ‘ health savings accounts ’ under George W. Bush , encouraged corporations to more rapidly shift health care costs to workers .
The net result of these related policies and practices — both ‘ bottoms up ’ and ‘ top down ’ — has been the continuing shift of more than a $ 1 trillion a year in relative income from 90 million working / middle class families to the wealthiest households and corporations in America .
Estimating the $ 1 Trillion Dollar Income Shift
The following represents a first effort at estimating the growing income inequality in the U.S. based on an analysis of the impact of policies and practices from ‘ the bottom up ’ .
Two sets of policy impacts are considered .
First , policies responsible for the reduction of relative income that once accrued to 90 million middle / working class families and the consequent shift of that income to corporations and the wealthiest households ;
Second , the estimation of sources of income received by corporations and wealthy households that have not been accounted for up to now in official government estimations ( e.g. the U.S. Census , Departments of Commerce , Labor , the Federal Reserve Board , the Congressional Budget Office ) of the income share of the wealthy .
Table 1 following summarizes some of the major shifts in middle / working class incomes that occurred in 2005 as a consequence of accumulated past corporate - government policies .
Given the magnitudes of these income shifts , it is not surprising that corporate profits have increased at double digit rates ( more than 10 % ) every quarter for the last three and a half years to more than $ 1.4 trillion ; or that CEOs and the top five managers of US corporations have increased their total share of national income from around $ 50 billion a year in 2001 to more than $ 140 billion a year in just five years ; or that the wealthiest 1 % ( 1.1 million ) households have grown their share of total national income reported back to levels of 20 % - 22 % of total national income not seen since the late 1920s .
TABLE 1 *
CATEGORIES OF INCOME SHIFT I :
( Shifting Income FROM Workers and Their Families )
Category of Income Shift 2005 Annual Amount ( $ billions )
De-Unionization ( Union wage differentials & secondary effects ) $ 156
Temporary / Part - Time / Contract Work Wage Reduction $ 250
Manufacturing / Job Offshoring Negative Net Wage Effects $ 95
Free Trade ( Net Export - Import Job Creation Wage Differential ) $ 19
Legislated Wage Compression ( Overtime Pay Elimination / Other ) $ 41
Health Care Benefits Cost Shift ( Premiums / Copays / Other ) $ 43
Defined Benefit Pension Plans ( Cash Outs / Liability Owed ) $ 85
Social Security Payroll Tax Surplus Diverted to General Budget $ 151
$ 840
The above numbers are conservative estimates .
They do not include , for example , other potentially significant categories associated with today ’s shifting of incomes .
Not accounted for in Table 1 are the increase in tax payments by the upper ten million or so of the ninety working families due to growing impact of the federal Alternate Minimum Tax ;
Or the full discontinuation of employer - provided health insurance coverage in addition to cost shifting of coverage in plans still provided by employers ;
Or the full discontinuation by employers of a pension instead of just replacement of a defined benefit pension with a lower cost 401 k plan ;
Or the shifting of disability insurance and workers compensation costs from employers to workers .
All such examples amount to further income shifted , in addition to that noted in Table 1 above .
The income shifted from working / middle class families thus may exceed even the $ 840 billion estimate above and may total well in excess of $ 1 trillion .
However , policies promoting domestic cost - driven income transfer ( from the 90 million households ) are not the whole picture .
U.S. corporations and wealthy households are able to expand their income additionally from speculative activities and from offshore investment activity as well .
And a good part of that income — corporate and individual — never gets reported in the income totals of the wealthiest households in the official data .
Table 1 categories represent income that is shifted from the 90 million households in the U.S. which then passes through the conduit of the corporation .
From there it may be disbursed by the corporation to shareholders , senior managers and CEOs in the form of dividends , interest payment , capital gains , and various forms of deferred and total compensation for senior management .
What is not disbursed may be accumulated and expended on corporate expansion ( i.e. invested ) or held by the corporation as retained profits .
Official figures for retained profits by U.S. corporations are now at the level of more than $ 500 billion a year , now running about $ 200 billion a year higher than long term historical averages .
And those figures only represent retained profits that are reported .
Largely unreported are additional profits by multinational corporations which get transferred by various accounting means to their offshore subsidiaries and affiliates and then held there as unrepatriated profits for years .
The precise totals for such unrepatriated profits are not known , either by the IRS or the US government .
A brief glimpse was provided , however , by the investment bank , Morgan Stanley , in 2005 when it publicly reported that the total in offshore unrepatriated profits held by US corporations amounted to about $ 700 billion .
But that was only what was publicly admitted at the time .
A third and even more opaque category of profits is that which is neither reported as retained or unrepatriated .
This third category consists essentially of unknown profits ( from domestic US or foreign operations ) that are diverted to offshore tax shelters and never reported to the IRS .
The latest unofficial indication of the level of income held today in offshore tax shelters — which now proliferate from islands in the Caribbean to Cyprus to the Seychelles in the Indian ocean to various locales throughout the Pacific archipelago — is about $ 7 trillion .
That is up from a ‘ mere ’ $ 250 billion in the mid-1980s .
It is reasonable to assume that at least $ 4 trillion of that $ 7 trillion is held by US corporations and wealthy households , the mix between corporate and individuals essentially unknown .
An annual additional net flow of income from the U.S. into such shelters is easily around $ 200 billion a year , not counting interest earned annually on the $ 4 trillion already there ( which would amount to another $ 300 billion assuming a highly conservative 7 % rate of return ) .
Discounting the additional $ 300 billion , the $ 200 billion never gets reported to the IRS and is therefore never counted as income of the wealthiest households or corporations .
The point is that neither retained profits , nor unrepatriated profits , nor income held in offshore shelters by corporations of individuals are ever calculated and added to the estimations of income of the wealthy in the U.S.
However , such profits and sheltered income should be considered as temporarily undistributed ‘ deferred income ’ of wealthy households that will eventually be paid out in subsequent years to those households .
Government tax policies have also had the effect of shifting income to the wealthiest households ( and corporations ) .
This , however , is based on income that does get reported .
This income to the wealthy has been a result of government policies providing record tax cuts on capital ( dividends , interest , capital gains , estate , gift tax , etc ) , extending from Reagan ’s then record $ 752 billion tax cut in the early 1980s to George W. Bush ’s sequence of annual tax cuts from 2001 to 2006 .
During George W. Bush ’s first term alone , more than $ 4 trillion in tax cuts were passed .
Studies show that approximately 80 % of these cuts are accruing to the wealthiest 20 % households , and largely in turn to the highest income groups within that 20 % .
Should the Bush tax cuts be made permanent , the amount will grow to $ 11 trillion , again with the highest income groups receiving the overwhelming lion ’s share of the cuts and income .
Additional corporate tax cuts amounting to more than a $ 1 trillion were also passed under Bush during the period and have contributed significantly to the previously noted bulge in corporate retained profits .
Thus , while corporate level policies have increasingly shielded unreported income from the IRS on behalf of the wealthy in various ways , government tax cut policies from Reagan through Bush Jr. have served to shift income to the wealthy from sources that are reported to the IRS .
Table 2 shows select categories of income shifted to the wealthiest households and corporations as a result of government tax policies , as well as from corporate - level policies diverting and / or shielding income .
TABLE 2
CATEGORIES OF INCOME SHIFT II :
( Shifting Income TO Wealthiest Households and Corporations )
Category of Income Shift 2005 Annual Amount ( $ billions )
Tax Sheltering , Avoidance , Evasion by Wealthiest Households $ 200
Bush Tax Cuts on Capital Incomes ( Dividends / Capital Gains/etc. ) $ 118
Bush Tax Cuts of Estate Taxes $ 29
Corporate Tax Windfall from Foreign Profits Repatriation $ 193
Corporate Profits Retention ( In excess of historical average ) $ 180
$ 720
Not included in the above income shifts in favor of wealthy households and corporations are various government direct subsidies to corporations and wealthy individuals which conservatively amount to additional tens of billions of dollars a year from the U.S. government .
Concluding Remarks
From the foregoing it is clear that there is , at minimum , a $ 1 - $ 1.5 trillion shift in relative income occurring annually today , the majority of which is being shifted from the approximately ninety million American working class families to the wealthiest 1 % , 1.1 million , households and corporations .
The income shifted from the 90 million working / middle class families alone amounts to about $ 1 trillion a year .
Even assuming the possibility of some double counting ( ie. overlap ) in the income categories in Table 1 , the amount of income shifted annually as result of policies represented in Table 1 is easily in the $ 700 billion to $ 1 trillion range .
Added to this must be categories of income in Table 2 which represent underestimations of income accruing to the wealthiest households due to tax sheltering , tax avoidance , evasion , and the record tax cuts to the wealthy over the past twenty - five years .
Even reducing the totals in Table 2 by half yields at minimum $ 300 - $ 400 billion a year in additional income to the wealthy .
When Tables 1 and 2 are therefore combined , the result is a cumulative total income shift of at least $ 1 trillion annually today .
The $ 1 trillion annual shift in relative income is roughly equivalent to the $ 1.09 trillion reported by the U.S. Commerce Department in Part 1 of this article .
It is likely this $ 1.09 annual income gap will continue to widen in the next few years , since gains from Bush ’s Capital Income tax cuts for the wealthy are projected to increase through 2010 while the policies which are responsible for shifting working families ’ incomes in areas of wages , jobs restructuring , job offshoring , shifts to more part - time / temporary / contract work , health and pension benefits cost shifts , payroll tax diversions , and the like show no sign of deceleration or reversal .
Furthermore , should recession occur by late 2007 - early 2008 , an increasingly likely prospect , the income shift will further accelerate as it always does during recessions .
In short , the outlook and probability is high that income inequality gap in the U.S. will continue to grow even further .

“ The Trillion Dollar Income Shift , Part 3 ″

Corporate and government policymakers today argue that the 90 million working and middle class households in the U.S. — who as a group have been experiencing an historic stagnation and decline in their incomes since at least 1980 — are themselves directly responsible for that stagnation and decline .
Today ’s growing income inequality exists , it is argued , because tens of millions of those households lack the necessary skills and education to ensure adequate income growth for themselves and their families in the new competitive global economy .
The lack of skills and education is the fundamental origin and cause of inequality .
The victim is thus the cause and not the consequence ; the mugged the mugger ; the truth its opposite .
In focusing on the alleged deficiency in education and skills of American workers , discussion of the root cause of inequality is conveniently crowded out and shunted to the margins of public debate .
The true origins of inequality — which lay in coordinated corporate and government policies of the past three decades — are ignored : origins which lay at root in the wholesale dismantling and offshoring of the U.S. manufacturing base ; in free trade - driven job loss and wage reduction ; in massive tax evasion , offshore tax sheltering , fraud , and fundamental tax shifting ; in the radical restructuring of job markets in the U.S. resulting in the wide - spread demise of unions , balkanization of what little remains of collective bargaining , and the displacement of tens of millions of previously permanent full time jobs with lower paid part time , temporary and contract work ; in the dismantling of traditional pension and health benefit plans , retirement and healthcare cost - shifting from corporations to workers , and the annual raiding of the social security trust fund by politicians ; in the gutting of minimum wage , overtime , and various forms of disability pay ; and in countless similar policies of lesser quantitative , but no less qualitatively important , impact .
The net consequence of the above panoply of corporate - government policies over the past quarter century has been — as was shown in preceding Parts 1 and 2 in this series of articles — the relative shift of more than a trillion dollars every year from the 90 million middle / working class households to the wealthiest 10 % ( and even 1 % ) and the corporations through which the income and wealth of this 10 % largely pass .
Bush & Co. Discover Inequality
Like the irrefutable reality of global warming , the fact of growing income inequality in the U.S. has become so undeniable that even George W. Bush this past January 2007 was provoked by journalists to admit , in one of his not infrequent slips of the tongue , that “ income inequality is real .
It has been rising for more than 25 years �?.
But for Bush and Co. the acknowledgement is merely tactical , and not a matter of grave national material or moral concern .
As a recent Wall St. Journal article , aptly entitled “ Bush Reorients Rhetoric , Acknowledges Income Gap� ? , pointed out : “ Top White House economic officials still do n’t consider today ’s inequality — the growing share of income going to those at the top — an inherently bad thing ; they believe it simply reflects the rising rewards accruing to society ’s most skilled and productive members �?.
The growing income gap for Bush & Co. simply raises the opportunity to find new ways to cleverly turn the growing concern over income inequality into the service of his pro-wealthy / pro-corporate legislative agenda .
Income inequality is tactically useful : token funding increases for worker ‘ Trade Adjustment Assistance ’ might help blunt growing protectionist sentiment in Congress and opposition to Bush & Co. free trade plans ( which reduce jobs and income ) .
It could help firm up support for new tax breaks for the self - employed to buy health insurance ( further shifting healthcare costs to workers ) .
Or ensure financial institutions can continue to rip - off college students with high cost education loans ( converting income from students ’ families to excess profits for those institutions ) .
In such ways Bush can appear to be addressing the problem of the growing income gap , while actually continuing to promote measures that in fact contribute to the ongoing growth of that gap .
The ‘ Official ’ Explanation
The core message of Bush & Co. on income inequality is that the skilled and educated are , by definition , the most productive and therefore the most worthy of a growing share of national income .
As Bush ’s Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers , Stanford University economist , Ed Lazear , put it : “ most of the inequality reflects an increase in returns to investing in skills �?.
Or as Federal Reserve Board chairman , Ben Bernanke , echoed in a recent address to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting : “ The degree of inequality in economic outcomes has increased for at least three decades … Education is the single greatest source of the long - term increase in inequality �?.
Like Bush , however , Bernanke in his speech also made it clear his concern about growing income inequality was really secondary ; the primary concern was that it might unleash anti-free trade protectionist sentiment that could inhibit continued , unfettered corporate offshore investing and job relocation ( read : free trade ) which in fact is a major cause behind income inequality .
The message that income inequality is the consequence of inadequate skills and education can be inverted and restated thus : if you are n’t among the relatively few receiving a larger and larger proportion of income today for yourself at the expense of the rest , it must be by definition that you are therefore unskilled , uneducated , and unproductive .
In other words , your decline in income is your own fault .
You have n’t kept up with the new global reality .
So get yourself more skills and education , become more productive as a consequence , and join the great income accrual party !
If such logic were correct , however , it would follow that corporate CEOs in America — who have raised their total compensation the past quarter century by nearly 400 per cent — must have really re-educated and re-trained themselves since 1980 .
To have raised their income by 400 % , they must be singly responsible for virtually all of the nearly 70 % gain in U.S. productivity since 1980 .
After all , the existence of their record income gains is proof of their rising contribution to productivity , which in turn is a consequence of rising education and skill levels .
Or so the argument goes .
In contrast , the 90 million households with declining incomes must have made no contribution whatsoever to productivity the past thirty years since their incomes have not risen at all over the period .
And if productivity is the consequence of one ’s improving one ’s education and skills , the majority of the 90 million must be therefore seriously deficient in education and skills .
The logically nonsensical argument that income gains are due to personal productivity — and in turn personal productivity is the consequence of improving one ’s education and skills — has its ultimate roots in 19th century neoclassical economic ideology .
That ideology maintained that income inequalities were the direct outcome of one ’s relative contribution to production and national income .
Nothing else mattered so far as one ’s share of national income was concerned .
If you got rich it was because you contributed more — i.e. were more productive .
If you were n’t rich it was because you did n’t .
But in the last analysis this was just an identity statement wrapped in circular reasoning — not scientifically proven fact or theory .
Corporate - government policies aimed at shifting income had no place in such 19th century theory .
Nor are such policies accounted for today in contemporary restatements of the theory .
The century - old notion that one ’s share of income was the sole consequence of one ’s contribution to productivity eventually made its way to conservative think tanks and elite academic institutions in the U.S. circa the late 1970s - early 1980s .
There it was refined , polished , and re-packaged for conservative policymakers intent on promoting a shifting of tax burdens and expanding free trade , accelerating deregulation of entire industries , assisting de-unionization , and the like .
Since 1980 the notion has become embedded in conventional economic wisdom where it remains to this day — in the form of the widely accepted official explanation of Bush & Co. that today ’s growing income inequality exists because those not enjoying income gains are less skilled , educated , less productive , and therefore unable to compete with those who are .
An alternative explanation of the relationship between education , productivity and relative income — never considered by Bush , Bernanke , Lazear , and colleagues — is the 90 million households ( and 108 million non-supervisory workers in them ) have been simply politically cut out of sharing in the 70 % productivity gains since 1980 .
Not due to inadequate skills and education .
But due to conscious policies adopted and implemented since 1980 by government and Corporate America designed to shift those gains to the wealthiest households and corporations .
For example , it is a fact that from 1947 to the mid 1970s annual incomes of middle and working class households rose roughly equal to the 3 % - 4 % annual productivity gains in the U.S. economy over that same period .
But since 1980 the roughly similar gains in productivity have gone all to CEOs , senior management , owners of capital incomes , have been funneled into offshore tax havens , allocated to offshore corporate investment projects , channeled into bloated corporate retained earnings accounts , or squirreled away in corporate coffers in foreign subsidiaries where they remain un-repatriated in order to avoid U.S. taxation .
Middle and working class families have been largely cut out of sharing the gains .
This has been especially true since Bush took office in 2001 .
But this did n’t happen because they were insufficiently educated or skilled .
It happened because of political and policy reasons .
Today ’s growing income inequality is not about insufficient skills , education , or personal contributions to national productivity .
It ’s about the political struggle over the distribution of the gains since 1980 and the new policies , corporate and government , that have been ‘ cutting out ’ the 90 million households from sharing in gains .
Media Pundits Right and Far Right
While the above view holds center stage , less sophisticated explanations of the causes of income inequality — and its solutions — have also entered public debate from the near and far right of the political - economic spectrum .
Representative of the various factions in the current debate on the far right — conservative think tank spokespersons , Wall St. Journal editorialists , or Cable news media pundits — assume typically one of three basic positions : either outright denial of any existence of an income gap , selective citation of the most conservative government data to lower the magnitude of the gap , or else they argue that ‘ globalism ’ and other mysterious ‘ market forces ’ beyond the control of any individual ( CEO ) , organization ( corporation ) or even country ( U.S. ) , are the root cause of growing income inequality .
Typical of this far right perspective are the views of Cato Institute economist , Alan Reynolds , who attacks the IRS data and conclusions of mainstream economists , Thomas Picketty and Emmanual Saez ( reviewed in Part 1 of this series ) based upon that data .
The work of Picketty and Saez shows , in particular , the extreme shift of income to the wealthiest 1 % households since the late 1970s .
But Reynolds attempts to deny outright the overwhelming evidence of the income shift .
He simply redefines the IRS data by adding categories of additional income to workers ’ share and by removing income from the share of income of the wealthy .
He then uses the most conservative gove

Adult humans possess some mathematical abilities that are unmatched by any other member of the animal kingdom but there is increasing evidence that the ability to count sets of objects nonverbally is a capacity that humans share with other animal species .
In PLoS Biology , Elizabeth Brannon and Jessica Cantlon discuss how humans and nonhuman animals share a capacity for nonverbal arithmetic .
The researchers tested monkeys and college students on a nonverbal arithmetic task in which they had to add the numerical values of two sets of dots together and choose a stimulus from two options that reflected the arithmetic sum of the two sets .
Monkeys perform addition like humans .
Monkeys and humans exhibited ratio - dependent accuracy and response time when solving addition problems .
For accuracy ( left panel ) , solid lines
show the predicted data from Equation 1 for humans ( red ) and monkeys ( gray ) at the best fitting w .
The R2 values for accuracy show the strength of the fit .
Response times ( right panel ) are fit with a linear function , and the corresponding R2 values are reported .
Error bars reflect the standard error among subjects .
The results indicate that monkeys perform approximate mental addition in a manner that is remarkably similar to the performance of the college students .
These findings support the argument that humans and nonhuman primates share a cognitive system for nonverbal arithmetic , which likely reflects an evolutionary link in their cognitive abilities .

The inspiration for the ‘ Magnetic Curtain ’ came through the book ‘ Hertzian Tales ’ by Anthony Dunn , which talks about the presence of electromagnetic fields , which are omnipresent and in our environment and form an independent invisible landscape .
How would a living space look , if it was n’t structured by the visible light , as it is normally the case , but by the invisible spectrum of electromagnetic fields ?
I developed materials which are formed by invisible forces or have an influence on them .
I experimented with microwave radiation and magnetic fields .
Iron particles dispersed in resin , exposed to a magnetic field would shape themselves along magnetic fieldlines and retain their form when hardened .
This let me to the idea of constructing a shapeable textile , which retains its shape through magnetism .
Cambridge University - where just 28 % of applications result in an offer - has admitted it is growing ' desperate ' for more applicants to its computer science courses .
Applications to study the subject have dramatically dropped since the start of the decade .
In 2000 , 500 students applied and 100 were accepted .
Last year , 210 applied and 70 were accepted .
The prestigious department is launching a publicity campaign to try to attract students up and down the UK , and is building a website that aims to bust popular myths about computer science .
Professors in the department - the oldest of its kind in the world - say unless they increase efforts to recruit , the " situation will become desperate " and it will be difficult to maintain quality .
They blame dropping numbers of applications on the " geeky " image of computer science and the misconception that all graduate jobs in the field are based in China and India .
Professor Andy Hopper , head of Cambridge 's computer laboratory , which runs the course , said : " We do n't portray ourselves to potential applicants in a contemporary way .
We do n't show that computer science knowledge can help solve some of the world 's global problems .
And we should . "
Hopper believes students are still deterred by the burst of the dotcom bubble early this decade , when shares in the internet sector rapidly rose then suddenly plummeted .
" We want potential students to know that the burst of the bubble is well and truly over .
There is a shortage of computer scientists in this country , jobs to be filled and the chance to get rich , " he said .
This summer a company set up by Cambridge computer science graduates - turned - lecturers , XenSource , was sold for $ 500 m ( £ 238 m ) .
Blueprints for the world 's first computers were drawn up at Cambridge by Charles Babbage in the 19th century .
Jack Lang , an affiliated lecturer at the lab , said : " People seem to think computer science is for nerds and for boys playing shoot - em - up games .
It 's just not true .
Not only that , they assume computer science is just about spreadsheets .
In fact , it is a subject that is ubiquitous in modern life .
It is the basis on which planes are controlled , our bank accounts are guarded from identity fraud and the NHS is kept running . "
Professor Peter Robinson , deputy head of the lab , said teenagers should not confuse computer science with IT when looking at university courses .
" Ours is a rigorous and demanding course that produces graduates able to both manage and innovate , " he said .
Outside Cambridge , the forecast for student recruitment in computer science courses across the UK is at best patchy .
Applications fell by 42 % between 2001 and 2004 , from 29,014 to 16,801 .
In 2007 , they rose by 0.1 % .
Dr Mike Rodd , the British Computer Society 's director of external relations , describes the national picture as " of great concern " .
" We think students assume all the graduate jobs in this sector are outsourced to China and India .
In fact , there are more vacancies in this country than ever before , " he said .
Computer scientists are smiling in one department , though .
This month the University of Southampton announced a 20 % increase in students for its computer science course - its biggest for five years .
Dr Paul Garratt , the course admissions tutor , puts the success down to integrating electronics into computer science .
" Students now are interested in how iPods and DVD players work ; that is electronic devices with in - built software and hardware , " he said .
XM and Sirius just cleared the largest ( and longest ) hurdle on their path to getting all conjoined : The Justice Department officially okayed Sirius 's $ 5 billion buyout of XM .
They said that the growth of mobile broadband " made it even more unlikely that the transaction would harm consumers in the longer term , " squashing arguments from radio and broadcasting groups the merger would be anti-competitive .
The DoJ thumbs up makes the merger more likely to happen , which Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin has repeatedly promised will make for cheaper , better programming .

Next stop is the FCC .
Chief Kevin Martin is vocally hot on competition , so he 'll probably squeeze them pretty hard on following through , though he 's likely to take the same stance as the DoJ :
The environment 's so scrambled right now , a single satellite radio company is n't really going to harm consumers .
And if they do raise prices and start sucking , people have plenty of other options to abandon them for .
On the other hand , they were both already on life support , so this jolt might not be enough to fully re-animte them .

In a Senate floor speech , Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - West Virginia ) inadvertently made plain that the proposed changes to the nation ’s spying laws radically expand how the government wiretaps inside the United States .
Rockefeller was decrying an amendment that would require the government to discard non-emergency evidence if a court later finds that the spying methods violate the law .
Rockefeller makes clear that the impending changes to the law are n’t about making it easier for the National Security Agency to listen in on a particular terrorism suspect ’s phone calls .
Instead , the changes are about letting the nation ’s spooks secretly and unilaterally install filters inside America ’s phone and internet infrastructure .
Rockefeller , the chief Democratic architect of the changes , explains :
Unlike traditional [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] application orders which involve collection on one individual target , the new FISA provisions create a system of collection .
The courts role in this system of collection is not to consider probable cause on individual targets but to ensure that procedures used to collect intelligence are adequate .
The courts ’ determination of the adequacy of procedures therefore impacts all electronic communications gathered under the new mechanisms , even if it involves thousands of targets .
In short , the changes legalize Room 641A , the secret spying room inside AT&T ’s San Francisco internet switching center that was outed by former AT&T employee Mark Klein .
That room sits at the center of a lawsuit against AT&T for its alleged illegal participation in the government ’s secret , warrantless spying program .
Under the new rules , secret spying court judges will no longer be evaluating whether the government has probable cause to eavesdrop on a spy or a terrorist who is inside the United States or to wiretap a particular foreigner via wiretaps inside the United States .
Instead the judges will simply evaluate descriptions of how NSA filters in the infrastructure are designed to not catch purely domestic traffic .
They can also approve or disapprove of how the spooks ‘ disguise ’ or reveal the identities of Americans who are one of the parties in any communication that involves a foreigners .
Rockefeller outlined the differences between the old legal architecture and the new one to argue against a amendment from Sen. Russ Feingold .
That amendment would require the government to throw out non-emergency communications that were caught by filters if judges later found the filter to be illegal ( and which the spooks did n’t fix in 30 days ) .
Feingold argues that without such a penalty the NSA wo n’t care at all what the courts say since there ’s no penalty for intercepting purely domestic phone calls in the current bill .
This marks a radical legal shift in how the nation ’s spooks interact with the nation ’s communication infrastructure .
And by infrastructure , I mean telephone switches for your landline , the server farms that serve up your Google search results , and the computers that handle and store emails for your Yahoo account .
The nation ’s current batch of politicians — save for a handful like Rep. Rush Holt ( D - New Jersey ) and Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - Wisconsin ) — see no problem in handing this unchecked power to the nation ’s spooks .
They collectively have bought into the lies , FUD and politically - expedient exaggerations deployed by the administration in order to legalize the President ’s rogue warrantless spying on Americans .
Hell , even one of Dem ’s blog fathers — Markos Moulitsas Zuniga of DailyKos — called opening the nation ’s infrastructure to the NSA a " single uncontroversial technical correction . "
For years , NSA watchers and former employees swore that NSA employees lived by the mantra ‘ Do n’t target Americans . ’
But as former White House General Counsel Alberto Gonzales publicly admitted in December 2005 , that rule secretly went out the window after 9/11 when the President ordered the NSA to point its surveillance equipment at Americans .
The NSA complied and so did the nation ’s phone companies , with the noted exception of Qwest , which later seems to have been punished for its belief in the nation ’s laws .
Now that same NSA is going to be granted by Congress virtually unchecked ability to order the nation ’s internet providers , phone companies and email providers to let the spooks build permanent filters inside their communication flows .
That NSA reports to a president who stands by his lawyers ’ arguments that nothing – not even the Constitution – limits his authority during the permanent war he unilaterally declared against ‘ terrorism . ’
And for the record , Sen .
Jay Rockefeller denies that intriguingly - timed AT&T and Verizon contributions to his re-election campaign bought his support for amnesty for spying telcos .
Hat Tip to emptywheel for noting Rockefeller ’s remarks .

TheGardenLady received this question from Ruth :
Is it true that fallen leaves can make good fertilizer ?
If the leaves can be used as fertilizer what are the benefits ?
Is it wise to mow / use as mulch the fallen leaves ?
Fallen leaves make excellent fertilizer .
This is nature ’s way of making fertilizer without help from mankind ; fallen leaves provide the nutrients that trees need and will enrich the soil – this includes increased soil organic matter , improved soil moisture holding , soil tilth ( the physical condition of a soil ) , structure and fertility plus it helps the community dispose of leaves .
See this link about recycling and mulching .
But the leaves left on a lawn or home garden have to be mulched unless you compost the leaves : Read The Garden Lady ’s column Would You Throw Out Your Old Gold .
It is very wise to mow your fallen leaves if you want to make the leaves into mulch and it is a lot easier than raking leaves .
There are mulching lawn mowers or mulching attachments for lawn mowers the mulching easier .
There are also mulchers – machines that you can buy to shred leaves .
But you can use a regular mower , going over the leaves a few times to be sure the leaves are finely cut .
It is easiest to mulch them by mowing them every few days so they do n’t accumulate .
You do n’t want any more than 6 inches of leaf mulch .
If the grass is visible after mowing , no other steps are necessary .
If there are clumps of chopped leaves , either re-mow in the other direction to chop the leaves further , or rake them up and put them in your compostpile .
And if you have too much mulched leaves for your lawn you can put them in your garden beds , flower beds and around trees and shrubs .

Researchers at Trinity College in Dublin , Ireland have gathered more evidence that the club drug and caffeine are a horrible combination .
Their report will appear in the March issue of European Neuropsychopharmacology , but it is already available online .
Previously , Andrew Harkin and his colleagues showed rats
develop a dangerously rapid heartbeat when they are given MDMA along with the everyday stimulant .
In their latest work , they verified that the blend of chemicals makes the lab animals feverish as well .
To test their theory , the scientists injected the drugs into Sprague Dawley rats and then probed them with a rectal thermometer .
When the unlucky critters received both chemicals , their body temperatures increased far more than when they were given MDMA or caffeine alone .
Harkin and his team followed up with some very thorough work in an attempt to understand how the two chemicals interact .
By giving rats a combination of caffeine and other drugs that have well - known effects on the brain , they were able to conclude that dopamine receptors , a type of nerve signaling protein , play a big role in the unusual overheating .
Arturo Medina and his homeless comrades pulled up chairs on a stretch of 13th Avenue , where they could sit and watch the world go by .
It was n’t the best view in Oakland , where vistas are as diverse as the people :
Up and down the street were garbage bins and bags , which have sat uncollected for nearly two weeks , ripening under the summer sun .
“ Yesterday , there was old meat , ” said Medina , an out - of - work truck driver with a Winnie - the - Pooh baseball cap .
“ It started smelling . ”
San Jose residents dodged a distasteful summer when the city ’s recycling hauler and the Teamsters averted a work stoppage Thursday .
East Bay residents have n’t been so lucky .
They are enduring a garbage showdown between the area ’s waste hauler and workers driving the garbage trucks and operating the equipment .
Amid contract talks , Waste Management of Alameda County locked out its Teamsters Local 70 on July 2 , and the replacement crew has been slowly learning the routes that cover 200,000 homes and 9,000 businesses in 10 cities .
On an average day , Waste Management picks up 4.48 million pounds of trash and weeds – the equivalent of five 747 planes .
Though garbage has been increasingly picked up as the weeks crept by , it ’s unclear why collection has been so scattershot – one block being serviced and the next untouched .
And in some neighborhoods , garbage was left behind while subcontractors picked up the gray recycling bins .
` Go back and catch up ’
“ We ’re trying to go back and catch up what we ’ve missed , ” said Monica Devincenzi , the company ’s municipal relations manager .
The company ’s area has a population of about 800,000 people .
A significant portion is Oakland : 85,000 of Waste Management ’s 200,000 residential customers .
Judging by their garbage – which still lined some sidewalks Saturday despite the company ’s boast earlier in the week that it had resumed normal service – they are people who sip Capri Suns and lunch on instant ramen ; they toss trash into their pink Chinatown grocery bags and gnaw short ribs down to the bone .
Or perhaps the feasting ants took care of any extraneous scraps .
In addition to the ants , there are flies , drawn to the ripped and leaking bags .
And , to Yvette Gross ’ dismay , there are maggots .
“ It ’s gross .
Ahhhh , ” said Gross , who lives on 11th Avenue and finally had her garbage picked up Saturday morning , instead of the normal Friday schedule .
Though the bags were gone , the critters that bred over the past weeks forced her to spend her afternoon scrubbing out the brown bins with a hose , a broom and a big bottle of bleach , which added a harsh top note to the neighborhood ’s already funky aroma .
“ As soon as I ’m finished , I ’m taking a very hot , hot shower with tons of soap , ” Gross said .
“ I feel horrible .
I hope they never do this again . ”
Gross has avoided the outdoors this month .
The breezes typically floating from the bay now carry a light whiff of garbage , like a woman brushing past with strange perfume .
It ’s not oppressive , but the constant scent pinches her chest , making it hard to breathe .
People are using different coping strategies .
At some homes , towers of trash bags sprout from the bins , testing gravity .
Others prefer a horizontal approach , lining the curb with bins , cardboard boxes and oversize - shopping bags all brimming with the detritus of modern life .
Signs everywhere
The sidewalk is littered with items that have escaped their containers : Q- tips , yellow Foster Farms styrofoam , grape stems with one or two purple orbs still hanging on .
On East 15th Avenue , Richard Chen kept mashing the bags deep into his bin , so the lid stayed on snug .
He has extra trash bags in his yard , by the pink hydrangeas .
He wo n’t put naked trash bags on the curb , worried about offending his neighbors on this modest street with tidy lawns .
“ It ’s not beauty , ” the chef said .
Some have unloaded their garbage at the city parks , putting it into the municipal cans .
Others have n’t even made that questionable effort , simply abandoning their bulging bags near vacant lots .
“ They must hurry with the decision , ” he said of the labor negotiations .
“ Let the street be clean . ”
No further negotiations were scheduled for the weekend , though Oakland has sued Waste Management for breach of contract , calling the festering situation a public nuisance .
Reenie Brown simply rolled her eyes and blew a raspberry when asked about the growing garbage .
She also lives on East 15th Avenue , where just one block over people have had their garbage removed .
“ I do n’t know what ’s going on , ” she said , as she tried to start her sputtering car .
“ When we hear a truck , we get excited .
But it ’s always for someone else . ”

Stopping children from watching TV really does make them healthier and less fat , according to one of the few studies to observe the effects of intervening directly in their watching habits .
" Television viewing is related to consumption of fast food and foods and beverages that are advertised on television .
Viewing cartoons with embedded food commercials can increase choice of the advertised item in pre-schoolers , and television commercials may prompt eating , " Leonard Epstein of the State University of New York in Buffalo and his colleagues wrote in the journal Archives of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine .
He and his team investigated whether encouraging or coercing children into cutting down their viewing time made them healthier .
They started with 70 children aged between four and seven who were in the most obese 25 % of the population , according to measurements of their body mass index .
In half of the children 's homes the team fitted limiting devices to their TVs and computers which prevented them from watching for more than a pre-set amount of time .
The children could decide when and what they watched , but if they exceeded their weekly allowance the device would shut down until the end of the week .
Each month , the team reduced the children 's TV time by 10 % until it had dropped by a half compared with the original score of 25 hours .
On average the restricted children watched 17.5 hours less TV a week , compared with 5.2 hours less for the group that did not have any restrictions .
The team found that in the group who had their TV watching curtailed , the children 's daily calorie intake dropped by more than 300 from 1,550 , or around 150 more than the drop in the control group .
The TV - restricted group also lost weight and ended up with an age - adjusted BMI more than 0.2 lower , from around 19.2 , after two years than at the start .
Their reduction was more than 0.1 higher than the control group .
The first group were also less sedentary , but they were not more active .
The authors state that fitting a device to limit TV viewing time takes the pressure off busy parents who are trying to police their children 's activity .
" Using technology to modify television viewing eliminates parental vigilance needed to enforce family rules and reduces the disciplinary action needed if a child exceeds his or her sedentary behaviour limits , " they wrote .
In what can only be classified as yet another crushing blow to the embattled HD DVD camp , rent - by - mail giant Netflix has just announced its intention to only stock Blu-ray titles in the future .
Netflix justified its decision by pointing out the fact that most Hollywood studios seem to be converging solely around the Sony - backed format -- a fact that 's all too familiar to Toshiba and friends .
With both Blockbuster and now the ' Flix having eschewed HD DVD for BD , it 's gonna get harder and harder to even find a place to rent those former discs in the first place , let alone one that has a decent selection .
Update :
It looks like all hope is not lost for HD DVD renters .
Not only does Blockbuster Online still carry titles in the endangered format , but Netflix should continue offering a limited selection of discs until current stock is phased out around the end of the year .
Since Josh has already mentioned it , I had better give it a full account .
Back in 2003 when I just started my postdoc in PSD Lab in University of Tokyo , my colleagues there were discussing about the third homomorphism theorem .
The theorem says that if a function f can be expressed both as a foldr and a foldl :
f = foldr ( ≪ ) e
f = foldl ( ≫ ) e
there exists some associative binary operator ⊚ such that
f [ ] = e
f [ a ] = a ≪ e = e ≫ a
f ( xs ⧺ ys ) = f xs ⊚ f ys
Being a list homomorphism implies the potential of parallel computation .
The paper we studied was , of course , The Thrid Homomorphism Theorem by Jeremy .
The aim then was to automatically , or semi-automatically , derive ⊚ , given ≪ , ≫ , and e .
The motivating examples include :
f = sum , where ⊚ can simply be + .
, where can simply be .
f = sort , where ⊚ can be the function merge merging two sorted lists .
, where can be the function merging two sorted lists .
f = scanr ⊛ e .
While scanr appears to be an inherently sequential function , it is actually possible to compute f “ from the middle ” , provided that ⊛ is associative , if we take xs ⊚ ( y : ys ) = map ( ⊛y ) xs ⧺ ( y : ys ) .
Can we come up with a method to derive ⊚ for all these examples ?
I myself was not particularly interested in automation .
I was interested in the challenge for two reasons .
Firstly , it appears that some kind of inverse function is needed .
Secondly , when I looked at Jeremy ’s proof , I felt there is a relational proof inside waiting to be discovered .
So I tried .
Setting the Stage
For the ease of point - free calculation , we define alternatives of folds where the input is paired with the base - cases :
foldrp ( ≪ ) ( [ ] , a ) = a
foldrp ( ≪ ) ( x:xs , a ) = x ≪ foldrp ( ≪ ) ( xs , a )
foldlp ( ≫ ) ( a , [ ] ) = a
foldlp ( ≫ ) ( a , xs⧺ [ x ] ) = foldlp ( ≫ ) ( a , xs ) ≫ x
The advantage is that we can shift a suffix or a prefix of the input list to the base case .
That is :
foldr ( ≪ ) e ( xs⧺ys ) = foldrp≪ ( xs , foldr≪ e ys )
foldl ( ≫ ) e ( xs⧺ys ) = foldlp ≪ ( foldl ≪ e xs , ys )
or , in point - free style :
foldr ( ≪ ) e . cat = foldrp ( ≪ ) . ( id × foldr ( ≪ ) e ) ( 1 )
foldl ( ≫ ) e . cat = foldlp ( ≫ ) . ( foldlp ( ≫ ) e × id ) ( 2 )
where cat ( xs , ys ) = xs ⧺ ys and ( f × g ) ( a , b ) = ( f a , g b ) .
The key property , however , is one that was shown in ( possibly among other literature ) Algebra of Programming : for a simple relation ( i.e. a partial function ) S , we have :
S . S° .
S = S
where ° stands for relational converse ( the relational concept of an “ inverse function ” ) .
Recall our aim : given f , look for ⊚ such that f xs ⊚ f ys = f ( xs⧺ys ) .
It translates to point - free style as ⊚ . ( f × f ) = f . cat .
Proving the Theorem
The third homomorphism theorem is a direct corollary of the following lemma :
Lemma 1 : f = foldr ( ≪ ) e = f = foldl ( ≫ ) e implies that f is prefix and postfix insensitive .
That is : f xs = f xs ’ ∧ f ys = f ys’ ⇒ f ( xs⧺ys ) = f ( xs ’⧺ys ’ ) .
In point - free style : f . cat . ( f°. f × f°. f ) = f . cat .
Once we have the lemma proved , the theorem follows by taking ⊚ = f . cat .
( f °× f ° ) .
It has to be a ( partial ) function because ⊚ . ( f × f ) = f . cat is a function .
Futhermore , ⊚ is associative because cat is .
The proof of Lemma 1 is simply some applications of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and S .
S° .
S = S :
f . cat
= { ( 1 ) }
foldrp ( ≪ ) . ( id × f )
= { since f . f° . f = f }
foldrp ( ≪ ) . ( id × f ) .
( id × f° . f )
= { ( 1 ) }
f . cat .
( id × f° . f )
= { ( 2 ) }
foldlp ( ≫ ) . ( f × id ) .
( id × f° . f )
= { since f . f° . f = f }
foldlp ( ≫ ) . ( f × id ) .
( f° . f × f° . f )
= { ( 2 ) }
f . cat .
( f° . f × f° . f )
The proof is still the same as that of Jeremy ’s , but in a relational disguise .
Refining to Functions
To derive actual algorithms , we have yet to refine ⊚ = f . cat .
( f°× f° ) so that it uses functional components only .
We shall pick some g ⊆ f° whose domain equals the range of f , such that ⊚ = f . cat . ( g × g ) .
( An equality , rather than inclusion , holds because ⊚ in both definitions are partial functions having the same domain . )
For example , consider the special case sum = foldr (+) 0 = foldl (+) 0 .
Here ⊚ = sum .
cat . ( sum°× sum° ) .
One simple choice is to pick wrap ⊆ sum° , where wrap a = [ a ] .
In this case a ⊚ b = sum [ a , b ] = a + b .
For sort , define sorted = ran sort .
It is a partial function such that sorted xs = xs iff xs is sorted .
Notice that sorted ⊆ sort° .
Therefore , a possible choice for ⊚ would be sort .
cat .
( sorted × sorted ) — concatenating two sorted lists , and sort them again .
Jeremy then went on with this definition and proved that ⊚ = merge , taking advantage of the fact that both input lists are sorted .
Some more Properties
Some more properties are needed to deal with scanr .
The following properties allow foldrp and foldrp to proceed by shifting elements of the list to the base case :
foldrp ( ≪ ) ( xs⧺[ x ] , a ) = foldrp ( ≪ ) ( xs , x ≪ a )
foldlp ( ≫ ) ( a , x :xs ) = foldlp ( ≫ ) ( a ≫ x , xs ) ( 3 )
When simple approaches of refining ⊚ = f . cat .
( f°× f° ) does not work , the following approach sometimes does .
Since f is a fold , one may attempt to take one of the f° as an unfold , thus forming an “ unfold , then fold ” pattern :
⊚ = f . cat .
( f°× f° )
= { ( 1 ) }
foldrp ( ≪ ) . ( id × f ) . ( f°× f° )
⊇ { since f .
f° ⊇ ran f }
foldrp ( ≪ ) . ( f°× ran f )
= { since f = foldl ≫ [ ] }
foldrp ( ≪ ) . ( ( foldl ≫ [ ] ) °× ran f )
Symetrically ,
⊚ = foldlp ( ≫ ) . ( ran f × ( foldr ≪ [ ] ) ° ) ( 4 )
Scanr “ from the Middle ”
Finally , consider f = scanr ⊛ e for some associative ⊛ with identity e ( that is , e ⊛ x = x ⊛ e = x ) .
A scan can be defined both as a foldr and a foldl as below :
scanr ⊛ e = foldr ≪ [ e ]
x ≪ ( y : xs ) = x ⊛ y : y : xs
scanr ⊛ e = foldl ≫ [ e ]
xs ≫ x = map ( ⊛x ) xs ⧺ [ e ]
From ⊚ = f . cat .
( f°× f° ) , we can prove that xs ⊚ ( y : ys ) = map ( ⊛ y ) xs ⧺ ys .
Here is the inductive case :
xs ⊚ ( x : y : ys )
= { ( 4 ) }
foldlp ( ≫ ) ( xs , ( foldr ≪ [ e ] ) ° ( x : y : ys ) )
= { definition of ≪ , let z ⊛ y = x }
foldlp ( ≫ ) ( xs , z : ( foldr ≪ [ e ] ) ° ( y :ys ) )
= { ( 3 ) }
foldlp ( ≫ ) ( xs ≫ z , ( foldr ≪ [ ] ) ° ( y : ys ) )
= { ( 4 ) }
( xs ≫ z ) ⊚ ( y : ys )
= { induction }
map ( ⊛ y ) ( xs ≫ z ) ⧺ ys
= { definition of ≫ }
map ( ⊛ y ) ( map ( ⊛ z ) xs ⧺ [ e ] ) ⧺ ys
= { map , e identity }
map ( λv → ( v ⊛ y ) ⊛ z ) xs ⧺ [ y ] ⧺ ys
= { associtivity of ⊛ }
map ( λv → v ⊛ ( y ⊛ z ) ) xs ⧺ [ y ] ⧺ ys
= { z ⊛ y =x }
map ( ⊛ x ) xs ⧺ [ x ] ⧺ ( y:ys )
Prologue
Given the complexity of the proof above , I did not think there was a hope to automatically construct ⊚ for a reasonably useful set of list homomorphisms .
My colleagues were talking about “ weak inverses ” — their attempts to look for a refinement of f° , which I considered too ad - hoc .
Being just graduated from AoP , I was perhaps too arrogant and proud of all the clever derivation we did to care about automatic program construction .
( Like Jeremy , in the end of my thesis I quoted “ 善數不用籌 策 ( Those who good at calculation need no mechanical aids ) ” from 老子 Lao Tzu .
And did n’t Dijkstra say “ I hardly used the computer they gave me .
I was perfectly happy without it . ” ? )
The relational method , which seemed to cover everything , gave me a false feeling that I knew the problem inside out .
Last year , however , my colleagues and I met again and I was told that they eventually published a paper on this subject :
Kazutaka Morita , Akimasa Morihata , Kiminori Matsuzaki , Zhenjiang Hu , Masato Takeichi .
Automatic Inversion Generates Divide- and - Conquer Parallel Programs , PLDI 2007 .
They focused on weak inverses that returns only lists with fixed lengths .
The advantage is that calculations like the one above are no longer necessary — since the lists are of fixed - length , ⊚ always takes constant time .
On the other hand , scanr and scanl are special cases dealt with on a different level .
Such distinction is enforced by the language they allow to construct f .
No , they do not seem to have handled sort .
But their approach still covered a reasonably useful collection of functions .
Well , I think the moral is that we cannot just stop when it appears that is no elegant solution that suits our taste .
It sometimes pays to get our hands dirty , through which we may eventually discover the beauty within .

An unmarried teacher alleges that she was forced to resign from a Minnesota Catholic school after informing the principal she was pregnant .
The teacher , " Emily , " who asks that her last name not be used , says she is coming forward in order to help other women who may be in a similar situation .
" I just do n't want it to happen to anybody else , " says the former 5th - grade teacher at St. Felix School in Wabasha .
" I feel it was an unjust act and I do n't feel that ... anybody deserves to be treated in the way I was . "
School officials told the Associated Press that they could not comment on personnel matters .

Obama 's National Security Speech
Remarks of Senator Barack Obama
Endorsement by US Admirals and Generals
Chicago History Museum
March 12 , 2008
t is my privilege to be joined by some of the distinguished generals and admirals supporting my campaign .
They have defended the American people and stood up for American values with honor and distinction .
Between them they have served nine Commanders - in - Chief , and I look forward to continuing to draw on their counsel throughout my campaign and beyond .
As as a candidate for the presidency , I know that I am running to be Commander - in - Chief - to safeguard this nation 's security , and to keep our sacred trust with the men and women who serve .
There is no responsibility that I take more seriously .
This is something that I 've talked about throughout this campaign .
Because I believe that any candidate for President must present the American people with a clear vision of how we will lead .
There are real differences between the candidates , and important issues to debate - from ending the war in Iraq , to combating terrorism , to devising new strategies and new capabilities to confront 21st century threats .
But recently , we 've seen a different kind of approach .
Instead of a serious , substantive debate , we 've heard vague allusions to a " Commander - in - Chief threshold " that seems to be about nothing more than the number of years you 've spent in Washington .
This is exactly what 's wrong with the national security debate in Washington .
After years of a divisive politics that uses national security as a wedge to drive us apart , how much longer do we have to wait to bring this country together to confront our common enemies ?
After years of being told that Democrats have to talk , act and vote like John McCain to pass some Commander - in - Chief test , how many times do we have to learn that tough talk is not a substitute for sound judgment ?
After years of a war in Iraq that should 've never been authorized , how many more politicians will appeal to the American peoples ' fears instead of their hopes ?
This moment - in this election - is our chance to put an end to a divisive politics that has done nothing to keep America safe , or to serve our men and women in uniform as well as they are serving us .
Because the real Commander - in - Chief threshold does n't have to do with years tallied up in Washington , it has to do with the judgment and vision that you will bring to the Oval Office .
On the most important national security question since the Cold War , I am the only candidate who opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning .
This judgment was not about speeches , it was about whether or not the United States of America would go to war in Iraq .
Because we did , we took our eye off al Qaeda ; we have lost thousands of lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars ; our military is overstretched ; and our security and standing has been set back .
So do n't tell me that the decision to go to war was just a speech , because it was far more than that to the men and women who have served - and continue to serve heroically in Iraq .
When I spoke out against the war , I said that I was not opposed to all wars .
In fact , one of the central reasons why I opposed going to war in Iraq is that we had yet to finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban .
That remains true today .
That is why I have consistently called for an increased commitment to Afghanistan , and why I called last August for at least two additional combat brigades to support our mission there .
And that is why I will end the war in Iraq when I am President , and focus on finishing the job in Afghanistan .
I will never hesitate to defend this country and our critical interests .
That is why I am the only candidate who has made it clear that we cannot tolerate any safe - haven for terrorists who threaten America .
But we must also use all elements of national power to combat the threats of the 21st century , and that means deploying the power of American diplomacy before we deploy our troops .
That is why we must be willing to talk to the leaders of all nations - friend and foe .
The threats we face are increasingly unconventional , and they call for new approaches .
I have worked on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to combat the challenges of the 21st Century - securing loose weapons and nuclear materials from terrorists ; working to stop ethnic killing and genocide in Africa ; and investing in our ability to combat epidemic diseases like avian flu that can be deadly at home and sew instability abroad .
And one theme that I hear in talking to military officers - whether generals and admirals , or the mid-level officers who will lead tomorrow 's military - is that we need new capabilities to respond to this century 's new threats .
We must maintain our overwhelming conventional advantage - and I will .
We also need to increase the size of our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 marines to relieve the strain on our troops , and to increase our capacity to put boots on the ground .
We need to invest in capabilities like civil affairs , foreign languages , and training foreign militaries , so that we can confront nimble enemies .
We need to give our civilian agencies the ability to operate alongside our military in post - conflict zones and on humanitarian missions .
And we must inspire a new generation of Americans to serve their country , in the military and in a civilian capacity .
And let me be very clear : when I am Commander - in - Chief , I will seek out , listen to , and respect the views of military commanders .
Under this Administration , too often we have seen civilian control turned into an expectation that the uniformed military will be punished if they tell the President what he needs to know , rather than what he wants to hear .
When I am President , the buck will stop with me , but we will restore trust and open dialogue between the military and civilian leadership .
Finally , it is the sacred obligation of any Commander in Chief to give the men and women who have served the care and support they have earned .
That is what I have tried to do on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee - working to improve care and benefits for wounded warriors and their families , and to enhance screening and treatment for PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury , the signature wounds of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
As President , I will ask myself every day whether I am serving our troops and veterans as well as they have served America .
That means only sending them into harm 's way when we absolutely must ; providing them with a clear mission and the equipment they need to do the job ; standing by them when they come home ; and helping them live their dreams after they leave the service .
Like the men who have joined me on this stage today , my story is only possible in America .
It is the story of my grandfather , who marched in Patton 's Army ; and my father , who crossed the globe to be a part of the dream that my grandfather defended .
An America that secures its people , and stands as a light of hope for the world .
That is the America that I will defend as Commander - in - Chief , drawing on the counsel of military commanders and the courage and conviction of the American people .
An America where we meet the challenges of the 21st century with sound judgment , clear plans , and a common purpose .

One of the things that your typical geek does not get enough of , besides sex of course , is sleep .
Whether it ’s because we ’re staying up late at night surfing Digg , writing code , or Photoshopping George Bush ’s head onto Linsey Lohan ’s body , it ’s a good bet we ’re all a few hours short of getting the recommended eight hours of snooze - time a night .
Coffee and soda companies bank on this fact and most of us make it through the day riding a sleepy / hyper / sleepy rollercoaster .
Despite the fact that studies have shown that power naps are more effective than caffeine , most companies and managers frown upon employees sleeping on the job .
But not the Japanese .
They may have crazy ass TV shows and an unnatural affinity for strange robots , but they ’re surprisingly enlightened on the subject of workplace naps ( perhaps because they are all expected to overwork themselves to death ) .
They call them “ inemuri “ , which translates to “ to be asleep while present ” .
There are some strict ground rules though .
First , you have to stay upright .
You ca n’t put your face down on your keyboard to show that you are still “ socially engaged ” .
Secondly , you have to be either high up or low down in the company ; the middle managers get screwed out of the benefits of inemuri .
The next time your boss yells at you for sleeping on the job tell them to chill out and send them to this post .
Your quick round of inemuri will keep you alert , on your toes , and productive .
Bonzai !!!

No True “ mod_ruby ” Is Damaging Ruby ’s Viability On The Web
By Peter Cooper
Note :
This post was drafted before DHH 's " The deal with shared hosts " post , but as it covers similar ground , it 's worth reading too .
DHH 's opinion appears to be that shared hosts should put up or shut up , but I disagree and suggest this is something we need to solve as a community .
Most of us in the Ruby community know that deploying Web apps powered by Ruby can be like pulling teeth .
Running up simple CGI scripts is easy enough , but once you move on to more robust systems , using things like Rails , Sinatra , Ramaze , Merb , Camping , whatever , it deviates significantly from the well - established " just upload it " route .
The reason is that applications built around these frameworks tend to expose themselves directly via HTTP daemons , using libraries such as Mongrel or WEBrick , and then requests from Web servers like Apache need to be proxied through to them , but this feels like a hackish workaround to the fact we lack a proper " mod_ruby . "
In the PHP world , things are a lot simpler .
Almost universally Apache comes with mod_php built in , and PHP scripts uploaded to any sort of Web space , shared or not , tend to " just work . "
This is POLS ( Principle of Least Surprise ) in deployment .
With Rails apps , say , you either need to go to a specialized , over priced Web host , rig up Apache with reasonably fragile FastCGI solutions , set up a Mongrel cluster separately to Apache and then do some proxying , or even deploy a whole new stack based around Mongrel clustering , Nginx and the like .
This makes deploying a Ruby application offputting to the typical webmaster and is , in my opinion , damaging Ruby 's viability as a mass market Web application technology .
If I 'm going to put up a blog , I 'll use WordPress ( Ruby Inside actually does ) .
If I want a forum , I 'll find one of the many PHP variants .
Why ?
Easy deployment on well established , easy to replicate application stacks .
Since PHP , Python ( including Django apps ) , and even Java apps ( via Tomcat ) can be deployed reasonably easily on an Apache stack with the relevant modules installed , should n't we be able to get mod_ruby doing the same thing ?
I 'm definitely willing to help in whatever way I can on this , as I 'd love to see Ruby / Rails / whatever apps as easy to deploy as PHP apps !
This is the main reason Ruby powered forum and blog systems are n't beating WordPress and vBulletin .
Unfortunately , I 'm pretty dumb when it comes to the technicalities of Apache modules and rigging these things up , but if the main impediment is money , publicity , programmers , or whatever , I 'm sure we can figure something out as a community .
So some questions arise :
1 ) Is there / why is n't there a version of mod_ruby that does n't have the " class sharing " issue ?
What is the technical impediment ?
2 ) Is there any immutable reason that Ruby apps could n't , in the future , be deployed in a PHP - esque fashion ?
When we have this ease of deployment , imagine how significantly the market for Ruby powered Web sites and applications could grow !
But , first , is it even possible ?
We 'll await answers from the technical wizards out there , but if we can take even a single step forward on this , we 're getting somewhere .
Former prime minister John Howard is to receive an award from the influential think tank when he visits Washington next month in one of his first public engagements since losing office .
It calls for the new surge in a report to be published next month .
Details have been revealed in the Army Times , an independent newspaper serving US troops .
Among its recommendations include sending a brigade to Oruzgan province , where Australian troops are based .
If adopted , the plan could double the number of foreign forces in Oruzgan , where about 2500 Australian and Dutch troops are over - stretched .
A US Army brigade can number between 3000 and 5000 troops .
According to the Army Times , the AEI says the the extra troops would be on top of the 3200 additional troops the US is sending to Afghanistan .
The AEI report , while not commissioned by the US Government , was drafted by a team of experts headed by Fred Kagan , a military historian and author of a paper that strongly influenced President George Bush 's Iraq surge .
The Federal Government has asked the defence force to review the composition of Australia 's current commitment of 1000 troops .
The review , revealed by Australian Defence Force head Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston late last month , prompted speculation that the Government could reduce the number of army engineers involved in reconstruction and increase the number of infantry .
The review is part of what Air Chief Marshal Houston said was a " comprehensive , whole - of - country strategy for Afghanistan , which is something that has been lacking up to now " .
Following talks in Washington last week , Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said there was " no current suggestion " of Australia sending more troops to Afghanistan .
But he said the Government was looking at a greater non-military contribution , including aid , training and building the capacity of the Afghan Government .
Australia 's rethink mirrors an urgent international review of the western effort in Afghanistan , amid warnings the US and NATO risk losing the fight with Taliban insurgents .
A study by US military and diplomatic experts last week warned that the prospect of losing significant parts of Afghanistan to Islamic extremists " has moved from the improbable to the possible " .
Unless more troops were sent and the foreign effort had a unified leadership and strategy , Afghanistan could revert to a " failed state " , said the report by the Afghanistan Study Group , co-chaired by retired US Marines general James Jones , a former NATO commander .
A separate report released in Washington , also chaired by General Jones , said : " Make no mistake , NATO is not winning in Afghanistan . "
In a comment that also reflects Australia 's emerging new approach , the report said " the future of Afghanistan will be determined by progress or failure in the civil sector " .
Western strategy in Afghanistan will be the focus of a summit of NATO heads of government in Bucharest in April , which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is likely to attend .
Thane Heins is nervous and hopeful .
It 's Jan. 24 , a Thursday afternoon , and in four days the Ottawa - area native will travel to Boston where he 'll demonstrate an invention that appears – though he does n't dare say it – to operate as a perpetual motion machine .
The audience , esteemed Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Markus Zahn , could either deflate Heins ' heretical claims or add momentum to a 20 - year obsession that has broken up his marriage and lost him custody of his two young daughters .
Zahn is a leading expert on electromagnetic and electronic systems .
In a rare move for any reputable academic , he has agreed to give Heins ' creation an open - minded look rather than greet it with outright dismissal .
It 's a pivotal moment .
The invention , at its very least , could moderately improve the efficiency of induction motors , used in everything from electric cars to ceiling fans .
At best it means a way of tapping the mysterious powers of electromagnetic fields to produce more work out of less effort , seemingly creating electricity from nothing .
Such an unbelievable invention would challenge the laws of physics , a no - no in the rigid world of serious science .
Imagine a battery system in an all - electric car that can be recharged almost exclusively by braking and accelerating , or what Heins calls " regenerative acceleration . "
No charging from the grid .
No assistance from gasoline .
No cost of fuelling up .
No way , say the skeptics .
" It sounds too good to be true , " concedes Heins , who formed a company in 2005 called Potential Difference Inc. to develop and market his invention .
" We get dismissed pretty quickly sometimes . "
It 's for this reason the 46 - year - old inventor has learned to walk on thin ice when dealing with academics and engineers , who he must win over to be taken seriously .
Credibility , after all , can't be invented .
It must be earned .
" I have to be humble .
If you say the wrong thing at the wrong time , you can lose support . "
The creation in question is a new kind of generator called the Perepiteia ( read related story " Holy crap , this is really scary " ) , which in Greek theatre means an action that has the opposite effect of what its doer intended .
Heins torques up the definition to mean " a sudden reversal of fortune that 's a windfall for humanity . "
Deep down , Heins has high hopes .
But he also realizes that merely using those controversial words – " perpetual motion " – usually brands a person as batty .
In 2006 , an Irish company called Steorn placed an advertisement in The Economist calling on all the world 's scientists to validate its magnet - based " free energy " technology .
Steorn was met with intense skepticism and accused of being a scam or hoax .
Seventeen months later the company has failed , despite worldwide attention , to prove anything under scrutiny .
Well - educated people , from Leonardo da Vinci to Harvard - trained engineer Bruce De Palma ( older brother of film director Brian De Palma ) , have made similar claims of perpetual motion only to be slammed down by the mainstream scientific community .
Heins has an even greater uphill battle .
He is n't an engineer .
He does n't have a graduate degrees in physics .
He never even finished his electronics program at Heritage College in Gatineau , Quebec .
" I have mild dyslexia and do n't do well in math , so I did n't do very well in school , " he says .
What he does have is a chef 's diploma , and spent time as chef at the Canadian Museum of Civilization before launching his own restaurant in Renfrew called the Old Town Hall Tea Room .
He has also had political ambitions .
In 1999 he ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Green Party of Ontario , deciding a year later to run as an independent in the federal election .
Today , Heins is focused on showing his invention to anybody willing to see it , in hopes that somebody smarter than him will give it credibility .
His long - time friend , Kim Cunningham , manager of communications and government relations at the Ottawa Centre for Research and Innovation ( OCRI ) is working part - time with Potential Difference to help get the message out .
Together , they have demonstrated the Perepiteia to a number of labs and universities across North America , including the University of Virginia , Michigan State University , the University of Toronto and Queen 's University .
" It 's generally always the same reaction , " says Heins .
" There 's a bit of a scramble on the part of the observer to put what they 're seeing into some sort of context with what they know .
They can't explain it .
They do n't know what it is . "
He'd be happy if somebody did , even if the news was bad .
His wife has kicked him out .
He does n't earn an income .
He can't pay child support .
The certainty would be welcome .
" I 've tried to quit many times , and thought if I could just be a normal guy I would have a normal life ...
But I had this idea and I believe it works . "
Others want to believe – or at least help out .
Cunningham , whose brother is general manager at Angus Glen Golf Club , introduced Heins to the club 's president , Kevin Thistle .
For two years
Thistle has acted as angel investor , providing start - up capital needed to incorporate Potential Difference , file patents and continue research .
Cunningham 's boss , OCRI president Jeffrey Dale , helped open doors at the University of Ottawa and make introductions to its dean of engineering .
As a result , Heins teamed up last fall with Riadh Habash , a professor at the university 's school of information technology and engineering .
" Dr. Habash has essentially rolled out the red carpet , " says Heins , explaining that he now has access to a university lab and all the equipment he needs to test and simulate his generator .

In an interview with the Toronto Star , Habash was cautious but matter - of - fact with what he 's seen so far .
" It accelerates , but when it comes to an explanation , there is no backing theory for it .
That 's why we 're consulting MIT .
But at this time we can't support any claim . "
In the meantime , Heins has been on a letter - writing campaign to raise money for his mission .
He 's written former U.S. vice - president Al Gore , Virgin Group founder and billionaire Richard Branson and John Doerr at venture capital powerhouse Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
He 's also tried to contact entrepreneur Elon Musk , chairman of electric car upstart Tesla Motors , and the " ReCharge IT " project run by Google 's philanthropic arm .
So far no bites , though there have been nibbles .
Heins has had discussions with a well - known investor in Oregon , known to many as the " godfather of start - ups , " who is apparently flirting with the idea of investing in Potential Difference .
" We got the impression ... he 's not necessarily interested in making a tonne of money , he just wants to see us succeed . "
Just before the big day at MIT , the Star spoke with professor Markus Zahn about what he expected to observe .
" It 's hard for me to give an opinion , " said Zahn , who admitted he was excited to see the demonstration .
" I do n't believe it will violate the laws of physics .
You 're not going to get more energy out than you put in . "
He said it 's easy for people to set up their tests wrong and misinterpret what they see .
" You 've got to look closely . "
It 's now Jan. 28 – D Day .
Heins has modified his test so the effects observed are difficult to deny .
He holds a permanent magnet a few centimetres away from the driveshaft of an electric motor , and the magnetic field it creates causes the motor to accelerate .
It went well .
Contacted by phone a few hours after the test , Zahn is genuinely stumped – and surprised .
He said the magnet should n't cause acceleration .
" It 's an unusual phenomena I would n't have predicted in advance .
But I saw it .
It 's real .
Now I 'm just trying to figure it out . "
There 's no talk of perpetual motion .
No whisper of broken scientific laws or free energy .
Zahn would never go there – at least not yet .
But he does see the potential for making electric motors more efficient , and this itself is no small feat .
" To my mind this is unexpected and new , and it 's worth exploring all the possible advantages once you 're convinced it 's a real effect , " he added .
" There are an infinite number of induction machines in people 's homes and everywhere around the world .
If you could make them more efficient , cumulatively , it could make a big difference . "
Driving home – he can't afford to fly – Heins is exhausted but encouraged .
He says Zahn will , and must , evaluate what he saw on his own terms and time .
What 's preventing the engineer from grasping it right away , he says , is his education , his scientific training .
Step by step , Heins is making progress , but where it will all lead remains uncertain .
Ticket spinlocks

Spinlocks are the lowest - level mutual exclusion mechanism in the Linux kernel .
As such , they have a great deal of influence over the safety and performance of the kernel , so it is not surprising that a great deal of optimization effort has gone into the various ( architecture - specific ) spinlock implementations .
That does not mean that all of the work has been done , though ; a patch merged for 2.6.25 shows that there is always more which can be done .
On the x86 architecture , in the 2.6.24 kernel , a spinlock is represented by an integer value .
A value of one indicates that the lock is available .
The spin_lock ( ) code works by decrementing the value ( in a system - wide atomic manner ) , then looking to see whether the result is zero ; if so , the lock has been successfully obtained .
Should , instead , the result of the decrement option be negative , the spin_lock ( ) code knows that the lock is owned by somebody else .
So it busy - waits ( " spins " ) in a tight loop until the value of the lock becomes positive ; then it goes back to the beginning and tries again .
Once the critical section has been executed , the owner of the lock releases it by setting it to 1 .
This implementation is very fast , especially in the uncontended case ( which is how things should be most of the time ) .
It also makes it easy to see how bad the contention for a lock is - the more negative the value of the lock gets , the more processors are trying to acquire it .
But there is one shortcoming with this approach : it is unfair .
Once the lock is released , the first processor which is able to decrement it will be the new owner .
There is no way to ensure that the processor which has been waiting the longest gets the lock first ; in fact , the processor which just released the lock may , by virtue of owning that cache line , have an advantage should it decide to reacquire the lock quickly .
One would hope that spinlock unfairness would not be a problem ; usually , if there is serious contention for locks , that contention is a performance issue even before fairness is taken into account .
Nick Piggin recently revisited this issue , though , after noticing :
On an 8 core ( 2 socket ) Opteron , spinlock unfairness is extremely noticable , with a userspace test having a difference of up to 2 x runtime per thread , and some threads are starved or " unfairly " granted the lock up to 1 000 000 (! ) times .
This sort of runtime difference is certainly undesirable .
But lock unfairness can also create latency issues ; it is hard to give latency guarantees when the wait time for a spinlock can be arbitrarily long .
Nick 's response was a new spinlock implementation which he calls " ticket spinlocks . "
Under the initial version of this patch , a spinlock became a 16 - bit quantity , split into two bytes :
Each byte can be thought of as a ticket number .
If you have ever been to a store where customers take paper tickets to ensure that they are served in the order of arrival , you can think of the " next " field as being the number on the next ticket in the dispenser , while " owner " is the number appearing in the " now serving " display over the counter .
So , in the new scheme , the value of a lock is initialized ( both fields ) to zero. spin_lock ( ) starts by noting the value of the lock , then incrementing the " next " field - all in a single , atomic operation .
If the value of " next " ( before the increment ) is equal to " owner , " the lock has been obtained and work can continue .
Otherwise the processor will spin , waiting until " owner " is incremented to the right value .
In this scheme , releasing a lock is a simple matter of incrementing " owner . "
The implementation described above does have one small disadvantage in that it limits the number of processors to 256 - any more than that , and a heavily - contended lock could lead to multiple processors thinking they had the same ticket number .
Needless to say , the resulting potential for mayhem is not something which can be tolerated .
But the 256 - processor limit is an unwelcome constraint for those working on large systems , which already have rather more processors than that .
So the add - on " big ticket " patch - also merged for 2.6.25 - uses 16 - bit values when the configured maximum number of processors exceeds 256 .
That raises the maximum system size to 65536 processors - who could ever want more than that ?
With the older spinlock implementation , all processors contending for a lock fought to see who could grab it first .
Now they wait nicely in line and grab the lock in the order of arrival .
Multi - thread run times even out , and maximum latencies are reduced ( and , more to the point , made deterministic ) .
There is a slight cost to the new implementation , says Nick , but that gets very small on contemporary processors and is essentially zero relative to the cost of a cache miss - which is a common event when dealing with contended locks .
The x86 maintainers clearly thought that the benefits of eliminating the unseemly scramble for spinlocks exceeded this small cost ; it seems unlikely that others will disagree .
It has always been impossible to clearly photograph electrons since their extremely high velocities have produced blurry pictures .
In order to capture these rapid events , extremely short flashes of light are necessary , but such flashes were not previously available .
With the use of a newly developed technology for generating short pulses from intense laser light , so - called attosecond pulses , scientists at the Lund University Faculty of Engineering in Sweden have managed to capture the electron motion for the first time .
The movie shows how an electron rides on a light wave after just having been pulled away from an atom .
This is the first time an electron has ever been filmed , and the results are presented in the latest issue of Physical Review Letters .
Experimental results obtained in helium at an intensity of 1:2 1013 W=cm2 are shown .
The results are
distinctively different from those taken in argon ( Fig. 1 ) .
With this higher intensity , more momentum is transferred to the electrons , and in combination with the lower initial energy , some electrons return to the atomic potential for further interaction .
In the first panel , we compare the experimental results ( right ) with theoretical calculations ( left ) obtained for the same conditions .
The excellent agreement is the strongest evidence for coherent scattering effects in the experiment .
All the substructures are well reproduced except for the highly saturated innermost peak in the experiment , which most likely is due to above threshold ionization of residual water in the experimental chamber .
“ It takes about 150 attoseconds for an electron to circle the nucleus of an atom .
An attosecond is 10 ^ - 18 seconds long , or , expressed in another way : an attosecond is related to a second as a second is related to the age of the universe , ” says Johan Mauritsson , an assistant professor in atomic physics at the Faculty of Engineering , Lund University .
He is one of seven researchers behind the study , which was directed by him and Professor Anne L’Huillier .
With the aid of another laser these scientists have moreover succeeded in guiding the motion of the electron so that they can capture a collision between an electron and an atom on film .
“ We have long been promising the research community that we will be able to use attosecond pulses to film electron motion .
Now that we have succeeded , we can study how electrons behave when they collide with various objects , for example .
The images can function as corroboration of our theories , ” explains Johan Mauritsson .
These scientists also hope to find out more about what happens with the rest of the atom when an inner electron leaves it , for instance how and when the other electrons fill in the gap that is created .
“ What we are doing is pure basic research .
If there happen to be future applications , they will have to be seen as a bonus , ” adds Johan Mauritsson .
The length of the film corresponds to a single oscillation of the light , but the speed has then been ratcheted down considerably so that we can watch it .
The filmed sequence shows the energy distribution of the electron and is therefore not a film in the usual sense .
Previously scientists have studied the movements of electrons using indirect methods , such as by metering their spectrum .
With these methods it has only been possible to measure the result of an electron ’s movement , whereas now we have the opportunity to monitor the entire event .
It has been possible to create attosecond pulses for a couple of years now , but not until now has anyone managed to use them to film electron movements , since the attosecond pulses themselves are too weak to take clear pictures .
“ By taking several pictures of exactly the same moment in the process , it ’s possible to create stronger , but still sharp , images .
A precondition is for the process to be repeated in an identical manner , which is the case regarding the movement of an electron in a ray of light .
We started with a so - called stroboscope .
A stroboscope enables us to ‘ freeze ’ a periodic movement , like capturing a hummingbird flapping its wings .
You then take several pictures when the wings are in the same position , such as at the top , and the picture will turn out clear , despite the rapid motion , ” clarifies Johan Mauritsson .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The dollar slipped on Friday on light profit taking but was still on track for the biggest weekly rise since June 2006 as investors increasingly expect the U.S. growth slowdown to drag on other economies .
The euro was off three cents in the week against the dollar and was seen weakening more in coming days on growing expectations the European Central Bank will cut interest rates later this year despite stubborn inflation pressures .
“ Despite a torrent of bad economic news the dollar has been on a tear this week , as the currency market recognized the fact that the slowdown in U.S. economic activity is likely to drag down growth in the rest of the G10 universe , forcing other central banks to adopt a much more accommodative monetary policy , ” said Boris Schlossberg , chief currency strategist with DailyFX.com in New York .
The euro edged up 0.2 percent on the day to $ 1.4505 , but was down 2 percent on the week , the largest weekly decline in 1 - 1/ 2 years .
The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 107.40 yen .
For the week , the New York Board of Trade ’s U.S. dollar index was up 1.54 percent to 76.605 .
The euro had jumped to a session high after a report said that OPEC may adopt the euro and abandon the dollar when pricing oil .
However , those gains were short lived .
“ If it happens , it ’s huge . ” said Joe Manimbo , a currency trader at Ruesch International in Washington D.C.
“ Trade is thin ahead of G7 and those headlines really hit . ”
Finance ministers and central bank heads at the Group of Seven rich nations will meet on Saturday .

: Category : Extending Firebug Tutorial
It 's been a while since I have started contributing to Firebug .
Everybody use this amazing Firefox extension and I am having great time with exploring the underlying architecture .
Well , it was hard time at the beginning 😉
I had to dive into unknown waters and understand what 's under the hood .
I remember it quite exactly , I have spent many hours with debugging a debugger trying to understand how it works .
I was searching the web intensively and if anybody would like to enjoy the same journey , I would recommend to check out Christoph Dorn 's awesome article on Extending Firebug .
There is also a cool page about Firebug Internals written by John J. Barton .
And last but not least source of information is certainly Firebug Group page , yep you can always ask there ...
However , what I was really looking for was a step by step tutorial that starts with the familiar " Hello World ! " application .
I did n't find it .
So , I decided to write down something by myself .
Perhaps it will be useful for those programmers , who are interested in contributing to Firebug , extending Firebug or developing an entirely new extension for Firefox .
So , here it is : Firebug tutorial for extension developers .
Hello World !
The first thing to do is to setup a structure of the extension .
This step is easy if you are already familiar with Firefox extension development .
In this case , the directory structure should look like this :
helloworld@janodvarko.cz / chrome / content / helloworld / helloWorld.xul helloWorld.js chrome.manifest install.rdf
The most important files are obviously helloWorld.xul and helloWorld.js .
These two files contains the actual Hello World !
implementation .
The other two files are used by Firefox to properly install the extension .
See the chrome .
manifest first .
xpcnativewrappers= no content helloworld chrome / content / helloworld / no overlay chrome:// firebug/content/firebugOverlay.xul chrome://helloworld/content/helloWorld.xul
Notice that xpcnativewrappers=no turns off security tests .
After revisiting this code , I would recommend to remove the option or at least be aware of it .
The file specifies that there is a content under chrome / content / helloworld / directory and that our helloWorld.xul represents an overlay for firebugOverlay.xul .
If you are interested , see an article about chrome registration here .
The install.rdf contains standard information about the extension .
No comment is needed for this , see detailed info about install manifests here if you want .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> < RDF xmlns = " http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns# "

Extension </ em:description >

</ RDF >
The helloWorld.xul is currently almost empty ( be patient there 'll be more things later ) , only the helloWorld.js is included .
<?xml version = " 1.0 " ?> < overlay xmlns= " http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul " >
< script src=" chrome://helloworld/content/helloWorld.js " type=" application/x-javascript " />
</overlay >
This is how the JS script looks like :
ns ( function ( ) { with ( FBL ) { FBL. FBL function HelloWorldPanel ( ) {}
HelloWorldPanel.prototype = extend ( Firebug .
Panel ,
{
name : " HelloWorld " ,
title : " Hello World ! " , initialize : function ( ) {
Firebug.Panel.initialize.apply ( this , arguments ) ;
} ,
} ) ; Firebug.registerPanel(HelloWorldPanel ) ; }} ) ;
The main and only purpose of helloWorld .js so far , is to create and register a new Firebug Panel ( tab ) .
Notice that a Panel plays the same role as a View in MVC ( Model View Controller ) design pattern .
In other words , the Panel is intended to present data to the user .
So , there is a new object called HelloWorldPanel , which is extended from internal Firebug .
Panel object .
The extension mechanism is realized through extend function , which creates a new object and copies all properties from the first parameter ( predecessor object - Firebug .
Panel ) and then all properties from the second parameter ( our new panel - HelloWorldPanel ) into it .
The object is then returned from the function .
You could see this as an imitation of class inheritance .
Our Panel has two properties and a method .
Theirs meaning is quite obvious , a name is used to identify the panel ( should be unique so , we can access it through getPanel method later ) and a title ( which is display name of the tab ) .
The later should be localized , but do n't worry about it now , we 'll deal with these nitpickings later .
There is even an initialize method .
This is called automatically by the framework when the Panel is activated ( displayed ) at the first time .
It 's empty now , but it 'll be useful for Panel initialization .
Do n't forget to call predecessor method , there is some initialization to be made .
Firebug .
registerPanel ( HelloWorldPanel ) ;
Finally , the new panel object is registered and so , Firebug can ensure it 's properly displayed .
Careful reader might have noticed that entire code is surrounded by a following code :
ns ( function ( ) { with ( FBL ) { FBL.
FBL // Panel definition }} ) ;
This is how namespaces are realized in Firebug framework .
It 's smart and useful .
This makes possible to avoid global variables and so , dangerous collisions .
Something , which everybody should take care of .
However let 's just use it as it is for now , we 'll fall in to this later .
Ok , that 's it for now .
See the following screen - shot that shows how the new panel should look like within Firebug 's UI .
The extension can be downloaded here .
Next time we 'll take a look at how to create a new button for our panel and associate a logic with it ...
