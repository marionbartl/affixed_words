KIGALI , Rwanda 
A mayor who was indicted for orchestrating the massacre of more than 2,000 Tutsi seeking refuge in a church during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda was captured and arrested this week in eastern Congo after 15 years in hiding , according to Congolese officials .
The fugitive , Grégoire Ndahimana , who is wanted for genocide and complicity in genocide , was arrested in North Kivu Province late Tuesday evening by Congolese armed forces .
He had been fighting in eastern Congo with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda , or F.D.L.R. , a primarily Hutu rebel group of genocide committers and other combatants who are now stirring chaos in Congo ’s troubled east .
Congolese officials said the fugitive was caught by surprise .
“ He was captured while he was coming to look for some food within the local population , ” Olivier Hamuli , a spokesperson for the national army , said via telephone .
Both Rwanda and Congo called the capture one of the most significant achievements to date of the joint military operations being undertaken by the two countries against rebels in the area .
YOUR correspondent is indebted to readers for their interesting comments about last week 's column on timber - framed buildings .
He is especially grateful to Anjin- san , whose observations about Japanese pagodas reminded him of a day spent a dozen years ago with Shuzo Ishida , a structural engineer at Kyoto Institute of Technology .
Mr Ishida , known to his students as “ Professor Pagoda ” , has a passion for the building 's unique dynamics .
What has mystified scholars over the ages is how these tall , wooden buildings cope so well with the earthquakes and typhoons that plague Japan .
Many have been struck by lightning and burned to the ground .
Others have been torched by marauding warlords .
Fire was a perennial hazard in Japan when wood and paper buildings were the norm .
But , remarkably , only two of the country 's hundreds of wooden pagodas have collapsed over the past 1,400 years as a result of violent shaking .

The disastrous Hanshin earthquake of 1995 killed more than 6,400 people , toppled elevated highways , flattened office blocks and devastated the port city of Kobe .
Yet the magnitude 6.9 shock left the magnificent five - storey pagoda at the Toji temple in nearby Kyoto unscathed , even though it levelled a number of lower structures in the neighbourhood .
You can see the Toji pagoda soaring 55 metres ( 180 feet ) into the sky from the train as it pulls into Kyoto station .
Though burned down four times since it was first erected in 826 by the master builder Kobodaishi , the current building has stood its ground since 1644 .
It was the tallest structure in Japan until the 36 - storey Kasumigaseki Building was erected in 1968 .
The slightly smaller Horyuji pagoda in Nara was built in 607 and is thought to be the oldest multi-storey wooden structure in the world .
Today , it is on UNESCO 's world - heritage list of cultural treasures .
What is it about Japanese pagodas that makes them so different from their ancestors in India and later China ?
All were religious monuments of one sort or another .
In India , mounds of stone called “ stupas ” were used to house religious relics and writings .
As Buddhism spread to China , the stone - built structures became taller and more elaborate .
But with the introduction of Buddhism into Japan in the sixth century , the pagoda underwent a fundamental change in design .
For a start , the Japanese version is built entirely from wood rather than stone .
Curiously , it has no internal staircase .
Unlike its equivalents elsewhere in Asia , which were used as lookout posts as well as for storing religious objects , the Japanese pagoda serves no practical purpose .
According to Atsushi Ueda , an architect , “ the Japanese pagoda evolved from an observation tower to a tower that was itself observed — a kind of object d'art . ”
To understand why Japanese pagodas are so different , consider first the climate .
The Japanese archipelago is on the northern fringe of the monsoon belt .
It also gets drenched each year by a dozen or more typhoons that swirl up from the Philippines .
In having to cope with more than twice the annual rainfall of China , Japanese carpenters have long learned to extend the eaves of their buildings much farther out from the walls .
This prevents rainwater from gushing down the side of the building into the foundations , causing the ground to soften and the building to subside or even collapse .
The eaves of a Japanese pagoda extend the building 's width by 70 % or so .
In China , they rarely overhang by more than 20 % .
Looked at from a distance , Japanese pagodas always remind your correspondent of a matsu pine tree , with its branches drooping gently under the weight of winter snow .
Indeed , for centuries , people believed the pagoda got its resilience from its central pillar , known as a shinbashira .
When struck by an earthquake or typhoon , this was thought to flex and sway like the trunk of a pine tree in a storm .
But a pagoda works nothing like a pine tree .
Indeed , far from carrying the building 's main loads , as the trunk of a tree does , the shinbashira — made from precious straight - grained Japanese cypress — is not even rooted in the soil .
In some instances , it dangles freely above the ground ; in others , it merely rests lightly on the foundations or second floor .
Even more strangely , the individual floors of a pagoda are not rigidly attached to those immediately above and below .
They are simply stacked on top of one another like a pile of hats .
The only force holding them together is gravity .
Meanwhile , their loosely fitted joints allow each storey to slide horizontally independently of the others .
So , why do n't they topple over at the first tremor ?
For two reasons .
First , as the structure begins to sway , the heavy - tiled roof covering the extended eaves of each storey acts like the long pole with weights on the ends that a tightrope walker uses to steady himself .
In both , the large “ radius of gyration ” means the shaking has a lot of inbuilt inertia to overcome .
Second , as the loosely stacked storeys slide to and fro—with each consecutive floor moving in the opposite direction to the one above and below — they collide internally with the trunk - like shinbashira dangling through the central well of the building .
With each collision , they dump more of their kinetic energy into the massive column — trying vainly to make it swing like a pendulum .
While at Kyoto Institute of Technology a dozen years ago , Mr Ishida showed your correspondent a series of models he had made of five - storey pagodas — some with central columns that rested on the ground , others that were anchored at the second - floor or hung freely from the top the structure .
When given a hefty shove on a shake - table , all of them proved more stable than a test model that had no central column .
But the one that damped the swaying best had its shinbashira resting firmly on the ground .
In practice , the mighty shinbashira either conveys the surplus energy of the swaying pagoda to the ground by dragging its base over the foundations — or , if dangling freely , begrudgingly swings a little .
In essence , then , the pagoda is a tuned mass - damping system .
Like all great buildings , a Japanese pagoda is as much a machine as a structure .
Engineers distinguish carefully between the two .
Great pains are usually taken to ensure that structures , although flexible , are incapable of swivelling or sliding at their joints as machines do .
Otherwise , they may collapse in a heap .
What the pagoda builders realised was that they could use controlled motion at the joints of a building to help it dissipate sudden stresses imposed on its various members .
Thanks to their pegged joints , the timber - framed buildings your correspondent described last week cope with subsidence by “ giving ” a little at the joints — albeit with nothing like the freedom of movement a pagoda has .
How clever of those Japanese craftsmen to figure it all out 14 centuries ago .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Robert Benmosche , the newly appointed chief executive officer of American International Group Inc , says he expects the bailed - out insurer to be able to repay its federal debts and to boost value for shareholders , according to a report by Bloomberg News .

Shares rose strongly after the report , rising as much as 31 percent on the New York Stock Exchange .
“ At the end of the day , we believe we will be able to pay back the government and we hope we will be able to do something for our shareholders as well , ” Benmosche said in an interview with Bloomberg while on holiday in Croatia .
“ My first charge is to get the company to operate at the level it used to operate , being the world ’s best , ” he said , according to the report .
“ The fact is we owe the U.S. government a lot of money and we are not going to be able to pay it back just by our profits , so we will sell some of the company off but only at the right time at the right price . ”
An AIG spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment .
Benmosche told employees at an August 4 meeting that he planned to rebuild AIG ’s profitable insurance operations .
“ I do n’t liquidate things , I build them , ” he said at that meeting , according to Bloomberg .
The new chief earlier this week halted the auction of an investment advisory unit .
Benmosche , 65 , took up the CEO post on August 10 .
He had previously been CEO of MetLife Inc , the largest U.S. life insurer .
He came out of retirement to take AIG ’s helm .
His task at AIG is to repay more than $ 80 billion in loans from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury while keeping AIG stable .
AIG , once the world ’s biggest insurer , was saved from bankruptcy by a federal bailout last September .
The company was on the verge of collapse from massive losses on derivatives linked to the subprime mortgage crisis .
SHARE REVIVAL ?
“ I think the CEO ’s comments mentioned in the Bloomberg story triggered a rally this morning , ” said Frederic Ruffy , option strategist at Web site WhatsTrading.com .
AIG shares were up $ 7.02 26 percent at $ 33.66 in late morning trading .
Earlier they hit $ 35.00 , their highest level since a one - for - 20 reverse stock split on July 1 , according to Reuters data .
In the options market , traders exchanged about 216,000 contracts or nine times the normal number in the first 90 minutes of trade , according to option analytics firm Trade Alert .
Out of that volume , 125,000 call options -- granting the right to buy the shares at a fixed price within a specified time period -- changed hands .
“ There is heavy trading in August $ 30 and $ 35 call strikes which expire at the end of this week , indicating that many investors are looking for today ’s rally in AIG shares to continue in the short term , ” Ruffy said .
Ruffy also noticed active trading in the September $ 14 puts where investors , paid a premium of 25 cents per contract and were possibly buying some insurance in case AIG should run into trouble again .
As its financial problems set in last year , the value of AIG shares sank dramatically , and the bailout resulted in taxpayers getting a nearly 80 percent stake , heavily diluting shareholders .
Cursor Preservation
by Neil Fraser , August 2009
Collaborative editors have to combine input coming from the local user and from remote users .
One of the significant user interface challenges is cursor behaviour .
When a remote user 's change is merged into the document , what happens to the local user 's cursor ?
Likewise , what happens to a selection which the local user has made ?
Failure to preserve the cursor and selection can result in the cursor jumping to the top of the document and selections becoming unselected every time a remote change occurs .
This behaviour can make such an editor completely unusable .
First , let 's define the related concepts of cursors and selections .
A text cursor indicates one point in the document where user keystrokes will be inserted .
A selection indicates the highlighted range between two points in the document .
Under most ( but not all ) environments there can be at most one cursor and one selection .
Furthermore , the cursor would normally be locked to either the left or the right side of the selection ( if there is one ) .
Thus the cursor and selection can be completely described with two points ( the selection start and finish ) and a Boolean ( which end the cursor is located at ) .
If there is no selection , then the start and end points are the same ( often described as ' collapsed ' ) and the Boolean is not relevant .
Absolute Referencing
The most common cursor preservation technique is to perform absolute referencing .
Under this model the start and finish locations are recorded in terms of character offsets from the document start , then the remote changes are applied while keeping track of deltas on both points .
If an insertion is made ahead of one of these points , then the point 's location is incremented by the length of the insertion .
Likewise if a deletion is made ahead of one of these points , then the point 's location is decremented by the length of the deletion .
If a deletion is made which encompasses the point , then the point 's location is decremented by the distance between it and the start of the deletion .
Insertions and deletions made behind a point have no effect on the point 's location .
Here is an example of absolute referencing .
The cursor is currently at offset 24 , just before the word " slithy " :
` Twas brillig , and the ^ slithy toves
The following edits arrive from a remote user ( strike - through represents a deletion , underline represents an insertion ) :
` Twas brillig , and & the slithy toves
Three characters were deleted and one was added .
If there were no deltas made to the cursor offset , the cursor would shift by two characters :
` Twas brillig , & the sl ^ ithy toves
By subtracting three and adding one to the cursor location , the cursor is moved to the expected location :
` Twas brillig , & the ^ slithy toves
Here 's another example involving a selection :
` Twas brillig , a nd the slithy toves
The same two edits arrive :
` Twas brillig , and & the slithy toves
Without any deltas , the six - character selection would slip sideways :
` Twas brillig , & the s lithy toves
The start of the selection was inside a deleted chunk , so its location gets decremented by the number of characters between the start of the deletion and the selection start .
The following insertion of one character occurs after the selection start thus has no effect :
` Twas brillig , & the s lithy toves
Finally the end of the selection is moved back by three and forwards by one , making a total delta of negative two :
` Twas brillig , & the slithy toves
Had the same edits arrived in the opposite order :
` Twas brillig , & and the slithy toves
Then the final result would have been different , but equally acceptable :
` Twas brillig , & the slithy toves
This technique is relatively simple and produces a reasonably good user experience .
Google Wave is an editor which performs absolute referencing .
Absolute Referencing Problems
While good ( and depending on the application , potentially " good enough " ) , absolute referencing is not perfect .
Consider the following case :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and ^ gimble in the wabe :
All mimsy were the borogoves , And the mome raths outgrabe .
If the middle two lines were swapped , the difference might look like this :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
All mimsy were the borogoves , Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
And the mome raths outgrabe .
Given that the original position of the cursor was in the middle of line 2 , and that line 2 was completely deleted , then absolute referencing would set the new location of the cursor at the beginning of line 2 :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves ^
All mimsy were the borogoves , Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
And the mome raths outgrabe .
However the user would expect their cursor to appear in the middle of line 3 .
A potential solution would be to extend the differencing algorithm to include not only insertions and deletions , but also moves .
Thus if a block containing a cursor or selection point is moved to a new location , then that point is moved along with it .
However this solution fails to address the case of moves with modifications :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
All mimsy were the borogoves , Did Gyre & Gimble in the Wabe :
And the mome raths outgrabe .
No known differencing algorithm would interpret this as a move plus some edits .
Context Matching
A completely different approach to restoring cursor and selection locations is to use fuzzy matching .
For each point of interest a number of characters before and after the point are recorded , as well as the absolute offset .
Once the remote edits are applied , a fuzzy matching algorithm is used to search for the best match for the previously recorded context , weighted around the area where the result is expected .
If such a match is found , then the point 's new location has been established .
In the above case the prefix might be " yre and " while the suffix might be " gimble i " ( in practice the context would be longer , but this example only uses eight characters for brevity ) .
The offset from the start of the document would be 52 .
After the edits are applied , the matching algorithm start looking for " yre and gimble i " at around position 52 .
The best match would be " yre & Gimble i " ( a Levenshtein distance of 4 ) at position 80 ( an offset distance of 28 ) .
Once a match is obtained , an exact position for the point needs to be determined .
The original point was in the middle of the original context string , but where is it located in the newly matched string ?
To find out , a detailed difference between the two strings is computed :
yre and & g G imble i
Using the difference as framework , we can now map the old cursor location to the new string :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves All mimsy were the borogoves , Did Gyre & ^ Gimble in the Wabe :
And the mome raths outgrabe .
One issue with context matching is that a point at the start of the document will not obtain a contextual prefix .
Likewise a point at the end of the document will not obtain a contextual suffix .
The result is that the following matching effort will be significantly weaker since there is less context to match against .
This is unfortunate since it is extremely common for a cursor to be at the start or end of a document .
One solution is to increase the size of the context on the opposite side such that the total amount of context remains constant .
Another solution is to generate a short string of random characters ( preferably unprintable Unicode ) and append it to the beginning and end of the text before acquiring and restoring the points , such that the match algorithm has something to match against .
Context matching relies on a rather complicated fuzzy matching algorithm .
Good results have been obtained from the efficient Bitap algorithm , modified to weight results by both the Levenshtein distance and the offset distance .
Google Documents is an editor which performs context matching .
Context Matching Problems
While context matching robustly solves the move ( with potential modification ) case which absolute referencing failed at , context matching has an issue of its own .
Consider the case of repeated strings :
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
Did gyre and ^ gimble in the wabe :
In this case there are two lines , both identical with the cursor is in the middle of the second line .
Next , a remote edit arrives adding a new line to the start :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe : Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
The matching algorithm starts looking for " yre and gimble i " at around position 51 .
And it quickly finds an excellent match with Levenshtein distance of 0 and an offset distance of just 1 :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and ^ gimble in the wabe :
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
The result is that the user 's cursor jumped up one line .
Had the matching algorithm been given a larger context ( e.g. " abe :
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe : \0 " ) there would have been sufficient information to make the second match yield a higher score despite being further away .
However , increasing the length of the context not only reduces the efficiency of the matching algorithm , it also reaches a point where accuracy is reduced too -- such as an inability to detect moves like the one which the absolute referencing algorithm failed at above .
Context Matching with Absolute Referenced Offsets
Merging the two algorithms allows each to solve the other 's problems .
The strategy is conceptually simple :
Capture the context and absolute offset of each point ( the first step of context matching ) .
Apply the insertions and deletions while updating the absolute offsets of each point ( the absolute referencing algorithm ) .
Restore the points on the new text based on the context and delta adjusted offsets ( second step of context matching ) .
Injecting the absolute referencing algorithm in the middle of the context matching algorithm corrects the offsets such that matches are targeted to the expected location in the new text rather than the previous location in the old text .
Consider an escalation of the previous case :
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe :
Did gyre and ^ gimble in the wabe :
The context recorded as " yre and gimble i " and the offset is 51 .
If a first line is added and the last line is edited , the difference would be :
` Twas brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe : Did g G yre and & g G imble in the w W abe :
The absolute referencing algorithm would add 36 to the offset to compensate for the insertion of the first line , would both subtract and add 1 for the case change on the letter ' g ' , and would subtract 3 and add 1 for the change of ' and ' .
The result would be an offset of 85 .
Next the fuzzy matching locates two potential matches .
One is " yre and gimble i " at offset 52 ( a Levenshtein distance of 0 and a delta offset of 33 ) .
The other is " yre & Gimble i " at offset 85 ( a Levenshtein distance of 3 and a delta offset of 0 ) .
Based on how the scoring formula in the matching algorithm is tuned , either answer might be chosen .
If the score ranks a small Levenshtein distance over a small offset distance , then the first match would be chosen , otherwise the second match would be chosen .
Indeed the expected result in this case is unclear .
Thus the tuning of the scoring formula becomes a matter of usability studies .
The combined algorithm is more complex , but significantly more accurate than either algorithm alone .
MobWrite is an editor which uses context matching with absolute referenced offsets .
Scrollbar Preservation
Once the cursor has been properly restored , the next challenge is restoration of the scrollbar .
It is not useful for the cursor to be restored to the correct location if the scrollbar snaps the to the top each time an update is made .
Successful scrollbar restoration involves setting the scroll position such that the text which the user is looking at does not move .
Left - right movement is unavoidable in a line - wrapped document , but vertical movement is controllable in the event that the document is longer than the widget it is being displayed in .
The challenge is to identify what the user is looking at .
In the absence of eye - trackers , there are a set of heuristics which provide decent usability :
If the scrollbar was at the upper or lower limits , it should be restored to those limits .
This allows one to stick to the ends and either view the start or track a document in real time as collaborators append to it .
If the cursor is on screen , the user is likely looking at the cursor and the scrollbar should be set to ensure that the restored cursor appears at the same height .
In the absence of any useful reference points , one can only pick a point at the start of the middle line visible on screen and restore the scrollbar such that the chosen point reappears at the same height .
The horizontal scrollbar ( if there is one ) ought to be treated in the same manner .

On Twitter this morning , folks were talking about all the Hollywood folks who have come out in support of Polanski .
Even Whoopi Goldberg trying to claim this was n’t a “ rape - rape . ”
Even , allegedly , Sharon Tate ’s sister trying to draw some distinction between rape and rape .
Dude drugged and raped a crying thirteen year old girl who begged him not to .
Then , when he thought his plea bargain might be reneged on after he could n’t even be bothered to show remorse , he fled .
None of these facts are in dispute .
This is n’t one of these pseudo - gray areas where she seemed like she wanted it and then she “ changed her mind . ”
Or she was “ seduced ” out of her “ no ” by his persistence .
She was drugged by him ( indicating that he knew she would n’t be even remotely compliant otherwise ) , and raped repeatedly as she said no over and over .
So , how is this not a rape - rape , even if we were to accept the idea that there is any such distinction between rape and rape ?
Why would these Hollywood folks jump to his defense ?
This morning , I realized something so gross I had to float it by y’all to see what you think .
I think they think that no only should n’t he be punished because he ’s the great artist Roman Polanski , but that it was n’t rape - rape because it was n’t some gross , disgusting guy who raped her , which of course would be terrible , but the great artist Roman Polanski .
It was n’t rape - rape because it was a great man , way out of her league , deigning to pay her some attention .
Rape as flattery .
It was n’t rape - rape because she does n’t have to be ashamed of who raped her .

During a recent research cruise , a rare giant squid was captured in the Gulf of Mexico .
The research cruise was partially funded through an interagency agreement between the Department of the Interior ’s Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
The 19.5 foot long , 103 pound squid was caught at a water depth of more than 1,500 feet in a special trawl net pulled by the NOAA vessel Gordon Gunter during a pilot study for the MMS , " Sperm Whale Acoustic Prey Study . "
The two - year , $ 550,000 MMS prey study hopes to identify the species composition and biomass of squid and fish that represent the feeding base for sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico .
“ This is the first time a giant squid has been captured during scientific research in the Gulf of Mexico , ” explained Dr. Deborah Epperson , the MMS biologist responsible for this study .
Numerous MMS - sponsored studies of sperm whale abundance , distribution , habitat , and response to sound conducted since the 1990 ’s showed the need for more information about their prey which consist mainly of squid and fish .
Photos of the squid were sent to experts around the nation to confirm the specimen was indeed the Architeuthis ( Ar - chi - teu - this ) species .
The giant squid is now at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History where it will be studied .
Additional field work for the “ Sperm Whale Acoustic Prey Study ” is scheduled for early 2010 .
A survey to assess the relationship between sperm whales and their prey based on lessons learned from this pilot study will be conducted .

The OECD calls an end to the global recession .
The global downturn was effectively declared over yesterday , with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) revealing that " clear signs of recovery are now visible " in all seven of the leading Western economies , as well as in each of the key " Bric " nations .
The OECD 's composite leading indicators suggest that activity is now improving in all of the world 's most significant 11 economies – the leading seven , consisting of the US , UK , Germany , Italy , France , Canada and Japan , and the Bric nations of Brazil , Russia , India and China – and in almost every case at a faster pace than previously .
Each of the 11 economies saw an improvement in July , the OECD said , with only France improving at a slower rate than in June .
The July figures are the most encouraging since the indices began ticking downwards during the first quarter of last year .
The OECD 's leading indicators are considered a key economic yardstick because they measure the sectors of countries ' economies that tend to react first to upswings and downturns .
As such they provide early evidence of the way in which the overall economy is progressing .
Unemployment Likely To Rise For A Year
" It takes GDP growth of about 2.5 percent to keep the jobless rate constant .
But the Fed expects growth of only about 1 percent in the last six months of the year .
So that 's not enough to bring down the unemployment rate . "
False Threat of a Double Dip
Michael Dueker is Head Economist for North America at Russell Investments and a member of the Blue Chip forecasting panel .
In February of 2008 he warned Econbrowser readers that it appeared unlikely that the economy was going to escape the slowdown without a recession .
In December of 2008 , he predicted in this forum that the recession would last until July or August of 2009 , but that employment growth would not resume until March of 2010 .
With that track record , we were very interested to learn the latest macroeconomic predictions stemming from Russell 's Business Cycle Index , subject to the disclaimer that the content does not constitute investment advice or projections of the stock market or any specific investment .
Model Predictions
Projections On Payroll Employment
Modeling the Double Dip
One key point of discussion at present is whether the economy faces a danger of sliding back into recession for the second part of a double - dip recession .
The business cycle index and its accompanying payroll employment forecasts can help assess the risk of a double - dip recession .
The chart of the business cycle index below illustrates that some backsliding in business cycle conditions is projected early in 2010 .

Model - Based Recession Probabilities
To see if the projected backsliding in business cycle conditions in early 2010 represents a serious threat of a double - dip recession , we can look at the forecasted recession probabilities for future months .
The chart below shows that the recession probabilities do not reach the threshold between 40 and 50 percent where we would call a double - dip recession .

Current Jobs Forecast
The current employment forecast shows some promising job gains between October and December 2009 and then some backsliding , with a small negative forecast for March 2010 .
If this occurs , there will be discussion about the possibility of a double - dip recession , although that is not the scenario projected here .
Instead of a double - dip recession , the forecast presented here is one where it takes a long time for the economy to achieve consistent triple - digit job gains , which are not expected until 2011 .

Paul Kasriel On The Double - Dip Theory
Over 50 years of history suggests that the economy does not enter a recession unless the Fed pushes it into one .
Krugman vs. Kasriel
Unemployment in the United States will peak only in early 2011 because of a slow and painful recovery from the global economic crisis , Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman said on Wednesday .
He said the global economy seems to be stabilizing at a level that is " unacceptably poor " and added it is possible that the recession will be a double - dip one .
Krugman , who received a Nobel Prize for economics in 2008 , said the acute phase of the global crisis had passed but the recovery is likely to feel like a " continuing recession . "
He said recoveries have been weak from past crises in the United States and other regions as job sectors continued to get worse long after the crises have bottomed out , adding the global job market will continue to get worse " well into 2011 . "
" We might have a double dip , that 's a real possibility now for the world as a whole , " said Krugman , saying the effects of stimulus programs will start to fade early next year and recovery will be slow due to the global nature of the crisis .
Job Loss Recovery
The last three recessions are unlike the eight preceding recessions .

It 's looking more and more likely that Apple will release a 10 - inch tablet computer in early 2010 .
Even if you 're sick of Apple tablet rumors , we promise you 'll like this one .
The latest update comes from a tipster with a solid track record , which reinforces previous reports that Apple will deliver a tablet in early 2010 .
The tipster also shares details on the rumored product 's specifications .
ILounge , an iPod and iPhone blog , cites a source who claims Apple plans to announce a tablet by Jan. 19 , 2010 .
The tipster claims the tablet will measure 10.7 inches ( diagonally ) and will run the iPhone operating system .
The tablet will sport a higher resolution than the iPhone or iPod Touch screen : " Expect something like 5 - 6 times the resolution of an iPod Touch or iPhone screen ( 720 p or thereabouts ) and 7 times the touchable surface area , " writes iLounge .
Also , there will be one version equipped with 3G networking and one without .
This would make the 3G model a bigger version of the iPhone , and the non -3G tablet a larger iPod Touch .
This particular report raises the likelihood of an Apple tablet landing in stores soon .
ILounge says this is the same source who was spot on when leaking details on the fifth - generation iPod Nano prior to its Sept. 9 launch .
That same source was also accurate with its description of the fourth - generation iPod Nano before its release .
ILounge 's source also said the tablet would specialize " as a slate - like replacement for books and magazines . "
Wired.com in previous months has argued that an Apple tablet would pose a serious threat to the Amazon Kindle as well as the Amazon.com e-book store .
We speculated that Apple could integrate an e-book section into the iTunes Store , giving it the potential to shake up the publishing industry .
Are you getting overwhelmed by the flurry of tablet news ?
We do n't blame you .
Here are the rumors that have been echoed by several publications :
Steve Jobs has had a heavy hand in the tablet 's development .

The tablet will cost between $ 700 and $ 900 , positioning it between the iPhone / iPod Touch and Apple 's notebooks .

The tablet will come in two versions .
Gizmodo 's source claims one model will feature a webcam ( perhaps for videoconferencing ) while the other will focus on education .
A camera - equipped tablet would make more sense on the 3G - equipped tablet described by iLounge 's source ; likewise , a camera - less version of the tablet could be the non -3G tablet mentioned by iLounge 's source .

Have any doubt left in an Apple tablet ?
We do n't .
But there 's so much here that if the tablet turns out to be a media - fabricated illusion , even David Copperfield would be impressed .

It was obvious when the Obama White House stood back and let Van Jones get run over by the right - wing bus that he just happened to be first in line .
These wingnuts are just getting warmed up .
That was self - evident yesterday on Fox , when not just Glenn Beck , but Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly piled on as well .
These guys are now headed straight for the rest of Obama 's progressive appointees , and ultimately are after Obama himself .
Beck had on Michelle Malkin to help him line up the next row of victims , who appear primarily to be John Holdren and Valerie Jarrett .
Hannity , too , clearly has Jarrett in his sights ; he featured a clip from her chat at Netroots Nation , talking up the value of having someone like Van Jones in the administration .
But really , this bus is n't just aimed at progressive appointees .
It 's directed ultimately at Obama himself .
Beck made that clear in his segment with O'Reilly ( who miraculously comes off as the voice of reason in all this ) , when he essentially admitted that the purpose of this whole campaign is to paint Obama as a closet Marxist who secretly wants to transform America into a communist state .
In other words , this is about delegitimizing the Obama presidency .
That 's been their purpose from Day One , and they appear to be right on schedule .
With a helping hand from the Obama White House itself .
“ You ’re going into surgery right now .
Put your things in this plastic bag . ”
And she walked off .
I was still numb from the shock .
I hardly ever got sick , and had never had surgery .
This was not the way my Christmas vacation was supposed to begin …
Yesterday I was at Disneyland !
No Time To Lose
I called my dad and told him I was going in for surgery , right that instant .
I told him I was fine and would be ok , but He was n’t buying it .
He was on the next plane out so he would be there as soon as I was sent home .
They took me upstairs and injected some anesthetic .
For about 10 seconds , I felt extremely calm … then I passed out .
When I awoke , I was groggy , and confused before I remembered where I was .
Oh , right : I ’d been sliced open , my appendix was gone and my clothes were somewhere in a plastic bag .
The Surgery is a Success
They told me the surgery went smoothly , and that it was a good thing I had come in when I did – any longer and it may have ended my life .
Then … the bad news .
Only liquids for a week
No strenuous physical activities for at least a month
I mentioned to my surgeon I was in the middle of an important workout routine , involving lifting heavy weights .
He was unsympathetic : “ Not anymore . ”
Frustration
I used to think the hardest part of weight training was the grueling workouts … but I was wrong .
The hardest part about weight training is wishing you could lift weights but not being able to .
Lifting weights , yoga and running are a big part of my life – but I never realized how much they meant to me until they were gone .
Once I lost them though , every day I felt a feeling of anxiousness to get back in the gym .
I thought of all the times I had complained about going – and how often I had skipped a workout .
I wished I could have had all those days back .
My First Day Back
When I was finally cleared to workout again , I entered the gym relief , happiness – and newfound motivation to make up for lost time and to get more serious about the things I wanted .
I entered with a promise to myself to be excellent .
And I was .
Excellence
I tackled my workouts with more motivation than ever before .
I ate perfectly .
I slept perfectly
I never missed a workout
I was incredibly strict – and it was the happiest I have ever been weight training .
I looked forward to it every day – I was thankful just to be back in the gym .
I made more progress working out in those six months than in the three years prior .
Stop Taking Things For Granted
My biggest lesson from that was experience was this :
Taking things for granted has stopped me from achieving my goals more than the breaks that never came .
All those years I could have worked out , I could have had laser focus – but I did n’t .
I procrastinated ,
I wasted time and then only when I lost what I had taken for granted the whole time did I wake up and get serious .
I did n’t need a big break – I just needed to take the chance I already had right in front of me .
Take today ’s lesson as a starting point – and stop taking something for granted in your life today .
Appreciate it .
Take advantage of the moments and opportunities in your life right now .
Remember – YOU Are The “ Something ” You ’ve Been Waiting For .
You do n’t have to wait anymore .
Take Action Today
You do n’t have to go it alone .
If you like what you ’ve seen so far , and want to make the most out of your life , take a moment to read the details about my course The Action Solution and see if it ’s something you ’d be interested in .
It is the result of decades of experience , and hundreds of hours of working with real people – just like you .

According to a study published in the journal BMC Public Health , children as young as 10 - and 11 - years - old already have notions about the ideal body .
An analysis of more than 4,000 students from Nova Scotia revealed that young girls ’ happiness with their body image is directly linked to how thin they are .
Boys , on the other hand , were happiest when they were neither too lean , nor too heavy .
Given that dissatisfaction with body image is strongly linked with an increased risk for eating disorders , the researchers were particularly concerned to find that the perception of perfection began at such a young age .
Overall , 7.3 % of the girls included in the study reported that they did n’t like they way they looked , but that increased proportionately as girls ’ weight , measured by body mass index ( BMI ) , went up .
For girls with normal body weight , 5.7 % reported being unhappy with their bodies , among those who were overweight , 10.4 % did , and among girls who were categorized as obese , 13.1 % were unhappy with how they looked .
For girls , the researchers noted , every one unit increase in BMI measurement indicated about an 8 % increase in body dissatisfaction .
What ’s more , among the girls , but not the boys , those who had lower levels of educational achievement or lived in more rural areas were more likely to report feeling unhappy with their bodies .
Among boys , reported dissatisfaction was slightly higher than for girls , 7.8 % compared with 7.3 % , but unlike with the girls , their level of contentment did not fall in direct association with increasing body weight .
Instead , boys were unhappy if they perceived themselves as too skinny or as overweight .
Yet , similarly to the girls , as BMI increased to overweight or obese , there was also a trend of increasing dissatisfaction among the boys .
For boys of normal weight , 7.6 % reported not liking how they look , of those who were overweight , 8.4 % did , and of those considered obese , 8.1 % did .
Previous studies have shown that early , school - based intervention to teach children about healthy body weight and body image have actually achieved some success .
Considering the prevalence of childhood overweight — which now effects a third of American children , and more than a quarter of Canadian children — understanding how kids perceive themselves , and helping them to build confidence by building healthy behaviors may be vital not only for combating the obesity epidemic , but also diminishing its concurrent health problems , which range from diabetes to depression .
I would n't worry too much .
Whatever you might lack in skill you more than make up for in weirdness .
Protocol dictates that rank precedes gender , so if your intended holds a title higher than American Apparel sales associate , simply say , " Madam Chancellor , may I present My Erection ? " to which she will reply , " How do you do ? "
Attendees then rise for the national anthem , Senator Feinstein makes opening remarks , there is a canon salute , and Aaron Neville sings " Amazing Grace . "
Then , and only then , can insertion commence .
At least that 's how they do it where I come from .
However , Robert J. Rubel , author of the indispensable Master / Slave Relations : Handbook of Theory and Practice , as well as 2007's Squirms , Screams and Squirts : Going from Great Sex to Extraordinary Sex ( because the title A Dance to the Music of Time was already taken ) , disagrees .
He confirms your fear about implied incompetence and calls you a " submissive man , " a charge you 'll have to just sit there and take , I 'm afraid .
" I 've never had a woman guide me in initially , " he scoffs , before defining the core problem .
" Here 's the core problem : Anything that you do to pull the woman back into her head will destroy the moment .
Do n't ask her anything , do n't do anything that she has to think about , do n't confuse her . "
He 's absolutely right .
I was about to say something about the futility of rules with regard to the passionate acts of willing adults , but I 've already forgotten the question .

According to the White House , there was no deal with big Pharmaceutical companies that would bar the government from negotiating on prices .
However , given the constant stream of information and misinformation , it 's hard to tell what is really going on , and it would n't be surprising if by tomorrow , we heard there was a deal .
Regardless , the hope of a strong public option still exists , and it's down to progressives to keep pressure on the Obama Administration to ensure it is n't negotiated away .
Comparative Negligence in Western , PA
One issue that may arise in personal injury claims is comparative negligence .
In some cases , injury victims may have been somewhat at fault or negligent in causing the accident that led to their injuries .
Although plaintiffs in this situation still may be able to recover damages from other liable parties , their ability to do so is limited to some degree .
Under Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes 42 Pa. C.S. § 7102 , plaintiffs who are less at fault for an accident than other parties may still pursue compensation from those parties .
However , the amount of damages that they may be eligible to obtain will decrease by the percentage of their fault for the accident .
As a result , if the injury victims are thirty percent at - fault for the accident , then their maximum recovery is limited to seventy percent of their total damages .

Continental Airlines diverted a Twin-Cities - bound plane to Rochester due to a storm , and then locked the entire planeload of passengers in the plane overnight for nine hours .
The TSA had gone home , so the passengers could n't clear security if they got off and left the airport , and the ground crew would n't let them get off and stay in the airport .
So 47 people — including babies — were locked into the plane with no food and overflowing toilets , held prisoner until the airline could get its act together .
Jesus .
" It 's not like you 're on a [ Boeing ] 747 and you can walk around , " said Christin , a professor at William Mitchell College of Law .
" This was a sardine can , with a single row of seats on one side of the plane and two rows of seats on the other .
And they 've got about 50 people inside , including babies , for the whole night .
It was a nightmare … "
The airline crew on the plane reached their maximum work hours in the air , so another crew had to be flown in .
The alternative of chartering a bus did n't work out .
And letting the passengers into the Rochester airport was not possible because they would have to go through security screening again , and the screeners had gone home for the day .
What about just letting the passengers sleep in the airport terminal ?
" That was not provided as an option by ground services personnel at the airport , " said Nicholas …
As light began to fill the cabin around 6 a.m. , the plane doors opened and passengers were allowed into the airport terminal , Christin said .
The airlines gave them one free beverage , he said .
By about 9:30 a.m. , the passengers were sent back on the same plane they had spent the night in — which by this time had no functioning restroom .
They landed in the Twin Cities about 11 a.m .

' I 'm so relieved , ' confesses Katie Price as police admit they 're powerless to act on rape claim
Katie Price was said to be ' hugely relieved ' last night after police confirmed that they would not be investigating claims she had been raped by a celebrity .
The mother - of - three has reportedly vowed to keep a low profile over the the next few weeks and is determined ' to draw a line under the whole sorry episode ' , according to reports .
Price , 31 , is said to have told friends that she was stunned at the attention her confession received .
Getaway : Katie Price and boyfriend
Alex make a hasty exit from her Surrey home
Taking flight : Katie was seen in her customised Beetle escaping the furore by flying off in a helicopter from Biggin Hill
' I never expected it to blow up like this .
I want it to go away , ' she is quoted as telling friends in a report by The Mirror .
The news comes after she made a determined effort to return to her normal routine yesterday after a tumultuous week .
The glamour model left her Surrey home in her customised pink Beetle for Biggin Hill air base where she boarded a helicopter .
And as she flew off to an undisclosed location , police admitted they were powerless to pursue her rape allegations unless she made a formal complaint .
Surrey Police confirmed officers had spoken to Katie , 31 , but that the force lacked ' substantiated information ' about the alleged attack .
A spokesman said an ' incident ' has been recorded but Price must speak to them if they are to formally record a crime and start an inquiry .
Escape : Katie left Biggin Hill airfield in a helicopter for an undisclosed destination
A Surrey Police spokesman said the situation could change if new information came to light .
He said : ' Surrey Police treats all reports of sexual offences very seriously and investigates them thoroughly , encouraging anyone who may have been a victim to come forward and providing specialist officers to support them .
' Based on our inquiries and the lack of substantiated information - particularly around locations and dates of any allegations - we have recorded an incident , but due to its very historic nature we are dependent on Miss Price 's co-operation to formally record a crime and continue any investigation .
' Should any new information come to light , it will be diligently investigated and this position may be reviewed . '
No comment : Price and her son Harvey in London yesterday .
After being visited by police last night , she refused to make a statement about the rape claims
Local officers spoke to her at her home in Woldingham , Surrey , last night about the allegations and fears that she was targeted by a bogus police officer .
She declined to give a formal statement and officers no longer believe she was visited by anyone pretending to be from the police .
Detectives wanted to question the glamour girl over allegations in her magazine column and a subsequent interview that a ' famous celebrity ' subjected her to a brutal sex attack .
Denial : Warren Furman , who dated the model for two years has angrily denied he is the celebrity who raped her
Price - also known as Jordan - initially said she would ' absolutely never ' name the man and had no plans to make an official report to police .
But Surrey Police made contact with her representatives yesterday after it emerged she let the alleged attacker 's name slip off - air during filming of her ITV2 reality show What Katie Did Next .
After being visited by officers last night , she refused to make a statement after internet rumours pointed the finger of suspicion at him .
However , speculation was still mounting that the celebrity could be named publicly like John Leslie , the former TV presenter who was suspected after Ulrika Jonsson made her own anonymous allegation , which he strongly denied .
Yesterday Price 's former fiance Gladiator Warren Furman blasted claims he was her attacker .
The 37 - year - old told the Daily Star : ' Whoever she claims raped her , it is certainly not me and I do n't think anyone would believe anything she said anyway . '
Furman , who dated Jordan for two years , is thought to have addressed the rumour after internet gossip pointed the finger of suspicion at him .
To start a meaningful inquiry , police would need Price 's cooperation and details of when the alleged attack happened and the names of any witnesses who could corroborate what happened .
As police made their move yesterday , there was mounting cynicism about Price 's true motives for revealing her alleged rape ordeal several years ago .
Recently , she has milked publicity about her divorce from 90s pop star Peter Andre and media figures claimed she might be aiming to ' cash in ' by selling the rape story .
But detectives believe they have an obligation to investigate further and have arranged a full interview with her .
Another day , another interview : Peter Andre appears on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross yesterday , but he avoids discussing his estranged
wife 's rape allegations
Senior sources stressed that it was too early to say whether a full - scale inquiry will begin .
Price first made the sex attack revelation after newspaper stories appeared about her actor boyfriend Alex Reid allegedly filming a rape scene for a forthcoming movie .
The model said reporting the matter to police was a ' hard thing to do ' .
The alleged attack is said to have taken place several years ago after a party in the West End following a series of secret dates between Price and the unnamed man .
Surrey Police said Price has been contacted but had not been spoken to ' in depth ' .
A source said : ' We are trying to establish whether any offence has occurred .
We need to see her because very serious allegations have surfaced in the media . '
But the alleged attacker 's identity has since been widely circulated in showbiz and media circles and it is only a question of time before the name becomes public knowledge .
A show insider revealed there was a three - line whip at the ITV2 studio .
A handful of people know who it is but they are absolutely not allowed to even tell their loved ones , ' the sources was quoted in The Sun .
Price maintains she will never name the attacker but with it now ' out there ' , her alleged rapist faces a battle to remain anonymous .
Yesterday , one anonymous celebrity approached by national newspaper reporters categorically denied any involvement .
Understanding : Katie Price contacted the Matthew Wright show during a TV debate to defend her actions in saying the rapist was a celebrity
Price yesterday called in to Channel Five 's Matthew Wright show to say she would ' take to the grave ' the identity of the rapist , who she described to friends as ' vicious ' .
One friend said she had been grabbed round the throat during the assault which left her ' devastated ' .
' She told how he became violent towards her after not getting his way .
' At one point he made a move for her throat .
It sounded terrible , ' the friend told The Mirror .
' At the time she was too scared to report it . '
Sources have revealed that the ordeal took place at a party in London 's West End before she met and married ex-husband Peter Andre .
She and the attacker are thought to have been on secret dates and ' got on well ' before the alleged attack .
The friend added : ' She was shocked by some of the lewd things he used to come out with .
' It was clear he was highly sexed and in hindsight , it should have served as a warning sign .
She wishes she had nothing to do with him ' .
Yesterday , Katie rang Channel
Five after watching the panel debate her decision to say she had been sexually assaulted by a celebrity .
She said she was ' livid ' at the storm that had been whipped up around her allegations and denied they were a cynical publicity stunt .
Speaking to show host Matthew Wright , she said : ' I 'm sitting here watching the programme - we 're all here doing a shoot .
Thanks for sticking up for me Matthew - you understand the media .
' I have n't just come out and said I got raped , I was actually sticking up for Alex .
It come out in the newspapers that he was doing this rape thing and I stuck up for him in my OK column .
' I would never do something like that for sympathy .
It has all got out of context , I think it is really out of order to say I would do it for sympathy I would never do that .'
Katie claims she would never use the crime to promote herself and said she never thought it would be all over the papers .
Defence : Katie with boyfriend Alex Reid .
The model said she only spoke about the rape to defend him from claims his new film glorified rape
She said : ' I have mentioned it in my column , then I did a shoot with the kids and the press have gone on and on about it .
I am absolutely livid - they dig and dig and dig .
' I do n't make a joke about it - it is a serious matter .
I woke up this morning and it's over the front of the newspapers . '
When asked whether she would go to the police , she replied : ' It happened absolutely years ago and like anyone , it 's just a hard thing to do .
' It 's been done now , what do you do ?
I would say if something happens you should go to the police .
It was definitely rape - I did n't consent to it .'
Wright then asked the mother of three Katie if she would go on to name her attacker and said that speculation was rife about who it could be .
But she replied : ' Never , never , absolutely not . '
Ironically it was Wright who accidentally named television presenter John Leslie as the celebrity Ulrika Jonsson had been referring to when she claimed she had been raped .
Like Price she had made the claim but refused to publicly identify her attacker .
Leslie always denied it and was never charged .
Wright said today that people were quizzing him , because of his previous gaffe and reeling off a list of her previous lovers for confirmation .
Peter Andre yesterday held out an olive branch to the singer as he talked about his hopes for a reconciliation with the mother of two of his children .
The singer , who was promoting his new album , Revelations , said : ' I have said before that I reckon for the sake of the kids , you will compromise and do things and I think yes there will be a point .
' So you know you 've got to allow time for things to settle I think .
I have thought about it for the kids but not how or when or whatever .
I just know that time is a healer , everybody says that .
In an interview on Live From Studio Five , Peter also said that if he did meet anyone else then he would n't want to put them on camera .
In most human conflicts , there are good guys and bad guys .
This is not so in the history of global conservation , which is at least partly a story of good guy versus good guy .
The major contestants in the struggle to protect nature and preserve biological diversity may seem to be transnational conservation organisations on one side and rapacious extractive industries on the other .
But there is a larger , more lamentable conflict : the one between transnational conservation and the worldwide movement of indigenous peoples - good guys both .
These two forces share a goal that is vital to life on earth - a healthy and diverse biosphere .
Both are communities of integrity led by some of the most admirable , dedicated people alive .
Both care deeply for the planet and together are capable of preserving more biodiversity than any other two groups on it .
Yet they have been terribly at odds with one another over the past century or more , violently so at times , mostly because of conflicting views of nature , radically different definitions of " wilderness " and profound misunderstandings of one another 's science and culture .
The perceived arrogance of " big conservation " is a confounding factor ; so too is the understandable tendency of some indigenous people to conflate conservation with imperialism .
The results of this century - old conflict are thousands of protected areas that cannot be managed and an intractable debate over who holds the key to successful conservation in the most biologically rich areas of the world .
Violent effort
The conflict began in the bucolic stillness of Yosemite valley in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains of California .
From the middle of the 19th century until 1914 , when Yosemite became a national park , a concerted and at times violent effort was made to rid Yosemite of its natives , a small band of Miwok Native Americans who had settled in the valley about 4,000 years ago .
During the same period , most of the major parks created in America - notably Yellowstone , Grand Canyon , Mesa Verde , Mount Rainier , Zion , Glacier , Everglades and Olympic - repeated the Yosemite example by expelling thousands of tribal people from their homes and hunting grounds so that the new parks could remain in a " state of nature " .
This practice of conservation was exported worldwide , becoming known as " the Yosemite model " .
Refugees from conservation areas have never been counted ; they are not even officially recognised as refugees .
But the number of people displaced from traditional homelands worldwide over the past century in the interest of conservation is estimated to be close to 20 million , 14 million of them in Africa alone .
I have travelled across all five inhabited continents researching this subject , visiting hundreds of indigenous communities , some in conflict with western - style conservation , others in harmony with it .
Although tension persists , along with arrogance , ignorance and the conflicts they breed , I found an encouraging dialogue growing between formally educated wildlife biologists , who once saw humanity as inimical to nature , and ancient aboriginal societies that have passed their remarkable ecological knowledge from generation to generation without a page of text .
I found , mostly in the field , a new generation of conservationists who realise that the very landscapes they seek to protect owe their high biodiversity to the practices of the people who have lived there , in some cases for thousands of years .
Wildland conservation has a recorded history and a literary tradition .
Aborigines evicted from their homelands in the interest of conservation have only memory and the bitter oral narrative I heard again and again while visiting their makeshift villages and refugee camps ; their pre-eviction experience is rarely recorded outside the literature of anthropology .
So the concept of " fortress conservation " and the preference for " virgin " wilderness has lingered in a movement that has tended to value all nature but human nature , and refused to recognise the positive wildness in human beings .
Thus the beautifully written and widely read essays and memoirs of early American eco-heroes such as John Muir , Lafayette Bunnell , Samuel Bowles , George Perkins Marsh and Aldo Leopold inform a conservation mythology that until quite recently separated nature from culture and portrayed both natives and early settlers of frontier areas as reckless abusers of nature , with no sense or tradition of stewardship , no understanding of wildlife biology and no appreciation of biodiversity .
It was the " manifest destiny " of conservation leaders , then , to tame what the 17th - century Massachusetts Puritan poet and minister Michael Wigglesworth described as
A waste and howling wilderness /
Where none inhabited / But hellish fiends , and brutish men / That devils worshipped
It has taken transnational conservation a century to see the folly of some of its heroes , such as Richard Leakey , who recently denied the existence of indigenous peoples in his home country , Kenya , and called for the removal of all " settlers " from game reserves and other protected areas .
Today , all but the most stubborn enclose - and - exclude conservationists are willing to admit that it is specious to conflate nature with wilderness and occupants with " first visitors " .
They have recognised that indigenous people manage immense areas of biologically rich land , even if they do n't own it .
And most , although not all , are managing it well .
Hostile evictees
Some conservationists argue that a policy of tolerating the impoverishment of indigenous people has wrecked the lives of 20 million poor , powerless but eco-wise people , and has been an enormous mistake - not only a moral , social , philosophical and economic mistake , but an ecological one as well .
For it is far better to have good stewards living on land than to have that same land cleared of residents and surrounded by hostile evictees .
Enlightened conservationists are beginning to accept the axiom that only by preserving cultural diversity can biological diversity be protected , and vice versa .
As conservationists and native people make their uneasy convergence , I hope they will come to agree that they both own the interdependent causes of biodiversity conservation and cultural survival , that they need each other , and that together they can create a new conservation paradigm that honours and respects the ways of life of people who have been living sustainably for generations on what can only be fairly regarded as their native land .
And I hope that native people will blend their traditional knowledge systems with the newer sciences of ecology and conservation biology in search of better ways to preserve the diversity of species , which is not only vital to their own security but to all life on earth .
At this point , as the entire planet seems poised to tip into ecological chaos , with almost 40,000 plant and animal species facing extinction and 60 % of the ecosystem services that support life failing , there may be no other way .

Last Thursday , Twitter was “ defending against a denial - of - service attack . ”
This attack caused an outage on their site that began around 9.m. EDT and lasted for a few hour .
Now there has been a lot of speculation about who caused the attack , but I personally like CNET ’s hypothesis that 4 chan was behind it .
It makes it a little more interesting when the culprit is actually tangible not a secretive , nameless organization conducting their nefarious deeds from within the shadows .
In my opinion at least .
Speaking of Twitter , do n’t forget I have a Twitter account as well if you want to start following me .
I actually use it and respond to people who tweet me as well .
So , on Thursday I said that today was going to be the sequel to Tales from ConnectiCon ’09 : Part I. Today was suppose to be Monday Mookie .
Unfortunately , I did n’t anticipate this happening to Twitter when I wrote that post .
So now I planning for Thursday to be Tales from ConnectiCon ’09 : Part II a .k.a. Terracciano Thursday !
THE other day I had lunch with a guy whose first job out of college was as a foreign service officer in the American embassy in Saigon in 1965 .
He was one of 20 guys on the political desk assigned to head out to the provinces for a week at a time to check whether the things the South Vietnamese government was saying bore any relationship to reality .
He would check in with John Paul Vann and send the information up to Richard Holbrooke and Robert Komer .
Basically he was present at the formation of American counterinsurgency ( COIN ) doctrine .
So I asked him what he thought the prospects were for applying COIN to Afghanistan .
What happens when America gets involved , he said , is that we bring in this immense amount of infrastructure and personnel .
And the first thing you see is that inflation goes through the roof , which destroys the local economy right off the bat .
So nobody in the government can survive on their salary .
And then we complain that they all turn corrupt .
This is worth bearing in mind with regard to a question Spencer Ackerman asked the other day : when Admiral Michael Mullen says the Taliban is delivering better , less corrupt governance than the Afghan government is , why is that ?
In Afghanistan , inflation has not been the problem it was in Vietnam : it hit 20 % last year due to high oil prices , but has mostly stayed in single digits since 2001 .
But as in South Vietnam , the economy and revenue flows in Afghanistan are being entirely driven by donor aid .
Two - thirds of government spending is financed by donors .
The country 's GDP in 2008 was $ 23 billion ; American aid , excluding the cost of combat , was $ 9.3 billion .
The cost of combat operations in 2009 will be $ 60 billion .
One hears a lot about the corrupting effects of the heroin trade , but it amounts to just $ 3 billion a year .
You do n't have to be William Easterly to surmise that this vast quantity of aid money sloshing around in one of the poorest economies in the world is guaranteed to create unmanageable corruption problems .
Or maybe " create " corruption is the wrong way to think about it .
This 2007 report by the UN Office of Crime and Drug Control ( UNODC ) pointed out that since the foundation of the Kingdom of Afghanistan in the early 19th century , the state has never gathered much of its own revenue ; it relied first on " protection payments " from the British Empire and , later , on subsidies from the USSR and , now , the US .
Nor has it ever provided much in the way of services .
There basically has never been much of a government in Afghanistan :
The erosion of the state , and its contestation and capture by different factions , meant that in effect the public sphere ( and public positions ) were appropriated ( and misused ) for private ( including factional ) gain through most of the period of conflict .
Hence it is not very meaningful to try to delineate a concept of “ corruption ” within this nexus of state capture , state failure , and “ privatization ” of state functions .
Why the Taliban is doing a good job of governance is not yet clear .
But why the Afghan government is doing a bad job of governance is pretty obvious .
And it just does n't seem likely that pouring in more aid will solve the problem , rather than exacerbate it .

Drunk Driver Injury Attorney
Drunk driving accidents are some of the most devastating because they are preventable .
When a person leaves an establishment intoxicated , did you know that the location itself may be responsible for the damages he or she causes to another party if they knew his condition ?
Did you know that drunk driving accidents are often caused by people who have done this before – often with multiple convictions behind them ?
It 's time to work hard to make those responsible pay for the losses they impose on innocent victims .

Truck Accident Injury Attorney
Trucks are heavy , large vehicles sometimes driven for long periods of time by tired drivers .
It 's true an accident can happen for any reason , but many times , the loss occurs because of poor driving habits , fatigue , and poor management oversight of drivers .
If you have been in a truck driving accident , our attorneys have the experience to help you .
We work with clients facing significant loss as a result of a truck accident , such as medical bills , pain and suffering , lost time at work , and much more .
Our truck accident injury attorney works with clients facing a wide range of experiences .
You may have struck a truck yourself , perhaps due to the driver 's mistake .
A driver may have struck you , causing damage to your car .
In some situations , truck and car accidents can involve multiple parties , making it hard to determine who is at fault .
Our team works to gather evidence to prove what your case is and what your rights to compensation after a truck accident are .
No matter what you 've suffered , we want to learn more about your case .
Negligence , carelessness , and illegal activities tend to lead to these deadly truck accidents .
Hit and Run Accidents
Hit and run car accidents can leave you feeling unable to get help .
If someone strikes your vehicle and then leaves the scene of the incident , you still have options .
Your goal should be to report it to the police and allow them to work on determining who is responsible .
Thereafter , our hit and run accident attorneys work for you from the start to identify the responsible driver and to access available insurance coverage in every case .
North Carolina law allows hit and run victims to collect personal injury benefits from multiple car insurance policies .
However , these insurance companies always try to limit your payment .
That is why we provide comprehensive protection for you .
Let our hit and run lawyers gather evidence to support your case .
We also can help you to file claims against the responsible party 's insurance if the police determine who did it .
Do n't settle your case until you speak to our team about all of the losses you have including medical bills , lost time at work , pain and suffering , and long term limitations .
Public Transportation Accidents
Buses , rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft , and transit systems can cause accidents of all types .
These organizations have the legal requirement to provide you with safety while you are transported from one area to the next .
However , if you are involved in an accident on a bus , in a Lyft or Uber vehicle , or any other type of public transportation , our car accident attorneys can help you to obtain compensation for your losses .
This includes incidents when you are hit by a bus , suffered an injury on the public transportation system that leads to significant medical bills , or when you are injured as a passenger .
Because these types of accidents can be very hard to prove in a court of law , it is always best to have an attorney by your side who has experience in this area .
You can depend on Nagle & Associates to learn what options are available to you to help you overcome the financial losses you 've suffered .
We encourage you to call us right away for a consultation to discuss the incident if you 've suffered medical bills or other types of financial loss as a result of the incident .
Bike Injury & Pedestrian Accident Attorneys
Our team works closely with those who were hit on a bike or struck while walking as well .
Bicycle - involved car accidents are quite common with over 702 accidents causing injury in 2012 alone .
In some situations , bike - related car accidents involve some of the most devastating medical injuries .
The bike rider can be thrown hundreds of feet , suffering intense damage to their body , their organs or their brain .
Many have broken bones , internal injuries , and long - term limitations as a result of being involved in such an accident .
It is always our job to ensure we understand all of the losses you 've experienced so we can help you to overcome the injuries and collect full payment for all legal claims .
Our bike and pedestrian accident attorneys also provide support for reconstructing the incident .
If there is any question about fault in your case , we 'll work to show what happened and help you to fight for the compensation owed to you .
We work with people who have suffered these injuries themselves as well as family members of those who have suffered catastrophic injury or death as a result of a car accident involving a bike .
When traffic congestion , a lack of following the law , or distracted driving leaves you suffering as a bicycle rider or a walker , allow Nagle & Associates to help prove your case .

By Hilary White
August 11 , 2009 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) -
One of Britain 's most popular novelists , who recently revealed that he suffers from Alzheimer 's disease , has weighed in on the side of legalising assisted suicide .
Terry Pratchett , the author of one of the world 's most popular series of science fiction / fantasy books , told the Daily Mail that he wants the " right " to kill himself , saying , " I live in hope I can jump before I am pushed . "
In an op -ed , Pratchett described those who had already travelled to Switzerland to kill themselves as " brave souls " and his own potential suicide as a heroic act .
" I live in hope - hope that before the disease in my brain finally wipes it clean , I can jump before I am pushed and drag my evil Nemesis to its doom , like Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty locked in combat as they go over the waterfall . "
He said it is a " scandal " that people have to travel to commit suicide .
" t should be possible to die with benign assistance here . "
In the wake of a decision last week by the House of Lords judicial committee , called the Law Lords , Pratchett said , " I believe that if the burden gets too great , those who wish should be allowed to be shown the door .
In my case , in the fullness of time , I hope it will be in the garden under an English sky .
Or , if wet , the library . "
The Law Lords ruled that the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) for England and Wales must issue " guidance " on when and in what circumstances the law on assisted suicide will be prosecuted .
The case was brought by Debbie Purdy , a woman with multiple sclerosis who has campaigned for legal assisted suicide .
Purdy has said she intends to commit suicide at the Dignitas facility in Switzerland and wants guarantees that her husband will not face prosecution if he assists her .
Currently , assisting suicide is a criminal offense in Britain punishable by up to 14 years in prison , but the public prosecutor 's office has stated repeatedly that such cases will not be pursued .
Euthanasia and assisted suicide campaigners looked upon the Law Lords decision as a step towards legalisation .
Pratchett said he did not believe legal assisted suicide would lead to involuntary euthanasia of helpless patients .
" I have seen people profess to fear that the existence of a formalised approach to assisted dying could lead to it somehow becoming part of national health policy . "
" I very much doubt this could be the case .
We are a democracy and no democratic government is going to get anywhere with a policy of even recommended euthanasia .
" If we were ever to end up with such a government , we would be in so much trouble that the problem would become the least of our worries .
But neither do I believe in a duty to suffer the worst ravages of terminal illness . "
As of 2008 , Pratchett had published 36 " Discworld " novels that satirise modern life using imagery from a wide range of literature from Shakespeare , to JRR Tolkien to A. A. Milne , Edgar Allen Poe and Jules Verne .
He was the UK's best - selling author of the 1990s and has sold more than 55 million books with translations made in 36 languages .
The themes and characters of his books have been made into computer and internet games , role playing games and comic books and 14 Discworld novels have been adapted for the stage .
Many have noted that Pratchett 's views on religion are nearly uniformly negative , with special venom aimed at Christianity .
He describes himself as a humanist and is a " Distinguished Supporter " of the British Humanist Association , one of Britain 's leading anti-Christian campaign groups .
In the novels , all set in the same imaginary world , the religion of Om is analogous to Christianity .
The priesthood of Om is a clear parody of the Catholic Church whose clergy occupy themselves mainly with torturing non-believers .
At the end of Pratchett 's 13th novel , Small Gods , that has been described as a vicious attack on Catholicism , the hero ends the " Quisition " and reforms the church to be more open - minded and humanist in which followers make up their own theology and ethics .

The Hofstra Rape Hoax has people talking about date - rape all over again .
Emily Bazelon has some interesting commentary here .
Glenn Reynolds and Ann Althouse have some great comments here .
Let 's not dwell on the abstract ; let 's look at the concrete .
Let 's examine a real - life date - rape case .
( A defendant has consented to have his case details made available , though he does not want to be personally identified . )
In State v. Anonymous , the defendant went out drinking with the complaining witness ( CW ) and her best friend .
They drank most of the night .
Between the three of them , they drank less than 1/2 a bottle of Captain Morgan .
Around midnight , the defendant and CW had sex .
The defendant stayed overnight .
He left the next morning after the CW angrily told him to leave .
A review of police reports , private investigator reports , and medical reports revealed the following :
The complaining witness ' ( CW's ) best friend was in the room – and conscious – during the sexual intercourse .
The friend told police that she , " heard kissing noises " ; did not hear any " screams " ; or other " unusual sounds " ; and said : " I would have done something if I had though there was anything wrong . "
The CW , depending upon whom she was talking to , testified : " I was passed out the entire time " ; " I woke up but could n’t move " ; " I screamed " ; " I tried fighting him off " ; " I was in and out of consciousness " ; " I was kind of aware but not really . "
Even if we took the CW at her word , and that she had truly been in - and - out of consciousness , how could she have known she did n't consent ?
Is n't it interesting that a woman lacks the awareness to consent , but nevertheless has the awareness to realize she did not consent ?
Maybe there 's a grey line in between awareness and consent .
Maybe .
Then again , if the defendant had been drunk :
How could he have formed criminal intent ?
Think about it .
If everyone is drunk , how can we say a woman was too drunk to consent ; but that the man was n't too drunk to form intent ?
If everyone is drunk , then everyone should be presumably equally infirm .
Feminists , however , do not want equality .
Thus , if a drunk man has sex with a drunk woman :
The drunk man had the mental state to know he was committing rape .
The drunk woman lacked the mental state to consent to sex .
Incidentally , there was substantial evidence indicating that the CW should not have been taken at her word :
The defendant stayed the night after having committed such a horrible misdeed .
The defendant and CW worked together the next day .
The CW told police that there was " no way [ the defendant ] could have gotten any signals that I wanted to sleep with him . "
But ...
... The CW ’s best friend told police , " [ The CW ] was flirting [ with the defendant ] the entire night . "
the entire night . "
The CW had showed the defendant her breasts earlier that night .
The CW omitted that material fact in her previous discussions with police .
After the defendant naively talked to police , revealing facts about the case :
The CW admitted that she had " lifted up her shirt in front of the defendant , but did n't really mean to show her breasts . "
The CW omitted that material fact in her previous discussions with police .
After the defendant naively talked to police , revealing facts about the case :
The CW admitted that she had " lifted up her shirt in front of the defendant , but did n't really mean to show her breasts . "
CW admitted she was " ashamed " for having gotten drunk and " felt bad about having to explain to her mom " why she was sick ( re : hungover ) .
What were the " bad facts " for the defense ?
Every case has them , right ?
There must have been something to the case ?
The medical reports revealed no physical trauma .
No signs of any vaginal tears or damage .
The examining physician said that the CW cracked jokes during the exam .
No ripped clothing .
No roofies or date - rape drugs .
No bruises .
No screams .
No one was saying no .
In fact , according to the defendant , the CW initiated sexual contact .
The CW had shown her breasts earlier , asking the defendant if he liked them .
The CW also vaguely told police that she " sat on [ the defendant 's ] back . "
( The defendant told police she was straddling the small of his back , grinding her vagina on it , after he had laid on his stomach to fall asleep . )
The CW 's best friend corroborated the defendant 's story .
Incidentally , the defendant said that he and the CW had been making out .
Police did not take a DNA swab of the CW .
Would n't that have been relevant , exculpatory evidence ?
The CW wanted to make it seem as if she feel asleep , only to awaken to a beast mounting her .
Why not run a DNA swab through her cheek , to see if she had the defendant 's post - French - kissing saliva ?
The police , naturally , did no such investigation .
Proof that a police investigation is about confirming guilt rather than finding the truth .
After the complaint was made , the Special Victims Unit – tasked with people who are specially trained to believe rape victims – refused to file charges .
SVU prosecutors did n't believe the CW .
They would n't file .
That should have ended the case .
Nevertheless , the CW 's family knew the District Attorney himself .
Charges were filed .
The realpolitik of criminal law : Guilt or innocence matters less than personal relationships .
The Chief Deputy Assistant District Attorney ( the # 3 man in the DA ’s office ) was initially assigned the case .
He was an ornery prosecutor who won the office 's tough cases .
The Chief Deputy wanted to dismiss the case .
The DA would not let him .
Rather than proceed with the case , the Chief Deputy recused himself .
The District Attorney re-assigned the case to some flunkies and were told that they could not dismiss the case .
The defendant , if he had lost at trial , would have been given a minimum 4 - year prison sentence .
Added to that would have been lifetime registration as a sex offender .
Did the defendant go to trial , vindicating his rights ?
Surely he did .
He was acquitted .
Then the State Bar investigated the DA 's office , asking why the case was ever filed .
Only people who have never walked inside a criminal courtroom are n't rolling their eyes .
The defendant instead took a deferred adjudication deal .
With deferred adjudication , the charges are dismissed after a period of court supervision .
Deferred adjudication is not the same thing as an outright dismissal .
It ’s not a not - guilty verdict .
Still , in the criminal system , it 's as close to an outright dismissal as you can get without risking prison , and sex - offender registration .
Plus , legally , it 's a dismissal .
One who accepts deferred adjudication can truthfully claim that he has never been convicted of a crime .
It was an unsatisfying end to a horrifying case .
That case completely changed my view on how the criminal justice system treats date - rape cases .
I used to buy into the feminist line about date - rape .
I read Real Rape in college .
And believed it .
Live that case for a few years , and you 'll see the nakedness of feminism .
It 's scarier than Andrea Dworkin at your bed side .
You might say that the case described , above , is an aberration .
If only .
A couple of years later we had a similar case come in .
( The defendant in that case would rather not have his case details put out there . )
Talk to some criminal defense lawyers .
Almost all have seen a similarly marginal case ruin a young man 's life .
September 26 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
This is the first post that ’s coming out of my attempt to read ‘ Discipline and Punish ‘ by Michel Foucault .
I want to start with the broadest idea of the book : an analysis of how our attitudes to and methods of punishment have changed in the emergence of modern society .
Foucault ’s story is like this : in the previous ideology of punishment , the criminal appeared as something outside of and opposed to the social body – that social body being identified with the body of the king .
The function of punishment was to reaffirm the superiority of the sovereign body over the criminal ’s body by destroying it ; the more complete the destruction , the more effective .
Hence criminals taken out in public , tortured , dismembered , and finally executed .
In the currently ascendant ideology of punishment , the criminal appeared as always still a part of the social body , but a malfunctioning and diseased part ( partly because the social body was now the nation and the people , not the sovereign ) .
So now the function of punishment is to restore it to health – to strengthen and clean society .
Some key consequences of this new approach to punishment : that rather than seeking excess ( after all , to rip off someone ’s flesh with pincers , and kill them , and then string out their guts , is pretty excessive ) it had to seek balance between two opposed imperatives .
On the one hand , to attack and harm ( after all , that ’s what punishment is ) , but on the other , to respect and preserve the criminal ( for they must eventually be returned to society in ‘ mended ’ form ) .
Secondly , knowledge of the criminal now becomes vital – detailed understanding so that they can be changed both inside and outside .
This again tells against ‘ excess ’ and ‘ violence ’ , because they might disrupt the collection of systematic data .
The prison thus appears as the paradigm of punishment it preserves a symbolic ‘ something ’ about the prisoner that is not violated ( they can keep their bodily integrity as long as they follow the regulations ) and because its regimented , drawn - out nature allows for the collection of detailed information , the detailed composition of schedules and regulations , and the endeavour of trying to ‘ fix ’ the defective human being .
That ’s how Foucault presents matters – and in many respects this account is not too different from the conventional liberal story .
As society became more ‘ civilised ’ , its efforts at punishment shifted away from being motivated by base motives of vengeance and cruelty , and came to embrace ‘ humanitarian ’ punishment that respected the ‘ rights ’ and ‘ dignity ’ of the criminal , along with seeking to ‘ understand ’ them so as to ‘ rehabilitate ’ them .
The two stories are clearly referring to the same phenomenon , but presenting it in quite different ways – in essence , for the liberal , this new ‘ humanitarianism ’ is the opposite of the preceding attitudes towards punishment , while for Foucault , it is a different version of them .
It ’s Foucault ’s interpretation that makes most sense to me – it looks both more likely that the new approach should take over a heavy debt to the former , and similar foundations , and also more suited to explaining the defects of ‘ humanitarianism ’ that sit uneasily with its avowed principles .
What I want to add , and explore , is that this change looks like an example of a more widely recognisable psychological phenomenon : a sort of ‘ sadistic - altruistic shift ’ .
If I enjoy exercising power , then the way that I prefer to do so is liable to become more destructive and sadistic as I feel more threatened and insecure , and more ‘ benevolent ’ as I feel more secure and confident .
Under threat , I must exhibit power by destroying the threat as much as possible – with more security , I can rise my sights to aim at a more refined form of power , that would make the recipient accept my dominance with gratitude .
So it seems that what ’s happened is that as ‘ society ’ becomes stronger ( and , insofar as certain groups have effective control over society and its resources , as they become stronger ) its sense of that strength makes it less interested in merely destroying its ‘ enemies within’ , and more interested in a greater expression of dominance – ‘ reforming ’ them .
What might this suggest about the future ?
There are three obvious thoughts one might suggest .
Firstly , it might be that this is neither an improvement nor a worsening , merely a change of form , and in a century or two we ’ll merely get another form of the same will - to - power .
We may document the development of humanitarianism , but see nothing of great promise or threat in it .
Foucault does n’t explicitly say anything like this , but to me it seems to be , in practice , the implication of the general future - agnosticism of him and his pomo friends .
Secondly , it might be that this humanitarian form of power is actually , in its own way , worse – perhaps not now , but for the future .
We might predict that if society continues to develop as it has , the institutions of discipline – prisons among them – will become so generalised that no other tendency of impulse will be able to contest the ‘ will to rehabilitative power ’ .
This possibility is explored in books like 1984 and Brave New World – in both cases , an omnipotent power controls all of society ‘ for its own benefit ’ , though in different ways .
Thirdly , it might be that humanitarianism is a progressive step , and that its further development will be in the direction of its own dissolution ( that is , dissolution as a particular form of power - relationship ) .
That would involve telling a story like this : the reason why the human psyche finds ‘ rehabilitation ’ a more satisfying form of domination ( and hence prefers it when it has sufficient confidence ) is because , together with self - defensive urges , it naturally contains a wish for fellowship and reconciliation .
Its perspective naturally reaches out to the other person ’s shoes , and humanitarian punishment provides a mix of these two : it combines power - over with a measure of empathy and fellowship .
Consequently , when that psyche ’s power and confidence increases even more , the need for domination ebbs , while the need for fellowship strengthens .
The amount of control and self - assertion - by - power - over that ’s needed is less : the psyche is less afraid of the other ’s unpredictability , and so is more willing to grant it freedom , more willing to let go of some control – while the need for fellowship , in order to be able to sleep at night , does not similarly weaken .
Eventually , it becomes more satisfying to let the other be free , and to enjoy the sense of self that comes from being recognised by one whom you recognise ( am I sounding Hegelian enough ? ) , than to seek to control them .
It is still the same desire , at base – still will - to - power ( am I sounding Nietzschean enough ? ) , but now finding satisfaction not in triumph of ‘ me ’ over ‘ you ’ but of ‘ us ’ over our the very alienation that made ‘ me - over - you ’ make sense .
The key claim here , in amongst the German philosophy , is that our desire to affirm ourselves by dominating others ( rather than in more social ways ) is a product of fear and weakness , and that therefore , if the curret processes of technology and social development continue , it will be gradually reduced .
That amounts , arguably , to a particularly specific form of the oft - debated idea that ‘ human beings are naturally good ’ .
It also implies that the predictions of such novels as ‘ Brave New World ’ are not natural extensions of current trends , but rather the product of an artificial ( and , over time , likely unstable ) holding up of those trends – that the lack of interest in freedom or transcendence , and the great willingness to control and manipulate , which such dystopias envisage , would need a setting of societal fear , weakness , and vulnerability that the technology they possess would be in serious tension with .
Such a position might seem blithely optimistic .
It might also seem determinist , in that it suggests that the cycles of cruelty will wear out due to relatively apolitical trends in technology , rather than by ‘ our ’ efforts to break them .
Such allegations are perhaps valid , and perhaps not .
They certainly do n’t imply that it ’s not nevertheless true .
Day two of the CRTC network management hearing featured some great presentations from the Open Internet Coalition , Zip.ca , CISP , and two knowledgeable individuals – Jean - Francois Mezei and Jason Roks .
The presenters had some strong words about the lack of Canadian competition for high - speed Internet service , the debatable claims about the impact of P2P on congestion , and the overstated advertising claims .
Unfortunately , it would appear once again that the Commission has accepted the ISP claims regarding congestion and network costs , leaving the panelists with the challenge of overcoming those basic assumptions .
That said , the day featured some startling revelations including Zip.ca 's Rob Hall stating that it is currently cheaper to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on postage to send DVDs via the mail , rather than distributing the same content electronically through the Internet given the bandwidth costs .
Moreover , Jason Roks emphasized peering arrangements , where he stated that Bell is the only major Canadian ISP that refuses to peer with anyone else .
Potential solutions to come out of the day included :
1. Establishing a test for acceptable traffic management .
The OIC three - part test focused on whether the traffic management furthers a pressing and substantial objective ; is narrowly tailored to the objective ; and is the least restrictive means of achieving the objective .
2. Truth in advertising .
Emphasis on disclosure as well as possible limits on over - subscription .
3. Regulated peering to bring greater efficiences into the Canadian Internet .
4. Strong anti-competitive action to stop any attempts to leverage network management or pricing plans for unfair advantage .
Full report on the day 's proceedings are posted below , again thanks to Frances Munn .

CRTC Net Neutrality Hearings : July 7 , 2009
Open Internet Coalition
Opening Remarks : Jacob Glick , Google 's Canada Policy Counsel
The Open Internet Coalition described their main purpose as working to keep the Internet fast , open , and available to everyone .
In their submission , they made four main arguments :
1. Open Internet drives innovation .
They argued that robust access to an open Internet is important to public policy .
They urged the Commission to act in a way that promotes the development of an open Internet since it is a key economic engine .
2. Practices that undermine the Internet 's openness are bad for innovation .
The Coalition argued that application specific traffic management practices make the Internet less attractive to users .
They pointed out that slower applications will change user behaviour and undermine the Internet 's competitive market in applications .
3 . It is okay to manage some internet traffic .
They argued that some traffic management is normal and okay .
As the Internet has moved towards a greater multimedia format overtime , congestion has become a greater problem .
However , they emphasized that increased capacity has been the primary means of dealing with this evolution in the past .
4 . Acceptable traffic management will pass the light - touch test derived from the interpretation of s. 27 ( 2 ) and 36 of the Telecommunications Act .
They distinguished between useful traffic management and traffic management that discriminates .
They claimed that evidence shows that carriers can manage their networks , reduce congestion , and keep the Internet open at the same time .
After noting that they believed discrimination between applications constituted discrimination under s. 27 , they went on to explain their three - part “ test ” derived from s. 27 and s. 36 of the Telecommunications Act :
1 . Does the traffic management practice further a pressing and substantial objective ?
2 . Is the traffic management traffic narrowly tailored to address the objective ?
3 . Is the traffic management practice the least restrictive means to reach the objective ?
The Coalition argued that a debilitating network could be a substantial and pressing objective .
However , they pointed out that the evidence in this proceeding has not established the existence of debilitating network congestion .
They also expressed doubt that applications like BitTorrent and P2P " exploit " the Internet .
Addressing step two of the test , they argued that throttling is almost never narrowly tailored .
Further , they argued that throttling has negative effects on innovation and that there are better means of lessening congestion .
For the third arm of the test , they argued in favour of techniques that were more effective at reducing congestion and that did not discriminate between applications .
For the foremost alternative , they pointed to increased network capacity .
They also pointed to application - neutral and price - based levers .
Questions
Von Finckenstein opened the questions , asking the Open Internet Coalition to describe how they defined " openness . "
In response , the Coalition described " openness " as an Internet where users are free to engage with the World Wide Web and where application creators have the freedom to make new applications without having to go through a gatekeeper .
Finckenstein went on to address their three - part test , comparing it to the Oakes test .
He asked what constituted a " pressing " and " substantial " objective .
The Open Internet Coalition replied that the test was flexible and served as a guideline .
They argued that its main strength was that it could be applied on a case - by - case basis .
However , they admitted that it was ultimately a value judgement .
They went on to point out that there should be a higher standard applied to a practice that discriminates between applications than one that is application neutral .
Timothy Denton continued with the questioning .
He wanted to know what kind of system they imagined for the application of their test – e.g. whether they envisioned a complaint based system .
The Open Internet Coalition replied that they wanted the players to first know the rules of the game and , further , that they would have to seek specific exemptions .
They went on to say that in other contexts , there could be complaints to the Commission on a case - to - case basis .
Denton asked for their view on price - based systems and the utility of a price - based system to alleviate congestion .
In response , the Open Internet Coalition said they saw a variety of price based systems developing in the future .
In addition , they expressed concern that price - based systems might have unintended consequences such as discouraging Internet use overall .
However , they said that the Commission 's role was to continue to promote competition , not to regulate fees .
Denton then asked whether their proposal to increase network capacity was an optimal solution .
In response , the Coalition pointed out that increasing network capacity is key to the history of the Internet .
In the past , increasing Internet capacity has encouraged innovation , leading to a win-win " virtuous circle . "
They cited an Internet2 study that demonstrated that adding capacity was a more beneficial way to deal with increased activity than managing the network .
In addition , they pointed out that some traffic management was desirable as long as it satisfied their three - part test .
Denton asked about the future , wondering if the CRTC would be dealing with the traffic management controls on an ongoing basis or whether it would be a permanent part of their work .
The Coalition responded that if clear guidelines were developed , the Commission would not be overburdened with requests .
Further , they pointed to past experience where there have been periods of time with greater congestion .
They claimed it would be an overreaction to allow the networks to control scarcity .
Instead , policies should be developed that are aimed at increasing capacity and promoting innovation .
Leonard Katz took over the questioning and asked about the goal of increasing capacity .
He wanted to know how increasing capacity benefits shareholders in a market based economy .
While he accepted the argument that it might lead to innovation , he was concerned that it would lead to greater costs for shareholders .
In response , the Coalition pointed to a U.S. study that showed that costs have gone down in telecommunications but that prices have gone on .
They implied that prices were based on market power rather than costs .
Further , they argued that if increasing prices were necessary for more innovation , it was worth the trade - off .
Katz pressed them for evidence that consumers were willing to pay more for an open Internet .
The Coalition said they had no studies or statistics either way , but maintained that consumers wanted open access to the Internet and they pointed to the millions of consumers who have joined their coalition .
Further , the Coalition disagreed with the premise that the only available traffic management techniques were those that discriminated among applications .
As well , while they thought added capacity was a better alternative , they were not asking the Commission to mandate it – it should be open to the providers with incentives .
Molnar took over the questioning , asking about the " virtuous circle " between increased capacity and the consumer .
She wanted to know whether there were any obligations for an application maker to create an application in an efficient manner .
In response , the Coalition pointed out that there was a highly competitive market in the application sphere and that creators face pressures from users to provide fast applications .
Molnar went on to wonder if P2P is an inefficient use of bandwidth .
The Coalition replied that it serves no one to have a congested network .
Consequently , there is a built in incentive to reduce congestion .
Molnar asked about this built in " incentive " for application providers to be efficient .
The Open Internet Coalition replied that users would avoid network congesting applications and instead seek applications that did not cause congestion .
Further , if the application is causing congestion , it is due to high user demand for the application .
Consequently , the question is one of dealing with user demand .
They argued in favour of methods that did not arbitrarily discriminate among applications for dealing with user demand .
Von Finckenstein wondered if it would be just to use application discrimination in a congested Internet if there was no other choice .
The Coalition did admit that under their test , application discrimination would be a last result , but could be used if there was no other choice .
Molnar finished her questions by asking about technologies that allow the consumers – rather than the provider – to choose their applications .
The Coalition responded that having the consumers in charge of their own Internet was one way of dealing with the congestion problem .
They argued that the service provided by the Internet is set by the consumer .
That is , the user should control the packets of the Internet and that putting the consumer in charge was consistent with that .
Lamarre asked how privacy can be preserved on an open Internet .
The Coalition responded that in the Canadian context , privacy is preserved through private sector incentives .
They claimed that Canada is further along in terms of privacy than in the United States .
In addition , they pointed out that an open Internet is still subject to law .
That is , applications created on the Internet would be subject to Canadian privacy laws .
Zip.ca
Zip.ca opened their submission by arguing that it was difficult to set universal rules because there had to be some way of looking at individual practices .
Further , they encouraged the CRTC to find a way to identify infractions and settle them quickly .
Zip.ca is a DVD delivery company that uses the Internet to stream live video to its customers .
As this requires a fair amount of bandwidth , they were particularly concerned with congestion techniques that target applications .
They were also concerned with DPI technology .
Since Zip.ca can follow what their viewers watch , they can provide recommendations to their consumers .
They worried that their competitors may use DPI technology to do the same thing and thus harm their business .
They also raised the issue of timing .
As Zip.ca is a time sensitive business , they expressed concern that rulings could take long periods of times – maybe even years – to be resolved .
Such long periods would put their business in danger since they would not be able to deliver to their customers .
They encouraged the CRTC to maintain a fast Internet system .
Further , they addressed some of the negative criticisms of BitTorrent , arguing that it is an efficient way of delivering content to customers .
As such , BitTorrent can be used in legitimate ways and application discrimination would hinder this delivering ability .
They were also concerned about the idea of " walled gardens . "
Since much of their content is streamed from the U.S. , such a policy could harm their business .
Finally , they argued that choice should lie with the consumer .
Questions
Von Finckenstein opened the questioning by inquiring into their business model .
Zip.ca explained that their system of recommendations differentiated them from video on demand .
They said they offer a system similar to a DVD delivering system , but that content is downloaded from the Internet rather than received by mail .
Von Finckenstein expressed concern about Zip.ca as a third party being carried over the Internet and using a network such as Bell or Rogers .
In response , Zip.ca disagreed with the idea that big carriers should have the right to give their own applications priority over theirs .
Zip.ca argued that they carried the same service as a big network and that it was an unfair business practice for providers to favour their own services .
They argued that rules to manage network traffic should not exempt the applications belonging to the carrier .
They argued that throttling based on caps could also lead to the same unfair business practice .
While they said that volume caps make the most sense , they could be problematic if carriers could throttle outside applications like Zip.ca while allowing their own applications through unhindered .
Lamarre asked about the size of the bandwidth that Zip.ca would need to download movies to their customers .
Zip.ca replied that it depended on the size of the resolution and that with new compression technologies , they can deliver movies for under 1G .
They said they were concerned that bandwidth caps would be set just below what they could deliver a movie for .
Lamarre inquired into the cost of changing the delivery system from mail to the Internet .
In response , Zip.ca said that it costs more to deliver a video through the Internet than through the post .
They hoped that it would be cheaper in the long - run , but that with higher resolutions coming out , it is currently more expensive .
Denton asked about the cost of delivering movies by mail .
Zip.ca replied that it was about a dollar each way plus some handling fees .
They reiterated that with bandwidth costs , it was still more expensive to deliver movies over the Internet .
Coalition of Internet Service Providers
They opened by expressing concern over the use of DPIs but arguing that Internet Protocol flow management is in the public interest .
They made three key points :
1. Encryption
They argued that when encryption is used for security reasons , it makes DPI inspection impossible and leads to congestion .
Moreover , if ISPs could detect encrypted traffic , the encryption would be no good and quickly replaced by a stronger one .
They went on to argue that it only takes a small percent of users engaged in P2P traffic to congest the network .
Further , they argued that if they remain encrypted , there is no evidence that throttling will be able to reduce congestion .
2. Congestion Signaling
They argued that if there was a way for ISPs to signal to applications that their network is congested , the application would slow down or desist .
They pointed to the work of Dr. Lawrence Roberts who advocated a system of flow management .
Under this system , technology signals the presence of congestion by selectively dropping IP packets to slow down the system .
In addition , they criticized the current system of measuring gigabytes per month as arbitrary .
Instead they pointed to gigabytes downloaded per hour or per minute as the real problem .
They claimed that the Commission took an easy way out in ruling that it was non-discriminatory to set a monthly rate .
3. Wirespeed Aggregation
The Coalition described wirespeed as any device that processes data without reducing the overall transmission rate .
In other words , the cable box itself never becomes a choke point .
The system would require a big , fat " pipe " that is not congested .
The Coalition compared aggregated DSL to the widening of telephone networks .
They argued that changing the architecture is the only way to solve the problem of Internet congestion .
They urged the Commission to support wirespeed aggregation because it would lead to a system without traffic management and without discrimination against applications .
Questions
Von Finckenstein pointed out that their presentation was full of jargon and asked for a simple explanation of Dr. Roberts 's idea for congestion signalling .
In response , the ISP Coalition explained that under the characteristics of P2P , speeds are limited by the speeds of uploads .
They argued in favour of pacing the packets so that the system can function properly .
However , it would require new technology that can " signal " in times of congestion .
The main idea is that after applications are signalled , they slow down .
Von Finckenstein asked if the technology was available today and why it is not being used .
In response , the ISP said that while the technology is available , the technology does not work on IP protocol .
ISPs would have to make an investment in new technology .
Von Finckenstein wanted to know what would happen if the technology was deployed on a large basis .
In response , the Coalition said that the technology would have to be deployed by the ISPs .
However , since the technology remains expense , some ISPs would be unwilling to make the investment since they are currently free to engage in traffic shaping .
They added that under today 's system , network operators have to engage in traffic management because the network is not strong enough to engage in P2P applications .
Panel of Jason Roks and Vaxination Informatique ( Jean - Francois Mezei )
Jean - Francois Mezei
Mezei is a self - employed citizen aiming to share his opinion on this issue .
He began his presentation by emphasizing how much people depend on Internet for their day - to - day life .
He compared it to a utility like electricity where the supplier does not care how much the consumer uses .
He argued that in order to be competitive , a country needs a competitive telecommunications industry .
He pointed out that if we do n't have a competitive environment in telecommunications , Canadian businesses will leave the country and Canada will come to depend on telecommunications products developed by others .
He claimed that he got involved due to the myth that P2P and BitTorrent file sharing is " bad . "
He pointed out that when users are limited by speeds – e.g. 5 MB – it is not possible to download eleven times more than other users .
He argued that the networks have no business saying that P2P unfairly takes up bandwidth .
He pointed out that the now defunct Bell store allowed for full 5 MB per second downloading without throttling when it used just as much bandwidth as a P2P download .
Further , he argued that P2P is more efficient than Youtube .
Since Youtube videos come from one link , P2Ps are more efficient because they can come from several users at the same time .
He described this situation as unfair because when it comes to throttling , the networks should look at how much bandwidth is actually being used as opposed to the application itself .
He argued that ISPs did not throttle Youtube because of its popularity .
P2P , in comparison , remains an emerging technology .
He theorized that carriers are attempting to throttle it before it becomes popular .
In comparison , Youtube is putting out HD content that is non-regulated and not throttled .
Finally , he argued that P2P is democratic – people can create their own media and distribute it themselves .
Youtube , in comparison , can be controlled .
He pointed to the Montreal based VIF Internet system for dealing with heavy users .
After hitting 100 GB a month , a customer is given a slower throughput and there is no need for DPI .
He urged companies to stop advertising high speeds that are impossible to reach due to throttling and to instead advertise their true speeds to promote competition .
Jason Roks
Roks started with P2P and BitTorrent .
He called BitTorrent a " shipping container " and expressed concern that someone could be blocked just because of the shape of the box .
He called it " essentially the same " as any other file sharing application out there .
Further , he expressed scepticism at the idea that a technology could be banned , blocked , or hindered and described such methods as stifling innovation .
He pointed out that DPI cannot manage encryption , arguing that it is therefore ineffectual .
Further , he argued that there was simply no way to stop file sharing and that it would not go away .
He said that there were two options – adopting to the new technology or stifling it .
He argued that speeding up torrents is one method of dealing with congestion .
Since staying in the queue is what blocks the network , speeding up the queue would get them out of the way .
He said that ISPs were responsible for congestion because it happened on their networks .
He claimed that while ISPs say that changing the system would be a " lot of money , " no ISP has ever said exactly how much money it will be .
However , using inflated numbers , he claimed that an upgrade would cost them no more than 2 dollars per user per month over the next three years .
He addressed the market ploy that ISPs use to sell higher speeds .
He pointed out that on the one hand they sell higher speeds and then turn around and claim that there is too much data in the system .
He argued that people now pay a certain amount per month for a speed and that it is unfair for ISPs to charge more – e.g. people pay for 1MB for speed , and should not have to pay extra for using it .
He pointed out that there are two types of bandwidth :
1. Peer Bandwidth : Data that goes amongst the ISP 's network and does not cost anything extra .
He claimed that it in fact speeds up the network and maintains geographic integrity .
He pointed out that Bell is the only major company in Canada that does not peer .
2. Transit Data :
A request goes outside the network of an ISP and it costs the ISP money to connect to another network .
In sum , he said there should be no traffic management aside from controlling malicious software .
He urged traffic management only in times of congestion and only while the network is being upgraded .
He also argued in favour of full disclosure and transparency on the part of the ISP for the end user .
Questions
Von Finckenstein said that he was confused about P2P because other sources he had heard from claimed that it took five times more bandwidth than other applications .
In response , the panel said that P2P remains a tool of early adopters .
They pointed out that Youtube videos use as much bandwidth and have even expanded to HD .
They also said that focusing only on P2P does not work in the long - run as new technologies will come along .
For instance , BitTorrent now uses a new technology that avoids throttling .
As such , throttling in itself makes the network inefficient as the targeted application is avoiding it .
Von Finckenstein asked the panel to justify its recommendation that networks should upgrade their system .
The panel argued that ISPs are selling customers an insufficient network .
They argued that if the ISPs cannot afford to upgrade its system to meet demand , they should not keep subscribing to new consumers .
Leonard Katz addressed the issue of ISPs marketing the service with speeds " up to " a certain point and then delivering speeds that are much lower .
He asked the panel if ISPs should instead be advertising a minimum speed .
The panel agreed that it is a problem when ISPs advertise high speeds and then claim that they do not have the capacity for it .
They urged the Commission to insist that ISPs publish their throttling speed .
They explained that if ISPs were forced to advertise it , their throttling speed might go up .
They referred to " up to " speeds as " false advertising " since the ISPs cannot deliver it .
Further , requiring minimum speeds would provide them with an incentive to upgrade their networks .
Katz asked why ISPs continued to throttle .
In response , the panel said that ISPs have targeted P2P in particular for throttling .
They pointed out that many of the big companies that also sell television subscriptions are the ones that target P2P .
They claimed that the smaller networks – which are not threatened by downloadable television programs – can control their networks and do not complain about congestion .
Katz went on to ask Roks about the evolution of P2P .
Roks pointed out that there are many different ways to use P2P and that sharing data is the point of the Internet .
He also claimed that many of Bell 's throttling practices are unclear .
He argued that Bell is being selective and targeting certain P2P applications that perhaps pose a risk to their business .
Roks also said that if Bell is going to be allowed to throttle , there should be better disclosure .
Molnar brought up the consumption model where users have to pay for their bandwidth use .
She asked if the panel opposed the consumption model .
In response , the Panel said that it depended on how it was implemented .
They said that the Internet is a utility and that it is fair for users to pay for what they are using .
However , they pointed out that people are all ready limited by speed because there is only so much bandwidth a user can access on a specific speed .
Molnar wondered if the consumption model was only useful during the " steady state " model but no longer useful during times of unforeseen peak congestion .
She asked if there were any more reasonable technological solutions to managing trafficking .
In response , the panel said that there are technologies that can manage usage , e.g. the Montreal VIF model .
They pointed out that the Internet was designed to handle congestion and that the majority of users did not notice congestion on a daily basis .
They said there should be a balance and that it is reasonable to expect a small amount of congestion .
Von Finckenstein asked about Bell 's peering policies .
Roks explained that ISPs who share their networks can increase speeds .
Bell , in comparison , refuses to peer with anyone which makes the experience less efficient .

MOUNT AIRY , Md. —
A home - improvement worker and school janitor who apparently was struggling to survive the recession killed his sleeping wife and two children before turning the 12 - gauge shotgun on himself , Maryland State Police said Saturday .
Charles L. Dalton , 38 , left no suicide note and police have n’t clearly identified a motive for the murders , spokesman Greg Shipley said .
“ It is possible that financial difficulties were part of the motive , ” he said .
Police announced the findings one day after the bodies of Dalton , his wife Jennifer , 37 , and their children Charles Jr. , 14 , and Emmaline , 7 , were found in their home in Mount Airy , a Fredrick County town of 8,800 about 30 miles west of Baltimore .
Shipley said the bodies of Jennifer Dalton and the children were found in their beds .
Charles Dalton ’s body was lying in the master bedroom next to the bed , he said .
Dalton also fatally shot the family ’s beagle in a crate inside the home ’s front door , he said .
Investigators believe the deaths occurred Thursday night or Friday morning .
Shipley said Jennifer Dalton failed to report to her part - time job at a veterinary hospital in Damascus , prompting co-workers to try to contact her starting at 8:30 a.m. Friday .
No one answered their calls or came to the door .
A family friend called 911 at about 5:30 p.m.
Friday after spotting a body through a rear window of the split - level house , Shipley said .
Charles Dalton was a self - employed cabinet installer who ran his business , Imagine Millwork , out of his home .
He also worked the night shift as a maintenance worker for Montgomery County schools , Shipley said .
The house , on a corner lot in a modest , middle - class neighborhood , had a “ for sale ” sign out front .
It had been on the market for at least a year , neighbors said .
Kenneth Matthews , a security worker who also runs a carpet - cleaning business out of his home a few doors down , said Dalton had been scraping by in the weak economy .
“ He was struggling , just like me , ” Matthews said .
“ We ’re probably running about 40 percent of where we were last year . ”
Matthews said the Daltons were quiet , churchgoing people who kept largely to themselves .
A whitewashed rock in front of the house bore two Bible verses : “ We will serve the Lord ” and “ God is our rock . ”
Neighbors and others placed stuffed animals and flowers on the front porch , near the children ’s bicycles and a scooter , to remember the family .
“ We ’re just showing our respect , ” said Erica Mason , who had walked over with her husband and two young daughters to place a white teddy bear on the property .
She said the deaths hit “ pretty close to home — we ’re a family of four . ”
Tanya Miller came from her house a half - mile away .
“ I just wanted to walk around and say a prayer for them , ” she said .
There have been at least four other family murder - suicides in Maryland in the last 2 ½ years — three involving Frederick County residents .
In April , a Middletown man killed his wife and their three children before shooting himself .
On Thanksgiving 2007 , a Frederick man fatally shot his ex-wife and their three children during a custody hand - off in a Montgomery County park .
In April 2007 , a Montgomery County father hanged his two young children before committing suicide in rural Boyds .
In March 2007 , a Frederick man killed his wife and four children before hanging himself in the family ’s town house .

Ricky Dobbs could have played football somewhere else .
Unlike a lot of players on the Navy roster , the quarterback for the Midshipmen had an offer to be a receiver at Georgia Tech .
But he , and his family , wanted to go to the dentist .
Navy quarterback Ricky Dobbs :
On coming to Navy , the triple option and running for president
" Growing up , I did n't have the luxury of medical insurance , " Dobbs said .
" So my first trip to the dentist was for my 17th birthday .
Here , your family and everybody can get free medical and dental benefits . "
Such a simple thing , and such a responsible decision .
The Navy coaches are thrilled he 's there .
Dobbs played some last season , but is in his first year as a full - time starter and is the best passer this version of the Navy offense has ever seen .
He threw it in high school , and he misses that .
" A lot , " Dobbs said with a laugh .
So though Navy went through a game last year without throwing a single pass , the passing game is a threat to Ohio State on Saturday .
Jim Tressel said the threat of Navy 's play action , when the Buckeyes are charging up hard to stop the triple option and Dobbs is looking downfield for a receiver who 's all alone , is what scares him the most about this offense .
A year ago , Dobbs played in seven games , starting once , and threw only 16 passes , completing nine .
But he averaged 24 yards per completion .
So the pass wo n't be a staple of Navy 's gameplan on Saturday , but it could lead to a few big plays .
And then Dobbs , a junior , plans to be on to bigger things in a few years .
He wants to be the second African - American quarterback to win a Super Bowl , because he was born on the day , Jan. 31 , 1998 , that Washington 's Doug Williams became the first .
Then he wanted to become the first African - American president , but Barack Obama beat him to it , so he 'll settle for second there , too .
' I was willing to risk my life ' : World 's most successful plus - sized model reveals how close she came to death
She is the world 's most successful ' plus - size ' model .
But Crystal Renn , 23 , nearly died after she was pressured to lose nearly half her body weight to succeed in her cut - throat industry .
In a series of shocking insights , the American Rubenesque model described how she was ordered to drop five stone after being spotted by a talent scout at just 13 .
Embracing her curves : Crystal Renn was once a size zero but gained five stone to become a very successful model
From that moment she abandoned her care - free calorific diet which included cheesecake and pizza and from then on lived on lettuce leaves , diet Coke and chewing gum .
In a candid new autobiography Renn , whose mother abandoned her when she was a baby , said she saw modelling as an escape from her life
' When somebody says you can lose this amount of weight and escape everything that is currently happening to you – that is the moment that caused the eating disorder , ' she said in an interview with the Observer magazine .
Dying to be thin : Crystal dropped to 95lb , with a waist measurement of 33in , after barely eating for months on end
' To be a model – that was my ticket .
I made the choice not to eat because that was what was expected of me to get my ticket .
I was willing to risk my life to do that .'
By barely eating , taking diuretics and exercising for more than eight hours a day , her weight dropped to 95lb , with a hip measurement of just 33in .
She admitted the drastic diet took her to a size zero close to death .
' I am startled by the way my body looks when I do n't eat .
I think that is a picture of someone who looks like they are dying .
That is me facing death at a really young age .
I was all bones , ' she said .
Sick : Crystal starved herself for three years before her body rejected the regime
' I see someone who has nothing inside , who is unfeeling , incapable of understanding what is happening to them .
I talk about it as if it is a separate person .
Despite weighing just 7 stone and easily fitting into size 0 designer samples , work for the ' normal ' sized model was thin on the ground .
After starving herself for three years Renn 's body began to reject the regime and she gained weight .
She was told to shed the extra pounds - but refused and joined modelling agency Ford - known for supporting plus - sized models .
Renn began to embrace food again : ' ' Pizza , peanut butter , chocolate mud cakes .
I ate a lot of those , ' she told the Observer , adding that she would sit on the sofa eating cheesecake every day - the way she used to before her eating disorder .
' Each pound was a discovery .
I liked it .
I felt myself becoming more who I am .
I had a cleavage suddenly .
' I started wearing heels , short dresses , colour .
I was becoming the weight I naturally am .
It felt like I was a woman finally . '
Since gaining five stone , Renn has gone on to become one of the world 's highest paid plus - sized models , and has appeared in American Vogue , Harper 's Bazaar and has modelled for the Evans clothing brand .
While she is considered ' plus - sized ' in the modelling world , Renn , who is 5ft 9in and a UK size 14 , is far from large and rejects the tag .
In the real world with real people - the average British woman is a size 16 - she is fairly average but the modelling industry she is an anomaly .
Hot property : Crystal Renn , seen on the catwalk in 2006 with Jean - Paul Gaultier , has modelled for everyone from Evans to Chanel this season
' If they judge me for not being big enough , is that not the same as judging me for not being thin enough ?
When do we stop ?
My size should n't matter , ' she says .
' Let 's get rid of straight size and plus size .
It 's bulls * *t .
Just say model .
Full stop .'
' I'm a curvy girl .
You can't erase it …
Women should be able to look at me and think : ' She 's beautiful . '
But also : " I could look like that . " '

Wie viel Englisch muss ein Außenminister können ?
Dass man ein Ministeramt auch ohne größere Fachkenntnisse bekommen kann , das wurde in der Vergangenheit schon öfter offenbar : Christian Schwarz - Schilling etwa , ein Sinologe und Banker , übernahm 1982 das Postministerium , wo der CDU - Politiker ohne störende Technologiekenntnisse und zum Entsetzen mancher seiner Untergebenen dafür sorgte , dass für die Fernsehkabel nicht Glasfaser - , sondern Kupferleitungen verlegt wurden .
Trotzdem ging der einfache
Wähler bisher davon aus , dass es gewisse Grundlagen gibt , an denen man auch als Minister nicht vorbeikommt .
Dazu gehörte unter anderem , dass der Außenminister ein halbwegs passables Englisch spricht und dies auch einsetzt .
Mit dieser Vorstellung könnte es möglicherweise bald vorbei sein : Auf Guido Westerwelles erster Pressekonferenz nach der Wahl wollte ein BBC - Korrespondent von ihm eine Antwort auf Englisch .
Dies verweigerte der FDP - Vorsitzende nicht bloß - er akzeptierte nicht einmal , dass die Frage auf Englisch gestellt wird .
Es sei " in Deutschland üblich , dass man hier Deutsch spricht " , so Westerwelle , und in England würden die Fragen ja auch auf Englisch gestellt .
Dass die dortige Landessprache gleichzeitig die Weltsprache und die der internationalen Diplomatie ist , ließ der offenbar noch von Wahlkampf - Argumentationsanforderungen geprägte Außenminister in spe großzügig unberücksichtigt .
Als er anfügte , dass er bei einem Vier - Augen - Tee mit dem Reporter durchaus bereit wäre , Englisch zu sprechen , wurde endgültig klar , dass es Westerwelle offenbar um die Vermeidung weiterer Peinlichkeiten auf YouTube ging .
Dort erfreut sich nämlich ein Video großer Beliebtheit , in dem deutlich wird , dass die Englischkenntnisse des FDP - Vorsitzenden ganz in der Tradition eines Heinrich Lübke stehen .
Mit dem abschließenden Satz " Es ist Deutschland hier ! " ( der auch in Westerwelles Muttersprache einen gewissen Mangel an Eleganz aufweist ) , gab der künftige Außenminister einen Vorgeschmack darauf , in welche diplomatischen Fettnäpfchen er treten könnte .
Statt einfach zuzugeben , dass er um die sprachliche Tauglichkeit einer Antwort in Englisch fürchtet , reagierte er mit Äußerungen , die von der ausländischen Presse mit einem gewissen Staunen zur Kenntnis genommen wurden und mit denen der FDP - Politiker sehr leicht wenig PR - taugliche Bilder aus der Vergangenheit aufwärmen könnte .
In Blogs und Foren sah man den " Klischee - Deutschen " , der in seiner verkrampft - pathetischen Art tatsächlich etwas an Wilhelm II .
erinnert , bereits mit Pickelhaube und Monokel karikiert .
Dass die offenbar ohne einen wirklich geeigneten Kandidaten für das Außenministerium dastehende FDP den Posten im Tausch gegen ein zusätzliches Ministeramt an den über den EU - Verfassungsvertrag promovierten CSU - Mann zu Guttenberg abtreten würde , der ein für deutsche Politikerverhältnisse außergewöhnlich gutes Englisch spricht , scheint eher eine theoretische Möglichkeit .
Nicht zuletzt deshalb , weil kein ausreichend eitelkeitsbefriedigender Alternativposten für den 1994 mit einer Arbeit über " das Parteienrecht und die politischen Jugendorganisationen " promovierten langjährigen JuLi-Bundesvorsitzenden in Sicht ist , der die letzten 20 Jahre überwiegend in Talkshows oder anderen Wahlkampfveranstaltungen verbrachte .

Far less heroic uses are also being contemplated , such as textile inspection and implementation inside intelligent vacuum cleaners that would be able to adjust their cleaning to the particular surface they sense .

I mentioned in yesterday ’s post that our front office is apparently subject to massive delusions .
Many of you who read other Royals blogs are already aware of our GM ’s quotes so I apologize for the redundancy contained herein .
To minimize said redundancy , I thought it would be best to provide links that address this issue .
The article , and more accurately the quotes , that started it all was a piece written by Bob Dutton on Wednesday morning titled Moore has no doubt that Royals are on the right track for long - term success .
Reactions have come quickly from many sources .
Those four do a pretty good job of covering the nuts and bolts of the issue .
As for me , I have been willing to give Dayton Moore a significant amount of latitude up till now , but when he makes comments like , “ If our processes were so poor , how were we able to put together a pretty good team in the off - season ? ” he loses a lot of stock in my book .
First of all , if our GM ’s goal is to put together a “ pretty good team ” then he needs to resign .
Pretty good simply is n’t good enough in the landscape of professional sports .
Second , what team was he looking at this off - season ?
How in the world did he miss the lack of defense on the roster ?
How in the world did he think the Royals were going to score enough runs to win with the collection of OBP handicapped players he had assembled ?
Healthy or not , this team was n’t good enough .
I was drinking the kool - aid of Kevin Seitzer and the spring training numbers and I still picked them to finished 3rd with a 77 - 85 record .
Admittedly , I was overly optimistic , but anyone who seriously thought this team could contend , even in the AL Central , was blinded by the light of optimism to the Nth degree .
People were quick to point out that each of the divisional foes had a flaw , but never seemed to acknowledge that the Royals were constructed with multiple flaws .
Tony Pena
Jr on the roster was a flaw unto itself that it took over a half of the season to correct .
Moore went on to say , “ most people around baseball felt we were vastly improved . ”
Like his previous quote this takes me in two directions .
First , when you are as far down as the Royals have been , vastly improved does n’t get you very far .
You can polish a poo all you want , but in the end you still have poo on your hands .
Second , those same people around baseball were also collectively predicting that the Cleveland Indians would win the division so I ’m sorry if I ’m not giddy that the “ experts ” thought the Royals would be improved .
Not only did I not buy the Indians as a first place team , I was selling them as the 2009 AL Central cellar dwellers as you can read about here .
Ironically the Royals are standing in the way of that prediction being correct since our KC team now reside in last place after tonight .
I understand that Moore is in damage control mode and is trying to spin things the best he can , but I am also fairly certain he actually believes some of the stuff he is saying .
This kind of snow - job may work on fans of a different team , like the Atlanta Braves , but this does n’t fly with Royals fans , especially when the losing has set in for the season .
Kansas City Royals fans are desperate for a winner and even the brightest and best of us can be snowed by a modest winning streak or an 18 - 11 start .
That said , we are well versed in the economics of small - market baseball and we ’ve been in that classroom for far longer than Dayton Moore .
Even a casual fan of the Kansas City Royals is well versed in this issue .
Even the casual Royals fan is able to pick out a truly crappy player before the ink has dried on their contract or the press release of their acquisition has been typed up .
Anyone who is still invested in this team , after the last 15 seasons , is also able to take the truth .
As such , it would be nice to get an honest assessment about something from the front office or the manager of this team .
The more he talks the more the fan base doubts his ability and doubt is rarely a good thing , especially in baseball .
I still believe Dayton can turn things around , but I am also fairly certain that he is borderline insane .
Being insane does not prevent a person from having a positive impact on the world and it does n’t necessarily prevent someone from being good at their job .
Unfortunately being insane can have annoying side effects like keeping TPJ around for half of a season ( sorry I just ca n’t let it go ) .
Changing gears a little bit , but still on the heels of Dayton ’s delusions , there have been a number of well timed posts covering the borderline historic ineptitude of the Kansas City Royals .
Wednesday Royals have the wrong kind of history in their sights was posted over on Big League Stew
Earlier that same day , Bradford Doolittle posted Things for the Royals to shoot for over on Upon Further Review
I think it is important to state the obvious ; the numbers in past years do n’t predetermine the future of the Royals or any other organization .
Help is on they way , but who is running things when the help finally arrives remains to be seen .
Despite the vote of confidence , I do n’t believe that Trey Hillman will be the manager of this team when opening day of the 2010 season rolls around .
As for Dayton , he should have at least 2 more years of job security .
The ML team is a mess , and the Omaha Royals are n’t much better off , but from Double - A down some really good things are happening in this organization .
To understand where we are going , we have to understand where we have been , but where we have been does not have to determine where we are going .
So here 's the section , H.R. 3200 Section 1233 , that she seems to think leads to " death panels " .
( I know she did n't use that phrase , but that 's what she 's been driving at . )
( b) Expansion of Physician Quality Reporting Initiative for End of Life Care -
(1) Physician 'S QUALITY REPORTING INITIATIVE - Section 1848 ( k ) ( 2 ) of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1395 w - 4( k ) ( 2 ) ) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs :
` (3 ) Physician 'S QUALITY REPORTING INITIATIVE -
`(A ) IN GENERAL -
For purposes of reporting data on quality measures for covered professional services furnished during 2011 and any subsequent year , to the extent that measures are available , the Secretary shall include quality measures on end of life care and advanced care planning that have been adopted or endorsed by a consensus - based organization , if appropriate .
Such measures shall measure both the creation of and adherence to orders for life - sustaining treatment .
`( B ) PROPOSED SET OF MEASURES -
The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register proposed quality measures on end of life care and advanced care planning that the Secretary determines are described in subparagraph ( A ) and would be appropriate for eligible professionals to use to submit data to the Secretary .
The Secretary shall provide for a period of public comment on such set of measures before finalizing such proposed measures .'.
She seems to think that this measure will lead to incentivizing doctors to go through a whole huge long list of choices regarding end of life decisions , encouraging patients to refuse treatments , and then penalizing doctors if patients try to change their minds .
Given she does n't have any legal training whatsoever ( although she is apparently good at throwing parties for wealthy Wall Street elites ) , I 'd rather not hold it against her that she can't read and interpret legislation to save her life .
But if she 's going to imply that she 's some sort of expert , I 'm going to have to take her to task .
First , there is nothing in here that specifies any long list of choices that doctors must force their patients to make .
First , the bill says that if patients want to , Medicare will pay for a consultation every five years .
And there is no long list specified either , if the patient should choose to have that consultation .
Second , there is no incentive to encourage patients to refuse treatments .
During the consultation , patients are free to say that they want the doctor to do anything and everything to save their life and resuscitate them .
( Even including , if you go to Jon Stewart 's doctor , gold plated enemas . )
If you want to refuse treatment , you can .
If you do n't want to refuse treatment , you do n't have to .
And that brings me to the third point : that somehow doctors will be penalized if patients change their minds .
She comes up with this by noting that the quality rating of doctors will be partially determined by how well doctors follow the decisions set out in a patient 's living will , if they have one .
This is , quite possibly , the most disgusting claim she makes .
Let me explain .
First , nothing in here says that a patient can't change their mind before a living will is needed .
Draft one today , change your mind and draft a new one tomorrow .
Only the most recent one will be followed .
That 's how they work ; just like a regular will .
But what if you 're in the hospital ?
How do they work then ?
I , unfortunately , have had some experience with this and would like to explain .
If you 're in the hospital , and you 're conscious , then your living will does n't come into effect .
Make any and all decisions you want .
It 's only if you 're not able to indicate what you want the doctors to do that your living will comes into effect .
And doctors will regularly consult with the next of kin even when following a living will .
But for me , the worst part of her argument is that , for some reason , we should be encouraging doctors to ignore living wills .
That , somehow , encouraging doctors to follow a patient 's wishes is a bad thing .
As someone who has had to help draft these documents and as someone who has had to watch procedures take place that were following a patient 's wishes , I can say that is possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever heard .
As human beings , one of the most important freedoms we have is to control our own body and how it is treated .
If a person chooses to ask for any all methods of life - saving treatment in situations where that person is incapacitated , we should follow their wishes .
And if they choose to eschew those treatments , for whatever reason they choose , that choice should be honored .
The thought that somehow we should not encourage doctors to follow the wishes of patients is ludicrous and , having known how painful an end of life decision is when doctors are following through on it , disgusting .
Betsy McCaughey is taking hyperbole and fearmongering deep into the heart of the health care debate .
For this , she should be shunned and humiliated .
I , for one , will not be happy until she is completely ignored in the public debate .
And I have no doubt there are many who read this who agree with me .
UPDATE :
Not a really exciting update .
I 'm just going to bed so I wo n't be here to banter back and forth with you .
Being unemployed is exhausting after all . ;-)
Feel free to keep up the tips and recs though .
I swear I 'll figure out a way to trade them in for my Recliner of Rage .
UPDATE 2 :
Wow !
I made the rec list !
I wish I had n't been asleep when it happened .
Thank you everyone !
For most of this decade , Bob Newland has been the voice of marijuana law reform in South Dakota .
The photographer and Black Hills resident has organized Hempfests , lobbied for reform legislation in the state capitol , relentlessly crisscrossed the state from the Black Hills to the Sioux Valley , and organized medical marijuana petition drives .
He is the director of South Dakota NORML and founder of South Dakotans for Safe Access .
As a marijuana reform activist , Newland has been unstoppable -- until now .
Bob Newland
Newland was arrested earlier this year after being pulled over while driving for carrying slightly under four ounces of marijuana on what his lawyer described as a " mission of mercy . "
Originally charged with possession with intent to distribute , the veteran activist accepted a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to possession of under a half - pound of marijuana , an offense that carries a sentence of up to two years in the state penitentiary .
Prosecutors agreed to make no sentencing recommendations .
On Monday , Newland appeared in court in Rapid City to learn his fate .
Judge John
Delaney did n't throw the book at him -- he was sentenced to one year in jail , with all but 45 days suspended -- but threw him a curveball instead .
While under the court 's supervision for the next year , Newland must not exercise his First Amendment right to advocate for marijuana law reform in South Dakota .
According to the Rapid City Journal , which had a reporter in the courtroom , Judge Delaney had two issues with Newland 's marijuana reform advocacy .
He was determined that Newland not appear to have gotten off lightly , and he did not want Newland 's words to encourage young people to drink or use drugs .
" You are not going to take a position as a public figure who got a light sentence , " Delaney warned Newland before talking about how juvenile courts are packed with kids who have drug problems .
" Ninety - five percent of my chronic truants are using pot , " Delaney said .
The no free speech probation condition raised ire and eyebrows not only in South Dakota , but across the land .
Concerns are being expressed not only by drug reformers and civil libertarians , but also by legal scholars .
" Surrendering our First Amendment rights cannot be a condition of probation , " said Allen Hopper , litigation director for the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project .
" The Constitution clearly protects the right to advocate for political change without fear of criminal consequence .
It is a shame that the court feels obligated to muzzle protected speech in a misguided effort to guard society from unfounded fears of open debate .
Bob Newland is just the latest victim of a baseless drug policy that continues to clog our prisons and trample our rights . "
" Courts impose conditions on probationers all the time , but this sort of condition is very unusual , " said Chris Hedges , professor of law at the University of South Dakota .
" People ought to be able to argue that the law should be changed , but now he can't do that .
We always have to be concerned when someone 's speech is infringed , " she said .
" Bob is a classic example of an individual activist who was one of the lone activists in the whole state and who now knows smartly the pains of prohibition , " said Allen St. Pierre , executive director of national NORML .
" Those of us familiar with South Dakota laws and practices were not surprised with the jail time , but clamping down on First Amendment rights is something else .
Judges put all kinds of restrictions on people on probation , but they do n't usually say you can't engage in First Amendment activity . "
It was precisely Newland 's role as the face of marijuana reform in the state that earned the censorious probation , St. Pierre said .
" Bob 's pot bust was hardly an aberration , but the judge recognized he had the state 's leading reefer rabble rouser in front of him .
Had the judge had Joe Blow in front of him , I can't imagine that he would be saying you can't talk to anybody about this . "
" It 's appalling , " said Bruce Mirken , communications director for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" I can't imagine any reason why anyone should , as part of a criminal sentence , be barred from arguing that the law he was arrested on is wrong and should be changed .
This is profoundly troubling .
Whatever you think of the individual or the law , we do have something called the First Amendment , and it should apply to Mr. Newland as well as anyone else .
I can't imagine how the people of South Dakota could be endangered by allowing Mr. Newland to advocate for what he believes in . "
" It 's really sad what happened to Bob on Monday , " said Emmett Reistroffer , who has stepped up to take Newland 's place as leader of South Dakotans for Safe Access , which currently has a signature gathering drive under way to get a medical marijuana initiative on the 2010 ballot .
" I 've never heard of that before in my life .
I 'm not an attorney , but the first thing I think is what basis does the judge have for depriving someone of their First Amendment rights ? "
Newland himself was surprised at the probation condition , but uncertain as to whether it was worth fighting .
In what may be his last words on the subject -- for the next year , anyway -- he told the Chronicle he feared the " negative effects " of challenging it .
In other words , he does n't want to get thrown in jail for even longer than he will already have to serve .
" This seems to me to be a quite unusual sentence provision , of a sort I have never encountered in all my years of activism and watching other people get sentenced for illegal substances .
It certainly plays at the edges of suppression of speech of the sort we expect to see in totalitarian countries , " he said .
" Judge Delaney wanted to make a statement with the sentence , and he surely did .
If I were inclined to fight the provision , the immediate negative effects on my life would almost certainly outweigh any gain I could accomplish .
Therefore , I must say that I accept the judge 's decision in the same light that I accept all the other provisions of the sentence .
If this statement so far has n't taken me over the boundaries of taking a ' public role ' in reform advocacy , I 'd probably better wait a year to add to it . "
But Newland may not be silenced just yet .
Those words were written Wednesday , before the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project had a chance to discuss the issue with him .
That organization is definitely interested in pursuing the case .
If Newland wants to move forward with challenging the no free speech provision , drug reform groups will stand with him , said St. Pierre and Mirken .
" Drug policy reform groups have an immediate interest in this case , " said St. Pierre .
" It sets a terrible precedent and is such an aberration to be told what political subjects you can talk about .
The right to exercise political speech is the fulcrum this will turn on . "
Newland may also gain some reassurance from law professor Hutton .
Newland should be free to challenge the no free speech condition without fear of legal reprisal , said Hutton .
" If he just filed something to challenge that , it can not be used against him , " she said .
Ironically , the judge 's probation condition may prove to be a boon to the movement in South Dakota , said St. Pierre .
" Just the fact that this has happened has caught the attention of people around the world , " he said .
" Painful as this is , Bob is now probably going to raise the profile of this debate higher than 10 years of wearing out shoe leather -- and without saying a word . "
The Choose Your Own Adventure books that you remember from childhood are now published by a small female - owned company in northern Vermont , led by publisher Shannon Gilligan .

After the books , which were originally published by Bantam , went out of print , Gilligan started Chooseco in 2003 .
She 's since reinvigorated the brand by bringing the old CYOA books back into print and starting several new series , including Fabulous Terrible , a YA series targeted to teenage girls , and Dragonlark , a series geared to younger readers .
She 's also bringing the CYOA books into the 21st century by developing editions for the Kindle and the iPhone .
Gilligan , who 's married to the series founder R.A. " Ray " Montgomery , also worked for years developing software and has written several CYOA books herself .
We discussed how the Choose Your Own Adventure sausage gets made , what it 's like to be in book publishing in Vermont , being a female software engineer , and the Choose Your Own Adventure " hot dog " - the red banner at the top of the book covers .

I was super excited to do Choose Your Own Adventure and you because , of course , I was a kid in the ' 80s and everyone read Choose Your Own Adventure books .
I know you bought the company in 2003 .
Right , 2003 .
Ray - R.A. Montgomery - got the remaining copyrights and trademarks in late 2002 .
We formed a venture thinking originally that we would simply re-license the old ones to another publisher .
After about nine months of talking to publishers , we had a number of offers from all the big publishers in New York , but none of them were reality based , let 's put it that way .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
We had taken a hiatus from writing children 's books and we had started to develop software .
We 'd both been evangelized by Apple in the early '90s .
Apple had this very interesting program then called evangelism , which was a division started by Steve Jobs upon the introduction of the Mac around 1994 .
Evangelism went out to groups of people outside of typical software development channels to try to get them to develop software .
So I suppose it was just a hop , skip and a jump to get people who did Choose Your Own Adventure to do this .
They gave you machines and technical support .
We did that for awhile and while that was going on , publishing was changing a lot .
When we were fielding offers in the early 2000's , the offers were so weak .
A typical offer would be 4 books over 2 years .
Was n't Bantam publishing around a book a month for awhile ??
Yes , for many years , it was more like magazine publishing .
In the heyday it was quite a lot of work to get all those books lined up .
There would always be at least one full time editor and a couple of stringers working on it .

There was a point that Bantam got rid of the hot dog .
Was that was when things went downhill ?
What a mess that was .
For the last 6 or 8 titles in the late 90s , maybe in 2000 - they redid Choose Your Own Adventure so it looked like Indiana Jones .
Sales fell off a cliff .
That was the final nail in the coffin .
There 's a whole host of reasons why Bantam let the series go and a lot of it has to do with corporate institutional memory .
By late 1990s there was really nobody who was really shepherding the series .
Everyone involved in the series had moved on .
We were just this backlist orphan .
I think it was a valiant attempt when they redesigned the logo , but they did n't understand that it just did n't read as Choose Your Own Adventure .
We get emails every day at the website saying we did n't know you were in print .
How did you get to know R.A. Montgomery ?
My dad was a printer and Ray had gotten to know him when [ Ray ] was a publisher before becoming a full time writer and my dad said , Oh my daughter is in film and she 's looking for a job .
I had just graduated from college .
I said I do n't know the first thing about computers .
And Ray 's attitude was like , great , I do n't want anyone with any preconceptions .

So how old were you at this point ?
22 .
What year was this ?
This was 1981 .
So you met him right before the books sort of got huge .
They had actually already gotten huge .
They had a short stint as the Adventures of You published and written by Ray in 1977 - 78 .
In '78 Bantam wanted to start wanted to start a children 's division .
They had an editor who was assigned temporarily to starting a list .
And in that proverbial way that you read about , the agent took the Adventures of You to 14 different publishers and it was roundly rejected everywhere .
And then this children 's editor looked at it and said , kids will love this .
They wanted six books - a series .
Ray begged off writing all six .
He said I want to be able to use other writers .
So that was the beginning of the whole series .
They changed the name to Choose Your Own Adventure .
The first Bantam Choose Your Own Adventure book came out in ' 79 .
By '81 it had done really well .
The first 6 months or so , sales were fine - but they were n't getting the numbers they thought they would .
So they gave away 100,000 copies of the books to libraries and that is what really kickstarted it .
It was very clever .
Then it just sort of snowballed .
So these things do reach a critical point .
By the time I appeared in 1981 , the series was well on its way .
And for a few years it continued apace .
Advertisement
What led you to start ChooseCo yourselves ?
The rights had reverted .
At that point , in publishing in the ' 80s and '90s , it was typical for writers to get a rights reversion clause .
If a publisher took your book out of print for longer than 6 months , the rights would revert if you went through some legal hoops .
There was never a point where all 186 titles in the classic CYOA series were in print at one time .
If new kids came into the series , they would buy the first couple books and then the latest books .
So you would see this pattern , this inverted bell curve , where the first 10 titles always sold well and the most recent 10 titles always sold well , but the titles in between , with certain exceptions , really just fell off the cliff .

We initially thought , we 'll bring out the books and we 'll license other rights , because we did n't want to do everything .
Another reason we 'd said no to big publishing is because we wanted control of the art and the covers .
We had very definite ideas based on anecdotal feedback that we got constantly from former fans .
It 's very non-standard in the publishing world to allow authors to have control .
Now that I 've had more experience with the publishing side , I think it 's unfortunate that publishers do n't allow writers to have more input in that process .
I think it would lead to a lot of interesting developments .
We knew we wanted to go with a very retro look from the original covers .
Bantam had modified the covers five or six times over the 20 - year run they had with the covers .
And we felt like they got farther and farther from the original design .
I would love to know who did that original design - it was some nameless art director in the bowels of Bantam in the late ' 70s .
They did a brilliant job , we think , on the " hot dog " and the frame and the art .
You empower kids with choices and a defined role as an adult and you give them an adult sized book .
Then we just spruced it up to bring it into the 21st century .
You sort of alluded to this before when you were talking about Dungeons and Dragons , but what do you think it was about that sort of late ' 70s / early ' 80s period that led to this explosion in role playing games ?
CYOA books are all told in the second person so reader feels like they 're going on the adventure themselves .
What do you think that was about ?
I 'm not sure I know the complete answer .
I think it 's multicausal .
You could say that perhaps the advent of technology was making people think differently in terms of what they could perform with technology .
A lot of emphasis on the individual performing tasks that were quite complex that had previously been performed by a large number of people .
Maybe the culture had gotten very self absorbed .
Also , by the time Choose emerged in the early ' 80s there had really been 25 years of interactive fiction in various places .
The first really good example of it is a play written by a really distinguished French critic and writer named Raymond Queneau .
He wrote a play in the late ' 50s called A Story As You Like It .
He was one of those French intellectuals who was much more valued as an intellectual than a bestseller .
That play is probably his best - known work and it's been widely performed .
The audience voted on the ending .
Then in 1964 the Argentinean author Julio Cortazar wrote a book called Hopscotch , and you sort of decided where you were going to go to next in the story .
That was a literary sensation .
It was widely translated and published in the U.S. in 1966 by Farrar , Straus and Giroux .
Then in early ' 70s , there was a 14 book series published by Corgi [ now part of Random House UK ] called Trackers .
We 've not been able to find out much about it .
We tried to track down some of the authors at some point and could n't find them .
They were published in England - they were never published in the United States .
You could say that it was an idea whose time had come .

I think you 're right - it 's part of this desire for more participatory entertainment .
When you were a kid it was very exciting to feel like you were in charge of your character 's destiny .
I think that it also parallels something that all children need to do and that they crave - and it's that they try on other personalities .
They try on other roles .
This just took it 10 steps farther , by defining the role more carefully , often putting kids into adult roles or quasi - adult roles - for some reason you 're a gifted teenager who 's a mountain climber .
Or you 're an oceanographer .
You love to imagine different roles for themselves .
You see on the Internet - people develop avatars for themselves , totally different identities .
I think that 's a part of human nature .
Can you describe the process of writing a Choose Your Own Adventure book ?
I think every writer develops their own specific system , although there are aspects of the process that virtually everyone uses .
A map to track your choices and endings is essential .
Some writers make an arbitrary map , with a choice every certain number of pages , so many choices in a particular storyline , a certain number of total endings , etc .
I often worked this way .
Other writers let the story unfold and make the map follow the emerging stories .
This approach is more organic , but in my case I would keep on running out of pages , or having wildly long storylines coupled with a few overly short ones .
On the other hand , Ray almost always writes a book this way .

Keeping track of your page numbers is simple .
A CYOA is usually between 100 - 110 manuscript pages .
You just write the numbers 1-100 at the bottom of your map page , and as you use up the page number , you cross it off .
Those are the more practical aspects .
As for content , I have found over and over that you need to choose a scenario that has enough richness and potential to generate a slew of exciting stories .
For me , when I hit a writing block when I am working on a CYOA , it 's often because the initial set - up was n't juicy enough .
I 'll have to go back in and layer in more content — another character , some additional plot angle like a missing person or strange message , a plot angle that adds a time factor and the story tension that can be mined from a looming deadline ( e.g. if you do n't get the medicine to your missing partner within 72 hours , the poisoning will be irreversible , etc. ) .
I always liked to set stories in worlds I know .
Thailand , Japan , sea monsters .
These were areas of my own interest and expertise and I think that knowledge and zeitgeist is communicated , often tangentially .

Over the years , we have of course developed guidelines .
I suppose it 's not unlike rhyme schemes in sonnets .
Every book needs a certain number of endings , the choices have to occur within a certain number of pages or they do n't seem as compelling or urgent .
Those to factors tend to dictate how many storylines there are in a book .
It 's fun to play sometimes and loop different branches back in to each other .
It 's a writing challenge .
But those are parlor tricks .
At the end of the day , you are trying to write a whole bunch of really interesting fun plots that surprise the reader , and that make them think .
Over the years , we realized that there are only so many basic types of CYOA books .
There are chase stories , and escape stories , search stories , and mystery stories .
There are also fantastical world stories , some with a sci- fi orientation and others with more of a magical orientation .
These tend to be less about a particular goal , and more about learning in a smart way that does n't get you in trouble with the locals .

You guys have done a CYOA iPhone application , and I 'm wondering if you could talk about how you 've adapted to new technologies .
We think the sky 's the limit .
We 're in discussions about developing a massive multiplayer online universe - taking the brand and crafting it into an online world .
We have had a series of near deals in Hollywood .
We have n't gotten just the right one but there 's a tremendous amount of interest there .
We 've adapted two books for the iPhone in conjunction with Magnetism Studios , which is a software studio that 's a couple brothers in Brooklyn .
Ray recorded Abominable Snowman for the iPod .
You need the video iPod - you actually click on the link and we have active links on the video screen when you make a choice so it goes to the next place .
We have just done a deal to put all the books on the Kindle .
That 's been very interesting , because after fiddling with the Kindle interface for awhile we realized we had to redesign the books a little bit to work on the Kindle .
It was a very fun process to work with the programmers at Amazon .
It 's definitely more complicated than basic novel on the Kindle .
In - house we 're developing a text - based game for the iPhone .
Ray and I are both fans of text - based games , going back to '70s and early ' 80s .
Can you talk about the benefits and challenges of being in Vermont ?
You 've clearly made a decision to be far away from the epicenter of publishing .
There definitely are pros and cons .
I would say the pros are that we get to live in a wonderful , beautiful place with a very strong sense of community .
Technology advances have allowed us to work very efficiently , both in terms of time and cost , all over the world .
Right now is the absolute golden age of working in the country .
We use artists from India , Romania , Argentina , as well as several in the U.S. Everything is instant .
A lot less FedExing than there was in the ' 80s .
Those are the pros .
The very fact that you can run a fairly sophisticated operation in northern Vermont is a benefit .
I would say one of the cons is that we probably miss a fair amount of synergy that we would enjoy if we were in New York or LA .
We 'd be more up to the minute with technology and stuff .

Do you find any particular challenges in being a woman and running this business ?
No .
I think there 's the normal garden variety misogyny in publishing the way there is in the world .
You have to deal with those situations as they arise and try to just handle them as best you can .
Publishing is a business that 's filled with a lot of very progressive minded people .
It just attracts those kinds of people .
As a business it 's a pretty pleasant and collegial community of people to work with .
What 's interesting about my particular work experience is I had this seven or eight year stint in the '90s producing software .
And I found there was very little sexism in the software business .
When you get around really interesting technology people they do n't care about anything except technology .
I could have been a green frog .
They kind of got beyond it .
I have talked to women in the field who have not had that experience .
At the highest levels of programming there 's not a lot of women .
I know it 's better than it used to be but I know there are challenges for women engineers .
My experience has been pretty great .
Also , I think I do a service keeping a feminine perspective in at least some of the books , because I do think for whatever reason CYOA wears a masculine face .
It 's been very popular with girls too , but when boys stop reading they do n't stop reading CYOA .
It 's really identified in the publishing business as a boys ' series .
So it 's kind of great for me that girls are involved too .

We had talked about doing a princess series that was really girly .
I 've got a bunch of great women who work with us and we were excited about the idea .
But as we narrowed choices and investigated it , what we kept seeing were teen and adult romance series that were really poorly done .
We started to develop an interactive teen series but as we started to work on it we realized there was something about the teen girl novel - the choices in the storylines were getting so complex and convoluted , that it sort of did n't work for the genre .
But by this point we had very interesting characters and a very interesting scenario , and I love the second person - I love that voice .
So I said , let 's do a teen girl series - Fabulous Terrible - where " you " are the main character .
We wanted the " you " to be highly identified .
I got an email this year from a girl who was writing a book report and she said , My teacher told me to find the name of the character .
I told her , it 's really you .
It 's to the point where we were very careful not to give indications of skin color or hair color , anything like that .
You do learn in the second book that your hair is dark , but that 's all you know .
We tried very hard to make it be something neutral enough that they could project themselves onto it .

What is your favorite CYOA book ?
I think I would have to say I like Journey Under the Sea a lot .
It was an early one and it's a classic .
It 's a lot of fun .
I like a book called Inca Gold by one of our writers named Jim Beckett .
It 's set in the Andes and you 're in search of the Lost City of Gold .
I love Mystery of the Maya .
Those are my three favorites .
All the books with the word haunted or ghost in the titles outsell them .
I am genuinely proud of Fabulous Terrible : The Adventures of You .
The title was a wink back to the original Choose Your Own Adventure series .

But many analysts remain unconvinced .
Barclays Capital 's Doug Anmuth points out that for the deal to work for Yahoo ! , it needs to maintain its search market share .
Microsoft , he says , is guaranteeing revenue per search by country for the first 18 months , but not revenue itself .
The deal is also bad for Yahoo , Mr Anmuth asserts , because it has not factored in the possibility of what happens when Microsoft 's Bing takes market share straight from Yahoo ! , and not Google as intended .
Do you believe ??
Fright night .
See our reporter terrified by a ghost while filming in Dalhousie Castle Scotland
Today at noon Barack Obama addresses the nation ’s schoolchildren .. or a good number of them anyway .
Many students wo n’t hear the speech because of a rather severe miscalculation from the right .
Republican screaming and wailing made it sound as if Hugo Chavez was flying in via Aeroflot to speak to our poor , innocent , unsuspecting angels .
School districts reacted … and millions of school kids will sit around picking their noses at noon instead of watching the speech .
So now the speech is out .
As of yesterday afternoon you could read it on the Internet .
I ’ve read it , and if there is anything in there that I would n’t want my child to have heard from a U.S. President , I certainly could n’t find it .
Egad !
The speech is innocuous !
What are we going to do now ?
I know !
We ’ll all claim that Obama changed the speech after the uproar from the right !
Well , duhhhhhh .
Of course he did !
Why would n’t he !
Well , actually he really did n’t have to change it .
It probably was n’t written by the time conservative boxers bunched up en masse .
So Obama ’s speechwriters took their cue from the right and made the speech essentially bulletproof from the get - go .
One sharp mind in a Republican strategy session could have seen this one coming from the next galaxy .
President says he will give speech to schoolchildren .
Republicans say the speech will be full of leftist propaganda
Parents run in circles flailing arms overhead while screaming and shouting .
Some school officials black out Obama ’s speech .
( racist comment )
Grinning speechwriters prepare speech with no leftist propaganda .
Republicans look like fools .
People now more reluctant to listen to conservative complaints about Obama .
Now how easy was that ?
For about three days we have parents , the Republican Party and assorted odds spinning around on their eyebrows and spitting wooden nickels over Obama ’s speech .
He ’s going to indoctrinate our children .
He ’s going to fill them full of socialist ideology .
They ’re all going to come away from school today singing Kumbaya and waving red flags .
They ’ll probably stop on the way home from school to buy a Che Guevara t- shirt from vendors the Democrats will have waiting out in front of their schools .
Then the hopelessly indoctrinated kids will come home and destroy all the incandescent light bulbs and turn the spare bathtub into a recycling bin .
Before they do their homework ( reading The Communist Manifesto ) they ’ll hide the car keys so daddy has to take mass transportation to work on Wednesday .
TeamObama must have loved this one .
Talk about a hanging curveball .
Once the manic inanity started all they had to do is sit back , prepare an innocuous speech for The One , and let the people scratch their heads wondering what in the hell the Republicans were so upset about !
Now the next time the right comes up with an objection to some Obama concept , people who last week might have been on board will stand back and look at the Republicans with a jaundiced eye .
This one was so easy for the left I ca n’t even think of another 300 words to fill out this column .
So just move on to the next one .
Two steps forward and three steps back .
Unless PrezBO really messes up his address to Congress tonight watch for his popularity ratings to rise .
Thanks , Republicans !

Unix helped move computing toward a more open and user - friendly interface
Bill Thompson has been using Unix for a quarter - century - and does n't plan to stop now .
In the autumn of 1984 , I completed the Diploma in Computer Science at Cambridge University and started looking for my first job in the computing industry .
Cambridge was a good place to be a programmer at the time .
Trinity College had built its Science Park on the northern fringe of the city in 1970 and the university 's permissive approach to intellectual property meant that it was relatively easy to spin off an idea and see how it worked out without severing all links to a departmental salary .
As a result the cauldron of innovation had been well - stirred by academics from Computer Lab , the Engineering Lab and elsewhere , with a good mix of venture capitalists and an influx of talented managers eager to guide new companies .
By the mid 1980's , the Cambridge Phenomenon was in full flood .
I ended up in the middle of it , joining a small software house called Bensasson and Chalmers as a programmer to work on their database management system , Spires .
Language skills
During my course I had used the large IBM mainframe computer and also smaller microcomputers that ran an operating system called Tripos , written at Cambridge .
I had learned to programme in the teaching language Pascal and in BCPL , a stripped down language also developed at Cambridge by Professor Martin Richards .
BCPL was largely intended for writing operating systems and compilers for other languages ( a compiler is a utility that takes the source code of a program and turns it into the binary commands a specific computer can execute ) .
I am still proud to call myself a C / Unix programmer , even if it has never got me an upgrade on a long - distance flight
Bill Thompson
A look at 40 years of Unix However , I had now arrived at a commercial software developer , so I had to work in a commercial language on a commercial operating system , and at BCL that meant coding in the C programming language on a British - built Bleasdale computer running the Unix operating system .
I did n't know it at the time , but Unix was more generally used in academia and was relatively rare in commercial settings .
However , that was already changing , and the few weeks it took me to come to terms with C programming and learn my way around Unix provided the basis for much of my future career , both in the computing industry and as a journalist .
It was the IT equivalent of becoming a " made man " or " wise guy " in the Mafia , and has stood me in very good stead since .
I am still proud to call myself a C / Unix programmer , even if it has never got me an upgrade on a long - distance flight and rarely works as a chat - up line at parties .
Spires is no more , though the company is still around , and Simon Bensasson , John Chalmers , Jamie Radcliffe , Chris Richardson and the other talented people I worked with in my time there have other roles , in other places .
Unix , however , has done rather better in the intervening quarter - century , and this month it is celebrating its 40th anniversary .
Originally written by Ken Thompson in August 1969 because he wanted a lightweight operating system to let him play a game called Space War on the rather underpowered PDP - 7 computer that his employer , Bell Labs , had provided him , Unix has been at the heart of the IT revolution that has swept the world in the last four decades , even though most computer users will never have heard of it .
In the 30 or so years since it moved out of the research labs and started appearing on workstations , minicomputers and desktops , it has been embraced in particular by computer scientists and engineers .
They want to build systems that are open , flexible and expandable , systems that respect their users and administrators and acknowledge that they will want to make choices and should not be overly constrained by the tools they have chosen .
The Unix brand has inspired more than just a few die - hard fans Today Unix systems are everywhere .
All of the variants of the successful GNU / Linux operating system , including the recently - announced Google Chrome OS , build on an original design that came from Unix via a teaching implementation called Minix written by Andrew Tanenbaum .
Scratch the surface of your shiny Apple laptop and you 'll find that Mac OS is a Unix variant , and even mainframe computers run Unix - like systems .
This has happened despite massive resistance to Unix in almost all areas of the industry , especially from Microsoft who wrote Windows NT as a Unix - killer .
But Unix has succeeded despite this because it is an operating system that people who understand operating systems like to use .
It has succeeded because its core philosophy favours freedom and choice over user control and second - guessing , encouraging questions and investigation and rewarding those who try hard to understand it .
Free and easy Unix systems are also inextricably linked to the free software movement , and not just because the idea of free software originated in programmer Richard Stallman 's attempt to build GNU ( ' GNU 's Not UNIX ' ) , a non-proprietary version of Unix , when AT&T , who had taken over Bell Labs and therefore owned the copyright in the main commercial version of Unix , tried to lock it up .
Unix always encouraged tinkering , innovation and experimentation , and in order to do that effectively you need to look under the bonnet and read the source code - something that remains central to the free software philosophy .
In a world that is increasingly shaped by and managed through advanced computer technology , the ideologies built into applications and operating systems matter more and more because they shape the potential of the systems we are developing .
I choose Unix over anything else because I believe that the respect for the system 's administrators , programmers and end -users that lies at the core of the Unix philosophy remains our best hope for creating computer systems that will promote and encourage free expression , liberalism and humanism .
Unix is the operating system that most clearly expresses the values of the liberal enlightenment that form the basis of my own personal philosophy , and I will continue to use and support it .

Touring an archaeological dig site , you generally expect a glimpse of antiquities a little more antediluvian than a television antenna , a seven - inch single , a tailfin and a rotary - dial telephone .
But an odd excavation site that recently opened to the public on Governors Island purports to offer just that : artifacts not of the Mesoamerican but of the midcentury variety , about 1954 .
That is the year , at least according to Geert Hautekiet , the man in charge of exhibiting the site , that the United States Army , which then controlled the island , ordered a small , obscure civilian community there to be evacuated during the approach of a dangerous electrical storm .
All of the buildings and houses in the town , Mr. Hautekiet said , were then inexplicably buried under sand by the military , which later appeared to deny that the village had ever existed .
The town , known as Goverthing  which strangely has never appeared on any New York City historical maps or been noted by a single historian  is said to have been stumbled upon during recent demolition work on the island , which New York City and New York State have jointly controlled since 2003 , seeking to develop it as a recreational , historic and artistic destination .
It was then , the story goes , that a team of Belgian archaeologists was summoned to uncover pieces of the unlikely  indeed , almost unbelievable  community that , before it was evacuated , numbered only 29 residents , many of Belgian and French descent , whose livelihood centered on a small factory in town that capitalized on a once - thriving international market for snow globes .
The Obama Bounce Survey Shows Huge Leap in European Support for US Foreign Policy
US President Barack Obama has made America much more popular with Europeans , a new study shows .
According to the survey , 77 percent of Europeans have a positive view of Obama 's handling of international affairs , compared to just 19 percent who supported George W. Bush 's foreign policy .
( CNN ) --
The president of Liberia spoke Friday on the sexual assault of an 8 - year - old Liberian refugee in Phoenix , Arizona , decrying reports that the parents believe their family has been shamed by the girl .
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf says the girl , her family and the alleged rapists should receive counseling .
" This is not a question of shame on the family .
It is the question of an assault on a young child .
That cannot be tolerated , " said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , speaking by telephone .
Police have charged four boys , ages 9 to 14 , in the case .
The boys also are Liberian refugees .
" We are so saddened , " Sirleaf said .
" We are deeply distressed at this behavior on the part of our young Liberians and very saddened at this 8 - year - old child who has been so victimized . "
Phoenix police say the boys used an offer of chewing gum to lure the girl to a storage shed at an apartment complex on July 16 .
There , they allege , the four boys restrained and sexually assaulted her .
The 14 - year - old was charged as an adult Thursday and will face two counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnapping .
The other three boys were charged in juvenile court with sexual assault , and two of them also were charged with kidnapping , Thomas said .
Speaking from Liberia , Sirleaf said the family 's reaction to the incident is wrong .
" They should help that child who has been traumatized , " she said .
She suggested the family members " need serious counseling because , clearly , they are doing something that is no longer acceptable in our society here . "
She also called upon Phoenix authorities to counsel the alleged attackers .
" They have to pay the penalty , but we also want to make sure that they are counseled ... that they will have an opportunity to change and become useful citizens , not only in the United States but when they return home . "
Detectives said the girl was placed in the custody of Phoenix child protective services after the attack because of her parents ' attitude toward her .
" The parents felt that they had been shamed or embarrassed by their child , " Phoenix police Sgt. Andy Hill said Thursday .
Tony Weedor -- co-founder of the CenterPoint International Foundation , which aids Liberians in the United States and provides aid for those still in Liberia -- agreed with Hill .
He said rape was not against the law in Liberia until 2006 .
" The family [ believes they ] have been shamed by her ... and they 're more concerned about that than the crime , " he said .
Sirleaf said the family should not be concerned about that .
" Let me say very clearly that rape is a problem in Liberia also .
There is a strong law regarding that , " she said .
Milton Barnes , Liberia 's ambassador to the United States , said he also will step in to help the victim .
" Our primary concern is this child , " he said .
" We intend to work with the authorities and the family to make sure she is safe , protected and there is certain sensitivity exercised towards her . "
Edwin Sele , the deputy ambassador , also responded to the incident .
" Having heard the story myself , I 'm outraged , " he said .
" In Liberia , the family and law enforcement officers would be embracing the victim .
To hear that the family is not doing that , that should be an isolated case . "
Hill said Thursday that protective services officers would " determine what 's going to happen [ to the girl ] in the days ahead . "

CAMPS FOR DISSIDENTS READIED
Congressmen , authors , patriots warn FEMA camp system in place
By Victor Thorn
There exists an explosive hot - button issue that U.S. government officials do n’t want revealed to the American public ; namely , that internment camps have been established — and are at the ready to detain citizens if mass insurrections occur .
Under FEMA ’s National Level Exercise 2009 ( NLE 09 ) , potential trigger events could be economic collapse , widespread bank closures , massive social unrest ( possibly due to proof that Barack Obama is not natural - born ) , or a flu pandemic .
This final item led Rep. Paul Broun ( R - Ga. ) to declare on August 11 that the government “ might use a pandemic disease or national disaster as an excuse to declare martial law . ”
Renowned researcher Michel Chossudovsky addressed the mechanics of this subject in a March 19 article entitled , Preparing for Civil Unrest in America : Legislation to Establish Internment Camps on U.S. Military Bases :
“ How will the U.S. government face an impending social catastrophe ?
The chosen avenue , inherited from the outgoing Bush administration , is the reinforcement of the Homeland Security apparatus and the militarization of civilian state institutions . ”
Are Army bases actually being converted into detainment camps ?
In his September 2008 newsletter , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Tex . ) pulled no punches .
“ Even though we know that detention facilities are already in place , [ the government ] now wants to legalize the construction of FEMA camps on military installations using the ever - popular excuse that the facilities are for the purposes of a national emergency . ”
Conservative author and former presidential candidate , Pastor Chuck Baldwin , confirms this notion in an August 11 article , Why Are Internment Camps Being Built ? :
“ I ’ve had military personnel tell me that many of the U.S. military bases that have been recently ‘ closed ’ are also being prepared as large - scale ‘ holding areas . ’ ”
To counteract these charges , some claim the “ renovated bases ” will simply be used to hold illegal aliens .
A recent news item appeared in the Idaho Observer ’s June issue : “ In January 2006 , it was revealed that Halliburton subsidiary , Kellogg , Brown & Root ( KBR ) , had received a $ 385 million contract to build detention facilities ‘ for an emergency influx of immigrants . ’ ”
But to argue that their sole focus is simply on illegal immigrants does n’t hold water because the U.S. has had an open - border policy for at least three decades .
On the other hand , more likely targets for detainment would be anti-New World Order proponents , Second Amendment advocates , dissidents , people who refuse to participate in forced inoculation programs , Christians , tax protesters and those deemed “ extremists ” and “ enemies of the state ” under a recent Department of Homeland Security report on “ homegrown right - wing terrorists . ”
To show their seriousness in pushing this agenda , Bob Unruh revealed a disturbing development on August 7 for World Net Daily : “ An ad campaign featured on a U.S. Army website seeking those who would be interested in being an ‘ internment / resettlement ’ specialist is raising alarms across the country . ”
What specifically would this position entail ?
The description is clear : “ Internment / Resettlement ( I/R ) specialists in the Army are primarily responsible for day - to - day operations in a military confinement / correctional facility or detention / internment facility . ”
Legislation introduced by representative Alcee Hastings ( D - Fl. ) under HR 645 would have the DHS establishing at least half a dozen national emergency centers for large - scale imprisonment of American citizens on military installations .
Further , HR 645 would create a Guantanamo - style setting after martial law is declared .
At that point , posse comitatus laws would be rendered non-existent , replaced by military jurisdiction over all detainees .
As a result , the incarcerated would find it much more difficult to enforce their Constitutional rights to a fair trial and / or legal representation .
If skeptics doubt this scenario , they need to reexamine President Obama ’s own words in a May 21 speech at the National Archives in Washington , D.C.
At this locale , he spoke of “ prolonged detention ” for all those who posed a threat to U.S. security .
Even members of the liberal media were disconcerted by the implications of this proposal , including MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow , who questioned the “ expectation of future crimes ” that seemed implicit in his plan .
Maddow had further suspicions about the president ’s advocacy of an Orwellian Big Brother - world via the use of “ preventive incarceration ” to keep certain people in prison indefinitely without charge .
Finally , similar to the policies of George W. Bush , Obama vowed to “ reshape the standards that apply to our rule of law ” ( i.e. , prolonged military detention and the denial of habeas corpus ) .
Obama and his representatives have unmistakably drawn a line in the sand .
The Department of Homeland Security even has an “ Operation Endgame ” that proposes the “ removal of all ‘ potential terrorists . ’”
How would such a roundup be accomplished ?
How would “ terrorist ” be defined ?
FEMA official Glenn Cannon admitted to the Associated Press on Feb. 13 , 2008 that they are “ looking at ways to use passenger trains to get elderly and sick people out of harm ’s way during an emergency situation . ”
But would they conceivably stop at just senior citizens and the infirm , or is their plan much more sinister ?
On Feb. 4 , 2008 , Lewis Seiler and former Congressman Dan Hamburg ( D - Calif . ) provided a chilling scenario for The San Francisco Chronicle : “ Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary KBR to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees . ”
Such accounts should ring alarm bells , especially when we realize that the U.S. has a long history of detaining its own citizens .
In 1838 , President Martin Van Buren authorized a massive roundup of Cherokee Indians .
During the Civil War , Abe Lincoln ’s jails were filled with inmates due to “ suspicions of disloyalty . ”
Much worse , President Woodrow Wilson imprisoned over 100,000 Americans during World War I who were deemed political opponents or pacifists .
In 1939 , the FBI compiled a “ Custodial Detention Index , ” whereas FDR signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19 , 1942 , which permitted the incarceration of not only Japanese , but Americans , including orphaned infants and anyone deemed a “ dissident ” as well .
More recently , on August 20 , 2006 , Allen Roland of Global Research described one of the most horrifying pieces of legislation ever passed : “ Through Rex 84 , an undisclosed number of concentration camps were set in operation throughout the United States for internment of dissidents and others potentially harmful to the state . ”
Closely associated with this action is Operation Garden Plot , which activist priest Frank Morales characterizes as “ a master plan to suppress democratic opposition in the United States . ”
It was actually implemented during the 1992 L.A. riots .
Finally , Operation Cable Splicer is designed for “ the orderly takeover of state and local governments ” by FEMA and other federal agencies .

( Issue # 35 , August 31 , 2009 )
The Hofstra University student who accused a fellow student and four of his pals of gang - raping her in a campus dorm stunningly recanted her claim last night , and the four suspects were sprung from jail just before 10:30 p.m .
“ Late [ last night ] … the alleged victim of the sexual assault admitted that the encounter that took place early Sunday morning was consensual , ” said Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice .
“ I have launched an immediate criminal investigation into the statements and reports given by the woman in connection with this incident . ”
“ Innocent until proven guilty ! ” shouted an elated Kevin Taveras , 20 , a Cablevision worker from Brentwood , LI , after walking out of jail .
“ I ’m so happy .
I ’m glad to be going home . ”
His 19 - year - old step - brother , Stalin Felipe , said that although he was “ very happy the truth came out , I ’m still embarrassed .
“ We were in jail for over 22 hours and we had to sit there and see our names on TV blurted out calling me a rapist .
“ I have no comment for that girl . ”
The four were arrested after 18 - year - old freshman Danmell Ndonye made her ugly , false accusation .
The fifth innocent person she accused was never arrested and his name was not released .
Taveras and Felipe , along with Hofstra senior Rondell Bedward , 21 , and Jesus Ortiz , 19 , were all charged with first - degree rape .
They ’d been held in lieu of $ 500,000 bail and faced 25 years in prison if convicted .
At least one of them had received a death threat through his lawyer .
“ I got a call from a blocked number saying I should keep my f—ing client off the campus .
He ’s a dead man , ” said Taveras ’ lawyer , Victor Daly - Rivera .
Taveras , a student at Suffolk Community , said “ I am very disappointed that she made up all those lies about us and quite frankly –I do n’t even know her name . ”
A source said that surveillance video failed to back up Ndonye ’s original story .
She had told investigators that Ortiz , 19 , took her cell phone around 3 a.m.
Sunday at a frat party at an on -campus club at the Hempstead , LI , university .
She claimed that she followed the man and his friends home from the party to retrieve her phone and rode the elevator with him to the 11th floor of Estabrook Hall .
There , she said , Felipe made advances on her , which she resisted .
She claimed the five forced her into a bathroom stall , tied her up and took turns sexually assaulting her .
Bedward was banned from campus and suspended .
“ I want to let whatever happened in the past be the past and I am looking forward to getting my life back together , ” Bedward — whose birthday is Saturday — said through tears last night .
His furious mom , Mae Edwards , said , “ he was wrongly accused by that young lady who almost destroyed his life . ”
She said she hopes to “ file charges .
He almost had his degree taken away . ”
Bedward , a Bronx native , is a speech communication and rhetorical studies major who graduated from the Bronx School for Law , Government and Justice in 2006 .
Ortiz and Bedward adamantly denied having sex with Ndonye .
“ I was so embarrassed and I am so upset , ” Ortiz said .
“ I have a great girlfriend at home .
Why would I do something like this to another person ? ”
Students were outraged at Ndonye .
“ This is ridiculous , ” said senior Cyassandra Frith , 21 .
“ She should be charged — she destroyed four people ’s lives . ”
Felipe , who is also a college student , was just looking forward to going home and taking a shower .
“ It feels good to be out , ” he said .
Ndonye ’s relatives had security guards at their building shoo away reporters .

In the never - ending battle to protect computer networks from intruders , security experts are deploying a new defense modeled after one of nature 's hardiest creatures -- the ant .
Unlike traditional security devices , which are static , these " digital ants " wander through computer networks looking for threats , such as " computer worms " — self - replicating programs designed to steal information or facilitate unauthorized use of machines .
When a digital ant detects a threat , it does n't take long for an army of ants to converge at that location , drawing the attention of human operators who step in to investigate .
The concept , called " swarm intelligence , " promises to transform cyber security because it adapts readily to changing threats .
" In nature , we know that ants defend against threats very successfully , " explains Professor of Computer Science Errin Fulp , an expert in security and computer networks .
" They can ramp up their defense rapidly , and then resume routine behavior quickly after an intruder has been stopped .
We were trying to achieve that same framework in a computer system . "
Current security devices are designed to defend against all known threats at all times , but the bad guys who write malware — software created for malicious purposes — keep introducing slight variations to evade computer defenses .
As new variations are discovered and updates issued , security programs gobble more resources , antivirus scans take longer and machines run slower — a familiar problem for most computer users .
Glenn Fink , a research scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ( PNNL ) in Richland , Wash . , came up with the idea of copying ant behavior .
PNNL , one of 10 Department of Energy laboratories , conducts cutting - edge research in cyber security .
Fink was familiar with Fulp 's expertise developing faster scans using parallel processing — dividing computer data into batches like lines of shoppers going through grocery store checkouts , where each lane is focused on certain threats .
He invited Fulp and Wake Forest graduate students Wes Featherstun and Brian Williams to join a project there this summer that tested digital ants on a network of 64 computers .
Swarm intelligence , the approach developed by PNNL and Wake Forest , divides up the process of searching for specific threats .
" Our idea is to deploy 3,000 different types of digital ants , each looking for evidence of a threat , " Fulp says .
" As they move about the network , they leave digital trails modeled after the scent trails ants in nature use to guide other ants .
Each time a digital ant identifies some evidence , it is programmed to leave behind a stronger scent .
Stronger scent trails attract more ants , producing the swarm that marks a potential computer infection . "
In the study this summer , Fulp introduced a worm into the network , and the digital ants successfully found it .
PNNL has extended the project this semester , and Featherstun and Williams plan to incorporate the research into their master 's theses .
Fulp says the new security approach is best suited for large networks that share many identical machines , such as those found in governments , large corporations and universities .
Computer users need not worry that a swarm of digital ants will decide to take up residence in their machine by mistake .
Digital ants cannot survive without software " sentinels " located at each machine , which in turn report to network " sergeants " monitored by humans , who supervise the colony and maintain ultimate control .

Il premier Silvio Berlusconi
" Deliranti spiegazioni " , " umorismo machista " , " un leader improprio per un paese serio " che è imbarazzante " frequentare " per gli altri premier e presidenti occidentali .
Così , in un editoriale della direzione , commenta la conferenza stampa di ieri in Sardegna in cui Silvio Berlusconi , accanto al primo ministro della Spagna Zapatero , ha tra le altre cose attaccato pesantemente il più autorevole quotidiano spagnolo predicendone in sostanza il fallimento .
Il resto della stampa internazionale reagisce in modo simile allo " show " del premier italiano , come lo definiscono vari giornali , e un altro grande quotidiano straniero , il , gli dedica un editoriale al vetriolo per la sua decisione di fare causa ai giornali che lo criticano , paragondandolo a un " torero che assume una banda di avvocati per impedire al toro " di fare il suo mestiere .
Messo nel mirino da Berlusconi , evidentemente risentito per le foto dei party con donne in topless nella sua villa in Sardegna che il giornale spagnolo è stato finora l'unico al mondo a pubblicare con ampio rilievo , dedica comprensibilmente ampio spazio alla " stravagante " conferenza stampa di ieri , come la chiama il corrispondente dall ' Italia Miguel Mora .
L'editoriale del direttore comincia col notare che Berlusconi , ammettendo di avere ricevuto più volte a casa propria un uomo d'affari , Gianpaolo Tarantini , indagato per droga e incitamento alla prostituzione , intrattiene " compagnie poco raccomdabili " .
Quindi l'articolo fa l'elenco della " deliranti spiegazioni " con cui il premier ha risposto , o meglio non risposto , alla domanda del giornalista del Pais durante la conferenza stampa , facendo sfoggia di un " umorismo machista e ridicolo " .
Infine l'editoriale accusa Berlusconi di essere un leader che " confonde il pubblico con il privato , come ha dimostrato nella conferenza stampa " , un leader " improprio per un paese serio e per un governo presentabile " .
Conclude : " Frequentare Berlusconi è una difficoltà politica addizionale pe rle odierne relazioni internazionali " , lasciando capire che il premier spagnolo Zapatero , che a un certo punto ha definito " interessante " quel che Berlusconi stava dicendo , preferirebbe tenerlo a distanza .
Analoghi commenti da parte degli altri quotidiani spagnoli , comeche giudica la conferenza stampa di ieri " un recital a base di cattivo gusto e machismo " e lache parla di un leader " irrimediabile " .
La bibbia del capitalismo , come è soprannominato il , mette in prima pagina la conferenza stampa e la accompagna con un editoriale intitolato " Silvio Berlusconi e il silenzio dei tori " , che riecheggia vagamente il titolo del film " Il silenzio degli innocenti " .
L'articolo non firmato , dunque anche questo espressione della direzione del più importante quotidiano finanziario al mondo , nota che la serie di cause per diffamazione lanciate dal premier italiano contro lae altri giornali stranieri , " susciterebbe ilarità " se non rappresentasse una effettiva minaccia di chiudere la bocca alla stampa .
Il Wsj riporta la recente frase di Berlusconi secondo cui i giornali " ci attaccano come tori infuriati , ma qui c'è un torero che non ha paura di niente " .
Senonché , commenta il , " noi non possiamo ricordarci l'ultima volta che un matador ha scatenato una sqdra di avvocati per impedire al toro di attaccare " .
Il quotidiano newyorchese fa un'ipotesi : che le denunce potranno trattenere alcuni giornali da criticare Berlusconi per le sue storie con giovani donne , ma potrebbero spingere la stampa internazionale a " occuparsi maggiormente di questioni che possono ben più danneggiare la sua reputazione , come le sue relazioni con Tripoli e Teheran , gli effetti del suo nazionalismo economico , le sue mancate promesse di ridurre le tasse " .
E conclude : " Se Berlusconi ama il suo paese così appassionatamente come dice di fare , allora dovrebbe lasciar perdere le cause legali e lasciare la stampa svolgere il suo lavor o " Anche la stampa britannica segue il caso da vicino , con ampi servizi sule sul : entrambi mettono l'accento , fin dai titoli , su un aspetto della conferenza stampa che potrebbe ritorcersi contro Berlusconi , cioè il fatto che il premier ha " per la prima volta ammesso che un sospetto protettore ha portato donne a casa sua " , come titola il , ovvero che Tarantini , " un uomo d'affari indagato per droga e prostituzione " ha portato " belle donne ai party " del premier .
Una frequentazione che per il momento non ha alcuna implicazione giudiziaria , ma che chiaramente i due quotidiani britannici considerano altamente imbarazzante da un punto di vista politico , forse immaginando cosa accadrebbe se il primo ministro del Regno Unito facesse cose simili .
Un rilievo che muove anche l'in Irlanda , titolando che un " pimp " , ossia un protettore , un magnaccia , ha condotto donne nella residenza privata del premier italiano , per stessa ammissione di quest ' ultimo che però a quanto pare non ci trova niente di scandaloso o improprio .
Della Berlusconi - story tratta oggi anche un altro grande quotidiano americano , il , che pubblica una lunga intervista al politologo italiano , a lungo docente di scienze politiche negli Stati Uniti , Giovanni Sartori .
Il titolo dell ' articolo , che riflette le parole di Sartori ( e il tema del suo ultimo libro ) , è questo : " Non è un ditattore ?
Allora è un sultano " .
Sept. 22 , 2009  -- Elizabeth Dianne McLeod says her husband Stanley pleaded with mortgage debt collectors , explaining that his heart problems were so serious that a helicopter once had to be called in to airlift him to a hospital .
In response , one collector allegedly mocked him , leaving a message on his answering machine , suggesting : " Why do n't you have that helicopter pick you up and bring that payment to the office . "
Months later , McLeod , 57 , was dead and the mortgage servicing company , his widow alleges , is to blame .
Elizabeth Dianne McLeod , of Keystone , Fla. , is suing Green Tree Servicing , LLC , for unspecified damages .
She claims the firm repeatedly made harassing debt collection phone calls that , she says , ultimately led to her sick husband 's death .
( Listen to messages McLeod says were left by Green Tree employees on the couple 's answering machine here and here . )
Stanley McLeod died of problems related to his heart condition in December , 2005 .
Green
Tree treated her husband " worse than any human deserves to be " treated , she said Monday through her lawyer .
A spokesman for Green Tree , which is based in St. Paul , Minn. , declined to comment on the lawsuit , saying that the company does not comment on pending litigation .
The McLeods fell on hard times in 2002 , when a heart attack forced Stanley McLeod to leave his job as an alarm technician at a Sears store and instead rely on government disability benefits .
By 2003 , the Keystone , Fla. , couple , contending with Stanley McLeod 's medical bills and a lower income , began sending some of their mortgage payments in late .
Each time they did , Green Tree , their mortgage servicing company , would call to demand payment , said McLeod 's lawyer , Billy Howard , of the Florida personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan .
By 2005 , Howard said , the situation had grown considerably worse : According to the law suit , Green Tree was calling on back - to - back days ; placed calls to Stanley 's McLeod 's neighbor , brother and grandson ; and once called at least nine times in one day .
McLeod 's outstanding debt , Howard said , was just under $ 700 .
" If somebody tells you they do n't have the money in the morning , the only reason you call them back the same day is to harass them , " Howard said .
Elizabeth Dianne McLeod said her husband experienced chest pains , spikes in blood pressure and heavy breathing after many of the phone calls .
" The unrelenting calls visibly ( were ) destroying his body , " she said .
Debt Collectors Are Consumers ' No. 1 Complaint
Originally filed in 2006 , Elizabeth Dianne McLeod 's lawsuit could be heard by a court this year after earlier efforts by Green Tree to settle the dispute through arbitration proceedings , Howard said .
Abusive practices by debt collectors are a common complaint among consumers , especially as many recession - battered Americans find themselves behind on mortgage , car or credit card payments and other debts .
Earlier this year , the Federal Trade Commission reported to Congress that it receives more than 70,000 complaints about debt collectors each year , more than about any other industry .
The trade group for debt collectors , ACA International , said it takes consumer complaints seriously .
" ACA International and its members do not in any way condone any illegal or unethical behavior or tactics , " said spokesman John Nemo , who said that Green Tree is not among ACA 's 5,000 members .
" We really feel strongly that every consumer deserves to be treated with dignity and respect , " he said .
Generally , debt collectors are subject to federal rules under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act , enforced by the FTC , which prohibits harassment by debt collectors .
But many mortgage servicing companies -- unlike traditional debt collection agencies -- do n't fall under the federal rules , according to Geoff Walsh , a staff attorney with National Consumer Law Center .
Some , he said , may be subject to state rules instead .
To determine whether a mortgage servicer may have violated a state or federal law , Walsh recommends individuals contact their state attorney general .
Billy Howard , McLeod 's lawyer , said Florida state law does ban harassment by companies like Green Tree .
" Our legislature recognizes the need to be protected against banks , creditors , mortgage companies and the like , " Howard said .
India ’s Department of Atomic Energy ( DAE ) is planning a large expansion of nuclear power , in which fast breeder reactors play an important role .
Fast breeder reactors are attractive to the DAE because they produce ( or “ breed ” ) more fissile material than they use .
The breeder reactor is especially attractive in India , which hopes to develop a large domestic nuclear energy program even though it has primarily poor quality uranium ore that is expensive to mine .
India ’s Department of Atomic Energy ( DAE ) is planning a large expansion of nuclear power , in which fast breeder reactors play an important role .
Fast breeder reactors are attractive to the DAE because they produce ( or “ breed ” ) more fissile material than they use .
The breeder reactor is especially attractive in India , which hopes to develop a large domestic nuclear energy program even though it has primarily poor quality uranium ore that is expensive to mine .
Currently , only one fast reactor operates in the country–a small test reactor in Kalpakkam , a small township about 80 kilometers ( almost 50 miles ) south of Chennai .
The construction of a larger prototype fast breeder reactor ( PFBR ) is underway at the same location .
This reactor is expected to be completed in 2010 and will use mixed plutonium - uranium oxide as fuel in its core , with a blanket of depleted uranium oxide that will absorb neutrons and transmute into plutonium 239 .
Liquid sodium will be used to cool the core , which will produce 1,200 megawatts of thermal power and 500 megawatts of electricity .
The reactor is to be the first of hundreds that the DAE envisions constructing throughout India by mid-century .
However , such an expansion of fast reactors , even if more modest than DAE projections , could adversely affect public health and safety .
While all nuclear reactors are susceptible to catastrophic accidents , fast reactors pose a unique risk .
In fast reactors , the core is n’t in its most reactive–or energy producing – configuration when operating normally .
Therefore , an accident that rearranges the fuel in the core could lead to an increase in reaction rate and an increase in energy production .
If this were to occur quickly , it could lead to a large , explosive energy release that might rupture the reactor vessel and disperse radioactive material into the environment .
Many of these reactors also have what is called a “ positive coolant void coefficient , ” which means that if the coolant in the central part of the core were to heat up and form bubbles of sodium vapor , the reactivity–a measure of the neutron balance within the core , which determines the reactor ’s tendency to change its power level ( if it is positive , the power level rises ) –would increase ; therefore core melting could accelerate during an accident .
( A positive coolant void coefficient , though not involving sodium , contributed to the runaway reaction increase during the April 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident . )
In contrast , conventional light water reactors typically have a “ negative coolant void coefficient ” so that a loss of coolant reduces the core ’s reactivity .
The existing Indian fast breeder test reactor , with its much smaller core , does n’t have a positive coolant void coefficient .
Thus , the DAE does n’t have real - world experience in handling the safety challenges that a large prototype reactor will pose .
More largely , international experience shows that fast breeder reactors are n’t ready for commercial use .
Superphénix , the flagship of the French breeder program , remained inoperative for the majority of its 11 - year lifetime until it was finally shuttered in 1996 .
Concerns about the adequacy of the design of the German fast breeder reactor led to it being contested by environmental groups and the local state government in the 1980s and ultimately to its cancellation in 1991 .
And the Japanese fast reactor Monju shut down in 1995 after a sodium coolant leak caused a fire and has yet to restart .
Only China and Russia are still developing fast breeders .
China , however , has yet to operate one , and the Russian BN - 600 fast reactor has suffered repeated sodium leaks and fires .
When it comes to India ’s prototype fast breeder reactor , two distinct questions must be asked : ( 1 ) Is there confidence about how an accident would propagate inside the core and how much energy it might release ? ; and ( 2 ) have PFBR design efforts been as strict as necessary , given the possibility that an accident would be difficult to contain and potentially harmful to the surrounding population ?
The simple answer to both is no .
The DAE , like other fast - reactor developers , has tried to study how severe a core - disruptive accident would be and how much energy it would release .
In the case of the PFBR , the DAE has argued that the worst - case core disruptive accident would release an explosive energy of 100 megajoules .
This is questionable .
The DAE ’s estimate is much smaller when compared with other fast reactors , especially when the much larger power capacity of the PFBR–and thus , the larger amount of fissile material used in the reactor–is taken into account .
For example , it was estimated that the smaller German reactor ( designed to produce 760 megawatts of thermal energy ) would produce 370 megajoules in the event of a core - disruptive accident–much higher than the PFBR estimate .
Other fast reactors around the world have similarly higher estimates for how much energy would be produced in such accidents .
The DAE ’s estimate is based on two main assumptions : ( 1 ) that only part of the core will melt down and contribute to the accident ; and ( 2 ) that only about 1 percent of the thermal energy released during the accident would be converted into mechanical energy that can damage the containment building and cause ejection of radioactive materials into the atmosphere .
Neither of these assumptions is justifiable .
Britain ’s Atomic Energy Authority has done experiments that suggest up to 4 percent of the thermal energy could be converted into mechanical energy .
And the phenomena that might occur inside the reactor core during a severe accident are very complex , so there ’s no way to stage a full - scale experiment to compare with the theoretical accident models that the reactor ’s designers used in their estimates .
In addition , important omissions in the DAE ’s own safety studies make their analysis inadequately conservative .
( Our independent estimates of the energy produced in a hypothetical PFBR core disruptive accident are presented in the Science and Global Security article , “ Compromising Safety : Design Choices and Severe Accident Possibilities in India ’s Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor ” and these are much higher than the DAE ’s estimates . )
Turning to the second question :
In terms of the stringency of the DAE ’s design effort , the record reveals inadequate safety precautions .
One goal of any “ defense - in - depth ” design is to engineer barriers to withstand the most severe accident that ’s considered plausible .
Important among these barriers is the reactor ’s containment building , the most visible structure from the outside of any nuclear plant .
Compared to most other breeder reactors , and light water reactors for that matter , the design of the PFBR ’s containment is relatively weak and wo n’t be able to contain an accident that releases a large amount of energy .
The DAE knows how to build stronger containments–its newest heavy water reactor design has a containment building that is meant to withstand six times more pressure than the PFBR ’s containment–but has chosen not to do so for the PFBR .
The other unsafe design choice is that of the reactor core .
As mentioned earlier , the destabilizing positive coolant void coefficient in fast reactors is a problem because it increases the possibility that reactivity will escalate inside the core during an accident .
It ’s possible to decrease this effect by designing the reactor core so that fuel subassemblies are interspersed within the depleted uranium blanket , in what is termed a heterogeneous core .
The U.S. Clinch River Breeder Reactor , which was eventually cancelled , was designed with a heterogeneous core , and Russia has considered a heterogeneous core for its planned BN - 1600 reactor .
The DAE has n’t made such an effort , and the person who directed India ’s fast breeder program during part of the design phase once argued that the emphasis on the coolant void coefficient was mistaken because a negative void coefficient could lead to dangerous situations in an accident as well .
That might be true , but it misses the obvious point that the same potentially dangerous situations would be even more dangerous if the void coefficient within the core is positive .
Both of these design choices–a weak containment building and a reactor core with a large and positive void coefficient–are readily explainable :
They lowered costs .
Reducing the sodium coolant void coefficient would have increased the fissile material requirement of the reactor by 30 - 50 percent–an expensive component of the initial costs .
Likewise , a stronger containment building would have cost more .
All of this is motivated by the DAE ’s assessment that “ the capital cost of [ fast breeder reactors ] will remain the most important hurdle ” to their rapid deployment .
Lowered electricity costs would normally be most welcome , but not with the increased risk of catastrophic accidents caused by poorly designed fast breeder reactors .
Nuclear engineer Ahmed Hassanein works at his Purdue lab , where researchers are adapting the same methods used in fusion - energy research to develop a new type of " nanolithography " for creating future computer chips .
Supercomputers at the US Department of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory are needed to run simulations critical for the research .
The technology revolves around extremely thin plasma beams for making tiny features in future computer chips and continuing Moore 's law , an unofficial rule stating that the number of transistors on integrated circuits , or chips , doubles about every 18 months .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers are adapting the same methods used in fusion - energy research to create extremely thin plasma beams for a new class of " nanolithography " required to make future computer chips .
Current technology uses ultraviolet light to create the fine features in computer chips in a process called photolithography , which involves projecting the image of a mask onto a light - sensitive material , then chemically etching the resulting pattern .
New nanolithography will be needed to continue advances in computer technology and to extend Moore 's law , an unofficial rule stating that the number of transistors on integrated circuits , or chips , doubles about every 18 months .
" We can't make devices much smaller using conventional lithography , so we have to find ways of creating beams having more narrow wavelengths , " said Ahmed Hassanein , the Paul L. Wattelet Professor of Nuclear Engineering and head of Purdue 's School of Nuclear Engineering .
The new plasma - based lithography under development generates " extreme ultraviolet " light having a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers , less than one - tenth the size of current lithography , Hassanein said .
Nuclear engineers and scientists at Purdue and the U.S. Department of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory are working to improve the efficiency of two techniques for producing the plasma :
One approach uses a laser and the other " discharge - produced " method uses an electric current .
" In either case , only about 1 to 2 percent of the energy spent is converted into plasma , " Hassanein said .
" That conversion efficiency means you 'd need greater than 100 kilowatts of power for this lithography , which poses all sorts of engineering problems .
We are involved in optimizing conversion efficiency - reducing the energy requirements - and solving various design problems for the next - generation lithography . "
Findings are detailed in a research paper scheduled to appear in the October - December 2009 issue of the Journal of Micro / Nanolithography , MEMS , and MOEMS .
The paper was written by Hassanein , senior research scientist Valeryi Sizyuk , computer analyst Tatyana Sizyuk , and research assistant professor Sivanandan Harilal , all in the School of Nuclear Engineering .
Critical to the research is a computer simulation , called HEIGHTS - for high - energy interaction with general heterogeneous target systems - developed by Hassanein 's team .
Computations for a single HEIGHTS simulation using Argonne supercomputers can take several months to finish , said Hassanein , a former Argonne senior scientist who led work there to develop HEIGHTS .
The laser method creates plasma by heating xenon , tin or lithium .
The plasma produces high - energy packets of light , called photons , of extreme ultraviolet light .
Plasma is a partially ionized gaslike material that conducts electricity .
Because of this electrical conductivity , researchers are able to use magnetic fields to shape and control plasmas , forming beams , filaments and other structures .
In experimental fusion reactors , magnetic fields are used to keep plasma - based nuclear fuel from touching the metal walls of the containment vessel , enabling the plasma to be heated to the extreme temperatures required to maintain fusion reactions .
HEIGHTS simulates the entire process of the plasma evolution : the laser interacting with the target , and the target evaporating , ionizing and turning into a plasma .
The simulation also shows what happens when the magnetic forces " pinch " the plasma cloud into a smaller diameter spot needed to generate the photons .
Findings in the paper detail the laser - produced plasma beams , showing that simulations match data from laboratory experiments recently built at Purdue , Hassanein said .
" It was very exciting to see this match because it means we are on the right track , " Hassanein said .
" The computer simulations tell us how to optimize the entire system and where to go next with the experiments to verify that . "
One design challenge stems from the fact that lenses absorb the photons that make up light , meaning they can not be used to focus the beam .
Instead , mirrors are used in the design .
However , plasma condenses on the mirrors , reducing their reflectivity and limiting the efficiency of the process .
" We are trying to help find innovative ways of producing these photons , optimizing the production and mitigating the effects of the plasma on the mirrors , " Hassanein said .
" So we are trying to improve the entire system . "
The simulation tool combines computations in plasma physics , radiation transport , atomic physics , plasma - material interactions and magnetohydrodynamics , or what happens when a target is heated , melts and turns into a plasma .

WASHINGTON  President Obama sought Wednesday to reframe the health care debate as “ a core ethical and moral obligation , ” imploring a coalition of religious leaders to help promote the plan to lower costs and expand insurance coverage for all Americans .
“ I know there ’s been a lot of misinformation in this debate , and there are some folks out there who are frankly bearing false witness , ” Mr. Obama told a multidenominational group of pastors , rabbis and other religious leaders who support his goal to remake the nation ’s health care system .
As the president returned to the health care debate after two days of silence , the administration encouraged Republicans to take part in the negotiations .
Still , Democratic leaders moved ahead with plans to advance a measure next month with or without Republican cooperation .
The White House acknowledged that its handling of the debate had been inconsistent , with Robert Gibbs , the press secretary , saying , “ I do n’t think anybody here believes we ’ve pitched a no - hit game or a perfect game . ”

I am sure they are smart people , but every once in a while the journalists working for the mainstream media deliver themselves of the opinion that exercise does not help you lose weight , or that , indeed , there is no way to lose weight .
This article in Time says that the reporter ’s friends removed the benefit of the exercise they had done by going to Starbucks afterward and having a muffin .
But he implies that they are doomed to do so .
No blame is laid on corporate food for America ’s weight problems , even though that is among the main culprits .
Losing weight is hard , but can be done .
The trick is to keep it off .
In one study published just last year , a group of women dropped 10 percent of their body weight .
But only about a quarter kept the weight off for the succeeding two years .
What was special about that 25 percent ?
They exercised vigorously about 5 hours a week , and they were careful about their diet , especially about eating very much fat .
Likewise of 3,000 weight loss subjects registered at the National Weight Loss Registry who have lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off at least 3 years , 90 % of them report exercising an hour a day .
In other words : Time exercise article Epic Fail .
Look , exercise and calories are not that complicated .
If a man gets on a treadmill for a little over an hour at a brisk pace , he should be using 600 calories .
If he also eats sensibly , and if he does the exercise at least five times a week , he should lose a pound a week .
Regular exercise and eating sensibly should allow him to take off 4 pounds in a month .
That may seem a pittance for someone who has put on a lot of weight , but it is 48 pounds a year , which should suffice for most people .
It is true that aerobic exercise causes you to lose muscle as well as fat , and such exercise should be combined with weight lifting to replace the lost muscle .
Muscle tissue uses more calories than other kinds , and so having more of it also helps keep the weight off .
Of course , diet is also key .
When you ’re trying to lose weight , you ca n’t be eating muffins at Starbucks .
You may crave them more , as the article asserts , if you exercise vigorously .
But you are n’t doomed to give in to the craving .
And , there are other things that would satisfy the craving .
A Starbucks blueberry muffin is on the order of 400 calories , and many of the drinks are 200 to 400 .
So obviously eating and drinking there carelessly would more than wipe out an hour ’s hard exercise .
But instead , you could have a tall non -fat capuccino for 100 calories and a biscotti for 160 , coming in at 240 total , and preserving 360 of the exercise savings .
If you were hard core about losing weight , you could just have the coffee of the day or a cafe Americano , which have hardly any calories at all , and some fruit .
Or you could stop at a soup and sandwich place instead of Starbucks , and have a cup of lentil soup for 200 calories ; that dish is high in protein , which is what your body is really craving after hard exercise , not muffins .
What the Time article neglects to note is that how many calories you take in at Starbucks only matters in the context of your total intake for the day .
If you eat a lighter than usual lunch , then the 240 calories picked up at Starbucks might not matter very much .
Especially if you are exercising about an hour a day .
Most people are n’t good at translating their pangs into wise choices because they have n’t educated themselves about processed foods served them by corporations and restaurants .
The body also plays tricks .
Sometimes you feel hungry when you are really just thirsty , and drinking some water would be enough .
When you talk about avoiding too much fat , it sounds puritanical and as though we are stuck with celery and raw broccoli .
But avoiding fat is mostly a matter of reading the labels of the things we buy in the grocery store .
The main problem facing Americans in particular with regard to the obesity epidemic is that our processed food sold to us by our corporations is typically unhealthy .
I had my gall bladder out a few years ago and before the operation was put on a nonfat or very low fat diet .
I thought , well I ’ll make myself some spaghetti with tomato sauce .
So I went to the grocery store and checked the spaghetti noodles , and they were loaded with fat .
Then I checked the pre-made tomato sauce and it was floating in fat .
Now , I do n’t think wheat and tomatoes have a lot of fat in them naturally .
It is being added by the corporations , just as high fructose corn syrup is being added , because fat , sugar and salt make food addictive for consumers , and they want to sell us as much food as they can .
I personally think that the Atkins low - carb diet works for a lot of people mainly because it makes them avoid processed carbohydrates like cereal and pasta that have had fat and sugar poured into them at some factory .
It would certainly make them avoid the Starbucks muffins and ( worse ) scones .
Exercise also has many health and cognitive benefits , including in fighting cancer and Alzheimer ’s , quite apart from the weight issue .
And , most people do n’t realize that if you do n’t do resistance training such as working with weights , after age 45 your muscles will turn to jelly .
I was outraged when I discovered this datum at age 47 , because no health care provider had ever warned me about it .
Luckily , the deterioration of the muscles can be reversed with weight training .
Running or playing tennis wo n’t help with this loss of muscle mass , it has to be doing curls .
Otherwise , muscles deteriorate and fat increases , which is easy since muscle tissue uses more calories than other kinds , and you have less of it as you age unless you work out .
The science on all this is perfectly clear .
Vigorous exercise ( both aerobic and resistance training ) combined with a low - fat diet is what allows people to take weight off and keep it off .
Time is shockingly wrong .

Pretty Django Error Pages ¶
Continuing on with the simple tricks that make everyone ’s life a little bit better , I know a lot of people hate that Django ’s 500 pages do n’t get rendered as a RequestContext .
This means that if you have context processors ( like one that sets a MEDIA_URL ) , they do n’t get called .
This was causing our 500 pages not only to make users sad because something broke , but knock them out of context becaue our entire design blew up .
Luckily , Django makes it incredibly simple to redefine your 500 handler in your URLConf .
Most pythonistas know that import * is a bad thing , but it is standard in the Django community in your URLConf to do a from django.conf.urls .
defaults import * .
This has the effect of pulling in Django ’s default handler500 function .
So if you want to override Django ’s default , you simply set it up like so .
from django.conf.urls.defaults import * handler500 = ' path.to.my.sweet.views.server_error '
Then you simply define a server_error view that renders the error page with a RequestContext .
from django.
shortcuts import render_to_response from django.template import RequestContext def server_error ( request , template_name = ' 500.html ' ) : " " " 500 error handler .
Templates : `500.html` Context : None " " " return render_to_response ( template_name , context_instance = RequestContext ( request ) )
How do you find the entrepreneurs and innovators in Africa who need investment funding to scale ?
That ’s the question I was most intrigued by on my panel today at SoCap with Emeka Okafor , Nii Simmonds and Ashifi Gogo about identifying opportunities for innovation in Africa .
There are really two big issues at stake .
First , how to find the right people .
Second , what funding level is needed .
Boots on the ground
You ’re not going to find the compelling African entrepreneurs while sitting in an office in the US or Europe .
It ’s only by spending significant time on the ground in the countries you ’re wanting to invest in that you find the people you need to know .
It ’s there that you get past the first - level of non-expert opportunity profiteers and attention seekers and find the people who actually do the work .
Two examples :
AfriGadget is a blog about finding interesting stories of African innovation .
It ’s not always easy to come up with the stories though .
You have to look hard , teach yourself to see things , in order to find these extraordinary individuals .
Without the great blogging team and the people sending in stories from the ground , we would n’t have anything .
I grew up in Nairobi , yet it took me a solid two years of meeting people and networking within the city to get beneath the surface and find the people with the talent and drive to create actual businesses .
It ’s generally not cost - effective for every funding source to have their own person canvassing the continent .
The question then becomes , how do you find the trusted intermediaries who know the real story on the ground , know the players and can spot the talent ?
The seed ( angel ) funding gap
Most of the individuals with the skills to create their own businesses in the high - tech space are working for large NGOs and multinationals .
Why ?
They got to a place in their life where they had to make the choice of going out on their own , armed with a good idea and no hope of funding , or putting food on the table .
This is similar to entrepreneurs worldwide , however in Africa the gap between success and failure is a lot less forgiving and the choices are a lot fewer .
Most of the funding available for companies in Africa comes through loans , debt financing .
It ’s mostly used in SMEs at the medium - sized level .
There ’s a gap , and that is seed funding .
There are very few opportunities to get equity - based funding , especially at the levels where most entrepreneurs starting off need it .
This is the $ 10 - 300 k range .
Who funds them ?
There are a few organizations internationally who run business plan competitions with money prizes , others that fund a few startups each year ( TechnoServe , Kuv and Acumen come to mind ) .
There are also some local people and organizations that do some of the funding ( as was the case for Agosta Liko pictured above ) , but it ’s very hard to come by even within Africa ’s most advanced tech / finance cities ( Nairobi , Johannesburg and Accra ) .
Who else is out there ?
How can we bridge this gap ?
Django 0.96.5 released
The recent security - oriented releases of Django included what was intended to be the final supported release in the Django 0.96 series .
However , an issue was discovered with the patch applied to the 0.96 release branch ; a portion of the updated code was not correctly applied , and as a result the runserver command no longer functioned at all .
To remedy this , tonight we have issued Django 0.96.5 , which includes the full corrected code .
The relevant changesets in the 0.96 release branch are :
The following download is also available :
Django 0.96.5 : package | checksums
All users of Django 0.96 are encouraged to upgrade , but are warned that this is the final release which will be issued in the Django 0.96 series , and official support for Django 0.96 is now ended .
However , that routine radio check , on July 28 , took place before British and European coastguards received an alert warning that the Arctic Sea had been previously been attacked by armed intruders in Swedish waters .
There are now fears the vessel , with 15 crew aboard and carrying almost £ 1 million - worth of sawn timber from Finland to Algeria , is under the control of pirates or gangsters .

Getting CUPS installed and configured on FreeBSD has proven to be an almost absurdly simple task for me — probably in part because I ’m “ smart ” , and tend to stick to networked PostScript laser printers rather than using chintzy bargain - priced inkjet printers .
Just in case you want an article handy that discusses the matter while you do it , the freebsd.org site has one called CUPS on FreeBSD .
That ’ll tell you stuff like how to get CUPS to start every time you start your computer , which might be non-obvious to someone who has n’t been using FreeBSD heavily for a while .
I link it here because the FreeBSD Handbook itself focuses pretty much exclusively on LPD for some reason , and leaves us on our own with CUPS .
It may have something to do with the fact that CUPS is n’t part of the Base System .
Once you ’ve got CUPS installed and recognizing your printer , you might want to get some kind of stand - alone X Window System based print dialog installed .
I ’d love to have something with more of a text user interface instead , but I ’ve been too lazy to bother with it so far , so I decided to use a lightweight GUI tool .
Some people might immediately leap to whatever comes with GNOME or KDE , or choose something else fairly bloated for its relatively simple task such as GtkLP .
I used GtkLP for a while , but I ’m less than pleased with it .
I prefer the lighter - weight XPP ( installed from ports , of course ) , at least until I find something better .
Unfortunately , installing XPP on FreeBSD might not immediately work for you with CUPS .
I ’ve discovered that there ’s an apparently undocumented incompatibility between XPP and a more recent standard configuration option for CUPS .
I hear it ’s meant to speed up printing operations for applications that make use of this configuration option , but XPP clearly is n’t one of those applications , since it prevents XPP from being able to interact with my printer at all .
The problem is the following line in the cupsd.conf file :
Listen /var/run/cups.sock
Comment it out with the # symbol at the beginning of the line and XPP will magically start working again ( though you ’ll have to restart the CUPS server process for it to pick up the configuration change , of course ) :
# Listen /var/run/cups.sock
That ’s about it .
Enjoy .
ROMULUS -- Congressman John Dingell ( D - Dearborn ) faced jeers and cheers during a forum about the future of the nation 's health care system .
The Michigan Democrat sponsored the event Thursday evening in Romulus on President Barack Obama 's health care plans .
The Detroit Free Press reports Mike Sola of Milan interrupted Dingell repeatedly as he pushed his son , Scott , in a wheelchair to the podium .
He said proposed changes would n't help Scott and called Dingell a fraud .
Dingell responded that the man 's concerns would be addressed .
Dingell told Fox 2 afterward that the forum had been infiltrated by opponents .
Some chanted " kill the bill " and other protesters gathered outside .
The meeting was n't announced until Thursday morning , but word quickly spread .
Dingell also faced accusations that the bill would support abortions , but told the crowd " there will be no payment of taxpayer funds for abortion . "
Independent group factcheck.org says that only one approved amendment to the health care legislation directly addresses the question of publicly - funded abortions .
Factcheck.org :
An amendment introduced by Rep. Lois Capps , a California Democrat , would leave it to private insurers to decide whether or not to cover abortion , and in the case of the federal plan , leave it up to HHS , but it would not be part of the " essential benefits package " defined by the government .
However , no public money could be used to pay for abortions , even in the public plan , which would be funded with privately paid premiums ; the only exceptions would be cases of rape , incest , or the mother 's life 's endangerment , much as in the current Hyde amendment .
The subsidies given out to help those below certain income levels purchase insurance " are not to be used for purposes of paying for [ abortion ] , " the provisions says .
RELATED CONTENT • State Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop : ' Angry mob ' may return if Gov. Granholm raises ' sin taxes '
The amendment would also require the government to make sure that each " premium rating area " of the U.S. offered , in its health insurance " exchange " where individuals could shop for coverage , at least one plan that covered abortion and one that did n't .
Billed as a compromise between Democrats who are pro-abortion rights those who are anti-abortion , the measure passed 30 - 28 , with two anti-abortion Dems voting for it .
But groups like FRC are unhappy with it , saying that the segregation between public subsidies and private funds to pay for abortion services is meaningless .
FRC head Tony Perkins says on the group 's Web site that the provision " mandated taxpayer - funded abortion . "
However , it does not .
Rep .
Bart Stupak introduced an amendment that would strictly prohibit the use of federal money " to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion , " but it fell 27 - 31 in the committee on energy and commerce .
The White House on Tuesday suggested that some of the anger seen at town hall meetings around the country is " manufactured , " and the Democratic National Committee this week released a new Web video saying " desperate Republicans and their well founded allies are now organizing angry mobs , just like they did during the election . "
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs specifically accused the group Conservatives for Patients ' Rights of staging protests around the country .
Richard Scott , the organization 's chairman , responded by saying " no one needs to manufacture anger or concern " because the American public " is threatened by a massive government takeover " of health care .
Earlier in the day , hundreds gathered outside Democratic Congressman Gary Peters ' office in Troy , protesting health care , abortion and socialism .
Conservatives for Patients ' Rights listed both town hall meetings on their Web site .
Editors note :
This story has been updated to expand on the abortion debate referenced in the original article .
Who has a better health care system : Canada or the U.S. Michael Moore would vote for Canada .
Libertarians would side with the U.S. A new NBER working paper by June O’Neill and Dave O’Neill concludes that the two systems may produce more similar health outcomes than was previously believed .
History of the Canadian System
The paper reviews some of the major developments in the Canadian health care system during the last half century .
Since the late 1960s Canada essentially has had a universal health insurance system covering all services provided by physicians and hospitals .
To implement universal coverage the federal and provincial governments took over full funding of both hospital and physician services , setting physician fees and hospital budgets .
During the 70’s physicians , dissatisfied with the official fee amounts , chose to work outside the system and bill patients at higher amounts .
But with the passage of the Canadian Health Act of 1984 Canada outlawed extra billing and became a rigid one - tier system which restricted the provision of any “ core ” services outside the public ’s so - called “ Medicare ” system ( Irvine , Ferguson and Cackett ) .
Since all hospital and physician services are free , demand surged in Canada leading to skyrocketing costs .
This lead to government spending cuts in the 1990s ; shortages and waiting lines resulted .
The condition for shortages was enhanced because of the provision in the 1984
Act that decreed that any service that the single payer provides , no matter how much in short supply it may be , cannot be privately insured or produced and sold in Canada .
Relief came , however , in 2005 when the 1984 Act was struck down as unconstitutional by Canada ’s highest court { Chaoulli v. Quebec ( Attorney General ) , 2005 , IS.C.R. 791 , 2005 SCC 35} .
A slim 4/3 majority ruled that the government ’s argument — that allowing a private sector , would undermine their public system — was not supported by the actual experience of other countries ( U.K. , France and Germany ) that had converted from single payer to dual systems .
Data
The authors ’ main data set used is The Joint Canada / U.S. Survey of Health ( JCUSH ) .
Collected between the fall of 2002 and spring of 2003 , this data set includes 3,505 Canadian and 5,183 American individuals .
Basic Statistics
U.S. Canada Life Expectancy ( Male ) 74.8 77.4 Life Expectancy ( Female ) 80.1 82.4 Infant Mortality / 1000 live births 6.8 5.3 Obesity Rate ( Male ) 31.1 17.0 Obesity Rate ( Female ) 32.2 19.0 HC spending as % of GDP ( 2005 ) 16.0 % 10.4 %
We can readily see that the U.S. has worse life expectancy , infant mortality rates , and obesity rates that Canada , yet pays more for for these relatively poorer outcomes .
Canada is clearly better …right ?
Investigating Infant Mortality
It turns out that once we condition on infant birthweight–a significant predictor of infant health –the U.S. has equivalent infant mortality rates .
In fact U.S. infant mortality is lower for low - birthweight babies than Canadian infant mortality for low birthweight babies .
Overall infant mortality , however , is higher in the U.S. because the incidence of babies with low birthweight is higher than in Canada .
This may be due to demographic or epidemiological factors , or it may be the case that the U.S. is better at having a live birth for a low birthweight baby .
Birthweight Distribution Birthweight - specific Infant Mortality
U.S. Canada U.S. Canada < 1500 1.4 0.9 247.3 262.2 1500-1999 1.5 1.1 29.3 36.6 2000-2499 4.6 3.7 12.2 12.9 2500-2999 16.6 15.0 4.8 4.4 ≥3000 75.9 78.9 2.1 2.0 <2500 7.5 5.7 60.4 58.0
Overall Mortality Differences
Why do Canadians live longer .
One reason is due to the excess number of accidents and homicides in the U.S. compared to Canada .
In fact 50 % - 85 % of the mortality gap between American and Canadian adults in their twenties can be explained by the increased American accident / homicide rates .
For people over 50 , 30 - 50 % of the difference in age - specific mortality rates can be attributed to the excess number of heart disease patients in the U.S.
These heart disease findings are more likely driven by American lifestyle choices rather than the efficacy of the U.S. medical system .
Access to Care
Well , the medical efficiency of the two systems may not be so different but access to care must vary greatly , right ?
Canada has an egalitarian , socialist system while the U.S. relies ( somewhat ) on free - market capitalism to allocate medical services .
Below we see that Canada general has a lower disease incidence rate , but treatment rates are generally higher in the U.S.
Further , these difference decrease even more if we only look at Caucasians in each country .
The authors state “ the composition of the non-white group differs by country — predominantly black in the U.S. , but Asian in Canada ; and racial differences in health outcomes may differ in the two countries . ”
See CensusScope for more details on the U.S. racial composition .
Canada U.S. % with condition % gets treatment % with condition % gets treatment All
Asthma 6.6 80.3 7.8 78.8
High blood pressure 8.8 84.1 13.1 88.3 Heart Disease 2.4 67.2 2.6 69.6 Angina 0.9 74.6 1.1 61.0 Whites Asthma 6.9 82.7 7.7 77.6
High blood pressure 9.1 83.2 12.5 87.3 Heart Disease 2.7 69.4 2.4 73.2 Angina 0.9 70.7 0.8 75.1
In Canada , the main reason for an unmet need was because the wait was too long or the treatment was unavailable .
In the U.S. , most people who do not receive treatment fail to do so because of cost considerations .
Preventive Services
Probably the most surprising discovery of the paper was that Americans partake in more preventive care than Canadians .
Mammograms : 88.6 % of American females 40 - 69 had ever had a mammogram compared to 72.3 % of Canadians .
PAP smear : 86.3 % of American females 20 - 69 had a PAP smear in the last 3 years compared to 75.1 % of Canadians .
Prostate screening : 54.2 % of American men 40 - 69 had ever had a PSA test compared to 16.4 % of Canadians .
As an economist , I attributed this finding to moral hazard : Canadians know that if they would get a disease that their government will pay for their care .
Thus , they may be less motivated to ask for preventive services .
One of my medical school colleagues noted , however , that physician recommendations also play a large part in the amount of care given .
Further , most patients strongly wish to avoid disease , not simply due to cost considerations , but because of the physical and mental impact the disease would have on their life .
Conclusion
American are less healthy than Canadians .
What this paper finds , however , is that this is mainly due to the fact that the U.S. has a higher incidence of disease .
It turns out that Americans may have slightly higher access to treatment than Canadians .
The paper is not the most smoothly written piece I have read , but the data is revealing .
The small - ish sample size of the JCUSH mean that the results should not be taken as definative .
Since the data set uses the same survey for both countries , however , the authors present convincing evidence that this cross-country comparison is of a high quality .
The new 2011 M sedan being introduced by Infiniti at Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance , has come up to be the 3rd generation among these prestigious luxury liners .

A blog of random bits of writing ( opinion pieces , humor , ultra - short fiction , reviews , et cetera ) updated Mondays and Thursdays .
MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre was fined $ 10,000 by the NFL on Friday for his crackback block on Houston defensive back Eugene Wilson in a preseason game .
The play happened on Monday night at Houston in Favre 's first extensive action since he signed with the Vikings on Aug. 18 .
The 39 - year - old lined up at receiver in Minnesota 's version of the wildcat offense .
Rookie receiver Percy Harvin took the snap and started running around the left end in Favre 's direction .
Despite playing with sore ribs , the quarterback crouched and threw his body at Wilson 's legs to cut him down .
The game was televised nationally and the block caused an uproar in Houston and elsewhere around the league .
Wilson injured his left knee on the play and defensive players have long considered that type of block a dirty play .
" What was up with that ? "
Wilson said after the game when asked about the block .
" Seriously , what was up with that ? "
His agent , James Sims , wondered what was up with the fine .
" Absolutely not , " Sims said in an interview with FOX 26 Sports in Houston when asked if the punishment fit the deed .
" Certainly there have been similar blatant infractions like this where a player has received a one - game suspension , which would have cost Favre a whole lot more money . "
Sims said Wilson was looking to get an apology from Favre .
" Eugene went back out on the field after the game hoping Favre would come up to him and apologize and express some concern and that did n't happen , " Sims said .
" Eugene then was hoping Favre would send him an apology through some sort of correspondence , but that has n't happened , either .
Eugene is still hopeful Favre will apologize to him . "
Favre had only been practicing for 14 days since ending his second retirement to join the Vikings .
He said he was n't trying to injure Wilson and was only trying to help Harvin on the run , and knock a little rust off .
" I will be 40 years old in October and [ was ] weed - eating 13 days ago , " Favre said .
" I was n't thinking about throwing blocks . "
The Vikings finish the preseason Friday night with a home game against the Cowboys .
Favre is not expected to play .

Advertisement President Barack Obama has said he intends " to get something done this year " on healthcare reform .
In an interview for ABC News ahead of his key speech to Congress , he said he was open to new ideas and would not be " rigid or ideological " .
Mr Obama said the speech would offer " a lot of clarity about what I think is the best way to move forward " .
Members of Congress are preparing to fight over the details of the reforms , as they return after the summer recess .
The president is expected to speak about the politically divisive option of having a publicly run insurance scheme .
We 're not being rigid and ideological about this thing , but we do intend to get something done this year
Barack Obama
Are healthcare protests genuine ?
When asked if Americans will find out in his speech whether or not he is willing to sign a healthcare reform bill without a public scheme , he said : " Well , I think the country is going to know exactly what I think will solve our healthcare crisis . "
Mr Obama said the speech will be directed at the American people , as well as members of Congress .
HEALTHCARE IN THE US 46 million uninsured , 25 million under- insured Healthcare costs represent 16 % of GDP , almost twice OECD average Reform plans would require all Americans to get insurance Some propose public insurance option to compete with private insurers
Q&A : US healthcare reform
Anger clouds US healthcare debate " The intent of the speech is to make sure that the American people are clear exactly what it is that we are proposing , " Mr Obama said .
" And B , to make sure that Democrats and Republicans understand that I 'm open to new ideas , that we 're not being rigid and ideological about this thing , but we do intend to get something done this year . "
In the Senate , Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus has drawn up a new compromise proposal .
And in the House of Representatives , a prominent Democrat has signalled he will not support any bill that includes a publicly run insurance scheme .
Passing a healthcare bill is Mr Obama 's top political priority for 2009 .
See how healthcare spending is divided up Earlier in the year he called on both chambers of Congress to pass healthcare bills before the summer recess , so that they could spend the autumn reconciling their different versions .
But neither house met Mr Obama 's deadline , amid disagreements over the specifics of healthcare reform .
Bipartisan
In the Senate , the Health Committee approved a plan that would have forced all Americans to get health insurance , while providing subsidies to the less well - off .
It would also have given Americans without employer - provided coverage the chance to sign up for a new publicly - run insurance scheme , the so - called " public option " .
But the other senate committee with responsibility for health legislation - Mr Baucus 's Finance Committee - was unable to agree on a bill .
Mr Baucus was keen to win support from Republicans as well as Democrats for a bill , but the Republicans on the committee , and some moderate Democrats , objected to the proposals to create a " public option " .
Now , Mr Baucus has drawn up a new " framework for consideration " , without a public option , which he hopes will attract bipartisan support .
In the House of Representatives , Democratic leaders made an informal agreement with moderate Democrats - the so - called " Blue - Dog Democrats " - before the summer recess on a healthcare bill that included a public option .
But one of the architects of the deal , " Blue Dog " Mike Ross , announced on Tuesday that he could no longer support a bill that contained a public option because his constituents appeared to oppose this overwhelmingly .

Eighty billion dollars of WHAT ?
I searched all over the newspapers and TV transcripts and no one asked the President what is probably the most important question of what passes for debate on the issue of health care reform : $ 80 billion of WHAT ?
On June 22 , President Obama said he ’d reached agreement with big drug companies to cut the price of medicine by $ 80 billion .
He extended his gratitude to Big Pharma for the deal that would , “ reduce the punishing inflation in health care costs . ”
Hey , in my neighborhood , people think $ 80 billion is a lot of money .
But is it ?
I checked out the government ’s health stats ( at HHS.gov ) , put fresh batteries in my calculator and toted up US spending on prescription drugs projected by the government for the next ten years .
It added up to $ 3.6 trillion .
In other words , Obama ’s big deal with Big Pharma saves $ 80 billion out of a total $ 3.6 trillion .
That ’s 2 % .
Hey thanks , Barack !
You really stuck it to the big boys .
You saved America from these drug lords robbing us blind .
Two percent .
Cool !
For perspective : Imagine you are in a Wal - Mart and there ’s a sign over a flat screen TV , “ BIG SAVINGS ! ”
So , you break every promise you made never to buy from that union - busting big box — and snatch up the $ 500 television .
And when you ’re caught by your spouse , you say , “ But , honey , look at the deal I got !
It was TWO - PERCENT OFF !
I saved us $ 10 ! ”
But 2 % is better than nothing , I suppose .
Or is it ?
The Big Pharma kingpins did not actually agree to cut their prices .
Their promise with Obama is something a little oilier : they apparently promised that , over ten years , they will reduce the amount at which they would otherwise raise drug prices .
Got that ?
In other words , the Obama deal locks in a doubling of drug costs , projected to rise over the period of “ savings ” from a quarter trillion dollars a year to half a trillion dollars a year .
Minus that 2 % .
We ’ll still get the shaft from Big Pharma , but Obama will have circumcised the increase .
And what did Obama give up in return for $ 80 billion ?
Chief drug lobbyist Billy Tauzin crowed that Obama agreed to dump his campaign pledge to bargain down prices for Medicare purchases .
Furthermore , Obama ’s promise that we could buy cheap drugs from Canada simply went pffft !
What did that cost us ?
The New England Journal of Medicine notes that 13 European nations successfully regulate the price of drugs , reducing the average cost of name - brand prescription medicines by 35 % to 55 % .
Obama gave that up for his 2 % .
The Veterans Administration is able to push down the price it pays for patent medicine by 40 % through bargaining power .
George Bush stopped Medicare from bargaining for similar discounts , an insane ban that Obama said he ’d overturn .
But , once within Tauzin ’s hypnotic gaze , Obama agreed to lock in Bush ’s crazy and costly no -bargaining ban for the next decade .
What else went down in Obama ’s drug deal ?
To find out , I called C - SPAN to get a copy of the videotape of the meeting with the drug companies .
I was surprised to find they did n’t have such a tape despite the President ’s campaign promise , right there on CNN in January 2008 , “ These negotiations will be on C - SPAN . ”
This puzzled me .
When Dick Cheney was caught having secret meetings with oil companies to discuss Bush ’s Energy Bill , we denounced the hugger - muggers as a case of foxes in the henhouse .
Cheney ’s secret meetings with lobbyists and industry bigshots were creepy and nasty and evil .
But the Obama crew ’s secret meetings with lobbyists and industry bigshots were , the President assures us , in the public interest .
We know Cheney ’s secret confabs were shady and corrupt because Cheney scowled out the side of his mouth .
Obama grins in your face .
See the difference ?
The difference is 2 % .
The following clarification was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday 19 August 2009
The article below about a missing cargo ship referred to the Dover straits and the straits of Gibraltar .
Guardian style is strait , singular .
While their Kalashnikov - armed modern peers are running riot off the Horn of Africa , pirates have been absent from the coasts of Europe for hundreds of years .
Now , however , coastguards are investigating what could be the continent 's first significant case of maritime piracy in living memory .
The mystery surrounds the Arctic Sea , a 98 - metre Russian - crewed cargo ship that set off from Finland on 23 July carrying timber worth about £ 1 m , bound for the Algerian port of Bejaia .
In the early hours of the next morning , in the Baltic Sea near the Swedish island of Oland , the ship was boarded by up to 10 armed men dressed in police uniforms , according to reports from the Russian news agency Tass .
The raiders tied up the crew as they searched the vessel and stole a few items , including a satellite phone , before leaving in their rubber dingy .
Three crew members were reportedly injured .
Curiously , the attack did not seem to be reported immediately , and only emerged 10 days later when Interpol issued an alert .
By this time the Maltese - registered ship had vanished .
Its last confirmed contact with the outside world came just before 3 pm UK time on 29 July , when it radioed British coastguards to say it was in the Dover straits and heading for Algeria .
Signals from the ship 's automatic identification system ( AIS ) beacon confirmed the position .
" That 's all they said – where they were and where they were going , " said Mark Clark , of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency .
" They did n't mention anything about having been boarded or hijacked , which would seem a bit curious .
If they had been tied up by pirates you 'd have thought they might have mentioned it . "
According to websites that monitor live AIS signals , the Arctic Sea , built in 1992 and owned by a Finnish company , disappeared from tracking systems in the early hours of 30 July off the northern French port of Brest .
This did not necessarily mean the system was turned off , as tracking coverage can be patchy .
The ship was later spotted by a patrol aircraft off the Portuguese coast , Clark said .
And then , nothing – the ship and its crew seemingly disappeared into thin air .
The vessel was due at Bejaia more than a week ago , but never arrived .
Spanish reports say it was never seen passing the Straits of Gibraltar , meaning it could have been taken down the west coast of Africa .
The Russian navy has sent ships from its Black Sea fleet to the Atlantic to hunt for the Arctic Sea , according to the country 's defence ministry , while Portugal is carrying out its own search .
" We do n't know what has happened , but it is possible the ship was attacked by pirates , " said a spokesman at the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Lisbon .
" We are searching with planes and boats , but so far there is no sign of it . "
The call to British coastguards was a mystery , Clark said .
" It seems possible that the hijackers could still be on board .
Even if they are not , at the very least a large ship has apparently gone missing , which is unusual enough .
It is possible that the person who spoke was either a pirate or a member of the crew speaking under duress . "
Inevitably , a number of alternative theories have sprung up , including the notion that criminal gangs or someone connected to the crew had been smuggling drugs or another illegal consignment amid the timber .
Russian maritime officials have dismissed any notion of crew complicity , saying those on board were experienced and trusted .
If the case does turn out to be piracy , it would be an unprecedented situation , according to Jeremy Harrison , from the UK's Chamber of Shipping .
" It 's extraordinary .
This just does n't happen .
These are heavily patrolled waters , " he said .
If boarders had turned off the AIS signal , finding the vessel could prove hard , Harrison added .
" It can take a long time even to find boats in trouble , even when the general location is known .
If the vessel is still afloat and is trying to hide – well , it 's a big ocean . "
FightBackH1N1
Wednesday , Sept 23rd , 2009
New York :
According to the CDC , the following states have implemented legal actions in response to the H1N1 virus :
Florida – the Florida surgeon general suspended distribution permit requirements Florida statutes to allow wholesale distribution of Tamiflu and Relenza .
The state has also distributed a series of blank quarantine order forms , including a voluntary home quarantine agreement , a quarantine to residence order , a quarantine to residence order ( non-compliance ) , a quarantine to facility order , quarantine detention order , quarantine of facility order , building quarantine closure order and area quarantine closure order .
Iowa –
In addition to the facility quarantine order listed above , Iowa has also made available forms for voluntary home confinement , home quarantine and home isolation .
Massachusetts – Massachusetts lists its own procedures for isolation and quarantine .
North Carolina – The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services released a draft isolation order that would provide for imprisonment for up to two years and pretrial detention without bail for any citizen who fails to comply with an isolation order .
Washington – Washington grants authority to local health officers to issue emergency detention orders causing citizens to be immediately and involuntarily isolated or quarantined for up to 10 days .
In addition , governors and health commissioners in the following states have declared a state of emergency since April following concerns about the H1N1 virus : California , Florida , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Nebraska , New York , Ohio , Texas , Virginia and Wisconsin .
Clearly this has nothing to do with public health and the qualitative ethical practice of medicine .
What about all the people who already had swine flu ?
Those people , who have already built natural immunity , if forced to quarantine in close quarters with a bunch of other people who may have other types of infectious diseases such as seasonal flu , etc. , then become exposed to other infectious diseases and are at greater health risk .
This seems like a great plan to help SPREAD whatever disease (s ) they want to spread !

How I Converted My Mercedes - Benz To Run On Veggie Oil
Lessons learned from my conversion of a 1984 Mercedes into a grease - mobile
There was a time when publishing a blog post was easy .
Just a few notes , jotted in a rush , a quick spell checking and then hit “ Publish ” .
Well , it ’s not anymore .
At least for me .
Besides the psychological benefits of “ letting it all out ” , a blog post has a much higher purpose .
Again , at least for me .
On this blog alone , I have more than 300 blog posts published .
I guess that somewhere around blog post number 200 , I came out with a personal filter .
A quality assurance system , if you want .
At some point , just publishing whatever crossed my mind was not enough anymore , I needed something meaningful .
Something that would create an impact , that would represent myself more than just random thoughts , rants or memories .
So , every time I am ready to hit the “ Publish ” button , I stop and look over those 7 questions .
If the answer to all is “ Yes ” , I go ahead and let the blog post fly .
If not , I move the post to the Drafts folder and move on .
1. Is It Useful ?
Is this post actually changing something in my reality ?
Is something that I need to do ?
Sharing this will make a significant impact in my existence ?
Is there any way in which this blog post will improve my life ?
Answering “ Yes ” to these questions is the fundamental step .
Of course , I usually use the short version : “ Is It Useful ? ”
This puts blogging in a wider perspective .
It ’s not only a safety valve , ready to throw out a lot of internal garbage , shamelessly polluting the blogging ocean , it ’s a way to make a difference , to create a better version of you .
If you just need a place to puke your mental nausea , just keep a private journal , that will certainly help .
But if you let something out in the wild , you ’d better make it count .
Make it important for yourself .
Make it something you would be proud of .
If you post it just to have something out there in the blog , you ’d better stop .
It wo n’t make any difference , if you do n’t really need it .
2. Is It True ?
Every time I think of a blog post , I wonder if it ’s something true .
Or at least something that I can vouch for as being true .
It must be something coming from my own experience .
I think this is the fundamental difference between the new media , including the blogging phenomenon , and traditional media .
In blogging , everything you said is marked with your own touch .
It ’s your own take at things .
It ’s personal .
Even if you talk about some specific news in an industry , adding your own point of view is what makes the blog post worthwhile .
And I think I ’m using the word “ true ” mostly as “ authentic ” .
If it ’s not something true , authentic , the blog post will be melting pretty soon .
As opposed to the traditional media , when the bare information , served quickly , is what matters , in blogging there ’s your own point of view related to something of interest that ’s going to promote your message .
And the best thing you can do is to write from personal experience .
3. Is It Understandable ?
That question is about how the blog post is written .
Is it clearly outlined ?
The sentences are flowing nicely from one each other ?
Is it clearly described ?
It ’s easy to read ?
The topic is clear ?
All those questions combined are giving the level of understandability .
If I have trouble understanding what I wrote , I usually delete the whole thing .
Human brain is a fantastic machinery , but as with all machinery , you have to touch the right handles to get the best response .
If you want to engage your reader ’s brain , you have to send the right messages .
You have to combine bare definitions with images and metaphors .
You have to balance right brain and left brain triggers .
Making something understandable is not an easy task .
But it ’s a very rewarding one .
And the good news is that once you engage on this path , you ’ll become better and better at making things understandable .
That in itself it ’s a fantastic asset in any area of your life , not only blogging .
4. Does Anybody Else Besides Me Need
This ?
Are there any other persons who may benefit form it ?
A very personal story is not always a motivating story .
It might be interesting to read but after reading , there ’s not much to benefit from it .
A blog post should enrich in some way other people too , otherwise , like for the first question , you ’ll be much better keeping a private journal .
Many successful bloggers are covering this question with the sentence “ write for your readers ” .
To a certain degree , I agree .
You have to keep in mind your readers needs , goals or specific attitudes .
But more than that , you have to write something that other people will find beneficialÂ in some way .
It does n’t always have to be something funny .
You can make your readers benefit from your writing even if you shake them a little .
In fact , shaking them – as in shaking their beliefs , theirs ideas and their attitudes – will give them much more value than a funny picture .
They may hate you in the beginning but they ’ll thank you later .
5 . Is It Shareable ?
Will your readers feel the need to forward your blog post to other people ?
That ’s one tricky question and I admit I struggled a lot with it in the beginning .
There does n’t seemed to be a clear model for a blog post to be shared and turned into a viral message .
But after a while , I discovered some patterns .
First of all , in order to be shared by a lot of people , the blog post must respond a big “ Yes ” to the first 4 questions .
But even if it does , this is not enough .
To be shareable , a blog post must be more than useful for you , authentic , understandable and useful for your readers .
It must be written in a certain way .
And that way is something that will make the sharer look great .
This time is not about you , it ’s about the reader .
If your blog post will make him look ( or be ) like a smart , wit or knowledgeable person , he ’ll share it .
And he ’ll be happy to do it .
6. Is It Easy Findable ?
But besides word of mouth , which is the most powerful way to be promoted , by the way , your blog post must be found in other ways too .
The most popular is search engine .
So , before publishing I take some time to do a quick SEO survey on my blog .
I do n’t try to impersonate the Google bot , and for the sake of your mental health , I do n’t advice you to do that either .
What I do , is to verify if there ’s enough of a connection between the main topic and the words distribution .
This does n’t involve any complicated math calculus or tools , just a bird - eye read and simple analysis .
It ’s just like reading it with a simple SEO filter .
Places where I look for SEO hooks are usually ( and in this order ) : post title , post slug , headlines and paragraphs .
If there is enough wording matching the idea , I will publish , if not , I make the necessary adjustments , most of the time using synonyms or replacing some parts of the phrases .
Alternatively , you can use a plugin like this : Scribe SEO Plugin .
7. Did I Enjoy Reading It ?
Being the first reader of my blog means also I am the first – and the worst – censor .
If I simply do n’t like something I wrote , I simply do n’t publish .

The following information is based on a lecture at Binghamton University on September 17th , 2009 by physician and nutrition expert Dr. Michael Greger .
He has been published in several academic journals and is the author of two books titled , “ Bird Flu : A Virus Of Our Own Hatching , ” and , “ Carbophobia : The Scary Truth About America ’s Low - carb Craze . ”
Over the past year Dr. Greger has paid close attention to recent findings in diet and nutrition and was kind enough to share some of these important findings and insights with Binghamton students and faculty members .
The theme of his talk was “ Optimum Nutrition 2009 , ” and focuses on a switch towards a more plant - based diet for Americans .
You can read more about Dr. Greger at his official website .
( Also , be sure to attend one of his events if he comes to a place near you , as he is an internationally recognized public speaker and an incredibly fun guy to be around ) .
1. AMERICANS CONSUME TOO MUCH ANIMAL PROTEIN
One of Greger ’s biggest critiques on the current eating habits of Americans is that we eat too much animal protein .
Why is this a bad thing ?
Because an increase in animal protein intake correlates with higher cholesterol , higher blood pressure , and a greater risk of heart disease – one of the top killers in America next to cancer .
Over consumption of red meats like beef can have an especially detrimental effect on our cholesterol levels and overall health .
One recent study showed that when pregnant women consumed more beef that it negatively affected the sexual development of males in the womb .
Solution : According to Dr. Greger , scientific evidence suggests that the healthiest way to eat is a vitamin - rich diet of whole plant foods .
For optimum nutrition , Greger suggests that we include an array of whole grains , beans , nuts , seeds , fruit , and as many vegetables as you can eat , but also specifically dark greeny leafy vegetables , berries , and green ( or white ) tea .
One of the best reasons to switch to a plant foods diet is that most meals will be low in calories ( especially when compared to meals with animal meat ) , but at the same time more nutritious in vitamins and minerals .
We eat less , but still replenish our bodily functions and energize our bodies .
On a side note , many may worry that a switch to a more plant - based diet may result in a lack of protein , but many nuts and vegetables provide plenty so that a dieter should not have to resort to protein supplements .
2. AMERICANS DON’T EAT THE RIGHT VEGETABLES ( IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CANCER )
Even when Americans do eat their veggies they still are n’t making the best choices .
Among the most popular plants consumed in the west – tomatoes , lettuce , potatoes , and spinach – none of these are particularly good at fighting cancer as other alternatives in eastern countries .
Again , perhaps these eating habits shed some light on why cancer ( and other medical illnesses ) is growing so prevalent in the United States .
Solution : Vegetables that have shown to be better cancer fighters are cabbage , soy , ginger , and umbelliferous vegetables such as carrots , celery , cilantro , parsley and parsnip .
The number one rated fighter against cancer was garlic .
3. AMERICANS TOO OFTEN CHOOSE CONVENIENCE OVER CONSCIOUS -EATING
It is far easier for a busy mother or college student to go to a fast food restaurant – or resort to some other convenient fatty food – than to prepare a healthy meal .
This is part of a growing problem .
It is n’t that Americans do n’t understand what constitutes good eating , only that we have become complacent in continuing our bad habits .
Solution :
If we want to change our diet then we need to become more aware of how we choose our meals when we choose them .
It requires our conscious effort .
Our diets already fluctuate subtly from week - to - week , but by shedding a greater awareness on what we eat as we eat it we can begin to take greater control over our diet , and hopefully move it in a more positive direction .
What I call “ conscious eating ” includes looking into the nutritional facts of what we are consuming on a day - to - day basis , making incremental changes over time , and maintaining the will to eat and live healthier .
4. IMPORTANT MICRONUTRIENTS
TO PAY ATTENTION TO
Dr. Greger also recommends these important micronutrients ( some of whose needs can be fulfilled in our food and others which may require supplements ) .
A. Vitamin B12 ( at least 2000μg each week – ideally as a chewable , sublingual , or liquid supplement ) .
B. Omega -3 Fatty Acids ( 250 mg daily of algae - derived DHA ) .
C. Vitamin D ( most of which can be absorbed by the sun during summer months , but may require a 4,000 IU supplement during the winter ) .
D. Calcium ( most greens are rich in calcium except spinach , chard , and beet greens , recommended 600 mg daily ) .
E. Iodine ( for those who do n’t eat seaweed or iodized salt , a 150μg daily supplement should be sufficient ) .
F. Iron ( especially for menstruating women but men should check for an iron overload disease before any attempt to increase intake ) .
G. Selenium ( Northern Europeans may need to take a supplement or eat about 20 Brazil nuts a month ) .
FINAL WORDS ON HEALTHY EATING
Diets do not change overnight ; they take time and sustained effort .
This does not mean that changing one ’s eating habits is an exhausting process , but that it is something that needs to be on your mind whenever you are planning to eat .
The core lesson of Dr. Greger ’s lecture is that by switching from a dependency on animal protein to a more plant - based diet we can simultaneously tackle a wide variety of health issues that are linked to poor eating habits .
Optimally , Greger recommends we rid our diets of animal protein completely ; but realistically , any change from less animal meat to more plant foods will probably have a positive affect on our health .

The skull of R. kriegsteini is dwarfed by the skull of a full - sized descendant
A 3m - long dinosaur fossil from China which predates T. rex by 60 million years is a blueprint for the mighty carnivore , say researchers .
They tell Science magazine that the fossil displays the same features as T. rex but in miniature .
The new species , Raptorex kriegsteini , would have weighed around 65 kg ; its descendants were 90 times as massive .
Scientists believe it could be the " missing link " between earlier species of dinosaur and T. rex .
The 125 - million - year - old specimen suggests that T. rex 's characteristic big head with enhanced jaw , relatively small forearms and huge back legs were inherited from this much smaller dinosaur , and that the body type changed little over millions of years except in size .
Long - armed relatives
In the past 10 years , fossils from earlier and more primitive species have been discovered in rocks between 100 and 176 million years old ( Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Periods ) in Europe , North America and China .
In short , much of what we thought we know about tyrannosaur evolution turns out to be either simplistic or out - and - out wrong
Stephen Brusatte , American Museum of Natural History
These previous finds have confirmed that the Tyrannosaur family of dinosaurs is descended from small - bodied , long - armed predecessors .
But there has been little evidence of a direct link between these relatively small dinosaurs and the massive fossils of T. rex .
The team believes that Raptorex kriegsteini is that link .
It looks identical to a big T. rex , even down to the shape of the skull with its enlarged olfactory bulbs , which would have given it the same acute sense of smell as T. rex .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Lead researcher Dr Paul Sereno , from the University of Chicago , said : " It 's as close to the proverbial missing link on a lineage as we might ever get for T. rex .
" From the teeth to the enlarged jaw muscles , the enlarged head , the small forelimbs , the lanky , running , long hind - limbs with the compressed foot for hunting prey : we see this all , to our great surprise , in an animal that is basically the body weight of a human or 1/90th the size that ultimately this lineage would reach in T. rex at the end of the Cretaceous . "
Theory overturned
The team believes that the new fossil completely overturns accepted opinion on the evolution of tyrannosaurs .
Until now it had been thought that their strange body shape evolved as a consequence of their large size .
The fossil record bears out the previous theory that as tyrannosaurs developed truly giant size over time , they needed to modify their entire skeletons so they could continue to function as a predators as they grew .
According to co-author Stephen Brusatte of the American Museum of Natural History in New York : " Raptorex , the new species , really throws a wrench into this observed pattern .
The animal was entombed at the edge of a lake in north east China " Here we have an animal that 's 1/90th or 1/100th of the size of T. rex , about my size , but with all the signature features - the big head , the strong muscles , the tiny little arms - that were thought to be necessary adaptations for a large body predator .
" So really we can say that these features did not evolve as a consequence of large body size but rather that they evolved as an efficient set of predatory weapons in an animal that was just 1/100th of the size of T. rex and that lived 60 million years before T. rex . "
The fossil record tells us that tyrannosaurs only grew to huge sizes during the final 20 million years of the Cretaceous .
Dr Brusatte said : " So that means that for most of their evolutionary history , about 80 % of the time that they were on Earth , tyrannosaurs were small animals that lived in the shadow of other types of very large dinosaur predators .
" In short , much of what we thought we know about tyrannosaur evolution turns out to be either simplistic or out - and - out wrong . "
Fossil hunter Dr Sereno estimates that this specimen of Raptorex kriegsteini was a young adult when it died .
The team made casts of the bones and reconstructed the animal as they believe it would have appeared .
They think it would have been 1 m high and that it would have had similar feathers to an ostrich .
It would have preyed on small birds and other smaller scampering animals that lived around the lake beds where it was discovered .
The forearm of raptorex is a blueprint for that of an adult T Rex
The researchers say that fragments of sand and sediment on the skeleton indicate that it came from an area of northeastern China rich in fossils .
It was dug up illicitly and spirited out of the country and ultimately sold .
It is named after Henry Kriegstein , a private collector , who bought it from a dealer .
He contacted Dr Sereno three years ago , asked him to analyse the specimen , and agreed to give it back to science and ultimately to China .
It is now in a museum in Inner Mongolia .
Mr Kriegstein is a co-author on the paper .
Dr Sereno said : " I hope this is a pathway that other important specimens will follow .
" This is more than just a Chinese specimen .
It has given us some real insights into our own tyrannosaurs here in North America .
So it really belongs to science .
It belongs to the world . "

What the hell ?
To say I was disappointed is an understatement .
After finishing the Maryann story about 25 minutes into the episode in a most anticlimactic fashion , we were treated to 30 minutes of an awkward amalgamation of essentially ... nothing .
The Maryann story has by far been the weak link this season and it was glaring in the season finale .
The writers could no longer play around with sex , so they did what they do best - play around .
There was a random ostrich egg , more crazy people , and a manga - like conclusion ending with the visually engaging goring of Maryann .
In the beginning of the season , Maryann was very interesting ; we did n't know what she was or what she could do .
People were doing weird things , but we did n't know why .
We did n't learn anything new until past halfway and by then , her antics became boring .
Hopefully next season gets better and does n't try the ' Big Bad ' thing a la Buffy .
Eric was conspicuously absent other than the totally random scene where he played Yahtzee with the Queen of Louisiana .
Jason blew out Egg 's brains in disturbing fashion which should have an impact on next season .
Sam is looking for his real parents , Jessica is now out killing people , and Hoyt grew some balls , and the people of Bon Temps are as stupid as ever .
The only thing that piqued my interest was Bill being kidnapped at the end of the episode .
Yes , I know he proposed to Sookie who almost said no , but it came across as so saccharine it reached a pathetic level .
The viewership has increased drastically this season , but I think season 1 was much better .
I hope season 3 turns out better , and it seems Alan Ball is starting to deviate from the books significantly which I think is the best direction .
Until next year ...

Review - True Blood Season 2 Episode 9 I Will Rise Up
The founder of one of Brazil 's biggest evangelical churches siphoned off billions of dollars in donations from his mostly poor followers to buy jewelry , TV stations and other businesses for himself , authorities charged .
A Brazilian judge accepted charges from prosecutors alleging that Bishop Edir Macedo and nine other people linked to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God committed fraud against the church itself and against its numerous followers .
Sao Paulo state 's prosecutors office alleged in a statement that Macedo and the others took more than $ 2 billion in donations from 2003 to 2008 alone , but charged that the alleged scheme went back 10 years .

Church lawyer Arthur Lavigne told the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that the accused denied any wrongdoing .
Church officials did not respond to attempts to reach them by phone and e-mail .
Prosecutors said the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God receives nearly $ 800 million in donations every year from faithful in 4,500 temples across Brazil .
The church claims to have nearly 8 million followers in Brazil and many more around the world .
Prosecutors said the church tells its members it needs donations — cash , checks , cars and other goods — to finance new temples and to pay for religious programs on radio and TV .
The church allegedly used fake companies to launder the money , moving the assets abroad and then returning them in the form of loans used by Macedo and his accomplices to buy businesses , prosecutors said .
" There is proof that the money from the donations was used to attend to the personal interests of those being accused " and that they took advantage that the donations were not taxed to make investments in personal business , the prosecutors ' statement said .
Macedo , who founded the church in 1977 , owns a large television network , three newspapers and several radio stations .
He also owns a tourism agency and an air taxi company .
In the early 1990s , the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God was investigated for embezzlement and tax evasion , but nothing was ever proven and the church grew stronger .
Brazil is the world 's largest Roman Catholic country , but recently the number of evangelicals has grown significantly among its population of about 190 million people .
Economists have finally proved what most of us have suspected for a long time — when it comes to apologising , talk is cheap .
According to new research , firms that simply say sorry to disgruntled customers fare better than those that offer financial compensation .
The ploy works even though the recipient of the apology seldom gets it from the person who made it necessary in the first place .
The study was carried out by the Nottingham School of Economics ’ Centre for Decision Research and Experimental Economics .
Academics set out to show whether customers who have been let down continue to do business after being offered an apology .
They found people are more than twice as likely to forgive a company that says sorry than one that instead offers them cash .
NSE research fellow and study co-author Dr Johannes Abeler said the results proved apologies were both powerful and cheap .
He said : “ We know firms often employ professional apologists whose job is to say sorry to customers who have a grievance .
“ You might think that if the apology is costless then customers would ignore it as nothing but cheap talk – which is what it is .
But this research shows apologies really do influence customers ’ behaviour — surprisingly , much more so than a cash sweetener .
“ People do n’t seem to realise they ’re dealing with an expert apologist rather than an individual who feels genuine shame .
“ It might be that saying sorry triggers in the customer an instinct to forgive — an instinct that ’s hard to overcome rationally . ”
Researchers worked with a firm responsible for around 10,000 sales a month on eBay , controlling its reaction to neutral or negative feedback .
Some customers were offered an apology in return for withdrawing their comments , while others were offered ? 2.5 or ?5 .
The simple apology blamed the manufacturer for a delay in delivery , adding : “ We are very sorry and want to apologise for this . ”
Customers offered money were told : “ As a goodwill gesture , we can offer you ? 5 if you would consider withdrawing your evaluation . ”
Because customers had no idea they were taking part in the experiment , their behaviour was completely natural and unaffected .
Some 45 % of participants withdrew their evaluation in light of the apology , while only 23 % agreed in return for compensation .
The study also discovered that a higher purchase price further reduced the number of customers willing to forgive for cash .
Yet the size of the initial outlay had no effect on the willingness of participants to settle for simply reading the magic words : “ I ’m sorry . ”
Dr Abeler , an expert in behavioural economics , said : “ It ’s interesting to note our setting should have made it hard for an apology to work .
“ The apology was delivered by a large , anonymous firm and was n’t face - to - face , and the firm had a clear incentive to apologise .
“ All of this meant the apology should have been regarded by the customers as calculated , insincere and just cheap talk .
Yet it still yielded much better outcomes than offering cash compensation ?
and our results might even underestimate its effects . ”
The Nottingham School of Economics , based at the University of Nottingham , is regarded as one of the UK ’s leading research departments .
Its economists have advised organisations including the Treasury , the World Bank , the IMF and the Department for Work and Pensions .
Notes to editors : The Nottingham School of Economics at The University of Nottingham has earned a world - class reputation for its research on a broad range of economic subjects , particularly globalisation , experimental economics and time - series econometrics .
Its standing among the elite economics departments in the UK was reinforced by the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise , which ranked its ‘ research power ’ among the top three in the country .
The measurement of ‘ research power ’ takes into account not only the quality of research but , crucially , the number of staff put forward for inclusion in the RAE .
To underline the strength and depth of its work , the School put forward every member of its staff .
All of its research was classed as of international quality , and 85 per cent was defined as ‘ world - leading or ‘ internationally excellent ’ ?
the top two possible ratings .
The School has almost 50 full - time academic staff and 800 undergraduate , 80 Masters and 70 full - time PhD students .
The University of Nottingham is ranked in the UK’s Top 10 and the World ’s Top 100 universities by the Shanghai Jiao Tong ( SJTU ) and Times Higher ( THE ) World University Rankings .
More than 90 per cent of research at The University of Nottingham is of international quality , according to RAE 2008 , with almost 60 per cent of all research defined as ‘ world - leading ’ or ‘ internationally excellent ’ .
Research Fortnight analysis of RAE 2008 ranks the University 7th in the UK by research power .
In 27 subject areas , the University features in the UK Top Ten , with 14 of those in the Top Five .
The University provides innovative and top quality teaching , undertakes world - changing research , and attracts talented staff and students from 150 nations .
Described by The Times as Britain ’s “ only truly global university ” , it has invested continuously in award - winning campuses in the United Kingdom , China and Malaysia .
Twice since 2003 its research and teaching academics have won Nobel Prizes .
The University has won the Queen ’s Award for Enterprise in both 2006 ( International Trade ) and 2007 ( Innovation — School of Pharmacy ) , and was named ‘ Entrepreneurial University of the Year ’ at the Times Higher Education Awards 2008 .
Nottingham was designated as a Science City in 2005 in recognition of its rich scientific heritage , industrial base and role as a leading research centre .

I know you must be wondering what sort of sites I like going on other than this one .
I have over 10 sites that I visit daily for TV information , but I have singled out 5 sites that you can't miss .
5. Sci Fi Wire
Basically any show under the wide purview of " scifi " is covered on this site , so the shows include Medium and Ghost Whisperer which have scifi elements , but normally would not be considered with Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica .
This allows for a huge coverage in the number of shows .
The site has lots of spoilers not on any site , and lots of interesting articles .
I know you might be wondering why Sci Fi Wire instead of io9 , but I have a simple reason : io9 has too much non -TV content .
4. TV Spoilers Center
I would n't necessarily classify this as a spoiler site , but more of a trailer site .
It has the fastest updated promos and sneak peaks for next weeks ' episodes .
It 's a nice site if you do n't want to continuously scour Youtube and other video sites .
The site may be in Spanish , but there 's nothing to read anyways , just videos and photos .
3. TV by the Numbers
If you love reading about ratings like I do , TVBTN is the best site to do it .
Not only does it have the overnights posted quickly , it also has great analysis of the numbers .
I find the site has many great commentators which is always a pleasure to read .
If you want to learn about TV ratings , this is the site to start .
The guys running the blog read the comments and answer questions efficiently , and you can learn a lot just be reading the posts .
2. Spoiler TV
If you 're spoiler junkie like I am , you should be hanging around this site as often as possible .
It has spoilers for every scripted show out there and is updated very often .
The site has original exclusive content , and content from many different sources .
It may be faster to go to the original sources , but for pure aggregation from a number of sites that would take you too long to access , this is the best site out there .
1. Television Without Pity
This site is by far the best television sites out there .
It has extremely detailed recaps of many shows old , and new written by very good writers .
Initially , I wanted this blog to be like TWoP with detailed recaps , but I stopped that idea when I realized it would take to long , so I turned to reviewing the episodes .
They have some nice blogs that are always fun to read and provide up to date information on the TV world .
Probably my favorite feature of the site is the photo galleries .
They have a huge range of categories and provide substantial text to go along with the photos .
Father shows off device he dug up in back garden ... unaware it's an unexploded anti-tank grenade
A father - of - two posed for photographs unaware he was holding a live Second World War anti-tank grenade after digging it up in his back garden .
Paul Davies , 32 , found the undetonated bomb and thought it was part of an old lawn mower or machine .
He took it into his house , where his friend used a camera phone to take a picture of him joking and holding the eight - inch device .
Explosive : Paul Davies , 32 , poses with the anti-tank grenade he dug up in his back garden .
Twelve nearby homes were evacuated after he realised what it was
Mr Davies , a window cleaner , then placed it near his sink next to some washing up where it sat for more than two hours .
But later in the morning he had a ' bad feeling ' and after checking the internet , he realised the rusty lump of metal was an anti-tank grenade .
He threw it into his back garden and called police , who evacuated 12 nearby homes and summoned bomb disposal experts .
They set up a 100 metre exclusion zone around the house before taking the bomb - which was still live - to a nearby field to blow it up .
Mr Davies , of Exeter , Devon , said : ' I could n't believe what was happening .
I dug this thing up and it looked like a part of some old machine .
' I took it inside so I could show the kids when they came home from school and my mate took a photo of me for a laugh and I put it down the side .
' A bit later on I suddenly thought it might be dangerous and had a look on the internet .
I said " I think it 's a bomb " .
' I can't believe I had it in my hand and was posing for a picture .
The bomb team told me it was still live . '
Lucky escape :
The unexploded grenade next to the sink .
Bomb disposal experts safely detonated it in a nearby field
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said the anti-tank grenade was detonated by experts at 12.50 pm on Friday .
He said : ' The bomb disposal team took it away and blew it up .
We visited homeowners and asked them to leave their houses to retreat behind a cordon .
Twelve properties were affected . '
Mr Davies added : ' It was n't buried that deep in the earth .
I 've asked around and apparently the guy who used to live here years ago had an air raid shelter .
' It must have been buried then .
I 'm glad I did n't hit it with my spade when I dug it up - it could have been kaboom . '
IF YOU want to save money , cut the cord .
In these difficult times ever more Americans are heeding this advice and dropping their telephone landlines in favour of mobile phones ( see article ) .
Despite some of the flakiest mobile - network coverage in the developed world , one in four households has now gone mobile - only .
At current rates the last landline in America will be disconnected sometime in 2025 .
Good .
Mobile phones offer individuals more freedom .
Yet confronted by the inexorable march of progress , America 's telecoms regulators have failed to respond .
In many ways the landline network is still an essential utility .
Maintaining landline networks provides thousands of jobs ( the landline operators support more pensioners than even the car industry does ) .
Landlines are the platform for many public services , such as emergency response .
And taxes on landlines are the basis of the complex system of subsidies to ensure universal service , meaning an affordable phone line for all .
The phone network is thus not just a technical infrastructure , but a socioeconomic one .
The more Americans abandon it to go mobile - only or make phone calls over the internet , the more fragile it becomes : its high fixed costs have to be spread over ever fewer subscribers .
If the telephone network in New York State were a stand - alone business , it would already be in bankruptcy .
In recent years it has lost 40 % of its landlines and revenues have dropped by more than 30 % .
But copper landlines are now an obsolete technology .
Telephony , once the mainstay of the industry , is just one service that can be offered over broadband connections , which will increasingly depend on new fibre - optic and wireless technology , not copper .
Rather than trying to keep a 19th - century technology alive , America 's telecoms rules must be updated to foster the roll - out of this new , 21st - century infrastructure .
Alas , attempts to reform the notoriously bureaucratic Universal Service Fund , the main source of subsidies to make landlines affordable , have gone nowhere .
Everyone agrees on the importance of expanding access to broadband — until it is time to hammer out the specific details .
Now Barack Obama wants a national strategy .
He would do well to concentrate on two things his country needs in the future , not the past : better and more reliable wireless coverage ; and more broadband connections , through fibre - optic cables and high - speed wireless links ( for both voice and data ) .
America ranks 15th in broadband penetration among OECD countries .
Kept on hold
America 's advantage is that so many people have gone before it .
To extend wireless coverage to rural areas , where subsidies are inevitable , India has an elegant reverse - auction scheme , under which the supplier who asks for least cash to supply a particular area wins the contract .
With broadband networks , the role of the state has less to do with limiting handouts than increasing choice .
Fibre - optic networks can be run like any other public infrastructure : government , municipalities or utilities lay the cables and let private firms compete to offer services , just as public roadways are used by private logistics firms .
In Stockholm , a pioneer of this system , it takes 30 minutes to change your broadband provider .
Australia 's new $ 30 billion all - fibre network will use a similar model .
There are hard choices for Mr Obama 's people to make — but sticking with old rules devised for copper wires is not one of them .
Prisoners at Her Majesty ’s Prison The Verne , Portland , Dorset , England had their swine flu gel withdrawn after officers discovered they were drinking it and getting drunk .
Instead of rubbing the gel into their hands , prisoners had been wrapping their lips around the dispenser outlets and consuming it only hours after the dispensers were installed .
The liquid soap - gel contains alcohol .
According to various reports from the UK press , a prisoner became aggressive after consuming the gel and eventually got into a fist - fight with a fellow inmate .
However , the BBC reported on 25th September that reports of a fight are incorrect .
The prison governor ordered the immediate withdrawal of all the dispensers from the prison .
The dispensers were installed as a measure to combat the spread of swine flu .
However , according to a source at the Verne Prison , it was not long before inmates “ starting drinking the stuff ” .
Nearby Dorset County Hospital , Dorchester , had recently removed the same gel after vagrants wandered in and began drinking it .
According to Peter McParlin , of the Prison Officers Association ( POA ) , the local POA had warned senior prison management that giving prisoners access to products containing alcoholic gel might not be a wise move .
McParlin said that concern had been raised with the Prison Governor beforehand .
Reports say that some prisoners mixed the gel with a drink before consuming it .
The Verne Prison has been in existence since 1949 on the site of a former military barracks .
It is a Category C Training Prison for adult males .
According to the prison ’s website “ The population consists of life sentence prisoners and determinate sentenced prisoners , many serving four years or over . ”
The Health Protection Agency , UK , reports that the number of people becoming infected with H1N1 swine flu is continuing to increase , especially among school - aged children .
Rates are below the normal winter seasonal baseline thresholds in England , Wales and Scotland , but are above newly defined provisional threshold levels in Northern Ireland .
Over the last week the estimated number of new infections stands at 9,000 ; up from an estimated 5,000 during the previous week .
The European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CMPH ) has issued a positive opinion and recommends approval for GlaxoSmithKline ’s candidate pandemic ( H1N1 swine flu ) adjuvanted vaccine PandemrixTM .
The indication for the vaccine is for protection against pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza .
The regulators agree that PandemrixTM can be used in adults , pregnant women and children over six months old .

Military readies checkpoints for swine flu pandemic after citizens are acclimated to accept presence of uniformed soldiers undertaking law enforcement duties
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , September 23 , 2009
Under the pretext of “ helping ” local communities short of police in difficult economic times , as well as preparations for a potential swine flu pandemic , U.S. troops are now occupying America as the country sinks into a state of de facto martial law .
We have been inundated with reports over the last few weeks of uniformed soldiers and National Guardsmen running internal checkpoints all over the country as a frightening “ Red Dawn ” scenario unfolds not with a bang but with a whimper .
The military are now being called upon to undertake roles normally designated to police as Americans are incrementally acclimated to accept the presence of troops on the streets as an everyday occurrence .
The latest case occurred in Kingman Arizona , where National Guardsmen were filmed “ providing security ” and directing traffic .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Another similar example occurred in Newport Kentucky earlier this month when military checkpoints suddenly appeared downtown on September 6 .
Military Police from the U.S. Army National as well as Marines were purportedly conducting “ traffic control ” because the city was strapped for funds and did not have enough police to do the job .
The excuse that troops are stepping in to help because there is a lack of police does n’t wash .
Crime is down over the last 20 years , there are around three times more police and the state is not calling out the National Guard , they are being put on the streets as a result of the harmonization of police and military , a process that has been ongoing for decades , long before the economic recession hit .
Troops also have guns and their primary function is to search people and vehicles , not direct traffic .
Members of the WeAreChange Ohio group interviewed some of the troops , who when asked if they would be prepared to “ confiscate guns , shoot resisters in the back of the head , or throw people into ovens to incinerate bodies , ” refused to categorically deny that they would follow such orders .
Watch the video below .
However , this was by no means the first time that troops have been used to fulfil roles normally ascribed to police in Kentucky .
During the Kentucky Derby on May 2 this year , Military Police were on patrol to deal with crowd control .
An Associated Press photograph shows armed MP ’s detaining a man who ran onto the track following the 135th Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs .
“ The military has NO BUSINESS policing the citizens except during extraordinarily exceptional times of national emergency by an executive order .
This is very disturbing and completely un-American .
Maybe even more disturbing is that no one seems to care how quietly and easily we have accepted the burgeoning police state , ” one respondent to the photo stated .
As we reported last year , U.S. troops returning from Iraq are now occupying America , running checkpoints and training to deal with “ civil unrest and crowd control ” under the auspices of a Northcom program that by 2011 will have no less than 20,000 active duty troops deployed inside America to “ help ” state and local officials during times of emergency .
Over the course of the last couple of years , we have reported on numerous instances of military involvement with local law enforcement in violation of Posse Comitatus .
In January , soldiers from the Virginia National Guard .
Soldiers from the Lynchburg - based 1st Battalion , 116th Brigade Combat Team , were used to conduct personal searches at checkpoints in Washington DC for the inauguration of Barack Obama .
In March , we reported on U.S. Army troops dispatched to patrol the streets of Samson , Alabama , after a murder spree .
On April 6 , we reported on a DHS , federal , state , Air Force , and local law enforcement checkpoint in Tennessee .
On April 3 , Infowars was instrumental in the cancellation of a seatbelt checkpoint that was to be conducted in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security and the 251st Military Police in Bolivar , Tennessee .
Last December , we reported on the Marine Corps Air and Ground Combat Center dispatching troops to work with police on checkpoints in in San Bernardino County , California .
On April 22 , we reported the deployment of 400 National Guard Combat Support Battalion troops to “ maintain public order ” at the Boston Marathon .
Last June , Infowars posted an article by D. H. Williams of the Daily Newscaster reporting the deployment of 2,300 Marines in the city of Indianapolis under the direction of FBI and the Department of Homeland Security .
We also reported a story on April 22 covering the assault of a local television news team by an irate police officer in El Paso , Texas .
A video taken by the news videographer shows uniformed soldiers working with police officers at the scene of a car accident .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The presence of uniformed and armed military police at the Kentucky Derby and those seen recently at the Riverfest celebration is part of an ongoing campaign to acclimate the populace to the presence of soldiers at public events .
This has now rapidly accelerated with reports pouring in from our readers of military checkpoints being set up all over the country in preparation for the swine flu pandemic .
Last week we reported on the testimony of a military whistleblower who warned that law enforcement and military personnel are training to set up checkpoints in order to catch people who refuse to take the swine flu vaccination .
In a You Tube video , a woman describing herself as a soldier explains how she was part of a drill in California centered around setting up roadblocks and checkpoints so authorities could check who has received the swine flu vaccine .
Those who have had the shots will be fitted with an RFID bracelet so they can be tracked .
Those who have not taken the shot will be offered it there and then and if they still refuse , will be carted off to an internment camp , according to the woman .
As CNN reported back in July , the military will assist civilian authorities in the event of a significant swine flu outbreak in the U.S. this fall , stoking fears that the pandemic , which has claimed relatively few lives so far , will be used as an excuse to implement martial law and a mandatory vaccination program .
“ The plan calls for military task forces to work in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
There is no final decision on how the military effort would be manned , but one source said it would likely include personnel from all branches of the military , ” states the report .
Northcom has been preparing for mass flu pandemics for years and indeed , Gen. Victor Renuart spoke of the threat of a flu pandemic emerging out of Mexico just weeks before it actually happened .
Testifying back in March , Renuart said Northcom would provide “ assistance in support of civil authorities ” during an epidemic , adding “ when requested and approved by the Secretary of Defense or directed by the President , federal military forces will contribute to federal support . ”
However , Renuart then added , “ USNorthCom does not wait for that call to action . ”
Northcom was only relatively recently assigned its own fighting unit – the Army ’s 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team , which had been fighting in Iraq for five years before that .
As we have previously reported , the Armed Forces Press Service has initiated a propaganda campaign designed to convince the American people that deploying the 3rd Infantry Division in the United States in violation of the Posse Comitatus
Act is a good thing , with images of soldiers from the brigade helping in “ humanitarian ” rescue missions , such as car wrecks .
This is all designed to condition Americans to accept troops on the streets and highways as a part of everyday life .
The assignment of the 1st Brigade Combat Team to Northcom alarmed the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
“ This is a radical departure from separation of civilian law enforcement and military authority and could , quite possibly , represent a violation of law , ” said Mike German , ACLU national security policy counsel .
The last time the the national guard and military worked with FEMA and local law enforcement on a large scale in the United States was during Hurricane Katrina , when they aided in the confiscation of privately owned firearms of citizens , even those who lived in the high and dry areas and were unaffected by the hurricane .
Another exercise that is training the U.S. military to take over law enforcement duties during a swine flu outbreak was revealed on Monday .
According to Navy.mil , the Panamax 2009 drill , which is taking place in both Panama and San Antonio Texas , is designed to train soldiers to “ stop people from going to work and school , ” during a pandemic .
The Pentagon is also attempting to “ grant the Secretary of Defense the authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel throughout the United States in times of emergency or a major disaster , ” writes Matthew Rothschild for The Progressive .
“ In June , the U.S. Northern Command distributed a “ Congressional Fact Sheet ” entitled “ Legislative Proposal for Activation of Federal Reserve Forces for Disasters . ”
That proposal would amend current law , thereby “ authorizing the Secretary of Defense to order any unit or member of the Army Reserve , Air Force Reserve , Navy Reserve , and the Marine Corps Reserve , to active duty for a major disaster or emergency . ”
Collating all the evidence of how the military has been seamlessly ingrained into the daily lives of Americans by way of uniformed troops undertaking law enforcement duties , there can be no doubt that the U.S. is already under a condition of undeclared martial law .
If a deadlier swine flu pandemic returns this fall , as authorities have vehemently promised will happen , military checkpoints that are now dotted around the country will rapidly multiply and America will fully begin to resemble conditions witnessed in the historical dictatorships of Maoist China , the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany .
Only by becoming aware of how far America has sunk into a militarized police state can we begin to reverse the incremental conditioning that has led Americans to accept the sight of troops on the streets demanding their papers .

Forget what they say about people in LA not drinking .
From Friday night to Monday morning , every bar is packed with older women who seem to have just one aim in life : to get through the weekend without even touching the $ 10 they came out with after work on Friday , and get rich blokes to provide them with cocktails and copious amount of champagne until they ( a ) fall over , ( b ) fall into bed , ( c ) find themselves unexpectedly in Vegas , having tied a whacking great knot ( marital , or literal , around their new spouse 's neck , depending on their luck ) .
US television has been quick to cash in on women seeking a fast route to snare a man and his fortune .
Megan Wants a Millionaire featured the proverbial blonde with large breasts looking for exactly what it said in the title .
At the end of each episode , the unlucky reject / sad sap of the week was handed a card and informed : " I 'm sorry , your credit has been declined " .
The show was pulled , when one of the former contestants was found dead , after being sought for the murder of his wife .
My current obsession is My Antonio , which features a group of women in Hawaii , all trying to pull the Hollywood actor Antonio Sabato , and it is hilarious .
This diverse group of women , which includes a NASA researcher , a nurse and a Playmate , really seem to care for nothing in life but getting this undoubtedly handsome man .
Antonio's mother Yvonne , who also stars , clearly hates them all .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Even Antonio's ex-wife Tully is in the mix , and to me it 's pretty obvious that the pair got it together before the show began and then used this rather spurious means of making some cash out of it .
I thought I might stand a better chance with Millionaire Matchmaker , which is set in LA , and boasts a wider cultural diversity than the shows offering just one man or woman whom everyone else must fight over .
Why did I bother ?
Having seen the millionaires on offer , I can only assume that presenter Patti Stanger has bagged all the best ones for herself and her mates .
Patti runs an elite matchmaking service in LA , and in series one concentrated on wealthy men looking for women .
In series two , rich women and rich gay men were added to the mix ( tough luck if one were a lesbian with dosh ) , so there were more fruits for the picking , but , alas , a lot more fruit pickers .
It certainly appears to be a much - needed service in the city , where women constantly bemoan the lack of available men .
I am quick to reassure them that I have now lived in five different countries , and they may as well stay put , because it 's the same story the world over .
Millionaire Matchmaker was therefore the first place I turned to here for advice in my quest to pull a rich man who was more than just the wad in his pocket ( size is n't everything , after all ) .
I quickly learned from Patti that you can say goodbye to your inheritance when your rich man pops his clogs , if you slept with him on the first date ( you have to hold out until they have opened a veritable MFI warehouse store of doors for you , apparently ) .
Oh , dear .
From the guys on offer , I would sleep with them ONLY on the first date .
Take Hatch .
He sounded a possibility , as he liked short women , and , in particular , women of 5ft tall .
Five feet exactly .
Which is what I am .
My chances would have been quickly blown , because at the initial ' mixer ' party he went straight for a woman who needed to duck when she entered the room .
Then there was Jimmy , who wanted to meet a cultured , Polish woman , who could speak Italian .
Specific , or what ?
He blew her out when they went on a tour of LA and she declared : " I do n't know what 's in the Getty . "
That would have been fine , had she not also said that she was a tour guide .
Serves your own right for being so fussy , Jimmy - boy .
Patti employs date coaches , therapists and personal shoppers to try to match like with like , and claims to have a lot of luck with what she believes is her true vocation in life .
I am now re-grouping and going along with her main suggestion : that a man will get his act together quickly if he " senses another penis around " .
I 've already started auditions .

When so many others were running scared last autumn , Mr. Buffett invested billions in Goldman Sachs  and got a far better deal than Washington .
He then staked billions more on General Electric .
While taxpayers never bailed out Mr. Buffett , they did bail out some of his stock picks .
Goldman , American Express , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , U.S. Bancorp  all of them got public bailouts that ultimately benefited private shareholders like Mr. Buffett .
If Mr. Buffett picked well  and , so far , it looks as if he did  his payoff could be enormous .
But now , only a year after the crisis struck , he seems to be worrying that the broader stock market might falter again .
After boldly buying when so many were selling assets , his conglomerate , Berkshire Hathaway , is pulling back , buying fewer stocks while investing in corporate and government debt .
And Mr. Buffett is warning that the economy , though on the mend , remains deeply troubled .
“ We are not out of problems yet , ” Mr. Buffett said last week in an interview , in which he reflected on the lessons of the last 12 months .
“ We have got to get the sputtering economy back so it is functioning as it should be . ”
Still , Mr. Buffett hardly sounded shellshocked in the wake of what he once called the financial equivalent of Pearl Harbor .
( An estimated net worth of $ 37 billion would be a balm to anyone ’s psyche . )
“ It has been an incredibly interesting period in the last year and a half .
Just the drama , ” Mr. Buffett said .
“ Watching the movie has been fun , and occasionally participating has been fun too , though not in what it has done to people ’s lives . ”
Fredy Montero of Seattle doing battle with Dejan Jakovic
The budding rivalry between Major League Soccer newcomer Seattle Sounders FC and long - time league power D.C. United ratcheted up considerably on Wednesday as Seattle won the U.S. Open Cup with a 2 - 1 victory at RFK Stadium in the nation ’s capital .
Fredy Montero scored in the 67th minute on a rebound of a shot that changed the hard - fought game completely .
The play was a double whammy for D.C. United , as goalkeeper Josh Wicks — who had been outstanding prior to that moment — stomped on Montero as he was lying on the ground after the goal and drew a red -card ejection .
The play thus gave Seattle not only a 1 - 0 lead , but a man advantage for the match ’s final 23 minutes .
Roger Levesque then hammered home the clinching goal in the 87th minute on a crossing pass from Sebastien Le Toux .
D.C. United scored in the 89th minute of play off a free kick just outside the penalty box that slid through Seattle ’s defensive line and left goalkeeper Kasey Keller helpless to stop a wide - open shot .
But Seattle held on , with Keller making several key stops in the closing moments , to land the first trophy in the team ’s MLS history .
It is something else to see an expansion team win silverware their first season in a league .
The Sounders have some experienced help , no doubt – especially their captain , Kasey Keller , and Freddie Ljundberg .
And I think they have the most determined and committed fans in the MLS .
Congratulations !
DON'T GET CHEATED BY SUPERMARKET SCANNERS
Last year alone , supermarket scanner errors cost shoppers more than $ 1 billion .
Here 's what you can do to stop getting gouged at the checkout counter .
( MONEY Magazine ) – Like most smart shoppers , you probably scout supermarket specials and compare prices .
Yet you have a one - in - 10 chance of losing some savings when you hit the checkout counter .
Consumer rights attorney Eugene DeSantis , 39 , pictured at right , noticed mistakes in his grocery bills so often he decided to fight back .
Last December , a small - claims court judge ruled DeSantis had been overcharged five times in three months at a Grand Union supermarket in East Greenbush , N.Y .
That suit was his second against Grand Union for the year and his third against a major grocery chain within the past three years .
'' I'm incensed , '' says DeSantis .
'' The same errors happen over and over .
It 's worth my time to take a stand . ''
The culprit ?
Your friendly neighborhood supermarket scanner , that laser - shooting , laborsaving electronic device first installed in stores back in 1973 and found in 81 % of the country 's 30,400 or so grocery markets today .
Scanners err more often than most shoppers realize .
And usually the errors are in the store 's favor .
The disturbing conclusion :
In many cases , overcharges may be deliberate .
'' Consumer deception appears to be occurring at an alarming rate at some stores , '' says marketing professor Harold Kassarjian at UCLA 's Anderson School of Business Management .
'' Such overcharges are more than just sloppiness . ''
MONEY 's reporting , plus an exclusive , two - month survey , has discovered : -- Scanners may overcharge at 30 % of stores .
At stores that overcharge , you may overpay for one out of every 10 items , on average . --
While scanner abuse may represent only nickels and dimes for any one customer , those errors add up .
Based on MONEY 's sample , we estimate annual losses to consumers of $ 1 billion owing to scanner overcharges .
InformationWeek , a trade publication for computer system managers , estimates those losses at $ 2.5 billion . --
Scanner errors account for more than half of supermarket profits .
The industry argues that scanner error cuts both ways .
'' A store could be undercharging a customer as easily as it could be overcharging one , '' says James Morford , president of the New Jersey Food Council .
But the MONEY sampling of 27 major supermarket chain stores in 23 states , as well as two other studies in the past two years , shows that scanner errors hurt shoppers more .
In the stores that MONEY surveyed , our correspondents purchased 10 randomly selected items , and in 30 % of the stores , they were overcharged on at least one item .
Our reporters found undercharges in only 7 % of stores .
And 63 % of stores were accurate on all charges .
Overcharges occurred on both regular - and sale - priced products , although more often on sale items .
In Ann Arbor , for example , one Kroger store charged us $ 1.49 for mushrooms on special for 99 cents .
A Miami Winn - Dixie more than doubled the sale price of a pound of brussels sprouts , automatically ringing up $ 1.97 instead of 89 cents .
And in Portland , Ore. , an Albertson 's scanner rang up $ 2.99 for a can of clam chowder listed for $ 2.69 on the shelf tag .
A UCLA test produced similar results .
Kassarjian and his colleagues purchased 1,245 items at five discount stores and 10 supermarkets ( three chains in all ) .
At one chain , they were overcharged five times more often than they were undercharged .
'' If these were truly random errors , '' says Kassarjian , '' then about half of them should have been in our favor -- they should n't have been overwhelmingly against us . ''
And a 1991 study of 21 local markets by New York City 's Department of Consumer Affairs also found the odds stacked .
Reports Commissioner Mark Green : '' When it is 10 times more likely that shoppers were overcharged rather than undercharged , it appears that the problem is intentional error . ''
How do scanners cheat ?
When a cashier whisks your groceries over the glass - enclosed electronic eye , the scanner reads the bar code , called the Universal Product Code ( UPC ) , on each item and calls up the price from the store 's computer .
Many supermarket chains , especially the larger ones , have a central data base that electronically sends as many as 1,000 to 3,000 weekly price changes to each store .
But store personnel may neglect to correctly or immediately update either the shelf tags or the store 's own computer listings .
Industry managers contend that stores work hard to ensure accurate scanners , often hiring at least one full - time employee exclusively to check prices in the computer against those on shelves .
'' The push to make sure that shelf price matches scanner price is a high priority , '' says Edie Meleski at the Food Marketing Institute , an international trade group that represents 1,500 food companies .
'' Whenever there 's an overcharge , '' continues Meleski , '' supermarkets generally give the item to the customer for free .
So considering profit margins of less than a penny on the dollar at most stores , any loss like that would prove a strong incentive to get prices right . ''
You would think so .
Yet four times in our survey , MONEY reporters who spotted scanner mistakes identified themselves to store managers or other personnel and informed them about the mistakes .
Then -- as a test -- MONEY shopped the same stores the following day .
Two were still overcharging customers .
Moreover , three months after we conducted our survey , our correspondents tried again , shopping every store where we had found overcharges .
Two out of the eight were still overcharging .
In fact , scanner errors pay off for stores , especially on sale - priced items .
If profits are , on average , close to 1 % of store sales -- roughly $ 280 billion at markets that use scanners -- total consumer losses to scanner overcharges could make up 50 % of profits .
'' Managers sometimes have bonuses that are tied to their ability to achieve profitability , '' says Leo Harty , director of retail marketing for NCR , one of the largest manufacturers of computerized scanners .
'' In some cases , a dishonest person could either change prices or not enter sale prices so consumers pay higher prices . ''
Sale items and limited - offer promotions are particularly prone to error , because they depend on someone entering changes in the computer .
And again , the ' ' errors ' ' overwhelmingly favor the industry .
In the New York City survey , for example , supermarkets wrongly charged regular prices on 10 % of their sale items , undercharging consumers on only 1 % of such purchases .
Consider Ralphs Grocery , the oldest chain in the West , where , last spring , inspectors from the Los Angeles County Department of Weights and Measures were overcharged on almost 19 % of sale items at seven supermarkets in the San Fernando Valley .
The Los Angeles city attorney 's office filed criminal charges last June against the 159 - store , $ 2.8 - billion - revenue chain , and Ralphs admitted to overcharges when the case was settled in November .
But the company claimed that the errors had been unintentional .
In one instance , the scanner registered $ 12.99 for a bottle of wine on sale for $ 9.99 .
In another , an inspector was charged 13 % more than the sale price for a box of doughnuts ( $ 1.35 instead of $ 1.19 ) .
The store agreed to pay $ 9,450 in fines and penalties and to provide employees with training in shelf - tag and computer accuracy .
Maybe this time it 'll work .
Almost six years ago , however , district attorneys in Los Angeles and San Diego found an 18 % overpricing error rate in the Ralphs stores -- close to the 19 % rate reported at the stores last year .
Similarly , without admitting wrongdoing , Ralphs settled the September 1987 cases by paying fees and penalties of $ 70,784 .
Responds attorney Jan Charles Gray , senior vice president at Ralphs : '' In both cases , the inspections did n't take undercharges into account .
Besides , in the last case , the selection was n't really random -- they chose items with expired sale dates . ''
The solution , of course , is tougher and better consumer protection .
While a handful of states and cities still have laws requiring stores to mark prices on each grocery item , the overwhelming majority now require only shelf tags , those hard - to - read labels now found on supermarket shelving .
As a result , when shoppers reach the checkout line with unmarked items , they cannot easily catch errors as prices flash on the cash register , assuming shelf tags were right in the first place .
'' There is nothing to check prices with -- except memory , '' says Margaret A. Charters , director of the consumer studies program at Syracuse University .
'' You ca n't even challenge a price without holding up yourself and the entire checkout line while someone goes to check the shelf . ''
Around the country , frustrated consumer groups are lobbying to get local governments to bring back item pricing , which would require stores to mark prices on all or most groceries .
The New York Public Interest Research Group , for instance , is currently rallying support to pass an item - pricing law next year .
In Philadelphia , the Action Alliance of Senior Citizens is compiling evidence of overcharges , the proof it needs to get item pricing on the books .
Supermarket companies oppose item pricing mainly because it would force them to double the weekly $ 2,000 or so they now spend on shelf tags for each store .
According to Margaret Charters , however , retailers could easily afford item pricing .
In states that already have item - pricing laws , consumers still face an uphill fight .
'' Item pricing is a difficult battle , '' concedes Martin Sloane , executive officer of the National Alliance of Supermarket Shoppers .
'' The supermarket lobby is powerful . ''
In Arizona , for example , the Consumers Council and the Center for Law in the Public Interest are preparing to sue the attorney general 's office , claiming that a five - member industry review panel has a clear bias against consumers .
'' Astonishingly , '' says Phyllis Rowe , executive director of the Arizona Consumers Council , '' last December they took only minutes to reject our proposal for accuracy checks on scanners despite clear evidence that stores were not changing scanners even after learning of errors -- a criminal practice that should be subject to severe penalties . ''
What can be done to prevent scamming scanners ?
You can lobby your supermarket company as well as local and state government to adopt the following measures .
( And in the meantime , when you shop , guard your pocket by following our advice in '' How to Beat the System , '' the box on page 134 . ) --
New laws .
Last summer , for example , Philadelphia enacted a law that requires stores to pay scanner licensing fees to support an undercover inspection program by city officials .
--
Increased enforcement of existing laws .
In California , for instance , where consumer protection officials are aggressive , state and local prosecutors have successfully brought suit against at least four major chains in the past four years -- adding up to individual fines as high as $ 100,000 for overcharges at Safeway , Vons , Lucky and Ralphs . --
More industry policing .
The Pennsylvania Food Merchants Association , representing 1,900 food companies , for instance , runs a new statewide accuracy program that incorporates many of the pricing standards required by Philadelphia law , including on - site inspections .
-- Improved technology .
Last fall , the Connecticut legislature exempted stores from its universal product coding law if the markets installed computerized shelf tags -- one of the latest high - tech products available to the industry .
'' With electronic unit - price shelf tags , '' says Joseph Lembo , legal director at the state 's consumer protection department , '' errors should be eliminated . ''
Until such consumer protections are in force , however , shoppers are advised to watch that little red beam very carefully .
Says Charters at Syracuse : '' Without a constant check of scanners , the potential for error and the temptation to use them dishonestly remains . ''

Honey Bees with Colony Collapse Disorder Show their Genes
By Kim Kaplan August 24 , 2009
The first hard evidence of what is happening physiologically inside bees during Colony Collapse Disorder ( CCD ) has been published in a new study by Agricultural Research Service ( ARS ) and University of Illinois scientists in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study also looked at differences in activity levels of critical genes in CCD and healthy bee colonies .
Using a tool called a genome - wide microarray , the scientists found a large amount of abnormal ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) fragments in the guts of honey bees in CCD colonies .
Ribosomes are the cellular factories in which proteins are made , guided by rRNA , and a large amount of abnormal rRNA fragments means the protein construction system is compromised .
This indicates that honey bees in colonies diagnosed with CCD had reduced ability to synthesize new proteins .
The gut is the primary entry point for pathogens and pesticides in honey bees .
Honey bees ' stress response systems also can be measured in the bee 's gut .
The honey bee has two separate response systems : one to environmental stresses such as pesticides , and a different one reacting to pathogens such as viruses .
This was the first time RNA levels have been measured in honey bees as a way of tracking whether it is honey bees ' pesticide response system or their pathogen immune response system that is reacting in CCD , according to ARS geneticist Jay Evans , who works in the Bee Research Laboratory at the ARS Henry A. Wallace Beltsville ( Md. ) Agricultural Research Center .
Evans was part of a team that included entomologists May R. Berenbaum , Reed M. Johnson and Gene E. Robinson from the University of Illinois .
In CCD colonies , the genes involved in the pathogen / immune response systems showed no single clear pattern of activity , although there was commonly more activation of these genes and the bees had a higher overall level of viruses and other pathogens than non-CCD colonies .
Almost all CCD colonies had a higher level of picorna - like viruses , which attack the ribosome .
Picorna - like viruses that attack honey bees include deformed wing virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus .
The varroa mite , a major honey bee parasite , is known to transmit picorna - like viruses .
Bees in CCD colonies did not show significantly active pesticide response genes .
The loss of ribosomal function would explain many of the phenomena associated with CCD , according to Berenbaum .
If the bees ' ribosomes are compromised , then they can't overcome exposure to pesticides , fungal infections or bacteria or inadequate nutrition because the ribosome is central to the survival of any organism .
The study did not establish a direct cause - and - effect link between the abnormal rRNA and CCD .
But colony surveillance by assays of rRNA and other markers expressed by bees could provide the earliest indication of CCD found so far , perhaps in time for beekeepers to take actions that might reduce losses , Evans suggested .
ARS is the principal intramural scientific research agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Texas Todeskandidat wegen pünktlichen Feierabends hingerichtet
" Wir schließen um 17 Uhr " : Weil eine Richterin sich weigerte , die Öffnungszeiten des Gerichts um 20 Minuten zu verlängern , um das Aufschubgesuch eines Todeskandidaten in Empfang zu nehmen , musste der Mann sterben .
( CNN ) --
A man shot his estranged wife to death , along with their son and grandson , before turning the gun on himself as police closed in , authorities in Livingston Parish , Louisiana , said Sunday .
Police say Dennis Carter Sr. shot four family members , three fatally , before turning the gun on himself .
Dennis Carter Sr. , 50 , also shot and critically injured his pregnant daughter - in - law , the parish sheriff 's office said in a statement .
The shootings occurred Saturday night in the town of Holden , Louisiana .
Authorities were dispatched to a report of shots fired at a home about 10:40 p.m.
Upon arrival , they found three people dead and the fourth -- Amber Carter , 25 -- in critical condition , the statement said .
Those killed were Dennis Carter Jr. , 26 , Amber Carter 's husband ; their son Mason Carter , 2 ; and 49 - year - old Donna Carter , mother of Dennis Carter Jr. and estranged wife of Dennis Carter Sr. , police said .
All had been shot to death .
A 16 - month - old child at the home was unharmed , authorities said .
Deputies believe Amber Carter attempted to escape from the gunman by jumping from a second - story window , holding Mason in her arms , the statement said , but the boy did not survive his gunshot wounds .
Amber Carter had several bullet wounds , said Perry Rushing , chief of operations for the sheriff 's office , and authorities believe the gunman shot her in the back as she was attempting to get out the window while holding the child .
She also may have been shot again after she got outside the home , Rushing told CNN .
Amber Carter was flown to a Baton Rouge , Louisiana , hospital , and later transferred to New Orleans , Rushing said .
She was in critical condition as of Sunday morning .
A neighbor in the area told deputies that he heard a gunshot and saw Carter Sr. walking to a car , a red El Camino , with a gun in his hand , the sheriff 's statement said .
At 11:30 p.m. , a police officer in the adjacent town of Livingston saw the vehicle entering Interstate 12 heading eastbound , the statement said .
A Livingston Parish sheriff 's deputy followed the car and attempted to stop it .
" However , the suspect shot himself with a handgun , in plain view of the officers , as the vehicle veered off the shoulder of the interstate near the Holden exit , " police said .
Records from the Livingston Parish Detention Center show that Dennis Carter Sr. , of Hammond , Louisiana , had been jailed " on three separate occasions in 2009 alone , on three separate charges of violation of a protective order and one charge of aggravated assault ( domestic ) , " the sheriff 's office said .
" At this time , there do not appear to be any other suspects or victims in this ongoing investigation , " police said .
Holden is about 35 miles east of Baton Rouge .
Women 's fear of spiders has now been linked to the behavioural traits of our hunter - gatherer ancestors
A new study in the US suggests that women have a genetic aversion to dangerous animals , such as spiders .
The research , published in the New Scientist , says women are born with character traits that were ingrained in our hunter - gatherer ancestors .
As child protectors , they have to shun animals that threaten them or their young off - spring , researchers said .
Previous research suggested women were actually up to four times more likely to be afraid of creatures like spiders .
The new research was headed up by developmental psychologist , Dr David Rakison , from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , 10 baby girls , and 10 baby boys were subjected to a number of pictures of spiders to gauge their reactions .
First the babies were shown a picture of a spider with a fearful human face , followed by images of a spider paired with a happy face - alongside an image of a flower twinned with a fearful face .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The results showed that the girls - some as young as 11 months old - looked longer at the picture of the happy face with a spider than the boys , who looked at both images for an equal time .
The researchers concluded that the young girls were confused as to why someone would be happy to be twinned with a spider , and were quick to associate pictures of arachnids with fear .
The boys , it seems , remained totally indifferent emotionally .
' Ancestral behaviour '
Mr Rakison attributes this genetic predisposition to behavioural traits inherent in our hunter - gatherer ancestors .
Men , he purports , were the greater natural risk takers , the ones who took greater risks were more successful when going out to hunt for food .
With women , in their role as natural child protectors , it made sense for them to be more cautious of animals such as snakes or spiders , Mr Rakison adds .
By contrast , the research concludes that modern phobias such as the fear of hospitals - or that of flying - show no differences between the sexes .
Previous research has shown that almost 6 % of people have a phobia of snakes , with nearly 4 % scared of spiders .
However , of that percentage , four times are likely to be women than men .

Just how effective is communication on Twitter ?
If you want to get your messages noticed , a study reveals when you should plan your most informative missives for re-tweeting .
Just how effective is communication on Twitter ?
About 40 percent of Tweets are actually useless babble , but if you want to get your messages noticed , might want to log on early in the week , according to data released Wednesday .
Market research firm Pear Analytics was interested to find out if Twitter actually conveyed useful information or it was a spam - filled waste of time .
They took 2,000 English - based Tweets over a two - week period , capturing the messages in half - hour increments .
They then lumped them into six categories : news , spam , self - promotion , pointless babble , conversational and pass - along value .
Not surprisingly , about 40 percent of these 140 - character musings were just pointless babble , though about 37.55 percent were placed in the conversational category .
Coming in third was pass - along value , though that only secured 8.7 percent of Tweets .
Self - promotion landed at 5.85 percent , about 3.75 percent was spam , and 3.6 percent was news .
" We thought the News category would have more weight than dead last , since this seems to be contrary to Twitter 's new position of being the premier source of news and events , " the study said .
" Self - promotion was also less than expected , [ which ] may be enlightening to some folks , as there appears to be a flurry of companies and businesses joining Twitter to promote products and services . "
But in addition to just sorting the messages , the firm also figured out what days and times are best for getting your Tweets noticed .
Do you want your message re-Tweeted ?
Your best bet is to post your message on Mondays or at 11:30 a.m. ( Central time ) , the firm said .
Most of the news hit the micro-blogging site around 2 P.M. and on Tuesdays .
( The group purposely did not include Michael Jackson - related news so as not to skew the results . )
Conversational Tweets , meanwhile , usually occurred between 2 and 4 P.M. , and usually on Tuesdays .
" Most people are busy on Monday catching up with work , so perhaps it takes until Tuesday to get into the swing of Twittering again , " the firm said .
Spam ?
You 're going to get that at all hours of the day , Pear found .
" With the new face of Twitter , it will be interesting to see if they take a heavier role in news , or continue to be a source for people to share their current activities that have little to do with everyone else , " the study concluded .
Pear said it will be conducting this study every quarter to identify other Twitter trends .
Mitochondria are the cell 's power plants , important in the operation of metabolism , how that metabolism determines life span , and many age - related diseases .
As described in the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging , a small number of mitochondrial genes are known to be crucial to its operation as the cell 's power plant .
Damage to those genes is a natural consequence of the operation of a mitochondrion , and leads to a Rube Goldberg sequence of events in which is a healthy cell is turned into a damaged cell that spews forth damaging biochemicals into your body .
As those errant cells accumulate , their actions collectively give rise to many of the unwelcome forms of change and damage that come with age : systems failing , organs shutting down , and important biochemical processes running awry because their component molecules are corrupted .
Given all this , we can see that the ability to replace genes in mitochondrial DNA is a foundation for methods of repairing and eliminating this contribution to the aging process .
The course of human life suggests that such a working technology would only have to be applied once every few decades .
Of all the branches of potential longevity science , replacement of mitochondrial DNA is one of the most advanced ( beyond stem cell research and regenerative medicine of course , which benefits from a far larger research community and funding base ) .
Replacement of all mitochondrial DNA was demonstrated in mice through protofection in 2005 , and moving mitochondrial genes into the cell nucleus as an alternative to direct replacement was demonstrated in mice in 2008 .
That second option is not as simple as you might think in an age of genetic science : copying the gene into the nucleus is a straightforward use of established technology , but that done you still have to manipulate the cell into transporting the proteins produced by that gene back into the mitochondria without breakage .
Fortunately , this breakthrough was made , so full steam ahead there .
But back to the straight replacement of entire damaged mitochondrial genomes .
Here is a recent report of this goal achieved in primates , though this is a pre-embryonic manipulation performed on a single cell rather than a global change in all the cells of an adult .
The point of interest is that it worked and the resulting offspring seem fine ; it provides further evidence for the safety of replacing all of a human 's mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) :
Mutations in mtDNA contribute to a diverse range of currently incurable human diseases and disorders .
To establish preclinical models for new therapeutic approaches , we demonstrate here that the mitochondrial genome can be efficiently replaced in mature non-human primate oocytes ( Macaca mulatta ) by spindle - chromosomal complex transfer from one egg to an enucleated , mitochondrial - replete egg .
The reconstructed oocytes with the mitochondrial replacement were capable of supporting normal fertilization , embryo development and produced healthy offspring .
The underlying technologies are within a few years of completion by the look of it .
At that point the real issue becomes one of regulation ; the FDA does not permit treatments for aging or changes that happen with aging that have not been lobbied into a designation as an official disease .
So any significant progress towards therapies aimed at repairing mitochondrial damage of aging will have to be made outside the regulatory systems of the largest markets .
With this science - and many other fields of medicine - so very far ahead of what regulators permit , the breaking point at which large for - profit development groups abandon the system to operate in more permissive regions has to arrive at some near future date .

Fall is here .
For many of us , that means cooler temperatures , a chill in the air , the rustle of warm - hued leaves at your feet , a change back from iced coffee to warm coffee , fragrant spices like cinnamon , nutmeg and cloves , creamy butternut squash and pumpkin , and football season .
For me means all of those things , but most importantly , Fall means that Christmas is coming soon .
Yes , right around this time , I whip out the Christmas albums .
Nat King Cole 's
The Christmas Song is my personal favorite , and I anxiously anticipate the opening minor chords to the title track .
And it is almost as if I can faintly hear the crackling sound that accompanied those chords on the record player that I listened to the album on when I was a young girl .
When that album is done , I follow it up with WCBS FM's ( a New York Oldies Station ) " The Ultimate Christmas Album Volume 1 " and dance to " Rockin ' Around the Christmas Tree " and " Santa Baby " .
But my personal favorite - one that makes me both laugh and smile warmly - is Mr. Hanky 's Christmas Album from the TV Show South Park .
This album was gifted to me by my father , and as you may have read , my father is quite the " young spirit " to put it nicely .
Mr. Hanky , the Christmas Poo ( I will not show the picture on this blog for fear that even a picture of a cartoon piece of poo wearing a Santa Hat will make your stomach turn slightly , something I do n't particularly want on my food blog ) , is joined by his friend 's Stan , Kyle , Cartman , Satan , Wendy , Kyle 's Sister , Ike , Mr. Garrison , and Chef , among others , to sing about the wonderful season .
Classics such as " Christmastime in Hell " , " Carol of the Bells ( Mmmmkay ) " and " Merry F --- ing Christmas " are belted out .
But I personally enjoy Eric Cartman 's rendition of " O Holy Night " .
O Holy Night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear savior 's b-b-b - birrrrth
O Holy Night
um ... something something something
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pies
Jesus was born , and so I get presents
Thank you Jesus for being in born !
So you can imagine me in my kitchen , making what can be considered a very " fall " treat , as I danced around to the most twisted Christmas album of all time .
But as I took one bite of these , I was pulled right back into the fall season as I tasted hints of cinnamon , nutmeg and cloves , enjoyed the chai scent , savored the orange flavor , and devoured the creamy , spiced buttercream frosting .
And then " The Most Offensive Song Ever " came on and I was once again pulled back into the Christmas spirit .
And yes , that is the real name of the Christmas song on that album .
Google , if you dare , but it is not for the religious , prudish , or thin - skinned .
You have been warned .
Merry Christmas !
This requires unpacking :
King told a conservative news radio program :
If there 's a push for a socialist society where the foundations of individual rights and liberties are undermined and everybody is thrown together living collectively off one pot of resources earned by everyone , this is one of the goals they have to go to , same sex marriage , because it has to plow through marriage in order to get to their goal .
They want public affirmation , they want access to public funds and resources .
...
King also said that former Sen. Rick Santorum ( R - Pa. ) was right to say that legal same sex marriages would open the door to legal polygamy or bestiality .
" Not only is it a radical social idea , it is a purely socialist concept in the final analysis , " King said .
Socialist ?
You realize that King must have no understanding of the word , or that the word has now become synonymous in Foxland with " anything that scares me . "
How on earth is allowing 2 percent of people the right to marry the person they love a path to redistribution of wealth or government ownership of the means of production ?
Marriage is an institution that helps people be independent of the state .
If one spouse gets sick , it is his or her spouse 's first responsibility to care for him or her .
Without the spouse , the government would have to step in .
Marriage encourages responsibility , long - term commitment , and leads to better health .
All of that too helps people remain independent of the state .
In fact every single argument that social conservatives make about marriage for straights - and rightly so - also applies to marriage for gays .
The mindset that lumps this in with some amorphous threat to everything good and American is not rational .
It is gripped by paranoia , illogic and prejudice .

You might want to change the DNS server if your ISP ’s servers can sometimes be slow or outdated .
sudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf
and change or add the lines :
nameserver your_DNS1 nameserver your_DNS2
You can add as many lines like these , but two should be enough .
Test the used domain name servers careful !
#dns-nameserver 192.168.0.1
#dns-nameservers 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2
#dns-search somedomain.org
#dns-domain 192.168.0.1
Edit : Serge ’s comment ( the first one ) made me search a little bit .
After searching google it was n’t totally clear if the DNS should be configured in resolv.cof or /etc / network / interfaces , so I took the GUI for a spin .
I ’ve set up the DNS trough the GUI and checked the changes inside both locations .
The DNS servers I addes , became listed inside the /etc/resolv.conf file .
So after all , I was right .
But as the configuration file starts with the line # Generated by NetworkManager , I was wondering if these settings would get overwritten by the NetworkManager .
So I wiped all configured interfaces from my computer and let the NetworkManager try its evil .
It worked like a charm and just added the line ‘ domain morraye.local ’ to the file , without erasing my dns settings .
This was tested on Ubuntu 9.04 and Ubuntu 9.10 .
You might also want to play with these settings in your resolv.conf file
# dns-domain 208.67.222.222 # dns-nameserver 208.67.222.222 # dns-nameservers 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220 # dns-search wikipedia.org
Note :
When you ’re behind a router , you should change the dns server at your router ( unless it uses pass - trough DNS lookups )

Dual Orion capsules studied for manned asteroid missions
BY CRAIG COVAULT
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : August 17 , 2009
A manned asteroid mission using two Orion spacecraft , docked nose - to - nose to form a 50 - ton deep space vehicle , is being studied by Lockheed Martin Space Systems as an alternative to resumption of U.S. lunar landing missions .
The Orion asteroid mission concept is being unveiled just as the Presidential committee reviewing U.S. human space flight is citing asteroid missions after 2020 as a less costly alternative to NASA 's proposed lunar landing infrastructure .
Results of the review will be briefed to President Obama by Norman Augustine , committee chairman , by the end of August .

The docked Orion configuration as shown in a Lockheed Martin graphic ( above ) would have a total of four large solar arrays and two service modules as well as two command modules for extra space on the several week flight .
Single 25 - ton Orion spacecraft would first be used to replace the space shuttle for servicing the International Space Station .
But use of them for asteroid missions and other deep space sites would maximize utilization of the Orion system if lunar landings are deleted as a near term goal .
If one looks closely at the graphic , a space suited astronaut deployed from the Orion , is standing atop the asteroid .
The graphic is from a Lockheed Martin promotional movie that shows concepts under study by the Orion prime contractor .
Under the Bush Administration strategy , NASA had planned a resumption of lunar landing missions by about 2020 using the Orion as a lunar orbiting command ship while its crew descended to the moon in Altair landers for lengthy stays on the surface .
The official NASA line has been solidly " all moon " for the last several years , while more realistic assessments over the same period have shown that is not feasible .
NASA more recently , however , had become more open about an asteroid mission capability for Orion after space scientists and planners meeting before formation of the committee began to criticize the lunar goal as too fragile .
Development and cost problems with the Ares 1 and Ares 5 launch vehicle programs have also become increasingly apparent since about 2007 .
Augustine and other committee members such as former astronaut Sally Ride have already reported publicly that NASA 's current plan to retire the shuttle , finish the space station and return to the moon by the early 2020s is not even remotely feasible under NASA 's current funding profile .

Orion missions to asteroids would be useful to characterize and sample them .
This would be important as early preparation to use some yet undetermined system if the need ever arose to divert an asteroid to save Earth from a devastating impact .
Some asteroids are solid bodies , while others are rubble piles of loose rock , making samples and close up characterization useful for diversion studies that would differ depending upon the type of asteroid threatening Earth .
In fact a Lockheed Martin video titled " Orion For Crewed Science Missions " shows the twin Orion configuration closely orbiting an asteroid while space suited astronauts explore its surface .
With the minuscule gravity of an asteroid , astronauts flying manned maneuvering units could travel between the Orion combo and the object without ever requiring a much heavier , and expensive , asteroid landing vehicle .
The video , little noticed at the time , was shown in early August at a propulsion conference in Denver sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics .
The AIAA " Joint Propulsion Conference " so called because it brings together multiple international agencies often makes news as it also did in 2008 when Chinese researchers openly discussed their scramjet technology program .
At this year 's event , the Lockheed Martin video was part of a presentation delivered by former astronaut Brian Duffy , now Lockheed Martin vice president and program manager for the Altair lunar module part of the Orion lunar landing infrastructure .
Duffy 's presentation also cited satellite servicing that could be performed by astronauts from an Orion configuration , equipped with a shuttle - type manipulator arm deployed from its service module .
The presentation also discussed use of single Orion spacecraft to service geosynchronous orbit military and civilian satellites and the potential for them to travel to Lagrangian points to service telescopes like the giant new Webb space telescope set for launch in about four years .
Lagrangian points balance out gravity from the sun , Earth and moon allowing spacecraft to remain parked at those locations .
They are about 1 million mi. from Earth , about the same distance as some asteroids passing near Earth .
This means Orions configured for missions to telescopes , like Webb , at Lagrangian points would have a life support capability also generally suitable for asteroid missions .
The twin Orion design includes large service modules on each spacecraft to allow extra space for astronauts to live in .
More importantly more capability to carry life support systems for several week missions could be carried in the two service modules .
Welcome back to Ireland , Muhammad O'ALi : Boxing legend thrills 10,000 with visit to home of his Irish great - grandfather
He fixed his eyes in a steely gaze , raised his mighty fists and made a crowd of 10,000 roar .
Okay , so it was n’t exactly the electric atmosphere he created with the Thrilla in Manila or the Rumble in the Jungle .
But the rapturous reception Muhammad Ali received in a small Irish town yesterday provided a spine - tingling reminder of those glory days .
Boxing legend : Muhammad

The champion arrives : Ali was greeted with a roar to rival even the Rumble in the Jungle as he took a few frail steps from his car under blue skies
It came as he unveiled a plaque to his little - known Irish ancestors in Ennis , County Clare .
Ali ’s great - grandfather , Abe Grady , who hailed from the town , emigrated to the U.S. in the 1860s , and in recognition of his roots Ali was yesterday made the first Honorary Freeman of Ennis .
It was his first visit there and with the confidence that typified his sporting career , he was almost immediately talking of a comeback , despite medical advice against travelling .
As the three times World Heavyweight Champion accepted the honour , his wife Lonnie revealed : ‘ Now that we know Muhammad is an Ennis man , we will be back . ’
The adoring fans , spanning generations , had packed into the town ’s main square for hours before the civic reception was broadcast on a huge screen .
Welcome : Muhammad

Lonnie announced that her husband , who has been battling Parkinson ’s Disease for 25 years , was overwhelmed by the experience .
Ali smiled several times during the ceremony and despite his frailty he was also obviously struck by the occasion , fiddling with the strap of his watch and rubbing his eyes as Ennis Mayor Frankie Neylon outlined the legend ’s links with Ennis and his many great achievements .
Some onlookers even suggested the magic of the man even brought fine weather , noting that more than three decades after he famously claimed to have ' even cancelled the rain ' for his Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman , it appeared he had pulled off the same stroke .
Irish honour : Thousands of fans watch a big screen in Ennis town centre as Ali unveils his family plaque
Shadow boxing :
To the delight of crowds in Ennis , Ali treats them to some moves that made him a three - time world heavyweight champion
After weeks of summer downpours , threatening rainclouds cleared almost within minutes of Ali being spotted touching down at Shannon Airport at around midday .
Imelda O’Grady , a distant cousin who embraced the boxing legend as he arrived in Ennis , said : ‘ Look , the sun ’s come out – it ’s shining down on him . ’
Miss O’Grady presented
Ali with framed photographs of them both , with the inscription : ‘ Cead Mile Failte ( One Hundred Thousand Welcomes ) from Imelda O’Grady and the O’Grady families . ’
First freeman : Ali and his family admire the plaque on Turnpike Road
Hero 's welcome :

Ali 's historic visit
So too were the thousands more who thronged Turnpike Road , the homeplace of Ali's great - grandfather Abe Grady , who emigrated to the United States in the 1860s and married a freed African - American slave .
The 67 - year - old ex-fighter , renowned as a civil rights champion , astonished his fans when he alighted from a black people carrier to unveil a plaque at his ancestor 's house .
As crowds cheered ' Muhammad , Muhammad ' and ' Ali , Ali ' , he turned and with an impromptu throw - back to his days in the ring , a shadow boxing cameo once again showed the ageing champion at his greatest .
The family tree of Muhammad Ali
Proud : Ali ( centre ) displays his Freedom of the City certificate with the Mayor and Councillors of Ennis
‘ It was unreal , it was a privilege , ’ she said afterwards .
‘ When he saw his relations he was delighted .
I think he was emotional – by God , I was certainly emotional . ’
Family tree : Odessa Grady , the mother of Ali , is the daughter of John Grady , who was the son of Irishman Abe Grady and his African - American wife
In total , among the invited guests at the ceremony were three representatives of three families believed to be directly descended from Ali ’s great - grandfather .
After the brief visit to Ennis , fans had to be levered off his people carrier as it made its way through the narrow - lined medieval streets , festooned with flags .
Before leaving for the U.S. , Ali stopped off at the nearby baronial Dromoland Castle , for a charity fundraising afternoon tea .
Mark Nolan , manager of the plush hotel , said his latest guest topped the bill of renowned visitors .
‘ We ’ve had George Bush , Bill Clinton … maybe Nelson Mandela is the only guest who is comparable to Ali , ’ he said .
‘ I ’ve never seen excitement like it here . ’
Ali is not the first global figure Ireland has laid claim to .
Of the 44 U.S. Presidents so far , 17 have been found to have links to Ireland , John F Kennedy and Ronald Reagan among them .
Barack Obama 's maternal family tree is also said to trace back to a well - to - do shoemaker from Moneygall , County Offaly , who lived from 1794 to 1861 .
MEXICO CITY , Mexico ( CNN ) -- Mexico City 's thousands of stores went green Wednesday , as amended ordinances on solid waste now outlaw businesses from giving out thin plastic bags that are not biodegradable .
Mexico City stores , such as this supermarket , can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags .
The law affects all stores , production facilities and service providers within the Federal District , which encompasses the city limits .
Nearly 9 million people live inside the district and another 10 million reside in surrounding communities that make up greater Mexico City .
Mexico City becomes the second large metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw the bags .
San Francisco in March 2007 enacted an ordinance that gave supermarkets six months and large chain pharmacies about a year to phase out the bags .
Los Angeles is set to impose a ban if the state of California does not enact a statewide 25 - cent fee per bag by July .
About 90 percent of the bags used in the United States are not recycled .
Bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries .
China has adopted a strict limit , reducing litter and eliminating the use of 40 billion bags , the World Watch Institute said , citing government estimates .
Although compliance has been spotty , violation of the law carries a possible fine of 10,000 yuan ( $ 1,463 ) , World Watch said .
In Tanzania , selling the bags carries a maximum six - month jail sentence and a fine of 1.5 million shilling ( $ 1,137 ) .
Mumbai , India , outlawed the bags in 2000 and cities in Australia , Italy , South Africa and Taiwan have imposed bans or surcharges .
Ireland reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one .
Some leading environmentalists are calling for a global ban on the bags .
Achim Steiner , executive director of the United Nations Environment Program , says plastic bags are the second - most - common form of litter , behind cigarette butts .
The bags are the greatest form of litter on the globe 's oceans , the U.N. agency said in a recent report .
The bags are also a major threat to ocean wildlife , causing the deaths of 100,000 sea turtles and other marine animals that mistake them for food .
" Thin - film , single - use plastic bags , which choke marine life , should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere , " Steiner said in June .
" There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore , anywhere . "
Mexico City , which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world , also is looking at improving its environment in other ways .
The municipal government announced this month it will place more than 1,100 bicycles at 84 stations throughout the city for residents to use .
Officials said they hope to increase bicycle use as a form of transportation to 5 percent , up from the current 1.2 percent .

SAN FRANCISCO , Sept 1 ( Reuters ) - California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a federal court ’s order that the state reduce its prison population by 40,000 inmates , a spokesman said on Tuesday .
The appeal will be a dramatic escalation in the long - running legal battle over the state of California ’s overcrowded prisons and their often criticized medical care for inmates .
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said the appeal will be filed later this week , adding that cutting the state ’s inmate population of about 170,000 must be done methodically and by state officials .
“ We do n’t believe it ’s right , ” McLear said , referring to the federal court order .
“ We need to reduce the prison population but we need to do so in a responsible way . ”
Schwarzenegger is pressing for state legislation to cut the number of prisoners in order to bring down spending on prisons , one of the state ’s top expenditures .
He backed a bill approved last month by the state Senate that would reduce the state ’s prison population with a number of measures , including releasing elderly and ailing inmates .
But the Assembly passed a rival and less ambitious bill on Monday , raising doubts the two bills can be reconciled .
A legislative battle over releasing prisoners may take shape amid public resistance to the idea after a sensational kidnapping case broke near San Francisco last week with the arrest of a paroled sex offender for abducting an 11 - year - old girl , holding her for 18 years and having two children with her .
Come On Let ’s start the debate .
orry to be your BuzzKill but Arabs didnt lose land in a war , they were unjustly pushed off of it .
when instigated to fight back , shit for brains like you claim that it was fairly lost in a war .
Sorry to burst your bubble but this fact is not true .
Yes Egypt conceded to the existence of Israel , which in fact did cause it heaps of problems , but for all Arabs to concede to stolen land that was lost in a calculated genocide is not an option to the majority of the Arabs .
Now
It ’s no big deal really , Israel can keep the land .
Because as I said , I support Israel 100 % .
Thank
God they are in existence doing what they are doing because I never could understand why the hell everyone hates them so much and I almost believed the stories of innocent holocaust slaughter , but with what they are doing now in Israel and what Haganah and Howard Stern gang did .
It all makes sense how only an ingrate could turn from oppressed to oppressor so damn quick .
Hence explaining the whole hate filled history of the mob of celestial ingrates of the tribe of Israel , or at least whats left of there descendants that havent accepted Christ already and been eternally saved .
Even accepting Islam would be better that being a fascist squealing whining lying Zionist .
I had some Jewish Pussy , it was actually quite nice , very clean , but still , reality check here buddy !
The war was instigated by the criminal gangs , x-Holocaust Hitler camp survivor thugs and were labelled as terrorists the world throughout .
Until that is a few stand up Jews dug deep into their pockets and turn popular opinion in their favor .
Just like I wish some righteous Christians or Muslims would do to stop this [ non Orthodox Jewish plunder ] .
Jews have been hated , deal with it , dont invent that it is alright to go against your creed and kill innocent people that just happen to be living on land that was your fore fathers that you had never seen before .
Yet you tell Palestinians to accept that .
So why do n’t you all accept that it is wrong and you are hated .
Just live with it instead of maiming and killing , duh .
You God fearing bunch of ingrates .
Yes I am a fundie hater but that doesnt mean I condone cut throat slithering tactics of a bunch of deranged ex concentration camp thugs who commit murder and are catapulted into God like stature .
Love it or leave it !
Every morning when I wake up , the first tension that arises in my mind is what to make in the breakfast .
Knowing what to make is half the battle won .
I am a big lazybones so , I prefer making elaborate dishes on weekends .
Week days are for something quick yet tasty .
This morning I oped for Blueberry pancakes .
Remember I had got a box of frozen blueberries , a few days back from a friend .
Other than having it and making blueberry smoothie , I had saved the rest for trying some other blueberry recipes .
In pancake recipes , usually everyone uses all purpose flour for making pancakes .
Instead I used soya or soy flour which is gluten free and has low fat .
Soy flour is made from roasted soybeans that have been ground into a powder and is easily available in supermarkets and food store .
Buy it and store in a refrigerator .
You can make numerous healthy low fat dishes with it , replacing flour .
Ingredients
Method
1/2 cup soy flour3 tbsp soy milk or milk1 / 2 tsp baking powder2 tsp superfine sugar3 - 4 tbsp maple syrup1 / 2 cup canned blueberry 1 - 2 tbsp oil1 egg *
Mix soya flour , milk , baking powder , sugar and one egg yolk to make the thick batter of dropping consistency . *
Leave it for 10 - 15 minutes .*
Meanwhile whisk the egg white until fluffy .
Add it into the batter . *
Take a nonstick pan , brush it with oil and heat it .*
Pour the batter into the pan in a circular manner .
As soon as the lower side is done at blueberries on top . *
Then flip and let the other side also cook . *
Serve hot with maple syrup , blueberries .*
For garnishing sprinkle with sugar .

Damming rivers has slowed the flow of sediment that would replenish land Most of the world 's major river deltas are sinking , increasing the flood risk faced by hundreds of millions of people , scientists report .
Damming and diverting rivers means that much less sediment now reaches many delta areas , while extraction of gas and groundwater also lowers the land .
Rivers affected include the Colorado , Nile , Pearl , Rhone and Yangtze .
About half a billion people live in these regions , the researchers note in the journal Nature Geoscience .
They calculate that 85 % of major deltas have seen severe flooding in recent years , and that the area of land vulnerable to flooding will increase by about 50 % in the next 40 years as land sinks and climate change causes sea levels to rise .
" We argue that the world 's low - lying deltas are increasingly vulnerable to flooding , either from their feeding rivers or from ocean storms , " said Albert Kettner from the University of Colorado in Boulder , US .
Flooding in the Asian deltas of the Irrawaddy ... and the Ganges - Brahmaputra ... have recently claimed thousands of lives
Irina Overeem
University of Colorado
" This study shows there are a host of human - induced factors that already cause deltas to sink much more rapidly than could be explained by sea level alone . "
Most of the at - risk river basins are in the developing countries of Asia , but there are several in developed nations as well , including the Rhone in France and the Po in Italy .
The Po delta sank by 3.7 m during the 20th Century , mainly from methane extraction , the researchers say .
Sinking feeling
The researchers drew on data from various space missions including the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission , an 11 - day project run from the shuttle Endeavour in 2000 , and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers ( Modis ) carried on two Nasa satellites .
Combined with historical records and measurements of sea level rise , this allowed the team to view how fast land was sinking in some deltas , and to look at the various factors that might be responsible .
Of the 33 major deltas studied , 24 were found to be sinking .
THE HIGH - RISK LIST Deltas with " virtually no aggradation ( supply of sediment ) and / or very high accelerated compaction " Chao Phraya , Thailand Colorado , Mexico Krishna , India Nile , Egypt Pearl , China Po , Italy Rhone , France Sao Francisco , Brazil Tone , Japan Yangtze , China Yellow , China Possibly the worst affected is the Chao Phraya , the river that flows through Bangkok .
In some years , parts of the delta have sunk relative to sea level by 15 cm ( six inches ) .
This is significantly more than the global rate of sea level rise as a consequence of climate change ( 1.8 - 3.0 mm per year ) .
The flow of sediment down to the Chao Phraya delta has been almost entirely blocked , the researchers report - by taking water out for irrigation , damming the river , and directing the main flow through just a few channels .
Normally , this sediment would add to the height of the land , a process known as aggradation .
Taking water from aquifers for drinking , industry and agriculture is also compacting the ground , making it sink .
As the ground falls and sea level rises , people become more vulnerable to inundation during storms .
" Every year , about 10 million people are being affected by storm surges , " said Irina Overeem , another of the study team from the University of Colorado .
" Hurricane Katrina may be the best example in the US , but flooding in the Asian deltas of the Irrawaddy in Burma and the Ganges - Brahmaputra in India and Bangladesh have recently claimed thousands of lives as well . "
The team identifies the Mekong and the Pearl River delta near Hong Kong as places where similar disasters are likely in future .

BFS vs. mainline scheduler benchmarks and measurements
[ Kernel ] Posted Sep 7 , 2009 2:17 UTC ( Mon ) by corbet
Ingo Molnar has posted the results of a number of benchmark tests comparing the performance of the new BFS scheduler from Con Kolivas against the mainline CFS scheduler .
The results include a number of graphs , and a clear conclusion : " Alas , as it can be seen in the graphs , i can not see any BFS performance improvements , on this box . "
In fact , BFS generally performs worse .
Of course , Ingo might be seen as a not - entirely - objective observer ; it will be interesting to see what kind of results others might get .

Mikhail Gorbachev , now 78 , insists he brought many benefits to Russia Mikhail Gorbachev is remarkably serene about his record as the last leader of the Soviet Union .
He says he expected a different outcome , but he would do it all over again .
It was Mr Gorbachev 's policies that sparked the 1989 revolutions which swept away communism in Eastern Europe .
But Russia , too , went through a metamorphosis - and after the loss of the Soviet empire two years later , it was the Soviet Union itself that fell apart .
The result is that for many Russians , Mr Gorbachev 's years in the Kremlin remain bitterly contentious .
Greater freedom
Before this interview I was expecting to find a rather grumpy curmudgeon , worn down by the carping of his countrymen .
The fall of the Berlin Wall swiftly led to the reunification of Germany Instead I meet a genial and relaxed 78 - year - old , who sweeps into the room , without tie and without aides , and insists on shaking hands with everyone before settling down for the interview .
But once we start he defends his record robustly .
He ticks off , in quick - fire sentences , the benefits he brought to Russia , which he says people are still enjoying today - more freedom and a reordering of Russia 's relations with the world .
" I think that '89 was certainly change for the better - no doubt about it .
We did not have the necessary freedom , particularly freedom of speech , " he says .
" One of the most educated countries in the world had elections that - let 's put it mildly - were not real elections , half - elections - because you had a choice of just the one candidate . "
" A lot needed to be done at that time .
We needed change . "
The fall of the Berlin Wall brought joy to much of the world - but Margaret Thatcher and France 's President Mitterrand were worried
BBC Diplomatic editor Brian Hanrahan
Thatcher 's fight against German unity
The most spectacular change was the fall of the Berlin Wall , after which Germany drove full - speed towards reunification .
Mr Gorbachev was against it - and so , he learnt , were Mrs Thatcher and France 's President Mitterrand .
But he discovered that the Western leaders were relying on him to block the process .
" They insisted unification should not go on , that the process should be stopped , " he says .
" I asked them if they had any suggestions .
They had only one - that somebody else should pull their chestnuts out of the fire . "
He says they wanted him to say no and send troops , then adds : " That would be irresponsible .
They were mistaken . "
He repeats it for emphasis : " They were mistaken " .
He feels let down by Western leaders who he thinks took advantage of Russian weakness in the 1990s , and are to quick to criticise now when Russia asserts itself .
A ' non-person '
The interview is taking place in the Gorbachev Foundation - a modern purpose - built block on the outskirts of Moscow .
It is a bit like a US presidential library with archives from his time in office , a library for researchers and an exhibition of the awards and tributes to the man who effectively reshaped our world .
It 's astonishing that one man - though facing stern internal opposition - could give history such a decisive push
BBC Diplomatic editor Brian Hanrahan
Gorbachev 's role in 1989 turmoil Among them is the Nobel Peace Prize , awarded in 1990 .
But despite the international acclaim , in Russian politics Mr Gorbachev is something of non-person .
And he picks his words carefully - praising Vladimir Putin personally , as the man who stabilised the country , but leaving no doubt he sees a lot wrong with the way the country is run .
He dismisses United Russia , the dominant party which backs Mr Putin , as nothing more that a bad copy of the old Communist Party of the Soviet Union .
And he believes what Russia needs now is more democracy .
" We need to transform our country ; we need to modernise our country , " he says .
" This can not be done by pressure , by issuing commands and orders and administrative commands .
It can only be done through democracy , by establishing a free and democratic environment with people 's participation . "
Its clear , though , that he thinks this is something for Russians to sort out , without lectures from the outside world .
So what if Mr Putin is a bit harsh sometimes - that , he says , is a matter of style .
And so too is the current tandem leadership , split between the prime minister Mr Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev. Voters ' rights
Mr Gorbachev warns against a possible return by Mr Putin to the presidency
What does provoke him are recent hints from Mr Putin that he may be contemplating a return to the presidency in 2012 which could see him running the country for another 12 years .
Mr Gorbachev remarks waspishly : " I did n't like the phrase ' I will sit down with the president and we will decide ' . "
" I think that it should be decided by the voters - by the people , and I did n't hear him mention the people .
I do n't think that this is right . "
The one charge about his own time in power that Mr Gorbachev acknowledges is that he may have pushed change too quickly .
Today he leaves the impression that it is not coming fast enough .

I was brought to Israel against my will .
I am being held in this prison because I had a dream that Gaza ’s children could color and paint , that Gaza ’s wounded could be healed , and that Gaza ’s bombed - out houses could be rebuilt .
This is Cynthia McKinney , and I ’m speaking from an Israeli prison cellblock in Ramle .
[ I am one of ] the Free Gaza 21 , human rights activists currently imprisoned for trying to take medical supplies to Gaza , building supplies , and even crayons for children – I had a suitcase full of crayons for children .
While we were on our way to Gaza , the Israelis threatened to fire on our boat , but we did not turn around .
The Israelis hijacked and arrested us because we wanted to give crayons to the children in Gaza .
We have been detained , and we want the people of the world to see how we have been treated just because we wanted to deliver humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza .
At the outbreak of Israel ’s Operation “ Cast Lead ” [ in December 2008 ] , I boarded a Free Gaza boat with one day ’s notice and tried , as the US representative in a multi-national delegation , to deliver three tons of medical supplies to an already besieged and ravaged Gaza .
During Operation Cast Lead , US - supplied F - 16s rained hellfire on a trapped people .
Ethnic cleansing became full - scale and outright genocide .
US - supplied white phosphorus , depleted uranium , robotic technology , DIME weapons , and cluster bombs – new weapons created injuries never treated before by Jordanian and Norwegian doctors .
I was later told by doctors who were there in Gaza during Israel ’s onslaught that Gaza had become Israel ’s veritable weapons testing laboratory , where people used to test and improve the kill ratio of their weapons .
The world saw Israel ’s despicable violence thanks to al - Jazeera Arabic and PressTV that broadcast in English .
I saw those broadcasts live and around the clock , not from the USA but from Lebanon , where my first attempt to get into Gaza had ended because the Israeli military rammed the boat I was on in international water .
It ’s a miracle that I ’m even here to write about my second encounter with the Israeli military , again a humanitarian mission aborted by the Israeli military .
The Israeli authorities have tried to get us to confess that we committed a crime .
I am now known as Israeli prisoner number 88794 .
How can I be in prison for bringing crayons for kids ?
Zionism has surely run out of its last legitimacy if this is what it does to people who believe so deeply in human rights for all that they put their own lives on the line for someone else ’s children .
Israel is the fullest expression of Zionism , but if Israel fears for its security because Gaza ’s children have crayons , then not only has Israel lost its last shred of legitimacy , but Israel must be declared a failed state .
I am facing deportation from the state that brought me here at gunpoint after commandeering our boat .
I was brought to Israel against my will .
I am being held in this prison because I had a dream that Gaza ’s children could color and paint , that Gaza ’s wounded could be healed , and that Gaza ’s bombed - out houses could be rebuilt .
But I ’ve learned an interesting thing by being inside this prison .
First of all , it ’s incredibly black , populated mostly by Ethiopians who also had a dream … like my cellmates , one of whom is pregnant .
They are all in their twenties .
They thought they were coming to the Holy Land .
They had a dream that their lives would be better .
The once proud , never colonized Ethiopia has been thrown into the back pocket of the United States , and become a place of torture , rendition , and occupation .
Ethiopians must free their country because superpower politics [ have ] become more important than human rights and self - determination .
My cellmates came to the Holy Land so they could be free from the exigencies of superpower politics .
They committed no crime except to have a dream .
They came to Israel because they thought that Israel held promise for them .
Their journey to Israel through Sudan and Egypt was arduous .
I can only imagine what it must have been like for them .
And it was n’t cheap .
Many of them represent their family ’s best collective efforts for self - fulfillment .
They made their way to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees .
They got their yellow paper of identification .
They got their certificate for police protection .
They are refugees from tragedy , and they made it to Israel , but only after they arrived did Israel tell them , “ there is no UN in Israel . ”
The police here have license to pick them up and suck them into the black hole of a farce for a justice system .
These beautiful , industrious , and proud women represent the hopes of entire families .
The idea of Israel tricked them and the rest of us .
In a widely propagandized slick marketing campaign , Israel represented itself as a place of refuge and safety for the world ’s first Jews and Christian .
I too believed that marketing and failed to look deeper .
The truth is that Israel lied to the world .
Israel lied to the families of these young women .
Israel lied to the women themselves who are now trapped in Ramle ’s detention facility .
And what are we to do ?
One of my cellmates cried today .
She has been here for six months .
As an American , crying with them is not enough .
The policy of the United States must be better , and while we watch President Obama give 12.8 trillion dollars to the financial elite of the United States , it ought now be clear that hope , change , and “ Yes , We Can ” were powerfully presented images of dignity and self - fulfillment , individually and nationally , that besieged people everywhere truly believed in .
It was a slick marketing campaign as slickly put to the world and to the voters of America as was Israel ’s marketing to the world .
It tricked all of us but , more tragically , these young women .
We must cast an informed vote about better candidates seeking to represent us .
I have read and re-read Dr. Martin Luther King Junior ’s letter from a Birmingham jail .
Never in my wildest dreams would I have ever imagined that I too would one day have to do so .
It is clear that taxpayers in Europe and the US have a lot to atone for , for what they ’ve done to others around the world .
What an irony !
My son begins his law school program without me because I am in prison , in my own way trying to do my best , again , for other people ’s children .
Forgive me , my son .
I guess I ’m experiencing the harsh reality which is why people need dreams .
But I ’m lucky .
I will leave this place .
Has Israel become the place where dreams die ?
Ask the people of Palestine .
Ask the stream of black and Asian men whom I see being processed at Ramle .
Ask the women on my cellblock .
Ask yourself : what are you willing to do ?
Let ’s change the world together and reclaim what we all need as human beings : Dignity .
I appeal to the United Nations to get these women of Ramle , who have done nothing wrong other than to believe in Israel as the guardian of the Holy Land , resettled in safe homes .
I appeal to the United State ’s Department of State to include the plight of detained UNHCR - certified refugees in the Israel country report in its annual human rights report .
I appeal once again to President Obama to go to Gaza : send your special envoy George Mitchell there .
Engage Hamas as the elected choice of the Palestinian people .
I dedicate this message to those who struggle to achieve a free Palestine , and to the women I ’ve met at Ramle .
This is Cynthia McKinney , July 2nd , 2009 , also known as Ramle prisoner number 88794 .
Cynthia McKinney is a former US Congresswoman and Green Party presidential candidate .
The first African - American woman to represent the state of Georgia , McKinney served six terms in the US House of Representatives , from 1993 - 2003 and from 2005 - 2007 .
She was arrested and forcibly abducted to Israel while attempting to take humanitarian and reconstruction supplies to Gaza on June 30th .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia hopes the United States will extend the deadline to retire its space shuttles beyond 2011 and has heard unofficially it is possible , the head of Russia ’s space agency was quoted as saying on Friday .

The U.S. space agency NASA plans six more missions by its fleet of aging space shuttles by late next year or early 2011 after the construction of the $ 100 billion International Space Station ( ISS ) is completed .
The shuttles will then be retired .
But the head of Roscosmos , Russia ’s space agency , said he would prefer to see further shuttle missions to the Space Station , now in orbit 360 km ( 225 miles ) above Earth .
“ From some sources we have learned that it is possible to extend the life of the shuttle beyond 2011 , ” Roscosmos chief Anatoly Perminov was quoted by RIA news agency as saying .
Reuters was not invited to the briefing .
“ Then the situation would change substantially and it would be possible to work jointly with the Americans , unlike now , when the main burden ( for the ISS ) lies with the Russian side , ” Perminov was quoted as saying by Interfax .
Perminov said he had not been told this through official channels , Interfax news agency reported .
He added that NASA ’s new chief and former astronaut Charles Bolden would visit Russia ’s Baikonur cosmodrome on September 30 in his first foreign trip .
NASA ’s future strategy is currently under review with the main focus on possible flights to Mars .
It is also encouraging a private space taxi project to the ISS .
NASA ’s current plan , conceived under former President George Bush after the Columbia accident , is to complete the space station , retire the shuttles and build new spaceships .
A new rocket and capsule to transport astronauts to the ISS is also being developed but will not be operational until about 2015 .
Until then , NASA will rely on Roscosmos and must pay $ 50 million per seat for flights to the ISS by Soyuz capsules .
The U.S. , Russian and Chinese governments are the only entities currently capable of human orbital space flight , although several U.S. companies are developing vehicles and support services to do so .
Das Buch ist ein einziger endloser Rant , wie Scheiße alles ist , von der Zielgruppe her also durchaus passend * hust * .
Zwischen dem Gemecker kommen aber durchaus auch ein paar erheiternde Zahlen und Fakten .
Ich will mal exemplarisch ein paar Zeilen von Seite 205 zitieren , wo es um das Zuschaueralter im Fernsehen geht :
Selbst bei den Seifenopern der Generation Zahnspange liegen die Älteren vorn .

It seems telephone calls are not the only means of communication that leave our superfriends vulnerable to fits of uncontrollable , temporary rage .
This image was sent in from a trusted and dedicated constituent nearby in Astoria , Queens , mere blocks from the mutilated telephone detailed here just yesterday .
Linking these scenes now feels impossible to avoid .
It is clear our superheroes are suffering , for their mistakes are rapidly becoming far more conspicuous .
It could be that there was a follow - up letter for that dreaded phone call on Gramercy ’s 3rd Avenue and 16th Street corner– it ’s a simple hop on the N train from Union Square over to Queensboro Plaza ( or an even quicker route from the 4/5 to 59th and a transfer to the N/W ) that takes a maximum of 35 minutes , not taking into account the possibility of superspeed or flight .
Perhaps all of this results from a long - brewing dispute with origins at the phone just down the street from this mailbox .
These points plot neatly .
Putting all the possibilities for such connections aside for a moment , let us consider scenarios for a letter to exist entirely independent of any other forms of communication .
The first possibility springing to mind is the last common correspondence that has n’t fully pulled away from paper mail service : bills .
One could imagine the Human Torch receiving quite an electric bill for the months of July and August – and if he ’s rooming with Thing , well , that could be a recipe for a nasty stone - on - stone disaster producing results not unlike those seen below … but let ’s not get carried away here .
The nature of said letter or parcel , just as the subject of the conversation in Gramercy or that of the mysterious phone call that occurred a couple blocks from this pictured location , is pointless to speculate .
One thing is for sure ; there is someone ( or , there are multiple individuals ) out there with physical power unlike that of any ordinary human being .
Perhaps it ’s best that we take these innocuous reminders for what they are —
Proof : that there is an evil air most definitely stirring .
Reassurance : that superheroes are out there , and they are on our side .

That ’s how I came to find myself spending long periods crouching in a Venetian alley , peering through a kind of antique entry phone device into a private garden on the other side of which stood the gaunt , shuttered façade of Titian ’s house .
From the upper windows of the house , Titian could look out across the lagoon towards the peaks of his homeland – Cadore in the Dolomites .
While in his day his garden is said to have stretched down to the marshy water ’s edge , a whole block of later buildings now separates his house from the bustling embankment of the Fondamente Nuove .
The basic volume of the house remains as it was , but the interior has been so drastically remodelled over the centuries – it is now flats – that it has been pretty much ignored by art historians .
Yet the idea of that building , which may have been looted of important paintings after Titian ’s death during the plague epidemic of 1576 , provided the central motif in my book .
The Gay Sons of Allah Wave of Homophobia Sweeps the Muslim World
In most Islamic countries , gay men and women are ostracized , persecuted and in some cases even murdered .
Repressive regimes are often fanning the flames of hatred in a bid to outdo Islamists when it comes to spreading " moral panic . "

The Vatican has lashed out at criticism over its handling of its paedophilia crisis by saying the Catholic church was " busy cleaning its own house " and that the problems with clerical sex abuse in other churches were as big , if not bigger .
In a defiant and provocative statement , issued following a meeting of the UN human rights council in Geneva , the Holy See said the majority of Catholic clergy who committed such acts were not paedophiles but homosexuals attracted to sex with adolescent males .
The statement , read out by Archbishop Silvano Tomasi , the Vatican 's permanent observer to the UN , defended its record by claiming that " available research " showed that only 1.5 % - 5 % of Catholic clergy were involved in child sex abuse .
He also quoted statistics from the Christian Scientist Monitor newspaper to show that most US churches being hit by child sex abuse allegations were Protestant and that sexual abuse within Jewish communities was common .
He added that sexual abuse was far more likely to be committed by family members , babysitters , friends , relatives or neighbours , and male children were quite often guilty of sexual molestation of other children .
The statement said that rather than paedophilia , it would " be more correct " to speak of ephebophilia , a homosexual attraction to adolescent males .
" Of all priests involved in the abuses , 80 to 90 % belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17 . "
The statement concluded : " As the Catholic church has been busy cleaning its own house , it would be good if other institutions and authorities , where the major part of abuses are reported , could do the same and inform the media about it . "
The Holy See launched its counter–attack after an international representative of the International Humanist and Ethical Union , Keith Porteous Wood , accused it of covering up child abuse and being in breach of several articles under the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
Porteous Wood said the Holy See had not contradicted any of his accusations .
" The many thousands of victims of abuse deserve the international community to hold the Vatican to account , something it has been unwilling to do , so far .
Both states and children 's organisations must unite to pressurise the Vatican to open its files , change its procedures worldwide , and report suspected abusers to civil authorities . "
Representatives from other religions were dismayed by the Holy See 's attempts to distance itself from controversy by pointing the finger at other faiths .
Rabbi Joseph Potasnik , head of the New York Board of Rabbis , said : " Comparative tragedy is a dangerous path on which to travel .
All of us need to look within our own communities .
Child abuse is sinful and shameful and we must expel them immediately from our midst . "
A spokesman for the US Episcopal Church said measures for the prevention of sexual misconduct and the safeguarding of children had been in place for years .
Of all the world religions , Roman Catholicism has been hardest hit by sex abuse scandals .
In the US , churches have paid more than $ 2bn ( £ 1.25 bn ) in compensation to victims .
In Ireland , reports into clerical sexual abuse have rocked both the Catholic hierarchy and the state .
The Ryan Report , published last May , revealed that beatings and humiliation by nuns and priests were common at institutions that held up to 30,000 children .
A nine - year investigation found that Catholic priests and nuns for decades terrorised thousands of boys and girls , while government inspectors failed to stop the abuse .
September 7 , 2009 – Henry Ford believed in using Hemp products to make cars .
He was green 50 years before GREEN was cool .
Henry Ford predicted back in 1925 that the future fuels used to power automobiles , trucks , planes , and power boat engines would come from sustainable and more eco-friendly resources than fossil fuels .
He even aggressively supported the use of hemp products to create bio-degradable auto parts .
With so many changes happening in the auto industry , companies like Fisker and Tesla working on electric models , motorsports competitors participating in Formula 3 Racing looking closely at bio-fuels , big name exotics company leaders like Ferrari — who participate in Formula 1 and are planning to release hybrid exotics on the market soon as alternative power source vehicles , sportscar companies like BMW releasing Hydrogen cars , and luxury car companies like Lexus promoting hybrid model daily drivers are finally beginning to provide consumers that are making life more green while keeping owners on the go .
Fuel of the Future
When Henry Ford told a New York Times reporter that ethyl alcohol was “ the fuel of the future ” in 1925 , he was expressing an opinion that was widely shared in the automotive industry .
“ The fuel of the future is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road , or from apples , weeds , sawdust — almost anything , ” he said .
“ There is fuel in every bit of vegetable matter that can be fermented .
There ’s enough alcohol in one year ’s yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for a hundred years . ”
Ford recognized the utility of the hemp plant .
He constructed a car of resin stiffened hemp fiber , and even ran the car on ethanol made from hemp .
Ford knew that hemp could produce vast economic resources if widely cultivated .
Ford ’s optimistic appraisal of cellulose and crop based ethyl alcohol fuel can be read in several ways .
First , it can be seen as an oblique jab at a competitor .
General Motors had come to considerable grief that summer of 1925 over another octane boosting fuel called tetra - ethyl lead , and government officials had been quietly in touch with Ford engineers about alternatives to leaded gasoline additives .
Secondly , by 1925 the American farms that Ford loved were facing an economic crisis that would later intensify with the depression .
Although the causes of the crisis were complex , one possible solution was seen in creating new markets for farm products .
With Ford ’s financial and political backing , the idea of opening up industrial markets for farmers would be translated into a broad movement for scientific research in agriculture that would be labelled “ Farm Chemurgy . ”
Why Henry ’s plans were delayed for more than a half century
Ethanol has been known as a fuel for many decades .
Indeed , when Henry Ford designed the Model T , it was his expectation that ethanol , made from renewable biological materials , would be a major automobile fuel .
However , gasoline emerged as the dominant transportation fuel in the early twentieth century because of the ease of operation of gasoline engines with the materials then available for engine construction , a growing supply of cheaper petroleum from oil field discoveries , and intense lobbying by petroleum companies for the federal government to maintain steep alcohol taxes .
Many bills proposing a National energy program that made use of Americas vast agricultural resources ( for fuel production ) were killed by smear campaigns launched by vested petroleum interests .
One noteworthy claim put forth by petrol companies was that the U.S. government ’s plans “ robbed taxpayers to make farmers rich ” .
Gasoline had many disadvantages as an automotive resource .
The “ new ” fuel had a lower octane rating than ethanol , was much more toxic ( particularly when blended with tetra - ethyl lead and other compounds to enhance octane ) , generally more dangerous , and contained threatening air pollutants .
Petroleum was more likely to explode and burn accidentally , gum would form on storage surfaces and carbon deposits would form in combustion chambers of engines .
Pipelines were needed for distribution from “ area found ” to “ area needed ” .
Petroleum was much more physically and chemically diverse than ethanol , necessitating complex refining procedures to ensure the manufacture of a consistent “ gasoline ” product .
However , despite these environmental flaws , fuels made from petroleum have dominated automobile transportation for the past three - quarters of a century .
There are two key reasons :
First , cost per kilometer of travel has been virtually the sole selection criteria .
Second , the large investments made by the oil and auto industries in physical capital , human skills and technology make the entry of a new cost - competitive industry difficult .
Until very recently , environmental concerns have been largely ignored .
All of that is finally changing as consumers demand fuels such as ethanol , which are much better for the environment and human health .

Google - designed Android operating system is clearly the flavor of the season as seen by the launch of LG 's latest phone .
The new LG phone , unimaginatively named LG - GW620 , will the company 's first Android - based device .
It will feature a 3 - inch full touchscreen and slide out QWERTY keypad .
LG did not offer detailed specs for the phone .
The new device is expected to be first available in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year .
The company has not disclosed the pricing for the device and has n't said when it will be released in North America .
" Our objective is to provide a wide selection of smartphones to satisfy the diverse preferences of today ’s consumers , " said Skott Ahn , president and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile .
" This Android phone is just one of many smartphone models we plan to introduce worldwide in the years ahead . "
LG 's Android phone comes on the heels of its rival handset maker Motorola introducing an Android - based device of its own called Cliq .
A feature - packed phone , the Cliq has a touch screen , physical slide - out keyboard , a 5 - megapixel camera , Wi-Fi , 3G connectivity , the ability to shoot video at 24 frames per second , a standard headphone jack and GPS capability .
The device also sports a custom - designed user interface that integrates email , text messages , social networking feeds from sites such as Facebook , Twitter , and MySpace and photos .
Other companies such as Samsung and Sony Ericsson are also looking to introduce new Android - based phones later this year .
Unlike Motorola , LG wo n't focus on Android alone and will continue to churn out phones running Windows Mobile , says the company .
LG plans to announce three new Windows Mobile - based smartphones in the next few weeks and a total of 13 new smartphones that run Windows Mobile over the next 16 months .

The gel has helped repair brain injury in rats
An injectable hydrogel could aid recovery from brain injury by helping stimulate tissue growth at the site of the wound , researchers say .
Research on rats suggests the gel , made from synthetic and natural sources , may spur growth of stem cells in the brain .
The gel has been developed by Dr Ning Zhang at Clemson University , South Carolina , who presented her work to a conference on military health research .
She predicted the gel may be ready for human testing in about three years .
Our strategy can potentially be applied to head injuries caused by car accidents , falls and gunshot wounds
Dr Ning Zhang
Clemson University
Following a brain injury the tissues tend to swell up and this causes the loss of even more cells , compounding the damage caused by the original wound .
The standard treatments attempt to minimise this secondary damage at the site of the injury , for instance by lowering the temperature or relieving the build up of pressure .
However , their impact is often limited .
Scientists believe that transplanting donor brain cells into the wound to repair tissue damage is potentially a more productive approach .
Donor cells
But while this method has had some success in treating some central nervous system diseases , it has produced very limited results when used to treat brain injuries .
The donor cells do not tend to thrive at the site of injury , or to stimulate repair .
This could be due to inflammation and scarring at the injury site , and the lack of supportive tissue and blood supply to provide the necessary nutrients .
Researchers say the advantage of the new gel , which is injected into the injury in liquid form , is that it can be loaded with different chemicals to stimulate various biological processes .
First , Dr Zhang used it to help re-establish a full blood supply at the site of a brain injury in rats , potentially providing a much more friendly environment for donor cells to thrive .
Then , in follow - up work , she loaded it with immature human stem cells and the chemicals they need to develop into fully fledged adult brain cells .
After eight weeks of treatment with this mixture rats with severe brain injuries showed signs of making a significant recovery .
Dr Zhang , whose work is funded by the US Department of Defense , said : " We have seen an increase in brain injuries due to combat , but our strategy can also potentially be applied to head injuries caused by car accidents , falls and gunshot wounds . "
She said the gel could potentially be loaded with different factors to make it useful for patients at varying stages following injury .
Professor James Fawcett , of the Cambridge University Centre for Brain Repair , said a brain - compatible gel that could inhibit scar formation and prevent the release of toxic molecules following brain injury would be a significant advance .
Headway , the brain injury association , said the research looked very interesting and could potentially be a " significant step foward " .
But in a statement , the charity said : " It is important to remember , however , that no human trials have taken place at this stage and a great deal more research is required before this method of regenerating brain tissue following traumatic injury can be heralded .
" We are some years away from the possible therapeutic use of this gel and it is important the expectations of people with brain injury are managed to avoid promises of miracle cures . "

Several airline advertising slogans have become memes in our culture even though the airlines that used them no longer exist .
For example ...
“ It ’s the only way to fly ! ” –
The famed ad slogan used by Western Airlines , starting in 1956 , which became a familiar saying .
“ If you 've got it , flaunt it ” - The ad slogan used by Braniff Airways , starting in late 1968 or early 1969 .
It was apparently inspired by the famous line said by Zero Mostel in Mel Brooks ’ great 1968 comedy movie , The Producers : “ That 's it baby , when you got it , flaunt it !
Flaunt It ! ” “ I 'm [ Name ] .
Fly me . ” ( e.g. , “ I ’m Cheryl .
Fly me . ” ) -
The suggestive ad slogan used by National Airlines in the 1970s .
Another famous airline ad slogan that ’s still quoted is “ Fly the friendly skies of United . ”
According to the U.S. Trademark Database , “ Fly the friendly skies of United ” it was first used in commerce by United Airlines on September 27 , 1965 .
It was created by legendary American ad man Leo Burnett , who also created such cultural icons as the Jolly Green Giant , the Marlboro Man , Charlie the Tuna and Tony the Tiger .
In the vintage United Airlines TV ads and print ads that used the slogan , it looked like it would be a pleasure to fly in those comfy seats , being taken care of by those happy , friendly ladies - who - were - still - called - stewardesses - not - flight - attendants .
“ Fly the friendly skies ” was the airline industry ’s longest running marketing message .
It was finally retired in 1997 .
United replaced it with the unmemorable one - word ad slogan “ Rising ” ( which did n’t make it into the quotation books ) .
Unlike the airlines that had the other famous ad taglines I mentioned , United is still flying .
In fact , despite various rocky financial periods it ’s one the biggest surviving airlines .
However , given the high - security , delay - ridden , pay - for - all - extras , cattle - car experience of air travel today , United ’s “ Fly the friendly skies ” slogan is now generally cited in jest or derision .
Here are some of the other famous quotes and phrases linked to SEPTEMBER 27 :
Eigentlich hätten nur die Teilnehmer des jährlichen Microsoft Venture Capital Summit davon erfahren sollen .
Doch einer von ihnen plauderte bei Twitter über Steve Ballmers Schelte am hauseigenen Windows Mobile 6.5 .
Dieser Kurzfassung ist zu entnehmen , dass der Software - Riese es bei seinem mobilen Betriebssystem " vergeigt " habe ( " screwed up " ) .
Wäre es nach den Wünschen des Microsoft - Chefs gegangen , hätte die Firma schon Windows Mobile 7 veröffentlicht – Version 6.5 erscheint jedoch erst am 6 .

I 'm writing this post in order to ensure that a response I left in the comments section at Dembski's blog is reproduced in a more reliable little corner of the web ; Dembski and his moderators are notorious for disallowing comments that they find uncomfortable .
If you have no interest in intelligent design - though you should , as the movement constitutes one of the greatest threats to what we 've gained as a species since the Enlightenment , and will continue to pursue its objectives even with decreased media buzz - then you should probably skip this .
Gil , if my work is so misleading that my readers have become my " victims , " then you or Dembski or anyone else should refute the dozens of points that I have made about intelligent design and the telling behavior of its advocates .
Dembski has read my book or at least skimmed it .
He has written two posts about it .
But he has not actually refuted anything I have written .
The sole exception was his objection to my references to the Book of Revelation ; regarding prophecies of stars falling to the Earth , he cited C.S. Lewis ’s assertion that the Bible is written for " grown - ups " who know how to separate metaphor from literalism .
It ’s a strange objection coming from him ; millions of ID sympathizers believe that the Book of Revelation is to be taken literally and will play out more or less as described .
Perhaps Dembski thinks that these Biblical literalists are not " grown-ups " ?
If so , he should say this plainly .
He should tell the members of ID ’s " natural constituency " that their beliefs are childish .
The advocates of intelligent design cannot refute what I ’ve written about their movement because there is nothing to refute .
Also , I can ride my bike real fast .
Those of you who are interested in learning more about intelligent design and the threat that it represents to Western civilization should consider adding biologist PZ Myers ' excellent blog Pharyngula to your daily bloggity blog blogosphere blog reading sessions .
Update - 7:52 EST
The comment I left at Uncommon Descent blog is still " awaiting moderation " nearly an hour after I left it , even as other comments posted after mine have already been approved for viewing .
One would think that I would have the right to comment on a post concerning Barrett Brown insomuch as that I 'm the world 's greatest expert on Barrett Brown , but apparently not .
This is the way these people operate ; they are intellectual cowards .
Update - 10:04 EST
After I updated my Huffington Post article to note that they 'd disappeared my comment , the folks at Uncommon Descent finally decided to let it through .
Baby steps !

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi moves in a rarefied world of high society and high - level politics — and nothing underscores that fact quite like her plans for the August recess .
Pelosi 's plan :
Wine , dine big donors
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi moves in a rarefied world of high society and high - level politics — and nothing underscores that fact quite like her plans for the August recess .
Pelosi will spend next weekend quietly tending to top party donors and political allies at a series of private events in Northern California .

The two - day “ issues conference ” starts next Friday night with a dinner for roughly 170 guests on the back lawn of Pelosi ’s multimillion - dollar home in the fashionable Pacific Heights neighborhood in San Francisco .
The following day , Pelosi will shepherd her guests to a Napa Valley winery with buildings designed by world - famous architect Frank Gehry ; the speaker and her husband , investor Paul Pelosi , own a nearby vineyard worth between $ 5 million and $ 25 million , according to her annual financial disclosure report .
There ’s nothing unusual about leaders using recess to fund - and friend - raise .
Before leaving town last week , House Minority Whip Eric Cantor raked in $ 1.1 million for fellow Republicans at a lobbyist - heavy fundraiser on Capitol Hill .
And Pelosi ’s staff notes that her California session will involve more than just schmoozing with the wealthy and well - connected .
The speaker will lead policy discussions on health care , energy reform and the economy , among other topics .
Scheduled to speak are Obama adviser David Axelrod , CNN commentator and former Clinton adviser James Carville and Mark Zandi , an economic adviser to Arizona Republican Sen .
John McCain ’s presidential campaign who has been providing advice to the Obama White House .
More than a dozen other House Democrats will be in attendance , too , including Massachusetts Rep.
Ed Markey , a key player on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee ; Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller of California , Pelosi ’s closest ally in the House ; Xavier Becerra of California , vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus ; and Joseph Crowley of New York and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida , two up - and - coming Democrats who have previously found themselves in Pelosi ’s doghouse but are moving to get back into her good graces .
The weekend event is technically not a fundraiser .
In the parlance of fundraising pros , it ’s known as “ donor maintenance , ” a “ thank you ” from Pelosi to those who have given generously to her and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
To be invited , one must have raised money for the DCCC , been a longtime friend of Pelosi ’s or contributed $ 30,4000 to the DCCC this cycle .
The maximum an individual may give to a national party committee in any one year .
A donation to the DCCC of that size qualifies a donor to be part of the “ Speaker ’s Cabinet , ” a fundraising program that gives supporters expanded access to Pelosi .
In addition to the annual Napa weekend , Pelosi also will personally provide at least one more private briefing for these maxed - out donors .
According to campaign reports filed by the DCCC , at least 170 individuals , as well as a handful of Native American tribes , reached that maximum donation threshold as of June 30 .
San Francisco and Bay Area bigwigs are prominent among the collection of big DCCC supporters , including Ann Getty Earhart , an heiress to the Getty oil fortune ; Elizabeth Fisher , whose in - laws founded The Gap , the retail clothing giant ; and Eugene Eidenberg , a former Carter White House staffer who is now a San Francisco venture capitalist .
Paul Pelosi owns up to $ 50,000 in stock in the investment firm that Eidenberg helped co-found , Granite Ventures , according to Pelosi ’s annual disclosure report .
Pelosi ’s aides are tight lipped about who will go to this year ’s event , but the guest list is expected to include Phil Angelides , a Pelosi ally who unsuccessfully ran against California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006 ; Steve Elmendorf , a prominent Democratic lobbyist ; Dick Gephardt , the former House minority leader and Democratic presidential candidate ; Richard and Judy Guggenhime , Pelosi ’s close friends and neighbors ; Michelle Lerach , wife of the now - imprisoned plaintiff attorney Bill Lerach ; George Marcus , a Bay Area commercial real estate broker ; Heather and Tony Podesta , a Washington power couple ; Marc Stanley , chairman of the National Jewish Democratic Council and a big party fundraiser ; Steve and Mary Swig , Pelosi friends and financial backers ; and Brian Wolff , Pelosi ’s longtime fundraising and political guru who is now a lobbyist for the Edison Electric Institute .
Altogether , more than 165 guests have already committed to attend the Pelosi weekend , according to informed sources .
“ Speaker Pelosi has spent years developing and keeping engaged a broad network of support from the best and brightest minds across America , and they care deeply about the issues facing the country and the Democratic agenda , ” said Jennifer Crider , the DCCC ’s deputy executive director and Pelosi ’s political director .
Pelosi , though , will not allow PAC representatives to attend her weekend soiree , and it ’s not a chance for lobbyists to curry favor with the speaker , so relatively few take part .
In the words of one past attendee , “ They do n’t cut any deals [ at this event ] , so those looking to do so are discouraged from coming . ”
Since her initial run for Congress in 1987 , Pelosi has forged an eclectic mix of political and financial supporters — a blend of Bay Area elites , Washington power players , labor unions , progressive corporate execs , trial lawyers , “ old money ” families from both coasts and Paul Pelosi ’s business connections .
And the veteran Democratic lawmaker has mined this group with enormous success , for herself and for her party .
Pelosi goes out of her way to court these donors .
Her personal touches include frequent gifts of flowers — orchids are her favorite — or chocolate .
She will call a sick family member of a big contributor or reach out to her supporters for their take on important policy issues .
“ She is very good at the personal , retail level of this stuff , ” said Steven Kazan , an Oakland - based attorney specializing in asbestos litigation .
Kazan cut a $ 30,400 check to the DCCC in February but is n’t sure if he will get to Pelosi ’s weekend gathering .
Kazan is among the wealthy Pelosi backers who take their cues from the speaker when it comes to giving money to House incumbents and candidates .
“ With the House of Representatives , I long ago decided that I could not figure out what races were important , ” said Kazan , who is constantly hit up for campaign donations .
“ When someone calls [ for a campaign donation ] , I tell them , ‘ Nancy Pelosi is my leader .
If your name is on her list , I ’ll give you some money .
If it ’s not , I ’m real sorry , but take it up with Nancy . ’ ”
Junior Democrats like Reps. Zack Space of Ohio , Mary Jo Kilroy of Ohio , Dina Titus of Nevada , Michael Arcuri of New York , Betsy Markey of Colorado , Martin Heinrich of New Mexico , Steve Driehaus of Ohio , John Boccieri of Ohio and Suzanne Kosmas of Florida have received tens of thousands from Pelosi ’s friends and supporters .
Republicans have derided conservative and moderate Democrats who accept money from Pelosi ’s friends for buying into her “ San Francisco values ” such as support for gay rights , abortion rights and an end to the U.S. military presence in Iraq .
Pelosi ’s aides and backers dismiss the GOP criticism as misguided and unrealistic .
They say that it is the role of a modern speaker to help his or her vulnerable members raise money for their reelection campaigns , especially in a tough political environment .
Pelosi has committed to personally raising $ 25 million for the DCCC this cycle , and party sources say she has already helped take in $ 10.7 million , with more than 14 months to go before the midterm elections .
The title of this blog is not mine , it belongs to Paul Ferrell of CBS Marketwatch who used it in a piece penned and posted yesterday to one of the largest financial websites in the business .
I am reposting a portion of it here because I find it interesting as an indicator of social mood .
Let ’s face it , a growing swath of people are not comforted by the V - shaped return of the stock market but instead see a continuation of the policies and power structures that got us into this mess in the first place .
More and more people are simply fed up with the financial and economic looting that has already taken place and downright angry to see that it is continuing unabated .
To the list of looted items tossed onto an already well - lit bonfire we can now add " the future " and " time " because the various stimulus programs and bailouts have done nothing to get us onto a sustainable path of repair .
But seeing such things openly in print in the mainstream media reveals a profound shift in attitudes .
New bull , new bubble , new meltdown by 2012 Americans are not going to put up with the " Wall Street Conspiracy " ripping off investors and taxpayers much longer .
Wall Street got rich sticking us with mountains of debt for generations to come .
Expect a major house - cleaning , a second American Revolution .
We predicted the " Great Depression 2 " around 2012 .
Well , we doubt taxpayers will passively sit one more time , like in the 1930s , in 2000 , and the past few years .
Next time voters will take a page from the history books about past revolutions in the American Colonies , France and Russia .
A perfect storm will erupt in a massive global credit meltdown , bringing down Wall Street and the clandestine $ 670 trillion shadow central banking system .
And the collateral damage will be massive and widespread , in areas such as these : Lobbyists ’ power is lethal to our values .
Special interests are running and destroying American democracy , will self - destruct .
Derivatives : Cap ‘n trade will crash worse than subprime .
The Goldman Conspiracy ’s spending millions lobbying for trillion - dollar derivatives .
" Too - greedy - to - fail " big banks will trigger harsh backlash .
Banks pay huge bonuses yet modify only 9 % of 4 million stressed home loans .
America ’s wealth gap will trigger grass - roots rebellion .
Wall Street ’s greed is so pervasive , gluttonous and obvious the rest will rebel .
The " Goldman Conspiracy " will be a target for retribution .
Goldman ’s hubris is most egregious and flagrant .
Their arrogance will backfire .
Wave of creative destruction will revive commercial banking .
Investment bankers are killing commercial banking , Glass - Steagall will return .
Secrecy protecting Wall Street ’s unethical behavior to end .
Wall Street ’s control over Washington ’s lawmaking will come to an end .
The Fed ’s shadow banking will collapse under excess debt .
Central bank balance sheets overdrawn , feeding new bubble with cheap money .
A " Black Swan " of huge unintended consequences .
Next bubble , highly unpredictable , huge collateral damage on Wall Street .
Make the most of this new bull .
Then get out — before you ’re the collateral damage .
Part of the anger stems from the fact that it is patently obvious that the entire rescue is aimed at banks , by banks and for banks with any ancillary benefits accruing to citizens a matter of accident .
With interest rates held at zero percent several classes of citizens are harmed .
Savers now receive next to nothing on bank deposits and those dependent on cash flow from safe , fixed - income bonds for their living expenses can attest that it is tough going out there .
But banks ?
Banks love being able to borrow at near zero percent and then loan it out at much higher rates .
That is , in fact , the precise recipe for returning banks to financial health .
You might think that banks would carefully tend their public images by sharing some of the bounty offered by the zero percent financing provided central banks , but you ’d be wrong .
Banks are making the highest profits on mortgages since records began 11 Aug 2009
The difference between the interest rate that banks charge and the rate at which they borrow is the biggest since the Bank of England started collecting data 15 years ago .
The figures demonstrate that , two years after the credit crunch began , consumers are being hit harder than ever , despite the Bank cutting interest rates to an all - time low of 0.5 per cent .
Last night senior politicians and campaigners called on banks , many of which have been propped up with billions of pounds of taxpayers ’ money , to “ play their part ” by lowering borrowing costs .
Today Mervyn King , the Governor of the Bank , is to unveil his latest quarterly predictions for the economy .
He is widely expected to say that lenders are failing to pass on billions of pounds of government support to consumers and small businesses .
According to analysis by Michael Saunders , the chief UK economist at Citigroup , the difference between these rates and the rate banks charge each other is at a record margin .
Banks are making a full 2 percentage points of profit on fixed rate mortgages – the first time this has happened , the Bank ’s data indicated .
Two years ago , lenders made 0.1 percentage points profit on a five - year deal .
At every turn we have banks acting rapaciously and with an extraordinary sense of entitlement and unlimited greed .
It is almost as if banks have lost the ability to understand that it is they who live off the efforts of others , not the other way around .
Politicians ( such as Mr. King above ) have remarked and complained about this mind - set and related actions , but so far have proven unwilling to apply any real force to the situation .
Even as public money has saved their profession and individual companies , banks and credit card companies have jacked up fees , yanked lines of credit , and feasted on the widest spreads in decades on their way to posting record profits in some cases .
And so people are becoming angrier and angrier and an increasingly lost Wall Street and Washington DC crowd , hopelessly tone - deaf to everything but the voices in their own echo chambers , seems unable to comprehend why this should be .
Which is why I sincerely hope that the trillions spent have not been utterly wasted and will provide some lasting benefit .
Because if it turns out that the trillions have all been thieved or diverted as seems to be the case , and the economy crashes back again , I can easily see the social mood turning just a little bit darker .
Let ’s hope not .
An alleged drink driver has collided with a parked ambulance that had its emergency lights flashing and sirens sounding in suburban Adelaide .
Police say the 22 - year - old man 's car hit the ambulance on Marion Road at Plympton Park just after 2:00 am ACST .
They say the car crossed the median strip and struck the front fence of a home .
The Ascot Park man allegedly recorded a blood alcohol reading of 0.187 .
He has lost his probationary licence and faces charges including drink driving .
Flour has long been an indicator of prosperity among a culture -- most societies that could grow , harvest , and grind grain into powder have been pretty well off , for the most part .
According to the Gallery of Flour Stacks , 320 million tons of wheat flour roll off the mills each year -- and that 's just for human consumption .
Flour is pretty indispensible , unless you 're on a gluten - free kick .
Unlike French fried onions or capers , flour is one of the few items you never have to hunt for in the grocery store .
Hunt down the baking aisle and it will always be loaded up on the bottom two shelves in a variety of sizes and textures .
Even the culinarily challenged majority of us have a plump bag perched in the pantry .
Instead of waiting for your next batch of cookies to put that pound to good use , consider other useful ways to utilize this ancient food supply .
1. Arts and Crafts Projects
Flour is amazing glue -- just mix some of it with water and let it dry on your counter to know what I mean .
Mix a one - to - one ratio of flour and water to make a nice thick mache paste - - great for piñatas or sculptures .
Color dough with food tint , cut into shapes , and bake to make your own Christmas ornaments .
Make playdoh or modeling clay with flour as a base .
Create salt and flour finger paint for a stain free , easy - to - clean activity .
2. Hygiene
Sometimes you hit the snooze button one too many times .
You need to wash out that hair but slept just a bit late .
Grab a tiny bit of flour ( baby powder works too ) and lightly rub into the roots of your hair .
Brush out and wipe off to soak up oil buildup at your roots .
This also works great if you go camping and can't get a good shampoo .
3. Clean Up
Sprinkle on small oil spills to soak up .
This also works with greasy stains on your clothing .
Let sit for 30 minutes before dusting off and washing .
Polish your silver or brass using equal parts of vinegar , flour , and salt .
Rub on , let dry , and buff off with a clean rag .
4. Critter Containment
Keep the ants away from the plants by pouring a small line of flour around your pots .
You can do the same with your perennials outside -- just mix flour and black pepper and sprinkle on the soil .
5. Other Unique Uses
Flour is more that a main ingredient in sweets .
If your soup is too runny , toss in a couple of tablespoon of flour to thicken it up .
Make great homemade gumbo using flour as a roux .
And did you know white wheat flour is the base ingredient for wallpaper paste ?

Speaking on Wall Street at noon Monday , President Obama laid blame for the crisis and recession of 2008 - 09 squarely at the feet of the financial sector .
The diagnosis was sound but the rest of his speech was disappointing – the administration ’s draft regulatory reforms look lame , banks are fully mobilized against the only proposal with any teeth ( a consumer protection agency for financial products ) , and the President ’s call to “ please do n’t do it again ” surely fell on deaf ears .
In fact , were any of the most relevant ears even listening ?
The real news from Monday was not the substance of the speech or the stony silence of the financial elite in the audience , but rather that not a single chief executive officer ( CEO ) of a major bank was in attendance .
This is striking because CEOs were the natural and repeated point of contact for the President and his staff throughout the crisis – as seen , for example , at the pivotal White House meeting in March .
This makes sense , because it was the CEOs whose jobs and reputations were on the line – people like Lloyd Blankfein ( Goldman Sachs ) , Kenneth Lewis ( Bank of America ) , Jamie Dimon ( JP Morgan Chase ) , and John Mack ( Morgan Stanley ) .
And these same CEOs are today the key decision makers for everything the President wants to urge : careful risk management , responsible compensation schemes , and improved business ethics .
These CEOs are , of course , busy people and no doubt many or all had good excuses and sent nice apology notes .
But their collective absence is beyond remarkable .
The President saved their jobs , bonuses , pensions and much more after he came in office ; this was a gutsy call on his part and one that may still sully his legacy .
And in this endeavor , the President represented both the Congress of the United States – for example , in deciding how to implement the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) – as well as all taxpayers and every citizen .
Usually , you have to stand in line for a long time to sit in the same room as the President of the United States .
But not a single big bank CEO apparently had the time to show a little respect or gratitude , and to pay even lip service to better behavior in the future ?
More than any technical discussion of raising capital standards or tightening leverage ratios , this presumably uncoordinated failure to show up speaks volumes about current attitudes on Wall Street .
The CEOs of our biggest banks have weighed the man and done the trade .
They have no more use for this President , no fear for what he can do to them , and see no reason to show support .
They have moved on – presumably back to whatever they were doing before the events of September 2008 so rudely interrupted .
And their obvious presumption , contrary to the words and body language of the President on Monday , is that next time – when they need it – the representative of the taxpayer will be there for them again , with generous bailout packages and extraordinary kindness .

ARLINGTON , Va. --
Alex Ovechkin arrived at training camp Saturday morning with some noticeable upper - body bulk and pumped - up expectations for the Washington Capitals .
The two - time league MVP and the Capitals reported for preseason camp , eager to erase the memories of a second - round loss in last spring 's playoffs to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins .
" On top .
On top of Pittsburgh , on top of everybody , " Ovechkin said , when asked where he expected the Capitals to finish the 2009 - 10 season .
Piloting a Zamboni down a New York City street and promoting an NHL - themed video game in Toronto -- Ovechkin's pursuits en route to Kettler Capitals Iceplex , where he took a physical and renewed acquaintances with teammates -- were merely diversions before the hard work begins .
" It 's time for us , I think , " said Ovechkin , parroting the slogan worn on teammates ' T - shirts emblazoned with the Stanley Cup .
" The organization , the guys understand that if we make the playoffs , it 's not [ enough ] .
Now we have to move forward . "
Despite scoring an NHL - high 56 goals last season , Ovechkin figures there 's room for improvement -- starting with himself -- if the Capitals are to attain that goal .
" This year , I want to be better , " he said .
The prospect of having an elite player step up his game and demanding that his teammates follow his example is intriguing to coach Bruce Boudreau .
" Improve ?
If he improves , great , " Boudreau said .
" We 'll take what he did last year and run with it .
But I 'm sure Alex wants to improve every time he steps on the ice .
I 'm sure this year 's no different . "
Three months in his native Russia must have been spent in the weight room , given the muscled shoulders hidden beneath Ovechkin 's gray T - shirt bearing the slogan " Get Ready It 's Our Time . "
" Yeah , I take some injections , " Ovechkin smiled .
A few minutes later , Ovechkin was on the ice , taking part in an unscheduled skate with teammate Alexander Semin , delighting a few dozen fans in attendance .
The Capitals tweaked their offense this summer by adding right wing Mike Knuble and center Brendan Morrison as free agents .
Knuble is a net - crasher that makes opposing goalies pay for not gobbling up shots , while Morrison adds a veteran presence to replace Sergei Fedorov , who departed for the Kontinental Hockey League in Russia .
Boudreau has 68 players in camp , but thinks the two - time defending Southeast Division champions may have only one open forward position .
On defense , Washington will pare a group of 10 or 11 candidates down to six or seven players who will make the roster for the Oct. 1 opener at Boston .
Jose Theodore , who was yanked in favor of rookie Semyon Varlamov after one game in the first round of the playoffs , has been anointed the No. 1 goalie by Boudreau .
But Theodore will have to stave off challenges from Varlamov and fellow rookie Michal Neuvirth .
Ovechkin is n't the only one pumped up over the Capitals ' prospects .
" We 're progressing , " said general manager George McPhee .
" We 've had two really good seasons .
Last year was better than the year before and we 're hoping this year will be even better . "
Added defenseman Mike Green : " Our expectation is to win the cup this year , and that 's the bottom line .
We 're all experienced now , we 're all old enough .
With a few additions this year , I think we 're ready . "

It 's at the end , past the Team Ico retrospective , but then , that 's worth watching in its own right .
You see her here , you see her there .
Sarah Brown , the normally reticent wife of the Prime Minister , is coming out into the open to battle for her husband 's political career .
She is the cook behind the " lasagne offensive " , which Gordon Brown has launched to improve working relationships with his cabinet ministers .
She has also stepped up the frequency of her public appearances , displaying the easy social skills she honed as the founder a PR agency before her marriage – skills in which her workaholic husband is notoriously deficient .
It is barely a month since two cabinet ministers , James Purnell and Hazel Blears , walked out of the Cabinet complaining , in effect , that they could not work with Brown any more .
He is accused of operating through a tiny cabal , which includes his old ally Ed Balls and the Cabinet First Secretary , Peter Mandelson , keeping other ministers out of the loop .
Caroline Flint , a middle - ranking minister who attended Cabinet , complained she was there only as " window dressing " when she too resigned .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Now , sitting at a round table with the smell of Mrs Brown 's cooking in their nostrils , ministers can have a more relaxed conversation with the Prime Minister than they can ever have in the cold formality of the Cabinet room with civil servants taking notes .
It is hoped that in these friendly chats Mr Brown can persuade his cabinet colleagues not to get involved in plots to remove him , which some fear will break out again in the autumn .
" He has been seeing a number of cabinet ministers socially , in the way you would expect in the run-up to the long summer break , " Mr Brown 's spokesman confirmed yesterday .
" But we are not going to be running a commentary on the menu – whether it is lasagne , pasta , or takeaway pizzas . "
There has only been one hiccup so far .
Mr Brown 's aides are still simmering because the Home Secretary Alan Johnson , a guest at one of the lasagne dinners , did not mention that he was going to make a public statement the next day that ID cards will never be compulsory , which changed the policy laid down by the Prime Minister .
Mrs Brown , 44 , has also been appearing in public as an informal ambassador for Downing Street and will be visible again when world leaders meet at L'Aquila in Italy for the G8 summit on Wednesday .
While her husband argues for more action to stimulate the world economy , she will carry out her separate programme of engagements , promoting charities with which she is associated .
Mrs Brown was photographed at the weekend marching alongside Michael Cashman , the openly gay Labour MEP at the gay pride march in London .
Mr Cashman and Mrs Brown were flanked by two men in drag .
She has also given a huge boost to the campaign run by Janis Sharp , the mother of a computer hacker who is the centre of an extradition battle .
Mrs Sharp 's son , Gary McKinnon , who has Asperger 's syndrome and is obsessed with UFOs , went computer hacking to hunt for " little green men " .
American security officers were not amused .
In the US , Mr McKinnon is accused of being a " cyber terrorist " , and if extradited could face a 60 - year jail sentence .
Mrs Sharp had nothing but praise for the Prime Minister 's wife after they met in Downing Street .
" She filled up with tears and I filled up with tears , " she said .
" She was very moved and was incredibly sympathetic .
She is a lovely , genuine person who clearly cares about people .
I think it was incredibly brave of her to meet us .
It was very heartening . "
And for her next trick ...
Mrs Brown to edit magazine
* Sarah Brown 's next project will showcase her PR skills , when she guest - edits an edition of Fabulous magazine , a News of the World supplement .
The Prime Minister 's wife , patron of the health research charity Wellbeing of Women ( WoW ) , has been working with the Fabulous editorial team to produce a special edition on women 's health issues .
It includes her interviewing Jools Oliver , wife of the TV chef Jamie , who overcame fertility problems to give birth to three healthy children .
" Guest editing this issue has certainly been a brilliant new experience for me , " Mrs Brown said in a statement .
" I 've loved every minute .
The 19 July edition marks the start of a campaign by the magazine to raise funds to help WoW 's scientists make the next breakthroughs in women 's health .
They do groundbreaking work .
It 's vital to share information with as many women as possible across Britain . "
In a judgment widening the scope of the right to life , the Supreme Court has held that forcible termination of pregnancy or denying a woman the choice to bear a child violates her fundamental right .
Conversely , refusal by a woman to bear a child , too , is a fundamental right .
“ A woman ’s right to privacy , dignity and bodily integrity should be respected , ” the court said on Friday , elaborating its reasons for allowing a mentally challenged rape victim from Chandigargh to give birth .
The court on July 21 had stayed the medical termination of pregnancy ( MTP ) of the woman .
The court said the legislative intent of the MTP Act , 1971 , was to provide a qualified ‘ right to abortion ’ and that termination of pregnancy has never been recognised as a normal recourse for expecting mothers .
Although there is little doubt that a woman ’s right to make reproductive choices too is a dimension of ‘ personal liberty ’ as understood under article 21 of the Constitution , the court said that it is important to recognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as abstain from procreating .
“ This means that there should be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such as a woman ’s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or , alternatively , the insistence on the use of contraceptive methods , ” a bench of chief justice KG Balakrishnan , and justices P Sathasivam and BS Chauhan held .
“ Furthermore , women are also free to choose birth - control methods such as undergoing sterilisation procedures .
Taken to their logical conclusion , reproductive rights include a woman ’s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term , to give birth and to subsequently raise children . ”
The bench also held that there are ‘ compelling state interests ’ in protecting the life of a prospective child .
Therefore , the termination of a pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions specified under the MTP
Act are fulfilled .
The Act says : “ No pregnancy of a woman who has not attained the age of 18 years , or , who , having attained the age of 18 years , is a mentally ill person , shall be terminated except with the consent in writing of her guardian … .
No pregnancy shall be terminated except with the consent of the pregnant woman . ”
The bench termed as ‘ anti - democratic ’ the measures taken to forcibly perform family planning surgeries and abortions on mentally retarded people .
It rubbished the belief that mental defects are passed on to the next generation .
In the case of the Chandigarh woman , an expert panel had said that though her mental age was that of a nine - year old , she understood the meaning of pregnancy and could do her own things .
Moreover , she wanted to bear the child .
Own your own tropical island for US $ 12,500.00 !!!
Here is what is likely the cheapest island for sale anywhere in the world right now , less than the price of many cars at just US $ 12,500 .
It is a tropical Brazilian island in an area called Salvador Bahia or Bay of Saints , which is along the north coast of the country .
Brazil has in the past few years seen some celebrities like Ricky Martin buy islands in a south part called Angra dos Reis , but I think for most investors it ’s a very overlooked market .
So what do you get for $ 12.5 K ?
Isla Amor , meaning Love Island in Portuguese , is just under one acre in size and lies 600 metres away from the coast .
It has nothing developed on it as of yet but looks like the perfect place for a small house .
The owner is technically giving it away ( buyer pays only legal fees ) because of bad memories after a divorce .
It sounds like a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone who wants a tropical island but not the big price tag !
Yoshiro Kimura 's Strange Journeys
By Brandon Sheffield
Yoshiro Kimura is a game director with a different way of looking at the world .
His 2002 PlayStation 2 game Chulip , unreleased in the U.S. until 2007 due to translation issues , puts the player in the role of a cherub who cheers up the inhabitants of a town by kissing them .
His latest game , Little King 's Story , was recently released for the Nintendo Wii in North America via XSeed and Marvelous .
In the game , you play as a young boy who becomes a king and must , in a strategy / simulationy sort of way , lead his townspeople to improve their kingdom and eventually take on the world .
He respects Shadow of the Colossus creator Fumito Ueda and Fable impresario Peter Molyneux -- and counts Katamari Damacy developer Keita Takahashi among his friends .
While Little King 's Story has n't gotten a lot of popular notice in the West just yet , it 's a creative and appealing game with a subversive sense of humor that currently sits with a quite impressive 87 rating on Metacritic .
Gamasutra recently had the chance to talk to Kimura about his influences and inspiration for the creation of Little King 's Story , as well as find out more about what direction his left - of - center development style might take in the future .
We also present pages from his sketchbook -- which he brought to our interview -- that show the games he 's worked on in the past , as well as new ideas forming in his head that may become games of their own one day ...
When I look at Little King 's Story , it 's very charming , but it 's still kind of a very niche oriented game -- kind of like your PlayStation 2 game Chulip was .
How can you market this kind of game , and to whom ?
Yoshiro Kimura : [ laughs ]
One of the things that I love to do , is I like to give an impression to people who play the game .
And the tendency lately is to go more realistic , make more movie - like games .
But because of that , I wanted to go in the opposite direction and stand out .
I really liked the storybook graphics in the intro .
I think it 's really quite nice looking .
I just hope that people wo n't think that it 's only for kids .
YK : That was one of my concerns as well .
The real essence of the game -- it has a lot of dark humor , ironies , and all the boss characters are unique in a way that all the adults can like look at it and enjoy it , too .
It just did n't really make sense if it was a realistic character doing those things , so we wanted to make it cute , to make those things more humorous .
I just hope that people will actually get to play it because the Wii is such a tough and oversaturated market right now .
YK : I did get a lot of the same questions with that , but I kind of made it towards the hardcore gamer in my mind , in the beginning .
In the very beginning of the game , it 's really simple .
Everybody can start playing , but the difficulty curve just jumps up .
Because the final boss is ridiculously hard .
You mentioned to me before that this is your favorite game that you have worked on .
Why is it so personal for you ?
YK : One of the ones that you mentioned before was Chulip , but that was actually one of my favorite games as well , because of the originality .
It 's a really original piece .
But at the same time , because I was still not experienced enough , the game design or the gameplay was n't up to the expectations that I wanted .
But I still wanted to have that strange quirkiness , and that 's what I implemented in Little King 's Story -- but with the good gameplay and level design .
So this is the game that meets your personal expectations ?
YK : In the very beginning , this was my goal , to make the game that I created .
But as I was going along , I started setting more goals that I wanted to create , so I want to implement that into the next title .
What 's next for you ?
YK : [ laughs ]
If possible , I want to go with Little King 's Story 2 .
If I am to create another Little King 's Story , I want to make it more adult - oriented , a little more artistic .
But it is artistic as it is right now .
The last time we spoke , I asked if you could ever foresee doing a whole in the graphical style of the intro .
Maybe something like that ?
YK : It 's just a vague idea that I have in my mind right now , but if that 's possible , yes , I want to use that utilize that opening image and try to make a game .
But at the same time , I want to try and create a game does n't really talk much -- not that much dialogue or text .
And people might say that 's just an action game , but my idea is something different .
One of Kimura 's new ideas -- a game about a girl who 's trapped in a prison , with a wolf for a guard .
I know what you mean .
In fact , I really like games that communicate story by showing instead of telling .
Like Ico , or something like that .
YK : I really think [ Ico creator Fumito ] Ueda - san games are really excellent .
He 's a genius .
When we spoke last , two years ago , the game was not done .
You were still figuring things out .
How has your vision of the game changed since then ?
At the time I asked , " If one of your villagers dies , do you have to explain to the kid where his dad went " ?
Is that still where you 're going ?
YK : So , [ we do n't offer ] much of an explanation , but there are some deep , sad parts about it .
For example , if there 's a family that 's only one adult and one child , and if that adult for some reason dies , at the funeral , there will only be that one kid going for the parent .
So , for example , if the group still travels together , they have this strong relationship with each other .
So , if that person dies , everybody comes to that funeral .
But if that one character does n't have that many friends , if you go to the funeral , there 's only a few guys mourning for him .
It sort of sounds like you still have the same kind of message that you want to send people -- it was a similar " We should get along with each other , " gather friends kind of message , correct ?
YK : It 's more of a message of , like , " We , as a group , " but it 's more like there 's a leader , which is the king -- or in real life it could be a president .
And each citizen will have their own life going within a world .
But if the king says , " Okay , I want to go to battle , " and just yank them out of their everyday life , they will complain about bit , but at the same time , at the end of the day , it 's what the king wants .
So , it 's how you want to bring them into it together .
Throughout the story , there 's a game system , but it 's really about co-existing with each other .
For example , there 's a leader and his subordinates .
And all the subordinates are looking up to you , and they want to follow you because you 're the leader -- the king .
But if you progress through the story , there are different kingdoms and different kings , and they have that same aspect .
People are looking up to them because that 's their mindset , and they think that 's the strongest king .
Later on , you 'll be fighting those kings to say who 's the more noble , who 's the better king .
But throughout the whole game , there 's the question of , " What is noble ?
What is to be more important ?
What does it mean to be the best in those kinds of aspects ? "
In Kimura 's game concept , the wolf guard is meant to be scary , but he 's old -- so he 's in a wheelchair .
However , it allows him to move quickly , and makes scary noises .
As the young prisoner , all you can do is run and hide .
It 's dealing with the responsibility of leadership .
YK : It could be described that way , but nothing too square like that .
More like each of the boss characters has their own characteristic , their own way of thinking of how people should live .
So for example , the land of the drunkards , the king is a drunken king , and everybody thinks that whichever king drinks the most is the most noble one .
And that 's because when he drinks , he 's happy , he 's jolly .
So , right when you meet him , he says , " World peace ! " and he says , " Cheers ! " , but right after that , he throws fire at you .
Another example is that there 's one where they think whoever is the tallest or whoever is at the highest location is the most noble one .
So , they 're all trying their best to be longer and taller and try to one up everybody .
The main character goes into that land because he 's still a kid .
He 's really small , so everybody is condescending to him .
By going to different kingdoms , you see their aspect of what 's good in that land .
So , one of the things that I want the U.S. audience to really watch and understand is that there 's a land of TV , and the king is called TV Dinner .
Basically , I got that idea because talking to people that I know in America , my friends and myself .
I love American TV .
And people in America really love TV .
So , in this land , people who watch the most TV or make the best programs are considered noble .
One of the things , I guess it 's not a spoiler , but I have n't talked to anybody about this -- but TV Dinner , his land is actually a world map .
It 's actually a world , so you 'll see little pins marking Italy , France , and Germany .
In each country , there 's a porter .
If you go talk to them , they 're talking about what the country is about .
TV Dinner thinks that he 's actually broadcasting to everybody .
But each country , they have their own biased opinion of what that country is .
So , for example , if you go talk to Italy , he 's saying something like , " People in Italy are all hairy , and they try to compete on who 's the hairiest . "
The king at the TV land , TV Dinner , he thinks broadcasting war is the most noble thing because a lot of people are interested in it .
So , he wants to have something going on .
So , as soon as the main character goes into their land , it becomes a world war within that section -- so World War III .
Is there some kind of message that you want to bring across with this TV land ?
Actually , I would be very unpopular TV because I do n't watch TV at all .
YK : More like I love watching TV , but I fear for myself -- that watching TV will make me stupid .
Me too .
So I stopped .
YK : I know that 's going to make me stupid , but I can't stop myself from watching it .
I really do n't say this much , but I love American TV .
So , every time I go to Europe or Africa or even Japan -- any place in the world , I always try to find major networks -- always trying to find like Heroes , Lost ...
And right now , I 'm really into American Idol and Six Feet Under .
When I 'm watching it , I 'm really happy watching it , but afterwards , I have just like a little bit of depression saying , " Ahhh ... I think I just wasted some time . "
So , with all that combined , that 's the reason I made this TV Land .
I have n't told this to that many people yet .
You should try The Wire and Dexter .
YK : I have n't seen The Wire , but I have seen Dexter .
That is funny .
It 's a little confusing because I have n't really seen this show , but it 's about a serial killer trying to be hero or something , and the father advises him to kill bad people .
Yeah , he has the feelings of a serial killer and he can't escape it , so his father , who is a cop , told him , " You should only focus on bad people , because I know you can't control it . "
So , actually , he works in the forensics department of the police -- so he actually is helping the police .
But when he sees someone who is beyond reform , then he will kill them and sink them into the lake .
YK : [ laughs ]
Yeah , he 's like watching them .
You mentioned , in Japanese , a " nobi-nobi " country .
What did you think of Noby Noby Boy ?
YK : I have n't had time to really play that .
But actually , Takahashi - san is a friend of mine .
He often comes to my house to play .
I have a lot of game creators come to my house , and we have drinks as well .
Takahashi - san used to live really close to me , like 200 meters away .
Walking distance .
Do you have any thoughts on Microsoft 's upcoming Project Natal ?
I think you would be very interested to see it .
Peter Molyneux presented a demo for it at E3 .
YK : I love Peter Molyneux .
Especially like the AI part , there 's a person who 's kind of like Peter Molyneux in Japan , Yasanaga - san , and he was involved in the AI process in Little King 's Story .
So , I 'm really looking forward to it .
I think his work is really great .
I 'm looking forward to it .
There 's no way I could beat Peter Molyneux . [ laughs ]
It seems like it's a kind of fit for the type of game that you like to work on .
Like Chulip , where you have to go around and kiss a bunch of people .
If you could actually do that in reality , that would be interesting .
YK : [ laughs ]
Yeah , I want to make an American version of Chulip .
Right now I have something in my mind , it 's getting together , but I 'm thinking about like a New York Bronx type of setting with an African - American kid , or a Caucasian , Asian , does n't really matter , but will be going around kissing everybody -- the American version .

The USSR newspapers first wrote about organizing a Soviet expedition to Antarctic on August 23 , 1955 .
Three months later , on November 30 , 1955 everything was just ready for the maiden voyage and Ob ’ diesel - electric ship put out to sea from Kaliningrad to the coldest continent .
It reached its destination on January 5 , 1956 with captain I.A. Mun at the controls .
The ship sailed along a narrow passage between icebergs to Farr Bay and moored to the land covered with ice .
Later two other ships joined the pioneer to help in carrying out the mission .
Debarcation was a real trouble , as this area was very little explored and proved to be one of the most severe and difficult sites for life and work .
The expedition was headed by Michail Somov , an experienced polar explorer , oceanographer and a geographer .
First Soviet people in this area came ashore on January , 5 , 1956 .
They raised the red flag of the USSR in a month and a half , and this very time the first ever base of Soviet Antarctic expeditions , Mirniy observatory , was founded .
During the year there are 204 days on the average when the wind blows at a speed of 15 m per sec .
Snowstorms and hurricanes always come with heavy blizzards , which are a usual thing in winter months .
As the observatory is located by the Polar circle , there are no polar nights , and polar days last for about a month , starting in December .
People who come there work on a regular basis in the coldest region in the world , and the latest expedition was the 53rd in the row .
Today the equipment is much better and the people know much more , but it ’s interesting to know what was in the origin .
Now you have this rare opportunity and can see the old photos of the first seasonal Russian expedition to Antarctic .

One criticism of the peak - oil theory is that technological improvements will paved the way for more oil finds in the near future .
That 's just not true , says Matt Simmons in Foreign Policy .
Four major pieces were written about oil in the past few weeks , each poking holes in the theory of peak - oil , and each was wrong in its own way , says Simmons .
The most interesting bone of contention to us , is Simmons assertion that we 're not going to see radically improved technology :
The final topic the Gang discussed was the rapid advances in oilfield technology .
Sadly , this is the greatest myth of all .
I spent four decades as an investment banker to the global oil - service industry , which collectively invented all of this technology .
The concept that there are new innovations in this area is false .
In fact , the seeds of this so - called technological revolution -- the ability to exploit oil from deep water or drill horizontally -- were first developed 40 years ago .
I personally raised a great deal of the venture capital that helped implement some of the most important technical advances in the industry .
Our firm , through advising on mergers , consolidations , reorganizations , and bankruptcies , helped save the oil - service companies that created these great technological advances that help us find and commercially exploit oil and gas .
None of this technology is new -- in fact , it is now quite mature .
Sadly , there are few new ideas in the oilfield pipeline to replace advances that were made decades ago .

Italian atheist sues priest over Jesus ' existence By Eric J. Lyman , Special for USA TODAY ROME 
An Italian atheist is suing a parish priest for saying Jesus Christ existed .
The hearing in a court in Viterbo , a city located in a valley 25 miles northwest of Rome , opened Friday and could take weeks to decide .
Luigi Cascioli , 72 , a lifelong atheist , is suing the Rev. Enrico Righi , 75 , a local parish priest .
The case has opened debate here over whether it 's appropriate for a civil court to decide matters of religious faith .
To some Italians , the case is a sign of growing secularism in their society .
" I do n't think this belongs in the court , and it never would have got there if the church was held in high esteem , as it used to be , " retired Roman teacher Lana Napoli , 62 , says .
" I do n't think I would want the church deciding on taxes or foreign policy , " said Federico Massaroti , 35 , a city worker in Rome .
" Why should the court worry about a religious topic ? "
Cascioli filed a civil suit against Righi in 2002 citing an Italian anti-fraud law designed to target advertisements that make unrealistic health or beauty claims .
Righi wrote in a church newsletter that Jesus was born in Bethlehem to a couple named Mary and Joseph and that he lived in Nazareth .
Cascioli's lawsuit claims the statement was an " abuse of popular belief . "
Wider implications
" The court will have to decide whether the statements Father Righi made were indeed fraudulent to decide whether the case has merit , " says Antonio Schieppati , a retired director of the law faculty at the University of Rome and a legal consultant .
" It has to make a judgment about the existence of Christ .
As far as I know , no court has ever been required to do such a thing . "
In a telephone interview , Cascioli says he chose to name Righi in his suit because he was local , but his case has a wider target .
" If Father Enrico Righi is found guilty of all this , it will have clear implications on all levels of the church , " he says .
" The question is n't who is guilty because if one person is , then many , many people are .
The question is whether the case can be proved . "
Schieppati says that if Cascioli is successful , the church will be forced to use conditional language when writing about some faith - related issues for the public .
Even if the suit fails , it may damage the Catholic church 's reputation .
" This is allowing the church to be sued in court the same way someone who borrows money and does n't pay it back is sued , " Schieppati says .
Cascioli's suit is based on several complaints .
Among them : • That Righi's parish has profited financially from promoting what Cascioli calls " the fable of Christ 's life . " •
That the church is guilty of " impersonation " by confusing the persona of Jesus with another man named John of Gamala , said to have lived in Israel around the time of Jesus .
•
That the four Gospels are filled with conflicting and inaccurate evidence about Jesus .
Burden of proof
The burden is on Cascioli to prove Jesus is a fabrication .
Magistrates tried to have the case thrown out on the grounds that no damages could be proved and that there was not enough empirical evidence of Jesus ' existence .
Cascioli repeatedly challenged that conclusion until Judge Gaetano Mautone in Viterbo agreed to set a court date of Jan. 27 .
The Vatican has not commented on the case .
Righi has declined to be interviewed on the advice of his lawyers .
In December , he wrote an article in his parish bulletin that pointed out some of the historical evidence that supports the existence of Jesus .
He cites Jewish historian Flavius Josephus , who wrote in 93 A.D. that 31 years earlier , there was an execution of " the brother of Jesus , the so - called Christ , who was called James by name . "
In the second century , Roman philosophers Pliny the Younger and Tacitus mentioned Jesus ' execution .
" Cascioli says that Christ never existed , " Righi wrote .
" If he ( Cascioli ) does n't see the sun at midday , he should n't denounce me just because I do see it . "
Cascioli admits he does n't believe he will win his case at the local level .
" I am smart enough to know that a court in a country that is 95 % Catholic is never going to rule that Jesus did not exist .
It would take a miracle , " he jokes .
" But maybe this will make people think about the contradictions of what they believe . "
If he loses , Cascioli says , he will appeal to the European Court of Human Rights , where he feels he has a better chance .
He says the church has less power on a European level .
This is an expanded version of a talk given to the University Democrats student group at the University of Texas at Austin , September 23 , 2009 .
For months , leftists have been pointing out the absurdity of the claim that Barack Obama is a socialist .
But no matter how laughable , the claim keeps popping up , most recently in the form of the Republican Party chairman 's warning of " a socialist power grab " by Democrats .
Within the past year , Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina has called Obama " the world 's best salesman of socialism . "
Conservative economist Donald J. Boudreaux of George Mason University has acknowledged that Obama is n't really a socialist , but warns that the " socialism lite " of such politicians " is as specious as is classic socialism . "
Silly as all this may be , it does provide an opportunity to continue talking about the promise and the limits of socialism in a moment when the economic and ecological crises are so serious .
So , let 's start with the basics .
As with any complex political idea , socialism means different things to different people .
But there are core concepts in socialist politics that are easy to identify , including ( 1 ) worker control over the nature and conditions of their work ; ( 2 ) collective ownership of the major capital assets of the society , the means of production ; and ( 3 ) an egalitarian distribution of the wealth of a society .
Obama has never argued for such principles , and in fact consistently argues against them , as do virtually all politicians who are visible in mainstream U.S. politics .
This is hardly surprising , given the degree to which our society is dominated by corporations , the primary institution through which capitalism operates .
Obama is not only not a socialist , he 's not even a particularly progressive capitalist .
He is part of the neo-liberal camp that has undermined the limited social - democratic character of the New Deal consensus , which dominated in the United States up until the so - called " Reagan revolution . "
While Obama 's stimulus plan was Keynesian in nature , there is nothing in administration policy to suggest he is planning to move to the left in any significant way .
The crisis in the financial system provided such an opportunity , but Obama did n't take it and instead continued the transfer of wealth to banks and other financial institutions begun by Bush .
Looking at his economic advisers , this is hardly surprising .
Naming neo-liberal Wall Street boys such as Timothy Geithner as secretary of the treasury and Lawrence Summers as director of the National Economic Council was a clear signal to corporate America that the Democrats would support the existing distribution of power and wealth .
And that 's where his loyalty has remained .
In short : Obama and some Democrats have argued for a slight expansion of the social safety net , which is generally a good thing in a society with such dramatic wealth inequality and such a depraved disregard for vulnerable people .
But that 's not socialism .
It 's not even socialism lite .
It 's capitalism -- heavy , full throttle , and heading for the cliff .
In reaction to the issues of the day , a socialist would fight to nationalize the banks , create a national health system , and end imperialist occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That the right wing can accuse Obama of being a socialist when he does none of those things is one indication of how impoverished and dramatically skewed to the right our politics has become .
In most of the civilized world , discussions of policies based in socialist principles are part of the political discourse , while here they are bracketed out of any serious debate .
In a recent conversation with an Indonesian journalist , I did my best to explain all this , but she remained perplexed .
How can people take seriously the claim that he 's socialist , and why does applying that label to a policy brand it irrelevant ?
I shrugged .
" Welcome to the United States , " I said , " a country that does n't know much about the world or its own history . "
Let 's take a moment to remember .
Socialist and other radical critiques of capitalism are very much a part of U.S. history .
In the last half of the 19th century , workers in this country organized against expanding corporate power and argued for worker control of factories .
These ideas were not planted by " outside agitators " ; immigrants at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries contributed to radical thought and organizing , but U.S. movements grew organically in U.S. soil .
Business leaders saw this as a threat and responded with private and state violence .
The Red Scare of the 19 - teens and ' 20s tried to wipe out these movements , with considerable success .
But radical movements rose again during the Great Depression , eventually winning the right to organize .
In the boom times after WWII , management was willing to buy off labor ( for a short time , it turned out ) with a larger slice of the pie in a rapidly expanding economy , and in the midst of Cold War hysteria the radical elements of the mainstream labor movement were purged .
But radical ideas remain , nurtured by small groups and individuals around the country .
One of the reasons that " socialist " can be used as a slur in the United States is because that history is rarely taught .
If people never hear about socialist traditions in our history , it 's easy to believe that somehow socialism is incompatible with the U.S. political and social system .
Add to this the classic tactic of presenting " false alternatives " -- if the Soviet Union was the epitome of a socialist state and the only other option is capitalism , then capitalism is preferable to the totalitarianism of socialism -- and it is easy to see how people might wonder if Obama is a Red to be Scared of .
This long - running campaign to eliminate critiques and / or critics of capitalism -- using occasional violence and relentless propaganda -- has always been a threat to basic human values and democracy .
The promotion of greed and crass self - interest as the defining characteristics of human life deforms all of us and our society .
The concentration of wealth in capitalism undermines the democratic features of the society .
Socialist principles provide a starting place to craft a different world , based on solidarity and an egalitarian distribution of wealth .
But capitalism is not only inhuman and anti-democratic ; it 's also unsustainable , and if we do n't come to terms with that one , not much else matters .
Capitalism is an economic system based on the concept of unlimited growth , yet we live on a finite planet .
Capitalism is , quite literally , crazy .
But on this question it 's not fair to focus only on capitalism .
Industrial systems -- whether operating within capitalism , fascism , or communism -- are unsustainable .
The problem is not just the particular organization of an economy but any economic model based on high - energy technology , endless extraction , and the generation of massive amounts of toxic waste .
Extractive economies ignore the health of the underlying ecosystem , and a socialist industrial system would pose the same threat .
The possibility of a decent future , of any future at all , requires that we renounce that model .
This reminds us that one of capitalism 's few legitimate claims -- that it is the most productive economic system in human history in terms of output -- is hardly a positive .
The levels of production in capitalism , especially in the contemporary mass consumption era , are especially unsustainable .
We are caught in a death spiral , in which growth is needed to pull out of a recession / depression , but such growth only brings us closer to the edge of the cliff , or sinks the ship faster , or speeds the unraveling of the fabric of life .
Pick your metaphor , but the trajectory is clear .
The only question is the timing and the nature of the collapse .
No amount of propaganda can erase this logic : Unsustainable systems can't be sustained .
To demand that we continue on this path is to embrace a kind of collective death wish .
So , while I endorse socialist principles , I do n't call myself a socialist , to mark a break with the politics associated with industrial model that shapes our world .
I am a radical feminist anti-capitalist who opposes white supremacy and imperialism , with a central commitment to creating a sustainable human presence on the planet .
I do n't know any single term to describe those of us with such politics .
I do know that the Republican Party is not interested in this kind of politics , and neither is the Democratic Party .
Both are part of a dying politics in a dying culture that , if not radically changed , will result in a dead planet , at least in terms of a human presence .
So , socialism alone is n't the answer .
In addition to telling the truth about the failures of capitalism we have to recognize the failures of the industrial model underlying traditional notions of socialism .
We have to take seriously the deep patriarchal roots of all this and the tenacity of white supremacy .
We have to condemn imperialism , whether the older colonial style or the contemporary American version , as immoral and criminal .
We have to face the chilling facts about the degree to which humans have degraded the capacity of the ecosystem to sustain our own lives .
I 'm not waiting for Obama or any other politician to speak about these things .
I am , instead , working in local groups -- connected in national and international networks -- to create alternatives .
There is no guarantee of success , but it is the work that I believe matters most .
And it is joyful work when done in collaboration with others who share this spirit .
But to get there , we have to find the strength to break from the dominant culture , which is difficult .
On that question , I 'd like to conclude by quoting Scripture .
In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus said :
" Enter by the narrow gate ; for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction , and those who enter by it are many .
For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life , and those who find it are few . "
[ Matt. 7:12 - 14 ]
I end with Scripture not because I think everyone should look to my particular brand of radical , non-orthodox Christianity for inspiration , but because I think the task before us demands more than new policies .
To face this moment in history requires a courage that , for me , is bolstered by tapping into the deepest wisdom in our collective history , including that found in various religious traditions .
We have to ask ourselves what it means to be human in this moment , a question that is deeply political and at the same time beyond politics .
At the core of these traditions is the call for humility about the limits of human knowledge and a passionate commitment to justice , both central to finding within ourselves the strength to pass through that narrow gate .
My advice to any of you who want to be part of a decent future :
Find that strength wherever you find it , and step up to the narrow gate .

Jedi church founder thrown out of Tesco for refusing to remove his hood was left ' emotionally humiliated '
The founder of the Jedi religion inspired by the Star Wars films was thrown out of a Tesco supermarket for wearing his distinctive brown hood .
Daniel Jones , 23 , who has 500,000 followers worldwide , was told the hood flouted store rules and was ordered to remove it or leave the supermarket .
As a result Jones , who also goes by the Jedi name Morda Hehol , claims he has been ' victimised over his beliefs ' and left ' emotionally humiliated ' by the supermarket in Bangor , North Wales .

Kicked out : Daniel was banned from this Tesco store in Bangor
But Tesco hit back in the spirit of the epic space saga and claimed that the three most well known Jedi Knights in the Star Wars movies - Yoda , Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker - all appeared in public without their hoods .
Mr Jones , from Holyhead , said his religion dictated that he should wear the hood in public places and is considering legal action against the chain .
' It states in our Jedi doctrination that I can wear headwear .
It just covers the back of my head , ' he said .
' You have a choice of wearing headwear in your home or at work but you have to wear a cover for your head when you are in public . '
He said he'd gone to the store to buy something to eat during his lunch - break when staff approached him and ordered him to the checkout where they explained he would have to remove the offending hood or leave the store .
' They said : " Take it off " , and I said " No , its part of my religion .
It 's part of my religious right . "
I gave them a Jedi church business card . '
Mr Jones claimed the store manager and staff were ' unco- operative ' and left him feeling ' emotionally humiliated ' for making fun of his beliefs .
' They were n't listening to me .
They wasted my personal time .
They were rude and not very nice to me .
They had three people around me .
It was intimidating .
Tesco named Luke Skywalker , Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi as prime examples of Jedi Knights who managed perfectly well without their hoods
Hooded : The Emperor would not be welcome at Tesco
' It was discrimination .
They were making a joke against me .
I was really upset .
Nobody should be treated like that .
' We have 500,000 members in our church .
It is a religion founded in Wales with a scripture and ceremonies '
Mr Jones has made an official complaint to Tesco , is considering a boycott of the store and is seeking legal advice .
A Tesco spokesperson said : ' He has n't been banned .
Jedis are very welcome to shop in our stores although we would ask them to remove their hoods .
' Obi -Wan Kenobi , Yoda and Luke Skywalker all appeared hoodless without ever going over to the Dark Side and we are only aware of the Emperor as one who never removed his hood .
' If Jedi walk around our stores with their hoods on , they 'll miss lots of special offers . '
NEWS ANALYSIS – FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski's unsurprising affirmation of support for network neutrality is a victory for the high - minded principle of open , unfettered internet access .
Too bad it means the days of all - you - can - eat , flat - rate internet access are probably over .
Net neutrality sounds like a good idea .
After all , it 's the internet 's openness to any and all users , applications and content that gave it such a resounding victory over closed networks like AOL , CompuServe and Prodigy .
And there 's no question that as a general business and networking principle , " anything goes " is both desirable and beneficial , to users and network operators alike .
Over the long run , the most open networks attract the most customers and will be the most successful — and the most profitable .
But somewhere along the way , this principle of good network architecture turned into a political tenet that , according to some true believers , is almost equivalent to the Bill of Rights in importance .
The argument goes like this : Internet service providers have such strong motivations to restrict access to content or applications that they do n't like that the government needs to step in to ensure a level playing field .
For net neutrality 's true believers , Comcast and Verizon no longer get to decide how best to configure the networks they spent billions building :
Their networks are so ubiquitous , and so critical to the common good , that the government has a responsibility to ensure they are managed fairly .
It 's easy to see the merits of the argument , and when we 're talking about ISPs that are near - monopolies built in large part on the basis of government subsidy or exclusive federal licensing , it seems downright un-American to argue against net neutrality .
Unfortunately , there are at least three big problems with making net neutrality a federal mandate .
First is that bandwidth is not , in fact , unlimited , especially in the wireless world .
One reason ISPs are averse to neutrality regulation , they say , is that they need the flexibility to ban or mitigate high - bandwidth uses of their network , like BitTorrent and Hulu.com , which would otherwise run amok .
Take away their ability to prioritize traffic , the ISPs say , and overall service will suffer .
" As long as there have been networks , people have had to engineer them to ensure that congestion does n't occur , " Carnegie Mellon professor and telecom expert David Farber said Monday ( he 's the co-author of a cautious anti-net neutrality opinion piece published in 2007 ) .
Farber is especially concerned about the impact of the FCC 's position on wireless networks , where bandwidth is already very limited .
" When you 're operating that close to capacity , you have to do a very tricky job of managing your spectrum .
If you have unconstrained loads being dumped on you , something 's going to have to give . "
Case in point : AT&T has repeatedly stumbled in its ability to provide 3G wireless capacity , thanks to the unexpected popularity of the iPhone .
Those difficulties lend credence to AT&T's ( and Apple 's ) reluctance to allow apps like Skype and Slingplayer unfettered access to the 3G network :
If the network can barely keep up with ordinary demand , just imagine what would happen if we were all live - streaming the Emmy Awards over our iPhones at the same time .
Take away ISPs ' ability to shape or restrict traffic , and you 'll see many carriers running into AT&T - like capacity problems .
Their response will almost certainly be to make consumers pay for what they 're actually using .
Want to BitTorrent all 6.7GB of the uncompressed Beatles catalog via 3G ?
Fine , but you 'll have to pay for the bandwidth you 're taking away from your neighbor .
Second , enforcement of neutrality regulations is going to be difficult .
Comcast may not be able to block
Skype traffic altogether , but what 's to prevent the company from slowing it down relative to other traffic it carries ?
Such preferential " packet shaping " is easy to turn off and on , as network demands ebb and flow .
By contrast , proving such infractions of neutrality will be complex , slow and difficult .
It sets up a classic " nimble , resourceful criminal versus slow - footed , underequipped cop " scenario .
Third , the new regulations create an additional layer of government bureaucracy where the free market has already proven its effectiveness .
The reason you 're not using AOL to read this right now is n't because the government mandated AOL 's closed network out of existence :
It 's because free and open networks triumphed , and that 's because they were good business .
Now the FCC is proposing taking a free market that works , and adding another layer of innovation - stifling regulations on top of that ?
This may please the net neutrality advocates who helped elect the current administration , but it does n't add up .
Net neutrality regulations make sense in closed , monopolistic situations .
But outside of small , rural markets , most of the U.S. offers a high level of competitive choice .
Do n't like Comcast cable internet ?
Switch to SpeakEasy , Astound or SBC , or look into satellite internet .
Do n't care for AT&T 's spotty 3G wireless network ?
Try T - Mobile or Verizon .
Need help finding an alternative ?
Check Broadband Reports ' interactive ISP finder .
That 's why the FCC should take a very cautious , careful approach to implementing its brave , new principles .
Free , unfettered innovation has been the secret to the internet 's explosive growth over the past two decades .
Let 's not let a well - meaning attempt to preserve that innovation wind up doing exactly the opposite .
As Farber says , " Whatever you do , you do n't want to stifle innovation . "

But Arthur Berman , a contributing editor and columnist for World Oil magazine , says some caution is in order .
This past week , he wrote an article for ASPO - USA called Lessons from Barnett Shale Suggest Caution in Other Shale Plays .
The future of natural gas production is a puzzle .
There have been stories about the potential of unconventional natural gas , and natural gas reserves reported by companies have been increasing .
Production by companies has risen to the point where there is a supply glut , and there has been a cutback in drilling .
Recently , Robert Rapier had a post called How Much Natural Gas Do We Have to Replace Gasoline ? .
Mr. Berman thinks that public companies are way too optimistic in their natural gas reserves , both in the Barnett Shale , and in other shale plays , such as the Haynesville and Marcellus shales .
These companies may also be making bad decisions about drilling if they are over - estimating how much gas they can produce from a given well .
I think Mr. Berman 's cautions are probably worth thinking about , so have paraphrased what he said , and added some thoughts of my own at the end .
The two issues I see are
1 . Does extensive fracing move natural gas production forward , so that past patterns , and estimates of reserve life , produce much too high estimates of the volume yet to be extracted ?
and
2 . Are historical decline patterns for tight gas ( produced using vertical wells without much fracing ) misleadingly good for shale gas with fracing ?
The original article is linked above .
If you are at all technically inclined , I suggest reading it as well .
Why does Mr. Berman think caution is in order ?
Mr. Berman says he examined the experience of the Barnett Shale , based on IHS data , and came to the following conclusions :
• Most reserve predictions based on hyperbolic production decline methods were too optimistic when compared with production performance .
• There is little correlation between initial production rates and ultimately recoverable reserves .
• Average well life is much shorter than predicted .
• The volume of the commercially recoverable resource has been greatly over - estimated .
• Core areas of the play do not have appreciably higher average ultimately recoverable reserves than the play overall .
• The ultimately recoverable reserves from horizontal wells is not significantly greater than from vertical wells .
• Average well performance has decreased consistently since 2003 for horizontal wells .
What are the underlying problems ?
According to Berman , he sees the following problems :
1. Group curve fitting is misleading .
It is easy to think that a hyperbolic decline rate will be predictive of future production .
But with all of the fracing , it just does n't work that way .
According to Berman , wells suddenly lose pressure and production drops below what the fitted curve would predict .
This can happen anytime between 12 months and 5 years .
More fracing does n't get production back up to the prior curve .
2. Initial production rates are n't very predictive of total production .
While high initial production is helpful , what one really needs is a decline rate that is n't too steep .
About half of production is in year one .
3. Economic life is of wells is much shorter than expected .
Berman reports that operators expect a well life of 30 to 40 years , but in practice , the most common economic life ( mode ) is only 4 years .
He quotes an average life of 7.5 years , and a maximum of 15 years .
4. Horizontal wells are not living up to expectations .
Berman indicates that owners are predicting recoveries of 2.5 billion cubic feet per horizontal well , but Berman 's estimate is that ultimate recoveries will be about a third of that or .81 billion cubic feet .
According to his calculations , horizontal wells produce only 31 % more than vertical wells , but cost 2.5 times as much .
5. Terminal decline rates are 15 % per year , not 4 % to 8 % .
Berman estimates a much higher decline rate than most operators are using .
Also , once production drops below operating costs , it does n't make financial sense to keep the well open .
6 . Lack of improved production per well with improved technology .
Berman had expected to see improvement in production per well with improved technology , but instead , Berman 's estimate of economic recovery for horizontal wells has dropped from 1.14 per billion cubic feet per well in 2003 to .59 per billion cubic feet per well in 2008 .
Berman feels that the USGS technically recoverable gas estimates for Barnett Shale are likely way to high , even though many companies believe the opposite .
The USGS estimates total technically recoverable resources of 26 trillion cubic feet in Barnett Shale .
Berman estimates that the 11,817 wells drilled to date will only produce about a third of this amount , or 8.8 trillion cubic feet .
If this is all that has been drilled to date , Berman estimates that the remaining 23,000 wells will cost over $ 75 billion dollars , just for the initial work ( leasing , drilling and completion costs ) .
According to my calculation , this amounts to $ 4.36 per thousand cubic feet -- more than natural gas is currently selling for , without considering costs for the remainder of the supposed 40 year lifetime .
My Thoughts
I am certainly no expert in this area .
I did visit BP's Tight Shale Gas Facility in Wamsutter , Wyoming in 2008 .
BP 's facility is tight gas , not shale gas .
Since tight gas facilities have been in operation a long time , and shale gas is quite new , BP 's tight gas facility is likely similar to what the new shale mines are trying to model their experience after .
BP 's site used only vertical wells .
BP was planning on a 30 year , or possibility 40 year , lifetime for their wells .
BP has been operating in the area since the mid 70s , so has experience with tight gas wells that have been producing for almost 40 years .
Their operation was set up to minimize servicing costs on a large number of wells that have been producing for many years .
I do n't know exactly how much fracing BP has been doing on their wells , but I am sure historically it was not anywhere near the level that is being done now .
BP mentioned recent changes which had improved productivity , and that likely included fracing .
Of course , the question then becomes :
Does fracing really increase total production , or does it just move it forward in time , or is it a combination of the two ?
In my work as an actuary , quite a bit of my work involves forecasting future claim payouts based on historical claim experience .
In many ways , it has a lot in common with what is being done in reserve estimations for these natural gas wells .
Insurance coverage often have very long claim payout periods , and one does n't always have comparable data to look at , so one has to work around the lack of comparable data .
The estimates an actuary makes have a big impact on both reserves and on decisions as to what products are profitable to sell in the future .
I can easily understand how someone could jump to the conclusion that if fracing makes recoveries during early production higher , it would lead to close - to - proportionately higher production over the life of the well .
I can also understand substituting tight gas experience for shale gas experience , if there is no long term historical experience for shale gas .
One might also substitute vertical well experience for horizontal well experience if inadequate long - term horizontal well experience exists .
I can also imagine gas companies not looking too closely at industry experience regarding decline rates .
After all , this takes quite a bit of time , analysis skills , and access to the IHS data base to do this .
If gas companies are small , and have limited staff , they are likely not set up to do this .
My experience with auditors is that they are n't many steps ahead of the company people .
Each auditing firm is likely looking at the reserves of several different natural gas producers .
If they are all making the same assumptions , the auditor feels pretty certain that what they are doing is right -- or at least consistent with what other companies are doing .
The auditing firms check for computational errors , but are not likely to think about whether the decline rate assumptions are wrong ( unless someone points out the issue to them . )
Nearly all the players would like things to look good -- the USGS , companies setting reserves , the people selling the fracing materials , and investors .
Except for Arthur Berman , it is n't clear that there are too many people looking at aggregate decline rates on shale gas deposits .
One might think that consulting firms would look at this -- for example Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) or Navigant Consulting or Advanced Resources International , but unless someone pays them for this service , it likely wo n't get done .
Once companies have gone down the wrong road in making estimates , it is my experience that it is awfully hard to turn around .
The financial implications get to be huge .
It is hard for an auditing firm ( or firm selling ongoing consulting services ) to do more than nudge the estimated decline rates a bit in the right direction , and hope that things will get better over time .
I would hope that other people will start looking closely at the questions Arthur Berman is raising .
Does IHS data really indicate that shale decline rates are a lot worse than companies are forecasting ?
What are reasonable lower bounds at which production becomes non-economic ?
Are natural gas companies really being over - optimistic on the long - term benefit of fracing ?
Have natural gas reserves been raised too much ?
Could there even be a problem even on tight gas reserves , if fracing moves production forward , and reduces what is producible in the later years ?

Icelanders are suffering in the aftermath of the catastrophic collapse of their country 's economy
A year on from a ruinous banking crash , there are surprisingly few visible signs of the desperate financial straits in which Iceland 's 315,000 inhabitants find themselves .
Designer fashion shops , bars and restaurants on Laugavegur , the main shopping street in Reykjavik , continue to trade – as do the city centre 's boutique hotels .
And not all customers are tourists taking advantage of the devalued krona .
On the harbourside , next to the plush central bank offices , construction of a glass - plated national concert hall , started several years ago , nears completion .
Meanwhile a new reformist coalition government is optimistically talking about restoring Nordic egalitarian priorities within a strong welfare state .
It hardly seems the typical recipient of a $ 10 bn ( £ 6.2 bn ) package of bailout loans orchestrated by the IMF .
But , despite the outward signs of continued prosperity , most Icelanders are quietly waking up to the burdensome legacy they must endure after one of the most rapid destructions of wealth any economy has ever seen .
It was on 30 September last year that the Icelandic government seized control of the country 's big three banks following a run on their deposits .
Finance minister Steingrimur Sigfusson , a leftwinger who spent years warning of the need to rein in the banks , sums it up : " At the end of every good party there is a bill that has to be paid . "
IMF officials appear to have allowed the country some breathing space , but the full pain of its stringent loan conditions will be felt in a second round of heavy tax rises and public spending cuts next year .
The government expects Iceland 's domestic production to shrink by 9 % this year , falling a further 1 or 2 % in 2010 .
Unemployment is likely to grow to one in 10 of the workforce this winter while many more have had to take big pay cuts .
Health minister Ogmundur Jonasson said his department 's budget had been cut by 7 % this year and would face similar reductions in 2010 .
Furious at enforced cuts across the welfare state , he accused the IMF of acting only in the interest of international creditors .
" As a leftwing politician , when it comes to prioritising the rights of property owners or those who own nothing , I tend to side with the latter group ...
People are really ashamed of what we did , but do you make cuts at a cancer ward in Reykjavik to honour those international debts ?
Would you rather lose £ 10,000 in a bank deposit or see a bed removed from your mother 's care home ? "
Meanwhile Sigfusson believes between 15 % and 20 % of households are in " severe trouble " with their loans and will need some form of assistance .
A similar debt crisis faces those Icelandic businesses fortunate enough to have survived the crisis .
The hardest hit are homeowners who , balking at Iceland 's high interest rates , previously took out loans partly in foreign currencies .
They have seen repayments soar after a run on the krona .
Anger among ordinary households has led to plans for a two - week repayment strike starting on Thursday .
It has been organised by the Icelandic Home Coalition , a new grassroots movement .
Anger is in large part focused on a belief that ordinary working people , who never sought to take huge financial risks , have been forced to pick up the tab for an elite band of aggressive business tycoons , a few of whom may have been fortunate enough to salt away some of the spoils of their own recklessness before their luck turned .
Sigfusson confesses he shares some of this frustration .
" It is more than easy to see people will say : ' This is not our debt .
These were private banks , why should we have to pay for their mistakes . '
It is the same question people are asking about the City and Wall Street .
" These banks were allowed to grow out of all proportion .
A peculiar atmosphere was created .
There was a total lack of self - criticism , mostly in the political and financial world , but also in the media .
These politicians and ideologists ... in many ways turned Iceland into a neoliberal laboratory .
And the experiment had a terrible ending . "
After its bitter experience as an international financial centre , heavily indebted Iceland must now fall back on the more mundane energy , farming , tourism and fishing industries , which are its best hope of economic recovery .
A massive foreign workforce , attracted in the boom years , has almost entirely disappeared .
Some young Icelanders are beginning to emigrate too .
Up to 1,800 are said to have left since the crisis though almost 1,200 have returned — many of them no longer able to finance living abroad .
While passions run high over who is to blame , Sigfusson insists his role is to prepare the country for the future .
The government is considering an application to join the European Union and he has been working to resurrect a stable domestic banking system as well as tackling difficult negotiations over bailout loans from the IMF and others .
" I look at this as a temporary situation we have to get out of .
The long - term prospects are bright , very bright . "
There is little point squabbling over who blame , he suggests , noting a government - appointed " truth commission " is shortly to deliver an official narrative of the collapse .
Pall Hreinsson , the supreme court judge who chairs the commission , this month said : " No committee has ever had to bring to its nation such bad news . "
His chilling words have sparked intense speculation about the commission 's likely findings , but he refuses to elaborate .
" Those words were needed so that people will expect what is coming from us , " he told the Guardian .
" It is paramount that we understand .
So that we can change the things we need to , and live with what we have to live with . "
His report will be published in November but will not delve into contentious details of specific deals involving Iceland 's failed banks and investment companies .
Where criminal activity is suspected , evidence has been passed to a team of fraud investigators advised by veteran French magistrate and anti-fraud crusader Eva Joly .
Team leader Olafur Hauksson has already taken on more than 35 cases and he believes the commission 's findings will contain yet more important evidence .
" We are most certain we will have much more information in this report that will lead to matters [ coming to us ] that have not been brought up yet . "
As well as addressing shortcomings in the commercial world , the commission 's report is expected to attack the Icelandic authorities – government , the central bank and the financial regulator .
These bodies have already been partially blamed by many for failing to act to protect the economy from a vicious stockmarket and credit bubble and a dangerously outsized banking sector .
Iceland 's three major banks , the engines of its rapid growth – Kaupthing , Glitnir and Landsbanki – had combined assets valued at almost 10 times Iceland 's GDP prior to the crisis .
Now all in bankruptcy protection , likely losses have yet to be assessed but some experts suggest they will reach $ 90bn ( £ 56 bn ) across the three firms .
Exactly how big the losses left behind by Iceland 's failed banks and investment companies turn out to be will depend on what value can be extracted from remaining assets now being overseen by insolvency experts on behalf of creditors .
The ownership of many well - known British retail chains including Hamleys , Iceland and House of Fraser – as well as Premiership football club West Ham – hangs in the balance .
Hreinsson says his report will address the big three banks ' perilous exposure to a few companies and individuals – many of whom enjoyed an international reputation in recent years as Iceland 's " business vikings " , expanding aggressively overseas .
The truth commission is examining how and why more than half the value of loans advanced by the three banks were to just 100 concerns .
Focus on this issue has been heightened in recent weeks by the leaking of internal papers on major loans at Kaupthing .
The papers detail huge bets Iceland 's largest bank was taking on its closest clients , many of whom held a substantial interest in the bank 's own shares and several of whom had been allowed to post shares as security for multimillion pound loans .
Some former Icelandic bankers believe allegations of widespread fraud and corruption are grossly overstated .
Even criminal prosecutor Hauksson agrees : " It is too much to say the whole collapse was brought on by criminal affairs … It was an extreme situation combined with some wrongdoing . "
Most experts agree a forensic tracing of Iceland 's tangled money trail , complicated by multiple cross-holdings and share - backed lending , is likely to turn in on itself .
Much of the nation 's vast wealth has vaporised in plunging stockmarkets and defaults on poorly collateralised loans .
If there are funds illegally hidden in Caribbean tax havens , they will amount to small change next to the debt mountain Iceland now faces .
" The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the Right and the other of the Left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers .
Instead , the two parties should be almost identical , so that the American people can “ throw the rascals out ” at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy . "
~ Carroll Quigley , Tragedy and Hope
On November 4th 2008 , millions of Americans went to the polls believing the " change " they were voting for included a scaling down and the eventual end of the wars of empire in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The voter ’s voice had been heard in the 2006 elections concerning their feelings towards these illegal and immoral wars , but now was their perceived chance to change the view from the top .
Instead of a scaling down of the wars , the new administration has brought about continuation of these wars for empire that includes escalation in Afghanistan and the shuffling of forces in Iraq .
This shuffling consists of the withdrawal of some military assets while increasing the number of private contractors .
The bottom line is still the same .
The paradigm of Republican ( right ) versus Democrat ( left ) politics in America has led this country to the calamity of total socialism and the loss of individual rights .
Since I have been of voting age , this has been the scenario .
Nixon had to be elected to free us from the tragedy that was the Vietnam War ; Jimmy Carter was elected to free America from the debacle that was Watergate ; Reagan was elected to free the nation from the indecisiveness and economic blunders of the Carter Administration ; Clinton was elected to change the economic policies of Reagan and George the First ; George W. Bush was elected to bring us back from the nausea of Clinton ’s constant and overwhelming personal issues ; Obama was elected to stop the illegal wars and the infringements on personal freedoms , the very core of the Bush Administration .
Tragic is it not that each and every political savior has led us deeper and deeper into the abyss ?
Obama is no different .
Voting for the lesser of two evils has brought us the promised product : evil .
A great majority of Americans refuse to accept the fact both parties are controlled by the same power cabal , just as Professor Carroll Quigley pointed out in his book , Tragedy and Hope .
Instead , they embrace the concept of party politics over those of individual freedom and liberty .
The paradigm of supporting your party or candidate of choice , even when they are involved in unconstitutional and / or criminal activities , takes on greater priority than supporting the Constitution or liberty itself .
Party first , regardless of the crimes committed , has relegated this country to being led by criminals and the loss of individual liberty .

Long ago , the ruling elite determined the greatest threat to its goal of one world government was sovereignty and self - determination .
In order to accomplish their goals they realized the two parties must have the appearance of being adversarial while maintaining the stated objective .
They decided to adopt the military strategy of divide and conquer .
Diversity and the hyphen became their weapons of choice .
Americans could not be seen as all being under the same umbrella politically , so they had to be divided .
Calling some Native - Americans and others African - Americans or Jewish - Americans assured polarity among the citizenry and eliminated unity of purpose .
Initiating these divides along racial lines was a master stroke ; now anyone who opposed the illegal or unconstitutional programs of another faction could be marginalized by insisting their opposition to the criminal acts was based on racism .

The attack on the Confederacy became a necessity .
Not only did the government of the South in 1861 express as its purpose the quest for sovereignty and self - determination , they also represented a revolt against oppressive taxation as a tool of control .
Revising history to show the South was motivated by racism would obscure from future generation the true goals of the Confederacy and their willingness to defend , with their very lives , the ideal of self - determination .
Even then , some of the leaders of the Confederacy could see the goals of the ruling elite .
General Patrick Cleburne would say , " It means the history of this heroic struggle will be written by the enemy ; that our youth will be trained by Northern schoolteachers ; will learn from Northern school books their version of the war ; will be impressed by the influences of history and education to regard our gallant dead as traitors , and our maimed veterans as fit objects for derision … "
Today , the goals of tyranny have been reached , for many , even those who trace their ancestry to the South , have denounced the war that killed nearly 700,000 Americans , many of them non-combatants , as a war to perpetuate slavery .
In actuality , the message delivered through the pages of history to those who believe in the right of self - determination is : if you dare challenge the right of government to control your life , you will be hunted down and eliminated .
History is resplendent with the demonization of those who have sought the right to determine their own fate without the interference of government .
American Indians were referred to as savages and red devils , while those who supported the Confederacy were referred to as rebels and traitors .
Today we are simply referred to as terrorists , which is true , because the very idea of an individual living a life free of government interference and control terrifies those of the ruling elite .
Ruling the world without the willing compliance of those ignorant enough to fight , die and provide the sweat of their brows would become impossible .
It is my opinion that the election of Barack Obama may have been our last chance to secure freedom and the rights of the individual .
Before you quit reading in disgust , hear me out .
Had John McCain been elected , we would have continued with our illegal wars and other fascist doctrine .
Republicans would have continued the chant that we were being " protected " from future calamities such as 9/11 , that infringements on our liberties , such as the Patriot Act and the John Warner Defense Authorizations
Act were necessary to keep the war , " over there " and to stop Domestic Terrorism .
The Democrats would have continued with their anti-war rhetoric and posturing .
Basically , the rush to pure Socialism would have continued at the normal frog - boiling pace .
With Obama , we have now the same fascist doctrine of illegal aggressive wars and infringements on liberty combined with in - your - face Marxist Socialism .

Those who voted for Obama believing it would end the wars have now seen they were conned ; those Middle - Class Whites who voted for Obama to salve their feelings of latent racism have seen race used as a defense of tyrannical theft and ever enlarging government and its quest for total control of our lives .
The possibility of the loss of the right to possess the tools of liberty have led millions to the purchase of firearms and ammunition , many for the first time .
In the month of August 2009 alone , over one million requests to purchase firearms were received at the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) of the FBI .
The rumors of vaccines and laboratory prepared viruses prepared as a tool for population control and the threat of military and law enforcement forced vaccinations have alarmed millions .
" Obama " and " Change " bumper stickers , once quite numerous in my rural part of the world , have all but disappeared .
In other words , a mentality of resistance to the combined forces of Fascism and Marxism seems to be taking shape .
The power elite and their shills in the media will continue to proclaim as racists any who would oppose the socialist criminal takeover in this country .
The advocates will refer to this criminality as a religious experience , but they will also offer up their " opposing views " commentators in an attempt to quell active protests .
Having someone in the media who represents the view of the opposition has become standard operating procedure for the media .
When Clinton was in office , we had Limbaugh , O’Reilly and Hannity ; when Dubya was in office the opposition found solace in Olbermann ; now the opposition finds a new friend in a much richer and suddenly reformed Beck .
Believing one has a proponent in the national limelight keeps many on their couches and out of the streets .
Believing there to be a political solution to the mess we are now in is folly indeed .
The government owns the entire game : political parties , the congress , elections , law enforcement , the military , the courts and the ability to forcibly take whatever it wants under the fear of death .
Our opinions and concerns mean nothing .
Writing letters to these thugs is a waste of time .
If they cared about our opinions , the banks would never have been bailed out nor the latest Supreme Court Justice confirmed .
The opinion of the people no longer matters ; live with it .
It was rumored that during the Dubya administration , a congressman in a western state voiced his written concern to the administration concerning the departure of the Republican Party from its core beliefs and supporters , especially those who supported the Second Amendment and opposed abortion .
Supposedly , this representative received a memo from the desk of Karl Rove stating : " Do not concern yourself with those who support the Constitution and oppose abortion , they have nowhere else to go . "
Folks , face the music , advocates of liberty and self - determination have nowhere else to go .

Trivia :
In his book " An Exaltation of Larks " he lists the popular and obscure phrases that describe groups of things ( ie , a gaggle of geese , a murder of crows and , of course , an exaltation of larks ) .
The book has been in print continuously since 1968 .
A rocket carrying a billionaire who has been dubbed the ' first clown in space ' has lifted off from a Russian base in the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan .
The craft is bound for the International Space Station .
The Soyuz rocket blasted off from the Baikonur launch site carrying a crew of three , including Canadian space tourist Guy Laliberte .
The founder of the renowned Cirque du Soleil performance group has reportedly paid $ US35 million for his flight and his stay on the International Space station , with the experience lasting less than two weeks .
Mr Laliberte has said while he is at the ISS , he intends to give a series of performances , including participating in a TV program .
He is likely to be the last space tourist for some years , as NASA is retiring its shuttle fleet , so seats on the Russian craft will be taken by American astronauts .

Words about censorship and destruction of books A. Word .
A. Day with Anu Garg
Librarians and booksellers are two of my favorite peoples .
Anyone who loves books so much as to dedicate their life to them can't be all that bad .
Unfortunately there are some who feel threatened by certain books and call for them to be banned or destroyed .
People have a right to be offended by any book .
All they have to do is not buy or borrow it .
The problem begins when they try to impose their views on others by trying to ban it .
As an antidote to banning , the last week of September is observed in the US as Banned Books Week .
To celebrate it , this week we are going to feature five words relating to censorship and mutilation of books .
Even though people after whom some of these words are coined have long gone , censorship is still alive .
But there 's hope .
I leave you with this thoughtful letter from a librarian to a patron .
comstockery PRONUNCIATION : ( KOM - stok- uh - ree , KUM -) MEANING : noun : Overzealous censorship of material considered obscene .
ETYMOLOGY : After Anthony Comstock ( 1844-1915 ) , founder of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice .
He crusaded against anything he considered immoral .
Nothing escaped his wrath -- even anatomy textbooks for medical students and the draping of mannequins in public view in shop windows were obscene to him .
He lobbied for laws against mailing any material that could be perceived as promoting immorality .
He was appointed postal inspector and he seized books , postcards , and other materials by the boatload .
He boasted that he had arrested more than 3,000 people and driven more than 15 to suicide .
George Bernard
Shaw coined the word comstockery after him when he attacked the American production of Shaw 's play " Mrs. Warren 's Profession " .
USAGE : " The language and thought police are hardly some Orwellian invention ; America has been unusually susceptible to plagues of Comstockery and self - righteous tomfoolery . "

A THOUGHT FOR TODAY :
It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies , but just as much to stand up to our friends .

Max Baucus ( D - MT ) has finally decided to let us all know that he 's formulated his health care plan :
In a last effort to give the Senate a bipartisan health care bill , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee circulated a comprehensive proposal on Sunday to overhaul the health care system and proposed a new fee on insurance companies to help pay for coverage of the uninsured .
The proposal is the culmination of more than a year of work by the chairman , Senator Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana .
A similar fee was proposed by several liberal Democrats in July .
In making it part of his proposal , Mr. Baucus may help cover the costs of the bill but also risks alienating Republicans whom he is trying to win over .
Mr. Baucus is struggling to forge a bipartisan consensus among 6 of the 23 senators on his committee before President Obama puts new pressure on lawmakers in an address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday evening .
The proposal by Mr. Baucus does not include a public option , or a government - run insurance plan , to compete with private insurers , as many Democrats want .
Mr. Baucus ’s plan , expected to cost $ 850 billion to $ 900 billion over 10 years , would tax insurance companies on their most expensive health care policies .
The hope is that employers would buy cheaper , less generous coverage for employees , thereby reducing the overuse of medical services .
The separate new fee on insurance companies would help raise money to pay for the plan .
The fee would raise $ 6 billion a year starting in 2010 , and it would be allocated among insurance companies according to their market shares .
No public option .
Not even a public option with a " trigger , " which was a ridiculous idea tacked on to a position that was already a compromise .
And the central tenet of the financing : a giant new " fee " that insurers are already saying they 'll simply pass on to their customers .
Apparently I 'm supposed to be more favorably disposed toward the " fee , " because it was once proposed by liberal Senators like Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) and Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) .
And I 'll admit that the sentiments expressed by those two have some merit :
Mr. Schumer said , " The health insurance industry should pay its fair share of the cost because it stands to gain over 40 million new consumers under health care reform legislation . "
Mr. Rockefeller said the fees were justified because insurance companies were " rapaciously , greedily and unstoppably making money by underpaying the patient , by underpaying the provider and by overpaying themselves . "
But if the idea of health care reform was to control the growth of premiums , that 's not really gonna help .
And I understand that healt care reform options like those I 'd prefer -- single payer or a non-profit , publicly - funded alternative -- will also cost taxpayers money out of pocket .
But I 'd rather spend that money funding a provider that wo n't be motivated to deny me coverage in order to increase bonuses for its employees .
That 's my bottom line .
The fee gets passed on to the customers just as surely as any increase in taxes required to fund a public plan would , but at least if it 's a tax for funding a non -profit entity , nobody 's taking 30 % off the top for bonuses .
Anyway , the real tragedy here is that this falling - off - a - log plan is " the culmination of more than a year of work " by Baucus .
A year ago , we knew the Republicans would oppose single payer .
We knew they would oppose any kind of public plan , because they oppose any expansion of government that they did n't author or that does n't kill foreigners or wiretap hippies , and because they would even oppose all of that if Obama would get a " win " if it passed .
And we probably could have guessed that they would have opposed these fees , too ( and they do ) , but would be more than happy to see Democrats add them into their plan , because it 's such a loser , at least so long as people do n't have anywhere else to go that allows them to buy insurance without facilitating yet another skimming opportunity for the insurance companies .
A fee might work just fine if there was some way to avoid having to carry that burden for the insurance giants .
So what I 'm saying here is that it 's very disappointing , to put it as mildly as possible , that it took Baucus more than a year to formulate a plan that amounts to capitulating to every Republican demand , and then adding a heaping pile of political suicide on top of it .
Thanks ,
Max !
Great plan .
Glad we waited .
Now STFU .
This could get ugly .
In an article published by Daily Finance on Friday , the website ( owned by AOL ) shared knowledge of a Microsoft lobbyist campaign to smear Google into governmental perception oblivion .
According to Daily Finance , insiders have given these regularly scheduled meetings a name …
“ Screw Google ” meetings .
The group effectively trying to “ Screw Google ” is said to be composed of Microsoft employees , other Google competitors and hired 3rd parties :
“ Microsoft is at the center of a group of companies who see Google as a threat to them in some combination of business and policy , ” said a source familiar with the matter , who requested anonymity to avoid retribution .
“ The effort is designed make Google look like the big high - tech bad guy here . ”
The meetings have occurred as frequently as once a week , sources with knowledge of the meetings say .
Daily Finance points out two particular public relations firms that Microsoft works with named Law Media Group and Glover Park Group .
LMG declined to comment and GPG says they have n’t been involved in anything “ Screw Google ” related .
But one source claims LMG is n’t so innocent :
“ Law Media Group has several people who work full - time on Google - bashing .
Everybody knows Microsoft is trying to throw roadblocks at Google and knock them off their game .
Microsoft is trying to harm Google in the regulatory , legal , and litigation arenas because they ’re having problems with Google in the competitive marketplace . ”
Hold up , wait a minute ( lemme put some Phandroid in it ) .
Before we continue shall we take a dive into the realistic side ?
Microsoft is n’t the only one engaging in these lobbying and policy conventions and practices whereby they attempt to sway and influence key decision makers .
Every big business does it … including Google .
Sad perhaps , but a fact of business .
And it is n’t “ sad ” or “ negative ” by nature – your company has certain ideas and beliefs and obviously , as a company , it is in your best interest to tell people your side of the story to create a favorable climate for your products and services .
We should at least TRY to be objective .
Unfortunately for Microsoft , their side of the story sucks .
Their side of the story is that they dominated desktop software with Windows which they leveraged to also dominate desktop web browsing with Internet Explorer .
They then watched Google waltz into the Search Engine space and less than a decade later Big G dominates with 70 % search market share .
In the past Microsoft execs have made comments claiming Google is more of an illusion than a business and Steve Ballmer himself screamed the words “ I ’m going to f*cking kill Google ” as he hurled a chair across the room when speaking to a Microsoft engineer defecting to Google .
Yes , that really happened … it is legally documented .
So now Microsoft is trying to kill imaginary businesses ?
Yes …
Google made them crazy .
Now Google is leveraging their own success to enter new markets … think of how ubiquitous GMail and YouTube are and Android will become .
And then there is Chrome … ahhhhh yes , Chrome .
And better yet , Chrome OS .
When Google announced Chrome OS it must have sent shivers down the backs of Microsoft Execs the world over .
Because as much as they want to effing kill Google … they can’t .
So now they ’re going by the old mantra , “ If you ca n’t beat them , join them . ”
Oh wait … slight correction , “ If you ca n’t f*ck them , screw them . ”
This “ Screw Google ” campaign took on a new life as soon as it was given that name .
Suddenly something that probably happens every day in every industry by hundreds of different companies was sensationalized with a marketable name .
But this name tells a much bigger story .
It tells the story of Microsoft ’s simultaneous decaying self - image and denial that their stranglehold on all things computer related is slipping … and fast .
Microsoft had a HUGE opportunity with Windows Mobile but the company absolutely FAILED to market it properly and even worse , squandered away valuable time they could have spent improving the software and making a compelling and superior product .
Unfortunately , Microsoft ’s market share in the mobile market is about to be gobbled up by Android and if you do n’t believe me just ask HTC .
But once again … Microsoft is delusional .
Microsoft must have been really angry when Google ran away with the growing search market .
Mobile could be considered the # 1 growth industry in tech and Google is about to run away with that as well .
But worst of all …
Google is about to kick Microsoft where it counts with Chrome OS , taking their innovation to netbooks and laptops and perhaps eventually desktop computers to challenge the very essence of Microsoft ’s existence on their home turf .
Microsoft and Google are also gearing up for an intense showdown over the very future of the PC operating system .
Google recently said it plans to introduce a new web - based operating system based on its Chrome browser ( though to date , Chrome has barely dented Microsoft Internet Explorer ’s lead in the browser market ) .
Google ’s fundamental strategy to shift the locus of computing onto in the Internet , and into “ the cloud , ” represents an ambitious assault on Microsoft ’s dominance of the desktop - based operating system market .
I do n’t doubt that Microsoft execs , lobbyists and sympathizers are all saying “ Screw Google ” right now … if they are n’t then they should be .
But maybe its time for Microsoft to realize that they can’t afford to spend their time and energy tearing competing companies down .
Instead they should be using that time to focus on building themselves up .
While others are bringing new and innovative ideas to customers no matter the cost ( see YouTube ) , Microsoft seems to be that 32 year - old guy who is obsessed with how awesome and popular they were in high school without realizing they are no longer awesome or popular .
Let me be clear …
I do n’t want Microsoft to fail .
In fact I ’d like to see them succeed .
But the company seems to be driving itself into the ground with a corporate culture that may have worked a decade ago but will not work now .
Its time to grow up , Microsoft … you ’re only screwing yourself .

Yes there was the same lazy writing , the plotholes , the inexplicable leaps , but all in all , this was my favorite episode .
I liked the tone of the episode and I thought the pacing was much better , and almost perfect in the first half .
By now , I really do n't care about the artifact finding , it 's the same stuff every week , so I wo n't be recapping the search .
The addition of James MacPherson was very intriguing , but I wish we could have learned more about him .
He used to work at the Warehouse and has high - tech toys .
Also , we know he 's evil since his Tesla gun shoots red electricity while Pete and Myka 's shoot blue .
I show the episode was going amazingly well until Artie explained what the sword did .
It " cuts " light and makes people invisible .
I know artifacts are supposed to be unexplained , but cutting through light because of the exact measurements of the sword .
It would have been much better if the sword had been dipped in some mystical water an imbued with special powers .
In fact , I would like the sword to have a completely different effect since we already can invisibility .
The main problem with episode was all the new stuff we learned about Artie .
He sold secrets to the Soviets and he has another name .
I knew the unraveling of Artie would n't be immediate , but now I have no clue what 's up with Artie , his motivations , or his importance that Mrs. Frederick would go to such lengths to procure him .
Claudia was missing this reason for no good reason and it was a shame she could n't be there for the best episode .
Leena had a few scenes which are always great .
I 'm not sure how Myka and Pete can go back to Artie after knowing what he 'd done .
It seems the twist was just thrown in so they would get in deep water with the Secret Service , and it does n't seem like the showrunners really planned anything .

If you get injured on the job , it can become very difficult to pay household bills and medical bills for yourself .
Luckily , American workers are covered under the workers ’ compensation insurance protection , which enables them to take care of their bills and make up for lost wages until they are well enough to take care of themselves again .
Without these benefits , it can be very tedious to get by on your own .
Unfortunately , workers make simple mistakes that cost them heavily during the claims process .
If you get injured at work , you must understand your rights and responsibilities .
Here are 5 tips that ’ll help you get the most out of your compensation claims .
Understand the available benefits
Before even starting the procedure of filing a claim , you need to find out and understand the extent of the benefits available to you .
While the benefits vary between places , some of them are common across the board , such as disability benefits , treatment reimbursement , travel reimbursement and vocational rehabilitation .
If you do n’t understand anything , you can reach out to employment lawyers melbourne no win no fee or a related agency for better understanding .
Look for help immediately Look for help immediately
When and if you are hurt on the job , do n’t wait to see if you can walk it off .
Report the injury immediately .
Many local authorities have set certain deadlines for you to report the injury , any delay in that gives the insurance companies more reasons to deny your claim .
They can say that the injury did n’t occur at work or it is n’t serious enough since you waited to see a doctor .
Immediate medical attention can lead to a quicker recovery .
Consider different doctors
Many states require workers to be treated by a doctor of the insurance company ’s choice .
Since these doctors are paid by the insurance company , they tend to work in favor of the insurance company and fix the situation enough to minimize the payout as much as possible .
If you feel like that is the case , you should switch your doctors as soon as possible .
Be specific
Once you have filed the claim , you ’ll be questioned by a lot of medical providers .
You must describe the whole incident in as much detail as possible and be consistent on every occasion .
The insurance company experts will comb through all the reports to find a reason to decline your request , so do n’t give them any reason to .
Consider appealing the denial
Insurance companies are for - profit organizations , which is why they usually deny legitimate claims in an attempt to save some money .
However , you have the right to appeal a company ’s denial .
The process may differ for states , but you can end up with some amount rather than nothing in the end .

Caching is used to lower the load on user ( cache = 10 minutes ) and artist ( cache = 1 week ) database requests , so the scripts usually only take ten - something seconds .
Now we all know I ’m a big fan of the niche sites .
Why ?
Because there are any number of sites out there that focus on being everything to everyone — which makes them mean basically nothing to no one .
It ’s the focused sites — those sites with which we can personally identify — that hold a great deal of promise .
And nowhere do I see people in the Portland area get more niche -y than food .
I mean , we like food .
Portland - based Gone Raw is a great example .
As is Bacn .
And today , I ’d like to introduce you to another Portland - area food - focused niche social site : Vancouver - based Gling , the social network focused on the gluten - free community .
What kind of information does Gling provide ?
The three major features of the application are a Recipes Database , a Foods Database and a Locations Database .
Individual ingredients within a recipe connect to their corresponding record in the Foods Database , allowing members to research at fine grain detail by clicking on the ingredient and moving to the record in the Foods Database , which lists any recipes that contain that ingredient .
But is n’t there already a ton of gluten - free information available online ?
Well , yes and no .
You see , the problem — according to CEO , Founder , and gluten - free guy Mike Lee — is that there ’s information , but it ’s not always useful .
“ There is no shortage of Gluten free sites , but consumers like us still have difficulty finding an online resource that not only informs them , but also equips average people with tools to make dining choices today for a tricky diet choice .
‘ How do I hold onto recipes or my favorite locations ? ’
With Gling , you can do so much more of what people actually need and use each day , ” said Mike in a press release .
I think he may have struck a chord .
Because even though the site just launched , there ’s a stream of gluten - free restaurant info from all over churning through the site .
And I can name at least a handful of people off the top of my head who will likely be using — and contributing to — this site as soon as they can .
What ’s that ?
You do n’t want all over ?
Well , they ’ve mapped out the Portland gluten - free spots too .
For more information or to participate , visit Gling .

[ Originally published in Movietone News 66 - 67 , March 1981 ]
Introduction by Richard T. Jameson
When it comes to new hope for the American cinema , filmcrit types are always in the market .
New hope in 1980 took the form of a low - budget festival film with the misunderstandable title Return of the Secaucus 7 .
It was n’t a documentary , was n’t a tribute to sullen or snarling radicals , was n’t even a where - were - you - in - ’ 72 American Graffiti–style slice of overpacked nostalgia .
What it was was this genial , witty , low - key comedy , with just the right touch of rue , about a group of friends getting together for an informal reunion one summer weekend , and trying to get used to the idea of turning 30 — and just a wee bit comfortably bourgeois .
The screenplay was a beauty , ostensibly laidback and wide - open , yet carefully detailed without letting the pointedness show ; the characters expertly drawn , no fuss , and so cleanly individualized ( among other things , everyone ’s dialogue has a logic and texture all its own ) that for the audience and for one another they step right out of any assigned boxes , free to explore a wide range of possibilities .
The result was a droll ensemble portrait shot through with the cozy vitality the Sixties used to call natural , without any of the boring unintelligence that so often went along with it .
The film marked the directorial debut of John Sayles , himself age 30 and one of the most solidly talented writers of contemporary American fiction .
About the time Secaucus 7 went into national release , Sayles accepted an invitation to meet with a scriptwriting class at the University of Washington and share some of his experiences .
Virtually all the Hollywood personnel who graciously and generously gave of their time to support this course delivered themselves of frank and cogent remarks about the realities of the film biz at the dawn of the Eighties ; but even in this company Sayles was conspicuous for the comprehensiveness and lucidity of his commentary .
He talked for better than two hours , first supplying a general commentary on his background in film and the circumstances of Secaucus 7 ‘s making , then opening the floor for questions .
Having never heard so much good sense about films and filmmaking collected in one place before , movietone news requested permission to share it with a larger public ; the unassuming writer - director seemed surprised that anyone would think so highly of his off - the - cuff remarks , but he agreed .
“ We ’ll send you a transcript so you can check it out . ”
He thought about that a moment , then said , “ No .
If I said it , I ’ll stand by it .
Just go ahead . ”
And that , with very little editing and rearranging , is what we did .
I ’d always been interested in doing screenwriting , realized that there were n’t too many ways into it .
I did n’t want to go out to Los Angeles and start knocking on people ’s doors trying to get an agent , so I went a route that is n’t much help to most people , which is that I wrote two novels and got them published .
I got a literary agent out of that , and his agency had a deal with a film agency on the West Coat , so they were automatically representing my novels as screen properties .
I wrote a query letter to them saying , “ I also write screenplays ” — which I had n’t done at that time — ” do you want to see one ? ”
They said , “ Sure , send one , ” so I wrote one and sent it off to them , and they said , “ Sure , we ’ll represent you . ”
So I moved out to the West Coast .
After moving there , the agent who I ’d got — who is still my agent , Maggie Fields — said , “ Look , you ’re not going to get offered too many good things .
People will try not to hold it against you that you ’re a novelist , but most of them wo n’t succeed . ” I found that to be true .
There ’s a real bad rap on novelists , especially novelists adapting their own books , because they tend to want to protect the book — which is n’t always the best thing , for it to be translated into a film .
What happened was , the first thing I got offered was a rewrite on Piranha .
Piranha had been a project that had been kicking around for about five years .
A guy named Jeff Schechtman , who was Nixon ’s youth advisor , had seen Jaws , said “ There ’s a spinoff here and if I get to it first I ’m gonna make a lot of money . ”
He had had several scripts written on it , had Japanese money in it , but never really got it off the ground .
He ended up at [ Roger ] Corman ’s door .
Corman said , “ Well , let me test - market the title . ”
He test - marketed the title , it went through the roof , and he said , “ I gotta make this movie ! ”
And he gave it to me , saying “ Keep the title and the idea of piranhas being loose in North American waters , and then dowhatever you want with it , but do it so that it seems something like Jaws . ”
And that ’s basically all I ’ve ever gotten from him , is a very vague concept .
With Battle Beyond the Stars what he gave me was basically “ The Seven Samurai in space . ”
By that time I was in the Writers Guild and he wanted a treatment on it , before I was brought in on the project , to get a commitment from Orion to give him half the money to make the picture .
He did n’t want to give me the three thousand that you have to pay a member of the Writers Guild , so he paid one of his office staff a hundred dollars just to put something down on paper that sounded like The Seven Samurai in space .
And that ’s what he handed me , and he said , “ Ignore this .
This is just for us to get half the money . ”
Writing those scripts was a lot of fun .
Seeing the movies after they were done was n’t as much fun .
One of the things you realize screenwriting is that you ’re the lowest element on the totem pole .
Basically you ’re writing — especially in an exploitation picture — you ’re writing a blueprint that other people will try to fill out or try not to fill out , depending how much they like it .
I never met the director of any of the three pictures that I wrote for Corman until a week before they were shot , or maybe a month at the most .
Not while I was writing them .
Usually I would get a call from somebody saying , “ Hi , I ’m directing your picture , I need help .
I ’m only getting 600 thousand dollars to shoot this thing — you have 60 speaking parts .
I ca n’t possibly afford that many people .
Can you help me ? ”
And this is after I ’d been paid — signed , sealed , and delivered .
“ Can you help me out ? ”
And you find that , because you want the thing to turn out good — your name is going to be on it unless it ’s so terrible that you ask to have your name taken off — you tend to do free work when you ’re first starting out , and say , “ Yeah , sure , I ’ll try to help you cut down the number of speaking parts . ”
I got a call on Battle Beyond the Stars saying , “ You have to cut the number of Malmori Mutants in half because we can’t afford them ; plus the model - shot people say you have to have all the attacks be in multiples of three . ”
For some reason it was easier for the model - shot people to have attacks if there were three spaceships instead of two or four .
And what you realize is that if you do n’t do it somebody else will ; and it ’s usually not going to be a writer , because they ’d have to pay a writer .
Usually on a low - budget picture like that , it ’s gonna be the second assistant cameraman , or the receptionist .
This is true !
I just did a picture called The Howling that will be out next year , a werewolf picture ; I walked in and the receptionist on the picture was the second female lead from Rock ‘ n ’ Roll High School .
What you find is that basically you try to cover yourself , try to help them make the picture work .
Sometimes you can get them to say , “ Yes , this is how much the picture ’s going to cost . ”
I ’ve rarely been able to do that .
I ’ve often asked , “ Shall I write this small ?
What ’re you gonna spend on this ? ” and they say , “ Oh , do n’t worry , you write the thing and then we ’ll make it . ”
Then , the week before they start shooting it , they say , “ You have to tailor this for such - and - such . ” I wrote a picture at New World called The Lady in Red , which was about the woman who was with John Dillinger when he was shot .
I wrote a script for a woman who ranges during the picture from 17 to 21 .
The first person they offered it to was Angie Dickinson ; and she almost took it .
Corman said , “ Oh yeah , we can brush it up a little . ”
It would have taken a total rewrite to make it make any sense at all .
Angie Dickinson , luckily , realized that , and realized that a total rewrite probably was n’t going to happen and there she would be , making a picture about an 18 - year - old woman , and she ’s over 40 .
That experience taught me a lot about the relationship between screenwriting and budget , and I was able to use that when I went into Secaucus 7 .
I said OK , I ’m writing exploitation pictures now .
It ’s gonna take me a couple of years at this rate even to be writing for major studios .
To get to the point — what I planned to do was to break into directing by writing a screenplay , having somebody make it , having it make the studio enough money so that , like the guy who wrote The Silver Streak [ Colin Higgins ] or the guy who wrote The Sting [ David S. Ward ] , eventually you can bring them a screenplay they like and you say , “ You can have it if you let me direct it . ”
And they either say , “ Sure , you made us $ 20 million last time , it ’s worth it ” — and that ’s stupid : ’ cause you can write does n’t mean you can direct — or they say , “ What have you done ?
What have you directed ? ” I wanted to have something to show them , and say “ I directed this — so there ! ”
I knew I was going to have $ 40,000 together in the same place at the same time — for writing the Corman things — before the IRS could get to it ; and if I could just spend it fast enough , they would n’t get it .
I decided I would make an independent film with it .
That ’s been done a few times .
Stanley Kubrick did it ‘ way back when ; he had family money and family friends who helped him raise money , and he made three features before he really broke through to a studio feature .
So I wrote a screenplay and , knowing about the relationship between budget and screenplay , I wrote a screenplay based on the budget .
I knew that I had to have a minimum of camera movement in it : camera movement takes a lot of time and time turns into money real quick on a film set .
I had to be able to use people who were n’t in the Screen Actors Guild yet but who were very good actors .
That immediately brought to mind the people I knew who were good actors who were n’t in the Guild yet , and they were all around 30 .
So I was going to have a picture where the people were all around 30 , and nobody younger ’ cause I was n’t going to have the time to direct a performance out of a kid who was a nonactor .
There were n’t going to be any adults — people over 30 — so it was going to be like Peanuts , no adults around , all people the same age .
And I decided to use that : if I ’m gonna have those people in it and I ’m not gonna write a lotta action , why do n’t I write a movie about people turning 30 ?
I wrote it for the locations .
I knew those locations and I wrote it for them .
I knew what I wanted to do in the movie .
I wanted to have one or two action sequences so that I could show I had some feeling for cutting action , for framing it , so I wrote a couple of scenes where they play basketball or volleyball or swim .
I knew that those were things that I was very familiar with from the inside out , and it would be very easy to shoot those things .
You would n’t need to wreck cars in order to do them — you know , pay for the car , for the insurance or whatever .
I wrote in one or two things that could be considered stunts , cast myself in the film and did my own stunts , with one guy who was crazy enough that if I did it he would do it , too .
All those elements were things that I knew I could get for free or cheap , and I wrote them into the script .
At the same time , making an independent film , I did n’t want to make something that the studios would make .
It seemed to me , how many times are you going to get to have that kind of control over a film ?
Even if it ’s very low - budget , I wanted the budget to be the only thing that limited me .
I did n’t wanna have to worry about the elements .
Basically the way that movies are made today , is that they say , “ OK , here ’s your screenplay and here ’s the people that we wanna put in it .
Can it make this much money from a network - TV sale , this much money from a cable - TV sale , this much from foreign - TV sale , this much money from foreign theatrical ? ”
If it makes that much money on paper before you start it , and if that money is equal to or greater than the amount that they ’re going to spend on the film , they ’ll make the picture .
They wanna break even on the ancillary rights before they even start shooting the movie .
I did n’t wanna have to worry about that stuff .
I was willing to make basically a very expensive audition piece — something that I did not expect to be released and distributed , but something that I would wanna go see .
There ’s a writer named Mickey Spillane , who ’s a lousy writer , but my favorite quote of his is : “ I write the kind of books I like to read . ”
I did n’t want to make a horror film .
I ’ve written ’em , I like to see ’em , but I did n’t wanna spend a year or more of my life making one just to break into studio movies , which would mean getting offered other horror films .
The guy who directed Piranha [ Joe Dante ] , after he directed Piranha he was offered several pictures and they were all Swim Team , Orca II , Jaws 3 — People Nothing — and he hates the water , right ?
It took him about two years to get offered any kind of picture that was n’t in the water .
I did n’t wanna do another horror film , so why do one in the first place ?
So basically a lot of what the experience was about was knowing what I wanted to do with it , knowing exactly the elements I wanted in it , and then seeing what things cost , and totally tailoring a script for budget .
Usually you do n’t have that as your starting point , a budget as a starting point ; but you have other things as starting points .
If you ’re doing a job for somebody else — Piranha — basically Corman said , “ You make the people whoever you want ’em to be , we have to have a certain number … ”
He did n’t specify the number , he said , “ We have to have a certain amount of action sequences ” — meaning carnivorous fish eating people .
And I said , “ How ’s about one attack every 15 minutes ? ”
And he said , “ Try for 15 . ” Given that , I had a structure for the film .
You open it , introduce the piranhas , and if you have one piranha attack every twelve minutes , it ’s a 90 - minute film , here ’s the structure : you have to get them from piranha attack to piranha attack without making it totally repetitious .
And that ’s hard to do .
There ’s only so much you can do .
What I ’m getting at is that any screenplay that you start with , you have to —
One of the things that ’s been the most helpful to me in my writing is that I ’ve also acted .
You take a part on , you say OK , the writer has given me these lines — especially in a small part , he ’s given me six lines : I gotta figure out who this character is .
And not only do I have to figure out who this character is , I have to figure out what this character wants within every scene I appear in .
That ’s helped me in writing , in that when I write something I very often write with a large cast , a lot of people ; it just seems to turn out that way .
I ’m able to go through and look at each scene and say , Why is this character there ?
If I was an actor playing this character — man , woman , or child — is it consistent ?
Does this person seem to be the same person from scene to scene ?
Does he have something he wants ?
And in fact , is he needed ?
And very often you ’ll find out , when you do that , this character is only here to supply somebody for the hero to shoot at .
If that ’s his only reason for being there , you sometimes can find , why not have another character who only does one thing be that same character ?
The thing about acting is that a lot of what you ’re dealing with is a very technical medium , but the human part of it is following each person who is in it , each actor who is in it , each character who is in it , and making sure that they ’re a reasonably rounded human being .
Acting has been helpful in that it makes you think , OK , I am this person — what makes me full ?
what makes me rounded ?
what makes my character have some kind of progression of character , or at least purpose in this film other than just another body ?
[ QUESTIONS FROM AUDIENCE HEREAFTER ]
I heard something I hope was n’t falsely attributed to you , that you write different versions of a screenplay for different uses , different readers .
Do you ?
Sure .
When you write a script you ’re writing it for somebody .
When I wrote Secaucus 7 I knew I was going to direct it .
I did n’t put any stage directions in there .
I did not write a selling script .
In a writing deal , they have cutoffs .
After the first draft they can cut you off ; so the first draft , I try to make it as easy as possible for a producer to read , which means very small words , no stage directions , keep it clear .
There ’s a lot of political content to screenwriting ; you ’re campaigning to get something made , and made the way you want it made .
How does the treatment fit into the campaign ?
Do you find it useful ?
A treatment is the worst form in the world .
It ’s your story boiled down to 20 or 30 pages of really lousy language .
As far as I ’m concerned , a treatment is another opportunity for the producer to decide not to use you or not to use the movie .
In the case of The Lady in Red , I wanted to do more than I knew Roger Corman wanted to do with that script .
He basically wanted Bloody Mama Part Three ; I wanted to get into other things about the Thirties .
[ Sayles ’s script was entitled Guns , Sin , and Bathtub Gin . ]
So I said , “ Roger , I will not write you a treatment , I ’ll write you a full draft . ”
And that way I was able to show him things that , if I had just said , “ I wanna go into this area , I wanna take her to jail , take her to a sweatshop , ” he ’d say , “ Oh no , that ’s beside the point ” ; whereas when I put it in the script he sort of got to liking the story .
So I was able to campaign for the script that I wanted , and get him to agree that he liked that , too .
Very often I ’ll get together with a director when he comes in and I ’ll say , “ Look , they want this scene in here , you do n’t want it in here , I do n’t want it in here — I ’ll write it in here , we ’ll schedule it so that it ’s on a day when you have a lot of other things to do , and they ’ll be happy to cut it when the time comes . ”
Or , depending on the producer , they wo n’t remember , by the time you make the picture , that they wanted it in there .
So you do n’t end up fighting over things that you do n’t need to fight over .
Without being devious , you know , a screenplay is a blueprint and you are trying to convince somebody to make it the way that you want it made , so you have to put it in the best form for that .
I ’ll write a different ‘ screenplay sometimes for an actor .
I ’ll write lines for an actor that do n’t show up in the regular screenplay because it makes it too long , but that actor may not have enough lines to know what his character is about .
A couple of times I ’ve had an actor call me up after he ’s been cast in something that I ’ve written , and say , “ This character seems pretty thin . ”
I had this happen with Bradford Dillman in Piranha : “ You know , there ’s nothing to this guy . ”
And I said , “ Well , I did n’t know who was going to be cast .
I wrote a character that was totally actorproof .
They could have gotten a guy who was the worst actor in the world and he could have gotten through the script .
You can act a little ” — I did n’t say it that way — ” I ’ll write some more stuff for you . ”
And he ended up getting some more lines that fleshed out his character , but also a lot of lines in scenes that I wrote for him that they eventually cut ; but it helped him to know who that character was .
I was n’t going to put it in the script to begin with because if they got a real nonactor we might have ended up with just a lot more of a nonactor trying to act .
I thought Piranha worked very well and I wondered how you set up your story .
The one thing was , you had to ignore the truth about piranhas somehow .
I did a lot of research on piranhas .
They ca n’t live in North American waters , they ’ll die in the cold water ; so I had to have a special breed of piranha .
Given that it ’s the horror film genre , we had to have something about , oh , you know , breeding mutant piranhas .
One thing that Corman always likes to have is a certain kind of antiauthoritarian feeling to his films , because most of the people who go to them in drive - ins hate their teachers or hate their bosses or whatever , and that always makes them feel comfortable .
They can honk their horns .
So I just came up with the idea that the Army had been raising these mutant piranhas to put them in North Vietnamese waters during the war — Operation Razorteeth — and they lost their funding .
And then after that , one scientist decided that he wanted to go on — he ’s a fish geneticist — because they ’re a hardy breed ; and he went up there and kept them alive by stealing dead dogs and cats and feeding them , and continuing with his research .
Eventually they get into the river , and they can live in cold water ’ cause they ’re mutants , and they can live in saltwater ’ cause they ’re mutants ; and that ’s why they ’re making a sequel where the piranhas have bred with flying fish .
That one I ’m not writing — the Japanese have taken over for Piranha II .
Anyway , that gave me an excuse for a lot of exposition , so we got the fish geneticist injured so that they had to carry him downriver on a raft .
That ’s the second thing : if there are piranha in the water and people find out , why do n’t they just stay out of the water ?
That ’s the main problem with that script , how to contrive it , ’ cause it has to be a contrivance , so that people keep going in the water even though they know there are piranhas in there .
Or they do n’t know .
How do n’t they know if they do n’t know ?
The script that I was given to rewrite , the guy had gotten it into his head , ’ cause he ’d read it somewhere , that piranhas only attacked when you were bleeding .
So there were all these scenes where people cut themselves shaving , stubbed their toes , talked about having their periods .
My favorite scene was the one where a bunch of people were camping around a campfire and a bear attacked them , mauled them , chased them into the river , they were eaten by the piranha , and then the fire got out of control and chased the bear into the river and the bear got eaten by the piranha .
Half the movie was about how people got cut .
And every time somebody got cut , you knew they were gonna say , “ Oh , I ’ll go jump in the river ! ”
So I dropped the idea .
They just attacked when they were hungry .
And these were mutant piranha who were stuck in a pool for a year with this geneticist feeding them cats and dogs , and now they ’re out in the river and having a good time , so they ’ll eat anything .
So I had to structure it so that , OK , people do n’t know that there are piranha in the water .
And so I structured it after a trip down the river on the raft : Huckleberry Fin… .
Another thing that also happens is that , in the heat of shooting , especially on a low - budget picture , people will — if you ’re not there , which I was n’t because they were too cheap to pay my way down there and put me up and have me work on it , and I was already paid for the screenplay — when they run into a technical difficulty , very often they ’ll write their way or shoot their way around it , not remembering that it now makes the script make no sense at all .
I got a call from the Piranha location saying , “ We ca n’t get a raft , Disney wo n’t let us have theirs — could n’t we have the people going down the river in a houseboat ? ”
I said , “ If they go down the river in a houseboat there ’s no danger from the piranha .
How are they gonna fall in ? ” — ’ cause I had set this thing up where the piranha eat the lashings off the raft and it falls apart .
They said , “ Oh . ” Then they went and found a raft .
If they had n’t called me , which they almost did n’t , they would have put the people in a houseboat , shot a lot of scenes , and then said , “ Uh - oh , they ’re in a houseboat — how are the piranha gonna get after them ? ” and had to rewrite from there .
All that gets back to the idea of something being functional .
In that kind of picture especially , when all you want to do is scare people several times during the movie and have the plot be plausible enough that they do n’t just walk out in disgust .
And I think I did that .
The picture made about $ 14 million domestically , and about fourteen million overseas .
I got ten thousand for it .
I was n’t in the Writers Guild yet .
The director and editor of the picture — he ’s the same person — got eight thousand for it .
And none of us got any points .
But you have to figure that the fourteen million , most of that is just Corman test - marketing that title , and knowing that if you have the title Piranha and the thing did n’t get a real stinker of a word - of - mouth , he could go to every major city and every major market , play two weeks , get out of there fast , and make his money back .
Which is what he did .
How did Return of the Secaucus 7 find a distributor ?
The distribution of Secaucus 7 came about because I was able to get the film — when it was still in 16 millimeter , which I shot it in — into a couple of film festivals .
Through exposure at those festivals — the Filmex thing in Los Angeles and then the Museum of Modern Art New Directors Festival — several smaller distributors got interested in it , and three or four of them started bidding on it .
The bidding was sort of like “ We ’ll give you fifty –fifty after prints and advertising costs — take it or leave it . ”
So it was n’t like there was a big price war going on .
I finally went with Specialty Films of Seattle because they were the only company that said , “ Yes , we will guarantee you that it will open in ten major cities . ”
The usual thing that happens with a small film , even with a small special - handling type of distributor , is they ’ll open in New York and Los Angeles ; if it does n’t do any business there , they say , “ We tried .
We spent 40 thousand , 50 thousand dollars — you do n’t want us to waste more money , do you ? ”
And I felt that Secaucus 7 was the kind of film that might bomb in New York , just make its money back but no profit in New York , but it might catch on in Seattle or Boston or Portland or Vancouver and play there for half a year , and actually make some profit ; and I wanted to give it that shot .
Specialty , on top of offering me the same sort of cut if the film made any profit as anybody else was , guaranteed me that they were gonna at least take that much of a risk of their own , financial risk ; that they would put out about a hundred thousand dollars in prints and advertising , and open it in those ten cities within a certain amount of time .
How much did it cost to transfer the film to 35 mm ?
$ 21,000 .
Today it would cost 22 ; within a year it ’ll cost 30 .
The process is just getting more expensive .
The people who work in labs just almost went on strike , and they got a ten percent increase , so all labor costs —
And there is quite a bit of labor .
You know , the guy who does the blowup works on the thing before it goes through the machine ; there ’s a lot of hours in there , and that all has gone up ten percent , so the cost of blowing a film up is gonna go way up .
Plus silver — the cost of the film stock itself has gone up and is going to continue to go up .
I paid for it myself .
Once it looked like somebody was going to be interested in the film , I started the process going , because it takes forever to get anything out of the lab .
But I knew that one of them [ the specialty distributors ] when I went with them would pick up the cost .
However , that ’s part of prints - and - advertising , and that money has to be made back before any money that comes in can be called profit .
When you ’re going to write a screenplay ; do you do outlines or diagrams or what ?
It depends on the script .
A couple of the originals that I ’ve written , I just had a story in my head and I started writing it .
A thing that I ’m doing right now with Triple Play for Twentieth Century Fox — it ’s a story about —
It ’s set in Trenton , New Jersey , in 1966 .
It ’s about a sort of Jewish sorority queen , a doctor ’s daughter , who gets involved with an Italian meatball who wants to become part of Frank Sinatra ’s Rat Pack .
It follows that relationship , which can exist in high school because they ’re both the sort of people who like their lives to be dramatic , and it follows them from their senior year in high school to when she goes off to Sarah Lawrence and really gets hit with the Sixties .
It ’s set at that time because that was a time when you could go to high school and be a senior and it was cool to be a virgin , and the next year in college it was the most uncool thing that you could do .
She really has to switch herself totally around .
It talks about whether that relationship can survive or tries to survive when she goes to Sarah Lawrence and he goes down to Miami and becomes a dishwasher and tries to meet Frank Sinatra in the Fontainebleau Hotel and become part of the Rat Pack .
Given that story , which Amy Robinson of Triple Play brought me , I said , OK , there ’s the structure of it .
We have a high school year and we have the beginning of her freshman year .
I ’m gonna write a 120 - page script .
I do n’t like to write a huge script and boil it down .
I know that if this thing gets made , if I direct it , it ’s gonna be a low - budget picture ; that ’s the agreement we made .
I ’m not going to have the luxury of shooting a whole lot of footage , a lot of extra scenes , and then carving a movie out of that in the editing room , which you can do with something like Apocalypse Now or Heaven ’s Gate .
I want to go out there and shoot everything that I write and only write what I ’m gonna shoot .
120 pages , 120 minutes — that gives you a two - hour movie and you may cut five minutes from it ; that ’s a good running time for a feature film , it ’ll give them the right number of shows per night , plus I can tell the story in that time .
About half of this film is gonna be the high school section , half the college section , so you ’ve got 60 pages , say , to do the high school section .
What things do you have to hit on to tell the high school part of that story ?
I write down what scenes have to be in there , then write down what kind of scenes I need for transition — of time , just to show that time is passing — and what scenes I need for development of their character .
Usually I come up with something like 25 or 30 scenes .
It ’s very mathematical , it ’s very technical ; but once you take that , and you say OK , I ’m gonna have 25 scenes in the first 60 pages of this movie , you realize that you have about two pages of two - minutes ’ screentime for each of these scenes .
Then you really start to look at what ’s gonna happen .
I want a scene here where she first meets the guy .
And I write very dense movies ; a lot of stuff happens at the same time .
I want her to meet the guy for the first time — how can I do that and have it only take up a minute of screentime and have it be something that is n’t just film shorthand , that is n’t just two lines and they meet cute and all this thing .
What I do is get an outline like that and I fill it in .
And the filling - it - in is where you really get stuck .
You say , How can I possibly do the senior prom and have him be robbing the tuxedo store and she ’s going to the prom with somebody else in five pages ?
That ’s where the discipline and also the visual part of screenwriting — I mean , most critics who write about film talk about the screenplay as if it ’s the dialogue : the screenplay was “ good ” if they liked the dialogue .
When I write a screenplay I write pictures , too .
I usually think ,
How would I write this movie if it was a silent movie , and still understand what ’s going on ?
And then I add dialogue when it ’s necessary .
That did n’t happen with Secaucus 7 because I knew I had to write a very verbal movie to be able to afford to do it .
But with most other pictures I say , Here ’s what I have to show in order to tell the story without a word of dialogue .
For instance , the guy who directed Piranha and directed The Howling often tells me , “ Write me some ‘ director ’s touches ’ ! ' ”
Which means write him some things that are totally visual , that he can just shoot because they ’re scripted there , and he ’ll get the credit .
On a screenplay , it ’s such a technical medium , and because I ’ve been working with such low budgets and have n’t had the luxury of being able to write a whole lot of material and sculpt a movie out of it , I work in a very technical fashion as far as the structure of the screenplay is concerned .
Then , within each of those two - or three - minute scenes I try to make it as human as possible .
Has it been more exciting for you to write screenplays and to follow the making of the films , than to write a novel ?
It ’s not a question of excitement .
It ’s a very different experience .
When you write a book , you ’re God : you can write any fuckin ’ thing you want , it comes out the way you want .
And there ’s not enough money in it so you ’re even tempted to say , “ Yes , I ’ll change it if you ’ll only please buy it and publish it , sir . ”
I ’ve always had the feeling that if they do n’t like it they can take a walk — I ’ll take it somewhere else or I ’ll stick it on a shelf with my fiction .
With the movie things I ’ve done , they ’ve been other people ’s ideas .
I did n’t wake up one morning and say , “ I have to write a movie called Piranha about little fish eating people ! ”
I was hired to do a job and I was interested in it and it was fun .
With movies , it ’s much more political .
It ’s more like what I was saying before about having to campaign for certain things .
Getting a screenplay written and made the way you want is like getting a bill through Congress .
You start out , you have this idea , you present it in the best way that you can , the way that you think it ’ll get through and still have the impact on the audience that you want it to have .
And then as you see it go through Congress , let ’s say they attach riders to it , they water it down , they compromise it , and you just hope that when it comes out the other end the piranhas have n’t gotten to it and it looks something like what you put in there and has some of the same feeling .
But it can really —
When you ’re just a screenwriter for hire , which I ’ve been , black can turn white .
You can really start out writing a movie that you want to be totally unexploitative that turns out to be a very exploitative movie — and they may not even change a line of dialogue ; and that ’s what you have to live with .
That ’s one of the reasons I would much rather direct the things that I write , or write things for people I trust , or who I know .

ATTORNEY -GENERAL
Rob Hulls will today announce a controversial compromise struck with the state 's religious groups that will allow them to continue to discriminate against gays and lesbians , single mothers and people who hold different spiritual beliefs .
In a move that has delighted religious groups but angered gay activists and discrimination experts , Mr Hulls will protect the right of hundreds of church - run organisations - including schools , hospitals and welfare services - to refuse to employ or provide services to people who they believe may undermine their beliefs .
Under the deal , Mr Hulls will allow church groups to continue discriminating on the grounds of sex , sexuality , marital and parental status and gender identity .
But they will be unable to discriminate on the basis of race , disability , age , physical features , political beliefs or activity , or breastfeeding .
The decision has dismayed groups that argued that the review was a chance to eliminate entrenched discrimination in Victoria , which has more exemptions to its equal opportunity law than any other state .
Leading discrimination law expert Professor Margaret Thornton said it was a win for fundamentalist religious groups .
'' In terms of a person 's private life … their sexual preference or marital status really has nothing to do with their ability to perform a job .
Being able to discriminate on marital status is particularly absurd .
It is really out of date .
It really amounts to the policing of women because the focus is on single mothers , not on men . ''
Google is developing a micropayment platform that will be “ available to both Google and non-Google properties within the next year , ” according to a document the company submitted to the Newspaper Association of America .
The system , an extension of Google Checkout , would be a new and unexpected option for the news industry as it considers how to charge for content online .
The revelation comes in an eight - page response to the NAA ’s request for paid - content proposals , which it extended to several major technology companies and startups .
It ’s surprising , given the newspaper industry ’s tenuous relationship with Google , that the company was involved at all .
In the document , which you can download here , Google outlines its “ vision of a premium content ecosystem ” that includes subscriptions across multiple news sites , syndication on third - party sites , accessibility to search , and various payment options , including small fees for access to individual pieces of content ( known as micropayments ) .
The company says :
Google believes that an open web benefits all users and publishers .
However , “ open ” need not mean free .
We believe that content on the Internet can thrive supported by multiple business models — including content available only via subscription .
Google describes its new e-commerce plans as “ in production ” and “ currently in the early planning stages . ”
The company says that Google Checkout is currently equipped to handle subscription payments for news sites but describes the process for merchants as “ fairly rudimentary ” and says the system “ could be improved to be more relevant for news and media companies . ”
The description of Google ’s micropayment system is more intriguing :
While currently in the early planning stages , micropayments will be a payment vehicle available to both Google and non-Google properties within the next year .
The idea is to allow viable payments of a penny to several dollars by aggregating purchases across merchants and over time .
Google will mitigate the risk of non-payment by assigning credit limits based on past purchasing behavior and having credit card instruments on file for those with higher credit limits and using our proprietary risk engines to track abuse or fraud .
Merchant integration will be extremely simple .
[ emphasis theirs ]
Transaction costs , including credit card fees , are a major hindrance to micropayment plans under consideration by the news industry , which is why Google ’s proposal could be appealing .
Of course , newspaper companies that have frequently accused Google of leaching off their revenue might be loathe to participate in a joint venture .
In a brief paragraph entitled “ business model , ” Google suggests that it would share revenue in a similar fashion to the iTunes App Store and its own Android Market , both of which take a 30 % cut of revenue .
But while these plans are emerging from Google ’s communication with the NAA , the micropayment system is likely to have bigger implications outside of the news industry .
In the same document , Google douses some cold water on micropayments for news : “ We do not believe it will be the norm for accessing content . ”
Google Checkout has longed been discussed as a potential micropayment platform and competitor to eBay ’s far more successful PayPal .
Google applied for a patent on a micropayment system in 2004 ; on page 7 of the application , Google mentions that “ a seller of web - based electronic content , such as newspaper stories , typically has a purchasing system that is valid for only the website providing the content . ”
A crudely drawn diagram describes Google ’s proposed alternative :
Google ’s document for the NAA also discusses publishers syndicating their content on third - party sites and sharing ad revenue , which sounds like what the Fair Syndication Consortium is proposing .
There are also a few paid - content scenarios that are worth checking out , including :
We envision the typical scenario to be where a user pays a monthly fee for access to a wide - ranging package of premium content .
One example of a “ package ” might be full access to the WSJ [ Wall Street Journal ] ; another “ package ” might include the top 10 business publications .
Google believes that there is real power and benefit to publishers in providing these sorts of broad , multi-publication access passes .
I ’m waiting on comment from Google .
UPDATE , 5:21 p.m. :
Here it is :
The Newspaper Association of America asked Google to submit some ideas for how they could use technology to generate more revenue from their digital content , and we shared some of those ideas in this proposal .
It ’s consistent with Google ’s effort to help publishers reach bigger audiences , better engage their readers and make more money .
We have always said that publishers have full control over their content .
If they decide to charge for it , we ’ll work with them to ensure that their content can be easily discovered if they want it to be .
As for Checkout , we do n’t have any specific new services to announce but we ’re always looking for ways to make payments online more efficient and user - friendly .
There ’s much more to explore in the NAA ’s report , which was produced by a task force of newspaper executives charged to explore “ platforms for monetizing digital content . ”
( The committee was formed after the NAA ’s secretive meeting in Chicago last spring . )
I ’ll update with more as I get to it , but if you see anything good , feel free to drop it in the comments or contact me by email .
Here ’s the document that Google submitted to the NAA :
Jetzt wird es auch in Österreich ernst .
Mit dem Vorwand , gegen Kinderpornografie zu kämpfen , denkt Justizministerin Claudia Bandion - Ortner laut über Netzsperren nach .
Danke an Martin
Thuer von ATV , dass dieser Beitrag ( eigentlich aus der Sendung gefallen ) , doch im Web gelandet ist :
Bandion - Ortner zum Thema Internetsperren auf ATV.at
Anlässlich der Eröffnung des Internet - Summits der Vereinigung der heimischen Internet - Provider ( ISPA ) sprach Bandion - Ortner aber nicht nur von Internet - Sperren , sondern auch von Netzzensur , sondern auch vom völlig unsinnigen und nichts bewirkenden Vorratsdatenspeichern .
Die Ministerin griff die dumme Idee der Zeitungsverleger auf , IP - Adressen sollten mit dem Zweck gespeichert werden , um Textpiraterie zu unterbinden .
Unscheinbar und abseits der Öffentlichkeit wäre das passiert , gäbe es nicht Twitter .
Gerald Bäck machte mich mit einem
Tweet darauf aufmerksam .
Kinderpornografie bekämpfen
Wenn die Ministerin meint , man müsse Kinderpornografie im Keime ersticken , so hat sie recht .
Es gibt nichts schändlicheres , als sich an Kindern zu vergehen und damit auch noch Profit zu machen .
Das ist verabscheuenswürdig und all jene , die das tun , gehören an ihren Eiern aufgehängt !
Aber : Durch Netzsperren verhindert man diese Verbrechen nicht .
Man kehrt sie lediglich in den Teppich .
Den Zugang zu Websites kann man zwar erschweren , jedoch nicht gänzlich unterbinden .
Wie sonst wäre es in China möglich , dass sich Aktivisten informieren ?
Es gibt immer Mittel und Wege drum herum .
Im Falle reiner DNS - Sperren sind Proxy - Server ein simples Mittel drumherum .
Wo liegt der Unterschied in der Bekämpfung ?
Das Problem an der Wurzel ( bei den Produzenten ) anzupacken , ist umständlicher , weil mühsamer .
Deutschland vs. Österreich
In Deutschland gibt es diese Diskussion schon länger .
Unser Glück ist das gute Abschneiden der FPD bei der letzten Bundestagswahl .
Die Freien Demokraten stellten sich von Anfang an gegen Netzsperren und machten deren Abschaffung mehrmals im Wahlkampf zu Koalitionsbedingungen .
Unser Glück ist auch , dass Gegner in dieser Frage auf sehr viel und sehr gutes Material aus Deutschland zurück greifen können .

Unser Pech ist , dass Österreich im Vergleich zu Deutschland weniger ausgeprägte Instrumente der direkten Demokratie kennt .
Eine Online - Petition im Nationalrat würde vermutlich gleich wenig bringen wie jene in Deutschland – es gibt sie aber ohnehin nicht .

You 're playing More Zombies
Description
You own a hot dog stand and run out of ketchup , but the new batch delivered has been tainted .
You and your hot dog stand are responsible for the spread of the zombie virus !

ACORN offered an undercover investigator for BigGovernment extensive advice on how to evade federal taxes .
Not just tax evasion , but also welfare fraud and advice on how to cover a conspiracy to traffic in underage hookers , as the conversation continued to develop .
Fox News has a headline blast on this story :
Officials with the controversial community organizing group ACORN were secretly videotaped offering to assist two individuals posing as a pimp and a prostitute , encouraging them to lie to the Internal Revenue Service and providing guidance on how to claim underage girls from South America as dependents .
The videotape was made public Thursday on BigGovernment.com , a political blog launched by Andrew Breitbart as a companion site to his BigHollywood .
breitbart.com blog .
In the videotape , made on July 24 , James O’Keefe , a 25 - year - old independent filmmaker , posed as a pimp with a 20 - year - old woman named “ Kenya ” who posed as a prostitute while visiting ACORN ’s office in Baltimore .
The couple told ACORN staffers they wanted to secure housing where the woman could continue to maintain a prostitution business .
ACORN denies everything :
A spokesman for ACORN , Scott Levenson , when asked to comment on the videotape , said : “ The portrayal is false and defamatory and an attempt at gotcha journalism .
This film crew tried to pull this sham at other offices and failed .
ACORN wants to see the full video before commenting further . ”
That ’s a little contradictory .
ACORN calls it false without having seen the video and says that the film crew tried this before and failed .
Well , apparently they succeeded on this occasion .
The video and the transcripts make this very clear :
Complete ACORN Baltimore Prostitution Investigation Transcript –
How do these ACORN community organizers express their concern for the downtrodden Salvadorean teens impressed into prostitution by this would - be madam and prospective politician ?
“ They do n’t even exist . ”
“ Call them ‘ exchange students ’ . ”
“ Train them to keep their mouths shut . ”
Neither of the two bat an eyelash at human trafficking while advising them to evade taxes and prosecution for their crimes .
Despicable .
It 's almost the last day of Crash Week , so we figured it 's about time to revel in the spectacular stupidity surrounding car crashes .
Below , our twelve favorite stupid car crashes caught on tape .
This one 's a classic " Hold my beer and watch this " moment .
What 's a better idea than setting the cruise control on your lifted pickup , opening the door and hopping up on the hood ?
Nothing , nothing is a better idea than that .
It 's tough to do , but this video proves it 's possible to have no spacial perception and completely fail at heeding basic hand signals .
How do you even do this ?
How is it possible to so effectively roll a station wagon as such low speeds .
Quite impressive .
Ever wonder what happens when you count your chickens before they 're hatched ?
This .
Does anyone look at this setup and think " Yeah , that should work out fine " ?
Nobody watching the video , that 's for sure .
A distinct sense of the inevitable failure is rewarded with a satisfying crunch .
Eddie Griffin crashed an Enzo during a promo event for the terrible car flick " Redline , " it was probably a publicity stunt , which makes it even more stupid , then Griffin opened his mouth , sending the stupid into the stratosphere .
Showing off what your BMW 7 - series can do , but not what it 's supposed to do , in front of onlookers in a drainage culvert and flipping it because of stupidity .
And some say karma does n't exist .
Put an idiot in a Lamborghini and he 's going to show off , this one put a lot of people in danger and got in an accident , screwing up his very expensive LP640 in the process .
Just desserts , some might say .
Why would you put someone who obviously can't operate a manual transmission in a kit car with some very serious horsepower ?
We say the stupidity here is on the part of the car 's owner , not of the woman behind the wheel .
Do n't try to look like a badass in a Bugatti Veyron after you spin out at the track by trying to pull a donut to get back on .
You will just take an embarrassing situation and make it an expensive one by backing it into the tire wall .
A Ferrari plus a opportunity to show off for other Ferrari owners during a Ferrari parade in cramped European streets practically guaranteed this type of thing would happen .
There are a lot of stupid things in this video , the people standing in the middle of a parking lot with no barrier wall while a bunch of dorks pull the e-brakes in their tooner cars come to mind .
Comparing the House Bill ’s Cost to the Baucus Proposal
Emptywheel has crunched the numbers on the Baucus plan , and has come up with how much money it will leave families if they actually have to use the insurance for any significant health care problems .
Here are her numbers for a family of four earning 300 % of the poverty levels or $ 66,150 .
Federal Taxes ( estimate from this page ) : $ 8,710 ( 13 % of income ) State Taxes ( using MI rates on $ 30,000 of income ) : $ 1,305 ( 2 % of income ) Food ( using “ low - cost USDA plan ” for family of four ) : $ 9,060 ( 13.5 % of income ) Home ( assume a straight 30 % of income ) : $ 20,100 ( 30 % of income ) Bad Max Tax : $ 20,610 ( 31 % of income ) Total : $ 59,785 ( 89 % of income ) Remainder for all other expenses ( including education , clothing , existing debt , transportation , etc. ) : $ 7,215 ( or 11 % of income .
Now , the House bill stops subsidies at EXACTLY the same level , 400 % of poverty level .
We can use Emptywheel ’s numbers for all of this .
The difference is that the House plan limits premiums to 10 % of gross income at 300 % ( pg 137 , pdf ) , and out of pocket expenses to $ 10,000 per family .
So that makes the House Tax : $ 10,000 + 6,615 = 16,615 or 25 % of income ( as opposed to 31 % ) .
The difference between the House plan and the Baucus plan is $ 4,025 .
Total expenses are $ 55,7607 , or The remainder for all other expenses is $ 11,240 or 17 % of income .
It ’s not a meaningless difference , $ 4,025 a year is $ 335 a month .
But it ’s not huge , either .
Now , one might say the real difference is that the House plan has a public option , which will drive down costs .
At best that ’s questionable .
I do n’t think so , neither does Taibbi , and neither do various other people .
Yes , a good public option would , but the House plan has a crippled public option .
I strongly expect that most people at 300 % are going to be paying 10 % of their income , because that ’s what insurance companies are going to charge them , since that ’s what they can charge them .
If you object to the Baucus bill because it will force families to buy insurance that will still financially cripple them , then there ’s little reason not to object to the House Bill for the exact same reason .
Update : Dave Johnson points out the following ( which would be true of Marcy and my numbers ) :
It seems you want to deduct the $ 20 K insurance premium from gross income before you calculate the federal tax , so fed tax should n’t be $ 8710 , it should be $ 66,150 – 20,610 = 45,540 * 13 % tax = $ 5920 tax .
The difference is $ 2,790 to both the Baucus and House plan numbers .
Which is slightly better for both of them .
I leave it to readers to decide if it ’s enough better to make either of them a good deal .
A neat new look and a price cut has worked wonders for Sony it seems , with sales of the PS3 increasing by more than 1,000 per cent according to the latest industry figures .
The new PS3 Slim may not please everybody , but coupled with a price drop , Sony has managed to gain an eleven fold increase in the sales of its console .
The data was assembled by Chart - Track who told gaming blog Spong that its system topped out at 999 per cent and that it was actually more .
11 fold
" There has actually been more than an 11 - fold increase in sales over the previous week , " said a spokesman .
" The PS3 also outsold the other three top - selling consoles ( Xbox 360 , Wii and DS Lite ) by 3 - 1 . "
Chart - track does not give out specific numbers , so we can't tell you exactly what that means - but the news is clearly positive for Sony and its PlayStation brand .
The price drop makes the Blu-ray playing console an attractive proposition and that is clearly something that the buying public are aware of .

Obama , rendition , and the decay of American democracy
26 August 2009
The Obama administration ’s decision to carry on the practice of rendition , by which “ terror suspects ” are spirited off to third - party countries to face torture , testifies to the profound decay of American democracy .
Rendition under Obama will be the same as the practice as it existed during the Bush administration .
An anonymous source close to the White House ’s Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies , who leaked the announcement to the New York Times , offered only vague assurances that prisoners would not be “ rendered ” to nations known to practice torture , and that diplomats would be allowed greater access .
The Bush administration made similar assurances .
In fact , there is no reason for rendition except to utilize the services of those nations most hospitable to torture and impervious to public scrutiny .
The announcement comes after a week of revelations related to the lawless and anti-democratic nature of the “ war on terror , ” which , taken together , reflect the growing power of the military - intelligence apparatus and the consolidation of the infrastructure for an American police state .
* On August 20 , it was revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) hired the private security firm then known as Blackwater Associates for a program of “ targeted killings ” of alleged Al Qaeda operatives .
The CIA violated US law in failing to inform Congress of this program .
* On August 21 , a New York Times report revealed that the Obama administration employs the same mercenary firm in the operation of the CIA ’s unmanned Predator drone assassination program in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
* On August 22 , Der Spiegel confirmed that the CIA hired Blackwater to transport prisoners from Guantánamo Bay to secret prisons in Central Asia , where they faced torture .
* On August 24 , the White House made public a heavily redacted version of a CIA inspector general ’s report discussing cases of agency torture and murder of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Among other forms of abuse , interrogators threatened inmates with death and warned that their mothers and children would be arrested and raped .
The report had been suppressed since 2004 and was released in compliance with a court order stemming from a Freedom of Information suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
Confronted with overwhelming evidence that its predecessor systematically violated US and international law — as well as basic human rights — the Obama administration has sought to contain the damage .
After releasing the CIA inspector general ’s report , Attorney General Eric Holder appointed a prosecutor to investigate a handful of torture cases discussed in the document .
The purview of the investigation will be limited to “ rogue ” agents who supposedly went beyond the forms of torture specifically endorsed by the Bush White House .
In keeping with administration policy , there will be no investigations of Bush administration officials , including Bush and his vice president , Dick Cheney , who formulated and oversaw the torture program .
Obama immediately distanced himself from even this half - measure .
A spokesman repeated Obama ’s mantra that “ we should be looking forward , not backward , ” while pinning responsibility for any investigation on Holder , who “ ultimately is going to make the decisions . ”
The CIA ’s open opposition to the report ’s release and the appointment of a prosecutor approached the level of insubordination .
An agency spokesman declared that the cases had already been investigated by the Bush Justice Department .
“ Justice has had the complete document since 2004 , and their career prosecutors have reviewed it carefully for legal accountability , ” said Paul Gimigliano .
“ That ’s already been done . ”
After the inspector general ’s report was released , the CIA took the unprecedented step of releasing two classified documents whose publication had been demanded by Cheney .
The former vice president claimed the documents would demonstrate the necessity of “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
Predictably , these documents made no specific reference to intelligence secured through torture .
Instead , they offered lurid and unsubstantiated claims about terror plots disrupted through CIA interrogations .
Cheney returned to the attack on Tuesday , criticizing the Justice Department ’s proposed investigation in the most ominous terms .
It raises “ doubts about this administration ’s ability to be responsible for our nation ’s security , ” Cheney charged .
The terms of the “ debate ” that emerged after the publication of the inspector general ’s report was very much dictated by the military - intelligence apparatus .
It hinged on whether or not torture “ works . ”
This , it was claimed , is a matter for legitimate intellectual discussion .
Current CIA Director Leon Panetta , an Obama appointee , echoed Cheney in declaring that torture had disrupted attacks .
Panetta suggested that whether or not such methods are “ the only way to obtain that information will remain a legitimate area of dispute , with Americans holding a range of views on the methods used . ”
In this context , Obama ’s declaration that rendition will continue was a transparent bid to curry favor with the military - intelligence apparatus .
Even the Times noted that the announcement “ seemed intended in part to offset the impact ” of the release of the inspector general ’s report .
Obama ’s continuation of rendition is yet another repudiation of his campaign promises .
In an article in Foreign Affairs in 2007 , Obama said he would “ eliminate the practice of extreme rendition , where we outsource our torture to other countries . ”
Many of those who voted for Obama did so out of revulsion over the Bush administration ’s use of torture and other illegal methods .
But , as with Obama ’s anti-war posturing and his pledges to reverse the pro-corporate agenda of Bush , the campaign promises of the apostle of “ change you can believe in ” have proven worthless .
On every essential question , the Obama administration is continuing and deepening the reactionary policies of his predecessor .
Obama ’s endorsement of rendition demonstrates that the anti-democratic methods of US imperialism — torture , kidnapping , assassination , aggressive war — are not rooted in the personal characteristics of politicians and cannot be overcome by replacing one party of American imperialism by another .
The danger of a police state emerges inexorably from the turn by the ruling elite as a whole to aggressive war and militarism as a means of offsetting the deepening crisis of American capitalism .
At the same time , the crisis is being used to effect a vast restructuring of class relations in the US to the benefit of the financial aristocracy which controls both parties and all the levers of state power .
The social inequality that is being created is such that the brutal measures currently employed in the “ war on terror ” will ultimately be unleashed on the working class within the US .

Mr Chen chose to stay in detention rather than hear the verdict in person Taiwan 's former President Chen Shui-bian has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of corruption by a court in Taipei .
Mr Chen was charged with embezzlement , taking bribes and money laundering , involving a total of $ 15 m ( £ 9 m ) while in office from 2000 - 2008 .
Mr Chen had denied the charges , saying they were politically motivated .
His wife , Wu Shu-chen , already jailed for perjury in the case , was also sentenced to life for corruption .
' Illegal ' sentence Taipei District Court convicted Mr Chen on six charges and Mrs Wu on seven charges .
The were also fined $ 15 m .
" Chen Shui-bian and Wu Shu- chen were sentenced to life in prison because Chen has done grave damage to the country and Wu because she was involved in corruption deals as the first lady , " said court spokesman Huang Chun-ming .
CHEN SHUI - BIAN SENTENCES
Life sentence for embezzling $ 3.15 m from a presidential fund Eight years for money laundering Lesser sentences for taking $ 12 m in bribes and kickbacks Differing views on Taiwan trial Mr Chen 's sentence :
Your views Taiwan divided by conviction
A spokesman for Mr Chen said the sentence was " illegal " , pointing to a decision to replace the judges in mid-trial .
The former president has said he will appeal .
Mr Chen has previously said the charges were constructed by the ruling Kuomintang ( KMT ) government in a political vendetta .
He has admitted accepting money but said it was campaign contributions .
Several dozen of his supporters were outside the court on Friday as the verdict was given , waving placards declaring his innocence .
Unprecedented trial Mr Chen and his wife were both sentenced to life for embezzling $ 3.15 m ( £ 1.9 m ) from a special presidential fund .
They received lesser sentences on the charges related to accepting at least $ 9 m in bribes from a Taiwanese company to help it sell a piece of land to the government and of accepting nearly $ 3 m more in kickbacks for helping a contractor gain a government project .
Mrs
Wu had already been sentenced on 2 September to one year in prison for perjury for asking her children to lie in court .
Mr Chen 's supporters say he is being persecuted
The three - year case also involved close family members of the couple , as well as former aides and government officials .
Their son and daughter - in - law received sentences ranging from 20 - 30 months for money laundering .
Other relatives received suspended sentences .
Two former advisors were given sentences of 16 and 20 years in prison .
The case , involving revelations of corruption at the highest levels , has gripped the nation , says the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei .
It is unprecedented in Taiwan 's short history as a democracy .
Direct presidential elections were first held in 1996 , after one - party rule ended in the 1980s .
Many expected a guilty verdict but some believed the trial was political revenge on the part of the new ruling party .
Mr Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party favoured Taiwan 's independence from the Chinese mainland , angering Beijing as well as the pro-China Kuomintang ( KMT ) in Taiwan .
Relations between Beijing and Taipei have been improving since the KMT , under President Ma Ying - jeou , took office last year .
Taiwan has been ruled separately from China since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 , when the defeated Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan to create a self - governing entity .
But Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province which should be reunified with the mainland , by force if necessary .

World 's largest wave farm gets the green light under plans to convert South - West England into renewable energy leader
South - West England will become the world 's largest wave farm under government plans to create a new leading centre in wave and tidal technologies .
The Wave Hub project will see a giant national grid- connected socket built on the seabed off the coast of Cornwall in a pioneering energy project .
Announcing an investment of £ 9.5 million for the scheme , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said it would create up to 1,800 new jobs .
A PowerBuoy wave energy converter , which is to be used as part of the Wave Hub project off the coast of Cornwall
He also named the region as the UK 's first Low Carbon Economic Area .
The Wave Hub project aims to create the UK's first offshore facility which will demonstrate the operation of wave energy generation devices .
The Wave Hub provides an area of sea with grid connection and planning consent where arrays and devices can be operated over several years .
These will eventually be able to generate electricity from the power of the waves and will allow developers to transmit and sell energy to Britain 's electricity distribution grid .
The project received the official go - ahead today from the South West Regional Development Agency ( RDA ) .
An artists impression of the Wave Hub project , which will see a giant national grid- connected socket built on the seabed off the coast of Cornwall
Stephen Peacock , enterprise and innovation executive director of the South West RDA , said it was an unprecedented opportunity for the region .
' Being identified as the UK's first Low Carbon Economic Area is a tremendous accolade and recognition of our commitment to develop this unprecedented economic opportunity , ' he said .
' We want to forge a new industry from the seas around our shores and today 's announcements cement our position as a global leader in wave and tidal technologies .
' We also welcome the Low Carbon Industrial Strategy which sets out a range of opportunities to ensure that we take advantage of a global market for low carbon products and services that could be worth £ 4.3 trillion by 2015 . '
It is hoped the South - West region willl become a world centre for wave and tidal energy
A further £ 10 million has been made available for the South West RDA to support other marine energy projects in the region .
The project will see infrastructure built including a sub-station building and an adjacent connection point to the distribution network .
From there , a cable will be taken through a duct beneath the sand dunes and then across the seabed to an eight square kilometre area within which the devices will be moored .
The European Regional Development Fund Convergence Programme also announced it would invest £ 20 million in Wave Hub , which will be commissioned next summer .
The first equipment orders for the project were placed this week .
The Wave Hub project could create up to 1,800 jobs for the region
The combined Government , RDA , European and private sector funding in the South West 's marine energy programme in the next two years is expected to top £ 100 million .
Today 's announcements form part of the Government 's Low Carbon Industrial Strategy .
This includes a White Paper on The Low Carbon Transition Plan as well as the UK's Renewable Energy Strategy , the Low Carbon Industrial Strategy and Carbon Reduction Strategy for Transport .
Well , says Grandad to himself , wo n’t you just look at that .
This is something new .
Believe it or not .
I ’m 87 years old , and this is something new to me .
Just yesterday I was thinking about how dead that grass looked .
It has no green left .
It ’s all dried up and brittle .
Poor grass .
Shame they let the field get that way .
Shame on Chicago for letting it get to this point .
Children play in that field , dogs play in that field , amateur softball players play in that field .
Citizens play in that field .
And it ’s all dried up and brittle .
Just look at it .
How could they let it get that way ?
A whole summer passes , a whole summer with its long hours of heat .
Three months , and not a drop of rain .
You ca n’t blame the grass for showing signs of weakness .
For letting go of its verdure and turning bland after three months of drought .
The grass had no choice .
Sun beats grass in the game of rock , paper , scissors .
Boy that hose sure is strong .
Just look at it .
So , this is how they fight fires ?
With a hose on a retractable ladder .
Imagine the water pressure in that sucker .
It must be watering grass a 150 yards out .
But what about the grass nearby ?
Are they just going to forget about that grass ?
Did Chief say it was acceptable to ignore that grass so long as they watered the grass a 150 yards out ?
I think all those firemen in their polyester uniforms should be watering the grass nearby .
What are they doing anyways ?
Just talking ?
That ’s what it looks like to me from up here .
A whole bunch of them , too !
It ’s not lunch yet .
Why do n’t they each take a hose and get to work ?
Water that grass nearby .
It ’s all dried up and brittle , too .
Ca n’t you see that ?
I hear they only have to work 8 days every month , these firemen , but for those 8 days they have to sleep at the firehouse , so it ’s like working ’ round the clock … for 8 days , and not all at once either .
That does n’t seem too bad if you ask me , says Grandad to himself , get paid a respectable salary with benefits for working 8 , 24 hour days every month .
The other 22 you can just loiter .
Just stand around with your hands on your hips while another batch of firemen take care of the fire station .
But the least they can do is water the grass nearby for Chrissake !
If they only work 8 days every month , why not water the grass nearby when they do work ?
It ’s showing signs of weakness , too .
How many are there ?
1,2,3 … at least a dozen of them .
There ’s even some under the tree across the street , standing on the grass instead of watering it .
Incredible !
How man firemen does it take to screw in a light bulb ?
Ha !
I think I ’ve seen just about everything now , says Grandad to himself , I think nothing can surprise me anymore .
Yes .
I ’ve seen everything under the sun , including this poor grass left parched .
Hey , but the firemen are watering some of the field , and that counts for something .
They are working for the greater good of Chicago .
Things could be worse .
They could be sitting at the firehouse , legs propped up on a table .
Smoky the fire dog keeping them company .
Or they could be trying to save lives in burning buildings .
Yes .
They could be trying to save lives and they could be dying trying to save those lives .
I need to reserve judgement in times like this .
I need to be happy for anyone who can spend their time watering grass , even if it ’s a 150 yards out , because they could be doing something a whole lot worse .

It is not just the career safe seat members of Congress and the Senate who are vulnerable to getting caught up in the arrogance and elitism of power .
Relative back bencher Baron Hill from Indiana 's 9th District might well have surged into the lead in the contest to see which member of congress had the most out of touch and arrogant attitude during the town hall meetings .
You have to watch this video to believe it .
It starts right after he has announced that there will be no videos allowed and goes into question and answer .
The first question is from a school student trying to fulfill a class assignment .
It is only 1:11 in length .
Some highlights :
A photo essay by Marty Pickleman , Grade 5
I like video games .
They are fun .
Sometimes I carry my video games in a green box .
I unfold them like this .
My sister likes to scare me by hiding in the box and jumping out .
If she beats me at Tetris , I fold her back up .
If I win , she makes a bowl of chunky butter cubes .
Sometimes my friends come over .
If there is n’t enough room , we become tiny .
If there ’s too much room , we get really old .
Some days , I play video games without cords .
Some days , I play them without looking at the TV .
And some days , I play them without being white .
Video games are fun .

A Cumbrian football team that endured a 90 - game losing streak has finally notched up a victory .
Since losing their first game 19 - 0 , Harraby Athletic failed to secure a single win for three years - until now .
The under - 14s , who have always finished bottom of the Longhorn Youth Football League , beat Edenvale Hawks 3 - 2 at Harraby 's Hammonds Park .
Coach Brett Preston praised the team 's persistence adding : " The looks on the kids ' faces were priceless . "
Harraby trailed 0 - 1 early in the game , but fought back to secure three points for the first time .
The team were awarded one point in the league last year , but only because the opposing team did not turn up .
Mr Preston said that defeat could sometimes help the team bond .
" When they go back to school after a 12 , 13 , 14 goal defeat , they do tend to stick together .
" They will barricade themselves in against a barrage of abuse . "
However , since the win on 5 September he had received phone calls from other managers congratulating them on their first - ever victory .
In what is sure to join the list of strangest athlete injuries ( although this came on the field ) , Adrian Beltre of the Seattle Mariners has been placed on the DL with a torn testicle .
Yep , the dude straight up busted his balls on a ground ball .
Fanhouse has the story :
On Thursday , Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu , shaking his head in bewilderment , announced Beltre would be placed on the disabled list with a torn right testicle and was even more stunned when told that Beltre does not wear an athletic supporter , better known as a cup that protects the groin area .
I too like the freedom of free - balling it when playing sports , but this sure does make me think twice about that .
Apparently Adrian has not seen this video ( I recommend fast forwarding to the 4 minute mark , if you have little patience ) :
In the ninth inning Wednesday night at Safeco Field , Beltre took the brunt of a hard grounder by the White Sox ’ Alexei Ramirez to the groin area .
Beltre recovered the baseball but threw wildly to first base for an error .
He remained in the game , but labored for three more at - bats .
Amazingly , he collected a single in the 14th inning and scored the winning run on Ken Griffey Jr. ’s single .
I have to admit that is fairly bad ass to get the winning run with some dangling torn nuts .
MAN CRUSH !
I ’ll spare you the rest of the details of the article , you can click through for yourself .
I do n’t think any man can read it without cringing .
We ’ll just leave you with this :
September 16 , 2009 – Q : We wear a lot of cotton clothing , and someone told us that cotton is heavily sprayed with pesticides while it is growing .
Is this true and can the cotton clothing hold the pesticides ?
Is there organic cotton ?
A : According to a 2007 report on deadly chemicals in cotton , compiled by the Environmental Justice Foundation and Pesticide Action Network , cotton is the world ’s most important nonfood agricultural commodity , yet it accounts for 16 percent of global insecticide releases – more than any other single crop .
Many of the pesticides used on cotton have been implicated in human cancer , water contamination , soil degradations and the killing off of various animals .
In 1991 , a train loaded with Metan sodium , which is used as a soil sterilant before planting cotton , derailed and spilled its contents into the Sacramento River , resulting in the death of every living organism in the river for 40 miles .
A few years later heavy rains washed the chemical Endosulfan from cotton fields and into Big Nance Creek in Alabama and killed almost a quarter of a million fish .
On the other hand , there is a product that is much more efficient and much more valuable than cotton .
That product is industrial hemp : A variety of Cannabis sativa , a tall annual herb of the mulberry family , native to Asia .
Industrial hemp is not marijuana ( Cannabis indica ) , as they are two different species of plants .
Some folks would like us to believe that growing any hemp is comparable to growing marijuana .
This is nonsense .
Switching to hemp instead of cotton would result in the use of less pesticide than is currently being applied to our environment .
Cotton growing is probably the largest polluter on the planet in terms of releasing pesticides into our environment .
The chemicals not only target insects , but go into the groundwater and affect nontarget organisms as well , including humans .
Hemp , on the other hand , has long been considered a weed , but it does not require pesticides to grow .
Another option is organically grown cotton .
No pesticides , fertilizers or defoliants are used in growing organic cotton .
Organic cotton can also be bred in different colors to eliminate the need for dye .
It comes in a range of earth tones , such as rust , cream , browns and greens .
Chemically dependent cotton is no longer necessary , and we should seriously look into increasing our yield of organic cotton and using industrial hemp .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A group of schoolchildren who reared a lamb from birth and named it Marcus has overridden objections by parents and rights activists and voted to send the animal to slaughter .
Sheep take part in the annual sheep parade through the heart of Madrid November 12 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Susana Vera
Marcus the six - month - old lamb has now been culled , the head teacher of the primary school in Kent confirmed on Monday , after the school ’s council -- a 14 - member group of children aged 6 to 11 -- voted 13 - 1 to have him killed .
The decision has provoked fury among animal - loving celebrities , animal and human rights campaigners and the parents of some of the children , and led to threats against Lydd primary school and its teachers , according to a member of staff .
Around 250 children at the school take part in a program designed to teach them about rearing and breeding animals .
The educational farm was started this year , with Marcus being hand - fed by the children .
The children also look after ducks , chickens , rabbits and guinea pigs .
The intention had been to buy pigs with the money raised from slaughtering Marcus , but those plans have been put on hold following the furor created by the lamb ’s culling .
The school said the program may now have to be stopped .
“ It ’s all up in the air , ” said a member of staff .
“ There ’s been so much pressure on us as a result of all this . ”
Despite that , the school said there had been overwhelming support among the children , the staff and most of the parents to have Marcus -- a castrated male who could not have been used for breeding -- sent to the slaughterhouse .
But opponents branded it heartless and cruel , with animal rights campaigners asking why Marcus could not have been used to teach the children about wool , and human rights campaigners worried about the emotional impact of Marcus ’s death on the children .
A popular talkshow host offered to buy the lamb and give it sanctuary and Facebook groups sprung up to rally support to keep Marcus alive .
But the children had the final say .
The school defended the children ’s decision , calling it educational .
“ When we started the farm in spring 2009 , the aim was to educate the children in all aspects of farming life and everything that implies , ” the school said in a statement .
“ The children have had a range of opportunities to discuss this issue , both in terms of the food cycle and the ethical aspect ...
It is important for everyone to move on from this issue , so the children can focus on their education . ”
Fusion Centers Will Have Access to Classified Military Intelligence
Speaking at San Francisco ’s Commonwealth Club September 15 , Director of National Intelligence Admiral Dennis C. Blair , disclosed that the current annual budget for the 16 agency U.S. “ Intelligence Community ” ( IC ) clocks - in at $ 75 billion and employs some 200,000 operatives world - wide , including private contractors .
In unveiling an unclassified version of the National Intelligence Strategy ( NIS ) , Blair asserts he is seeking to break down “ this old distinction between military and nonmilitary intelligence , ” stating that the “ traditional fault line ” separating secretive military programs from overall intelligence activities “ is no longer relevant . ”
As if to emphasize the sweeping nature of Blair ’s remarks , Federal Computer Week reported September 17 that “ some non-federal officials with the necessary clearances who work at intelligence fusion centers around the country will soon have limited access to classified terrorism - related information that resides in the Defense Department ’s classified network . ”
According to the publication :
Under the program , authorized state , local or tribal officials will be able to access pre-approved data on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network .
However , they wo n’t have the ability to upload data or edit existing content , officials said .
They also will not have access to all classified information , only the information that federal officials make available to them .
The non-federal officials will get access via the Homeland Security department ’s secret - level Homeland Security Data Network .
That network is currently deployed at 27 of the more than 70 fusion centers located around the country , according to DHS .
Officials from different levels of government share homeland security - related information through the fusion centers .
( Ben Bain , “ DOD opens some classified information to non-federal officials , ” Federal Computer Week , September 17 , 2009 )
Since the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the federal government has encouraged the explosive growth of fusion centers .
As envisaged by securocrats , these hybrid institutions have expanded information collection and sharing practices from a wide variety of sources , including commercial databases , among state and local law enforcement agencies , the private sector and federal security agencies , including military intelligence .
But early on , fusion centers like the notorious “ red squads ” of the 1960s and ’ 70s , morphed into national security shopping malls where officials monitor not only alleged terrorists but also left - wing and environmental activists deemed threats to the existing corporate order .
It is currently unknown how many military intelligence analysts are stationed at fusion centers , what their roles are and whether or not they are engaged in domestic surveillance .
If past practices are an indication of where current moves by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) will lead , in breaking down the “ traditional fault line ” that prohibits the military from engaging in civilian policing , then another troubling step along the dark road of militarizing American society will have been taken .
U.S. Northern Command : Feeding the Domestic Surveillance Beast
Since its 2002 stand - up , U.S. Northern Command ( USNORTHCOM ) and associated military intelligence outfits such as the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) and the now - defunct Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) have participated in widespread surveillance of antiwar and other activist groups , tapping into Pentagon and commercial databases in a quixotic search for “ suspicious patterns . ”
As they currently exist , fusion centers are largely unaccountable entities that function without proper oversight and have been involved in egregious civil rights violations such as the compilation of national security dossiers that have landed activists on various terrorist watch - lists .
Antifascist Calling reported last year on the strange case of Marine Gunnery Sgt. Gary Maziarz and Col. Larry Richards , Marine reservists stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego .
Maziarz , Richards , and a group of fellow Marines , including the cofounder of the Los Angeles County Terrorist Early Warning Center ( LACTEW ) , stole secret files from the Strategic Technical Operations Center ( STOC ) .
When they worked at STOC , the private spy ring absconded with hundreds of classified files , including those marked “ Top Secret , Special Compartmentalized Information , ” the highest U.S. Government classification .
The files included surveillance dossiers on the Muslim community and antiwar activists in Southern California .
According to the San Diego Union - Tribune which broke the story in 2007 , before being run to ground Maziarz , Richards and reserve Navy Commander Lauren Martin , a civilian intelligence contractor at USNORTHCOM , acquired information illegally obtained from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network ( SIPRNet ) .
This is the same classified system which fusion centers will have access to under the DoD ’s new proposal .
Claiming they were acting out of “ patriotic motives , ” the Marine spies shared this classified counterterrorism information with private contractors in the hope of obtaining future employment .
Although they failed to land plush private sector counterterrorism jobs , one cannot rule out that less than scrupulous security firms might be willing to take in the bait in the future in order to have a leg up on the competition .
So far , only lower level conspirators have been charged .
According to the Union - Tribune “ Marine Cols .
Larry Richards and David Litaker , Marine Maj. Mark Lowe and Navy Cmdr. Lauren Martin also have been mentioned in connection with the case , but none has been charged . ”
One codefendant ’s attorney , Kevin McDermott , told the paper , “ This is the classic situation that if you have more rank , the better your chance of not getting charged . ”
Sound familiar ?
Call it standard operating procedure in post - constitutional America where high - level officials and senior officers walk away scott - free while grunts bear the burden , and do hard time , for the crimes of their superiors .
Fusion Centers and Military Intelligence : Best Friends Forever !
Another case which is emblematic of the close cooperation among fusion centers and military intelligence is the case of John J. Towery , a Ft. Lewis , Washington civilian contractor who worked for the Army ’s Fort Lewis Force Protection Unit .
In July , The Olympian and Democracy Now ! broke the story of how Towery had infiltrated and spied on the Olympia Port Militarization Resistance ( OlyPMR ) , an antiwar group , and shared this information with police .
Since 2006 , the group has staged protests at Washington ports and has sought to block military cargo from being shipped to Iraq .
According to The Olympian :
OlyPMR member Brendan Maslauskas Dunn said in an interview Monday that he received a copy of the e-mail from the city of Olympia in response to a public records request asking for any information the city had about “ anarchists , anarchy , anarchism , SDS ( Students for a Democratic Society ) , or Industrial Workers of the World . ” ( Jeremy Pawloski , “ Fort Lewis investigates claims employee infiltrated Olympia peace group , ” The Olympian , July 27 , 2009 )
What Dunn discovered was highly disturbing to say the least .
Towery , who posed as an anarchist under the name “ John Jacob , ” had infiltrated OlyPMR and was one of several listserv administrators that had control over the group ’s electronic communications .
The civilian intelligence agent admitted to Dunn that he had spied on the group but claimed that no one paid him and that he did n’t report to the military ; a statement that turned out to be false .
Joseph Piek , a Fort Lewis spokesperson confirmed to The Olympian that Towery was a contract employee and that the infiltrator “ performs sensitive work within the installation law enforcement community , ” but “ it would not be appropriate for him to discuss his duties with the media . ”
In September , The Olympian obtained thousands of pages of emails from the City of Olympia in response to that publication ’s public - records requests .
The newspaper revealed that the Washington Joint Analytical Center ( WJAC ) , a fusion center , had copied messages to Towery on the activities of OlyPMR in the run-up to the group ’s November 2007 port protests .
According to the paper ,
The WJAC is a clearinghouse of sorts of anti-terrorism information and sensitive intelligence that is gathered and disseminated to law enforcement agencies across the state .
The WJAC receives money from the federal government .
The substance of nearly all of the WJAC ’s e-mails to Olympia police officials had been blacked out in the copies provided to The Olympian .
( Jeremy Pawloski , “ Army e-mail sent to police and accused spy , ” The Olympian , September 12 , 2009 )
Also in July , the whistleblowing web site Wikileaks published a 1525 page file on WJAC ’s activities .
Housed at the Seattle Field Office of the FBI , one document described WJAC as an agency that “ builds on existing intelligence efforts by local , regional , and federal agencies by organizing and disseminating threat information and other intelligence efforts to law enforcement agencies , first responders , and key decision makers throughout the state . ”
Fusion centers are also lucrative cash cows for enterprising security grifters .
Wikileaks investigations editor Julian Assange described the revolving - door that exists among Pentagon spy agencies and the private security firms who reap millions by placing interrogators and analysts inside outfits such as WJAC .
Assange wrote ,
There has been extensive political debate in the United States on how safe it would be to move Guantánamo ’s detainees to US soil–but what about their interrogators ?
One intelligence officer , Kia Grapham , is hawked by her contracting company to the Washington State Patrol .
Grapham ’s confidential resume boasts of assisting in over 100 interrogations of “ high value human intelligence targets ” at Guantánamo .
She goes on , saying how she is trained and certified to employ Restricted Interrogation Technique : Separation as specified by FM 2 - 22.3 Appendix M. Others , like , Neoma Syke , managed to repeatedly flip between the military and contractor intelligence work –without even leaving the building .
The file details the placement of six intelligence contractors inside the Washington Joint Analytical Center ( WAJAC ) on behalf of the Washington State Patrol at a cost of around $ 110,000 per year each .
Such intelligence “ fusion ” centers , which combine the military , the FBI , state police , and others , have been internally promoted by the US Army as means to avoid restrictions preventing the military from spying on the domestic population .
( Julian Assange , “ The spy who billed me twice , ” Wikileaks , July 29 , 2009 )
The Wikileaks documents provide startling details on how firms such as Science Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) , The Sytex Group and Operational Applications Inc. routinely place operatives within military intelligence and civilian fusion centers at a premium price .
Assange wonders whether these job placements are not simply evidence of corruption but rather , are “ designed to evade a raft of hard won oversight laws which apply to the military and the police but not to contractors ?
Is it to keep selected personnel out of the Inspector General ’s eye ? ”
The available evidence strongly suggests that it is .
As the American Civil Liberties Union documented in their 2007 and 2008 reports on fusion center abuses , one motivation is precisely to subvert oversight laws which do not apply to private mercenary contractors .
The civil liberties ’ watchdog characterized the rapid expansion of fusion centers as a threat to our constitutional rights and cited specific areas of concern : “ their ambiguous lines of authority , the troubling role of private corporations , the participation of the military , the use of data mining and their excessive secrecy . ”
And speaking of private security contractors outsourced to a gaggle on intelligence agencies , investigative journalist Tim Shorrock revealed in his essential book Spies For Hire , that since 9/11 “ the Central Intelligence Agency has been spending 50 to 60 percent of its budget on for - profit contractors , or about $ 2.5 billion a year , and its number of contract employees now exceeds the agency ’s full - time workforce of 17,500 . ”
Indeed , Shorrock learned that “ no less than 70 percent of the nation ’s intelligence budget was being spent on contracts . ”
However , the sharp spike in intelligence outsourcing to well - heeled security corporations comes with very little in the way of effective oversight .
The House Intelligence Committee reported in 2007 that the Bush , and now , the Obama administrations have failed to develop a “ clear definition of what functions are ‘ inherently governmental ’ ; ” meaning in practice , that much in the way of systematic abuses can be concealed behind veils of “ proprietary commercial information . ”
As we have seen when the Abu Ghraib torture scandal broke in 2004 , and The New York Times belatedly blew the whistle on widespread illegal surveillance of the private electronic communications of Americans in 2005 , cosy government relationships with security contractors , including those embedded within secretive fusion centers , will continue to serve as a “ safe harbor ” for concealing and facilitating state crimes against the American people .
After all , $ 75 billion buys a lot of silence .

Brian
Haw is definitely not a morning person .
Today was the veteran activist ’s 2,999th day camped out on the pavements of Parliament Square and the cantakerous 60 - year - old was in no mood for small talk .
“ I do n’t do talk about the weather , ” he grumbled , stirring a fifth spoonful of sugar into a milky cup of coffee which had just been boiled on a small gas burner behind his tent .
“ I hate it when people ask me all those silly questions , like ‘ How ’s it going ?
Did you sleep well ?’ or ‘ How long are you staying here ? ’
It ’s meaningless . ”
And he is equally nonplussed at the thought that tomorrow will mark the 3,000th day of a world - famous protest that defied an entire government and remains the most permanent symbol of free speech in a country which has suffered increasingly autocratic legislation curbing the right to free assembly .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
“ I ’m not into this Guinness Book of Records rubbish , ” he says , tipping back his pin-badge littered helmet to reveal a weathered face and two piercing blue eyes .
“ Three thousand bloody days , sleeping here and watching the politicians lie while children continue to die and people walk by .
And each one of us is responsible .
Each one of us , responsible . ”
Eight years of living in a tent opposite the Houses of Parliament , railing against the country ’s political elite through two bitterly controversial wars , has made Mr Haw an irritable man .
Any of the friends , passers by , tourists and journalists who have come across him will be more than aware the deep seated anger he feels towards the British government , which he accuses of anything from “ murder , to torture and genocide ” .
When the former carpenter - turned - peace - activist first appeared outside the Houses of Parliament on the 2 June 2001 to begin his one man protest few could have guessed that he would stay there for what has already the best part of a decade .
He began by demonstrating against Britain ’s support for the UN sanctions in Iraq , but the ongoing wars in that country and Afghanistan have since given him plenty more opportunity to consolidate his contempt for British foreign policy .
Since then council chiefs , police and the Government have all tried and failed to evict him .
Tired of his non -stop megaphone vigils , MPs even passed a specific piece of legislation aimed at ridding Parliament Square of his presence which - for the first time in over 350 years - effectively made it illegal to protest outside the Houses of Parliament without permission ( a promise by Gordon Brown to repeal that law has so far failed to materialise ) .
Undeterred , Mr Haw has fought and eventually won every attempt to have him removed .
The sheer logistics of his continued protest are remarkable .
For the past 3,000 days Mr Haw has called the pavement opposite the Houses of Parliament his home .
His bed is nestled under a leaking and weather beaten tent whilst the few possessions he has beyond the limited remaining placards he is allowed to display by Westminster City Council lie under a tarpaulin sheet which crawls with mice .
A modern day ascetic , he survives purely on the kindness of strangers and a small contingent of sympathisers who donate food and tobacco , which has lent him a thick bronchial cough that splutters throughout much of his sentences .
Daily washes , meanwhile , are made in a bucket but once a week he has the luxury of being able to take a shower at the home of an anonymous supporter .
To stay in contact with the outside world he beckons all and sundry to his makeshift shrine or calls friends on his mobile phone , which is charged by a sympathetic toilet attendant in Westminster tube station .

But eight years of living on the streets have clearly taken their toll .
Mr Haw ’s weathered skin and viciously tanned arms are testament to the days on end spent out in the elements and his frame is visibly skeletal .
Leaning forward on two crutches and sporting a t - shirt emblazoned with anti-war slogans , Mr Haw cuts a lonely figure among the thronging crowds of scantily clad tourists who stop to take pictures of Parliament ’s most eccentric resident .
A year into his protest , his wife Kay filed for divorce and he rarely sees any of their seven children who now range from 16 - 30 - years - old .
Although he has previously insisted his family support his vigil , births , weddings and birthdays have all gone by leaving the father of seven deeply embittered .
“ My kids are an off limit topic , " ” he says , angered by the question of whether they still stay in touch with him .
“ But I have effectively lost my family because our nation does n’t care enough .
I love my wife and children so much .
But I blame the Government for losing them because I should n’t have been here eight years .
I did n’t want to be here eight bloody years but while the killing and murder continues , I ’m staying . ”
Despite living his life so publicly , Mr Haw remains a deeply private person .
Personal questions inevitably receive replies that wind their way back to his raison d’etre – the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan or the war in Iraq .
For instance , in answer to a question about whether he prays ( Mr Haw is an evangelical Christian ) he replies : “ People get so organised do n’t they ?
They think that prayer is something you do on your knees .
Well I bet there are a few soldiers praying on the other side of the world right now .
And who is going to answer their prayers ?
I would suggest that you are the answer to your own prayers , if you get off your arse and do something . ”
One of the few times he breaks into a smile is remembering how he was voted Most Inspiring Political Figure at the 2007 Channel 4 Political Awards .
“ Yeah , that felt damn good , ” he recalls .
“ Ordinary Joe Bloggs on the street being voted ahead of Blair , Cameron and General “ Donut ” Dannatt .
That felt great . ”
But while Mr Haw remains an angry individual who feels he is a long way from achieving his goal of “ peace , love and justice for all ” , his days of fighting the law over his pitch are largely over .
If anything , his peace campaign has grown .
There are now anywhere between three and five regular campaigners who join Mr Haw in Parliament Square and local officials appear to have largely abandoned trying to evict them .
Barbara Tucker – or “ Babs ” as she is known among the campers – is the square ’s longest squatting resident after Mr Haw .
Barring her 33 arrests , the half Australian half English protestor , who is campaigning for peace in the Middle East , has herself camped out for more than 1,000 days now .
" ”t was Brian that inspired me , ” she says .
“ I had the complete capitalist lifestyle before all this but I gave it up when my two sons reached adulthood .
Brian showed me that a single man can make a difference .
Everyday we meet so many people from around the world who have heard what he has done and want to meet him when they are in London , it 's amazing . ”
As a busload of tourists pass by and all shout out “ Hi Brian ! ” at the behest of a tour operator with a microphone , it is clear that Mr Haw’s
protest is now as much part of Parliament ’s landscape as Churchill or Cromwell ’s statue .
And it ’s clear he ’s not going anywhere fast .
“ I ’m not leaving because we have n’t finished the job , ” he says .
“ We are all responsible for what our Government does in our name .
When our country does good we can be proud of that , and when it does wrong we must hold the liars to account .
And we have to keep doing that . ”
It is calving season in the Arctic .
A flotilla of icebergs , some as jagged as fairytale castles and others as smooth as dinosaur eggs , calve from the ice sheet that smothers Greenland and sail down the fjords .
The journey of these sculptures of ice from glaciers to ocean is eerily beautiful and utterly terrifying .
The wall of ice that rises behind Sermilik fjord stretches for 1,500 miles ( 2,400 km ) from north to south and smothers 80 % of this country .
It has been frozen for 3 m years .
Now it is melting , far faster than the climate models predicted and far more decisively than any political action to combat our changing climate .
If the Greenland ice sheet disappeared sea levels around the world would rise by seven metres , as 10 % of the world 's fresh water is currently frozen here .
This is also the season for science in Greenland .
Glaciologists , seismologists and climatologists from around the world are landing on the ice sheet in helicopters , taking ice - breakers up its inaccessible coastline and measuring glaciers in a race against time to discover why the ice in Greenland is vanishing so much faster than expected .
Gordon Hamilton , a Scottish - born glaciologist from the University of Maine 's Climate Change Institute , is packing up equipment at his base camp in Tasiilaq , a tiny , remote east coast settlement only accessible by helicopter and where huskies howl all night .
With his spiky hair and ripped T - shirt , Hamilton could be a rugged glaciologist straight from central casting .
Four years ago he hit upon the daring idea of landing on a moving glacier in a helicopter to measure its speed .
The glaciers of Greenland are the fat , restless fingers of its vast ice sheet , constantly moving , stretching down into fjords and pushing ice from the sheet into the ocean , in the form of melt water and icebergs .
Before their first expedition , Hamilton and his colleague Leigh Stearns , from the University of Kansas , used satellite data to plan exactly where they would land on a glacier .
" When we arrived there was no glacier to be seen .
It was way up the fjord , " he says .
" We thought we 'd made some stupid goof with the co-ordinates , but we were where we were supposed to be . "
It was the glacier that was in the wrong place .
A vast expanse had melted away .
When Hamilton and Stearns processed their first measurements of the glacier 's speed , they thought they had made another mistake .
They found it was marching forwards at a greater pace than a glacier had ever been observed to flow before .
" We were blown away because we realised that the glaciers had accelerated not just by a little bit but by a lot , " he says .
The three glaciers they studied had abruptly increased the speed by which they were transmitting ice from the ice sheet into the ocean .
Raw power
Standing before a glacier in Greenland as it calves icebergs into the dark waters of a cavernous fjord is to witness the raw power of a natural process we have accelerated but will now struggle to control .
Greenland 's glaciers make those in the Alps look like toys .
Grubby white and blue crystal towers , cliffs and crevasses soar up from the water , dispatching millenniums of compacted snow in the shape of seals , water lilies and bishops ' mitres .
I take a small boat to see the calving with Dines Mikaelsen , an Inuit guide , who in the winter will cross the ice sheet in his five - metre sled pulled by 16 huskies .
It is not freezing but even in summer the wind is bitingly cold and we can smell the bad breath of a humpback whale as it groans past our bows on Sermilik Fjord .
Above its heavy breathing , all you can hear in this wilderness is the drip - drip of melting ice and a crash as icebergs cleave into even smaller lumps , called growlers .
Mikaelsen stops his boat beside Hann glacier and points out how it was twice as wide and stretched 300 metres further into the fjord just 10 years ago .
He also shows off a spectacular electric blue iceberg .
Locals have nicknamed it " blue diamond " ; its colour comes from being cleaved from centuries - old compressed ice at the ancient heart of the glacier .
Bobbing in warming waters , this ancient ice fossil will be gone in a couple of weeks .
The blue diamond is one vivid pointer to the antiquity of the Greenland ice sheet .
A relic of the last Ice Age , this is one of three great ice sheets in the world .
Up to two miles thick , the other two lie in Antarctica .
While similar melting effects are being measured in the southern hemisphere , the Greenland sheet may be uniquely vulnerable , lying much further from the chill of the pole than Antarctica 's sheets .
The southern end of the Greenland sheet is almost on the same latitude as the Shetlands and stroked by the warm waters of the Gulf Stream .
Driven by the loss of ice , Arctic temperatures are warming more quickly than other parts of the world : last autumn air temperatures in the Arctic stood at a record 5C above normal .
For centuries , the ice sheets maintained an equilibrium : glaciers calved off icebergs and sent melt water into the oceans every summer ; in winter , the ice sheet was then replenished with more frozen snow .
Scientists believe the world 's great ice sheets will not completely disappear for many more centuries , but the Greenland ice sheet is now shedding more ice than it is accumulating .
The melting has been recorded since 1979 ; scientists put the annual net loss of ice and water from the ice sheet at 300- 400 gigatonnes , which could hasten a sea level rise of catastrophic proportions .
As Hamilton has found , Greenland 's glaciers have increased the speed at which they shift ice from the sheet into the ocean .
Helheim , an enormous tower of ice that calves into Sermilik Fjord , used to move at 7 km ( 4.4 miles ) a year .
In 2005 , in less than a year , it speeded up to nearly 12 km a year .
Kangerdlugssuaq , another glacier that Hamilton measured , tripled its speed between 1988 and 2005 .
Its movement – an inch every minute – could be seen with the naked eye .
The three glaciers that Hamilton and Stearns measured account for about a fifth of the discharge from the entire Greenland ice sheet .
The implications of their acceleration are profound : " If they all start to speed up , you could have quite a large rise in sea level in the near term , much larger than the official estimate by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) would project , " says Hamilton .
The scientific labours in the chill winds and high seas of the Arctic summer seem wrapped in an unusual sense of urgency this year .
The scientists working in Greenland are keen to communicate their new , emerging understanding of the dynamics of the declining ice sheet to the wider world .
Several point out that any international agreement forged at the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen in December will be based on the IPCC 's fourth assessment report from 2007 .
Its estimates of climate change and sea - level rise were based on scientific research submitted up to 2005 ; the scientists say this is already significantly out of date .
The 2007 report predicted a sea level rise of 30 cm - 60 cm by 2100 , but did not account for the impact of glaciers breaking into the sea from areas such as the Greenland ice sheet .
Most scientists working at the poles predict a one metre rise by 2100 .
The US Geological Survey has predicted a 1.5 metre rise .
As Hamilton points out : " It is only the first metre that matters " .
Record temperatures
A one metre rise – with the risk of higher storm surges – would require new defences for New York , London , Mumbai and Shanghai , and imperil swaths of low - lying land from Bangladesh to Florida .
Vulnerable areas accommodate 10 % of the world 's population – 600 million .
The Greenland ice sheet is not merely being melted from above by warmer air temperatures .
As the oceans of the Arctic waters reach record high temperatures , the role of warmer water lapping against these great glaciers is one of several factors shaping the loss of the ice sheet that has been overlooked until recently .
Fiamma Straneo , an Italian - born oceanographer , is laboriously winding recording equipment the size of a fire extinguisher from the deck of a small Greenpeace icebreaker caught in huge swells at the mouth of Sermilik fjord .
In previous decades the Arctic Sunrise has been used in taking direct action against whalers ; now it offers itself as a floating research station for independent scientists to reach remote parts of the ice sheet .
It is tough work for the multinational crew of 30 in this rough - and - ready little boat , prettified below deck with posters of orang - utans and sunflowers painted in the toilets .
Before I succumb to vomiting below deck – another journalist is so seasick they are airlifted off the boat – I examine the navigational charts used by the captain , Pete Willcox , a survivor of the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985 .
He shows how they are dotted with measurements showing the depth of the ocean but here , close to the east coast of Greenland , the map is blank : this part of the North Atlantic was once covered by sea ice for so much of the year that its waters are still uncharted .
Earlier in the expedition , the crew believe , they became the first boat to travel through the Nares Strait west of Greenland to the Arctic Ocean in June , once impassable because of sea ice at that time of year .
The predicted year when summers in the Arctic would be free of sea ice has fallen from 2100 to 2050 to 2030 in a couple of years .
Jay Zwally , a Nasa scientist , recently suggested it could be virtually ice - free by late summer 2012 .
Between 2004 and 2008 the area of " multiyear " Arctic sea ice ( ice that has formed over more than one winter and survived the summer melt ) shrank by 595,000 sq miles , an area larger than France , Germany and the United Kingdom combined .
Undaunted by the sickening swell of the ocean and wrapped up against the chilly wind , Straneo , of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , one of the world 's leading oceanographic research centres , continues to take measurements from the waters as the long Arctic dusk falls .
According to Straneo , the rapid changes to the ice sheet have taken glaciologists by surprise .
" One of the possible mechanisms which we think may have triggered these changes is melting driven by changing ocean temperatures and currents at the margins of the ice sheet . "
She has been surprised by early results measuring sea water close to the melting glaciers : one probe recovered from last year recorded a relatively balmy 2C at 60 metres in the fjord in the middle of winter .
Straneo said : " This warm and salty water is of subtropical origin – it's carried by the Gulf Stream .
In recent years a lot more of this warm water has been found around the coastal region of Greenland .
We think this is one of the mechanisms that has caused these glaciers to accelerate and shed more ice . "
Straneo's research is looking at what scientists call the " dynamic effects " of the Greenland ice sheet .
It is not simply that the ice sheet is melting steadily as global temperatures rise .
Rather , the melting triggers dynamic new effects , which in turn accelerate the melt .
" It 's quite likely that these dynamic effects are more important in generating a near - term rapid rise in sea level than the traditional melt , " says Hamilton .
Another example of these dynamic effects is when the ice sheet melts to expose dirty layers of old snow laced with black carbon from forest fires and even cosmic dust .
These dark particles absorb more heat and so further speed up the melt .
After Straneo gathers her final measurements , the Arctic Sunrise heads for the tranquillity of the sole berth at Tasiilaq , which has a population of fewer than 3,000 but is still the largest settlement on Greenland 's vast east coast .
Here another scientist is gathering her final provisions before taking her team camping on a remote glacier .
Invisible earthquakes
Several years ago Meredith Nettles , a seismologist from Colombia University , and two colleagues made a remarkable discovery : they identified a new kind of earthquake .
These quakes were substantial – measuring magnitude five – but had been invisible because they did not show up on seismographs .
( While orthodox tremors registered for a couple of seconds , these occurred rather more slowly , over a minute . )
The new earthquakes were traced almost exclusively to Greenland , where they were found to be specifically associated with large , fast - flowing outlet glaciers .
There have been 200 of them in the last dozen years ; in 2005 there were six times as many as in 1993 .
Nettles nimbly explains the science as she heaves bags of equipment on to a helicopter , which will fly her to study Kangerdlugssuaq glacier .
" It 's quite a dramatic increase , and that increase happened at the same time as we were seeing dramatic retreats in the location of the calving fronts of the glaciers , and an increase in their flow speed , " she says .
" The earthquakes are very closely associated with large - scale ice loss events . "
In other words , the huge chunks of ice breaking off from the glaciers and entering the oceans are large enough to generate a seismic signal that is sent through the Earth .
They are happening more regularly and , when they occur , it appears that the glacier speeds up even more .
The scientists rightly wrap their latest observations in caution .
Their studies are still in their infancy .
Some of the effects they are observing may be short - term .
The Greenland ice sheet has survived natural warmer periods in history , the last about 120,000 years ago , although it was much smaller then than it is now .
Those still sceptical of the scientific consensus over climate change should perhaps listen to the voices of those who could not be accused of having anything to gain from talking up climate change .
Inuit warnings
Arne Sorensen , a specialist ice navigator on Arctic Sunrise , began sailing the Arctic in the 1970s .
Journeys around Greenland 's coast that would take three weeks in the 1970s because of sea ice now take a day .
He pays heed to the observations of the Inuit .
" If you talk to people who live close to nature and they tell you this is unusual and this is not something they have noticed before , then I really put emphasis on that , " he says .
Paakkanna Ignatiussen , 52 , has been hunting seals since he was 13 .
His grandparents travelled less than a mile to hunt ; he must go more than 60 miles because the sea ice disappears earlier – and with it the seals .
" It 's hard to see the ice go back .
In the old days when we got ice it was only ice .
Today it is more like slush , " he says .
" In 10 years there will be no traditional hunting .
The weather is the reason . "
The stench of rotting seal flesh wafts from a bag in the porch of his house in Tasiilaq as Ignatiussen 's wife , Ane , remarks that , " the seasons are upside down " .
Local people are acutely aware of how the weather is changing animal behaviour .
Browsing the guns for sale in the supermarket in Tasiilaq ( you do n't need a licence for a gun here ) , Axel Hansen says more hungry polar bears prowl around the town these days .
Like the hunters , the bears can't find seals when there is so little sea ice .
And the fjords are filled with so many icebergs that local people find it hard to hunt whales there .
Westerners may shrug at the decline of traditional hunting but , in a sense , we all live on the Greenland ice sheet now .
Its fate is our fate .
The scientists swarming over this ancient mass of ice , trying to understand how it will be transformed in a warming world , and how it will transform us , are wary of making political comments about how our leaders should plan for one metre of sea level rise , and what drastic steps must be taken to cut carbon emissions .
But some scientists are so astounded by the changes they are recording that they are moved to speak out .
What , I ask Hamilton , would he say to Barack Obama if he could spend 10 minutes with the US president standing on Helheim glacier ?
" Without knowing anything about what is going on , you just have to look at the glacier to know something huge is happening here , " says the glaciologist .
" We ca n't as a scientific community keep up with the pace of changes , let alone explain why they are happening .
" If I was , God forbid , the leader of the free world , I would implement some changes to deal with the maximum risk that we might reasonably expect to encounter , rather than always planning for the minimum .
We wo n't know the consequences of not doing that until it 's way too late .
Even as a politician on a four - year elected cycle , you can't morally leave someone with that problem . "

The words in brackets were removed from this sentence : " The melting has been recorded since 1979 ; scientists put the annual net loss of ice and water from the ice sheet at 300 - 400 gigatonnes ( equivalent to a billion elephants being dropped in the ocean ) , which could hasten a sea level rise of catastrophic proportions . "
It was not a good comparison : a gigatonne is 1 billion tonnes and elephants do not weigh 300 - 400 tonnes .
George Washington & Spiritual Tyranny
As we begin the final week of our month - long series on the Founding Fathers , Spirituality , and Religion , we turn our attention to George Washington , the commander of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War , and of course the first President of The United States .
A fierce advocate of personal liberties , General Washington worried over the tyranny of establishments and institutions in all matters , especially regarding politics and religion .
As such , Washington belonged to no political party and in fact wished that America would not form parties , not simply out of a fear of tyrrany but also because he felt a party system would encourage conflict and prevent governments from getting things done .
Looking at the current sad state of political affairs , we see that Washington ’s concerns were very prescient .
The following passage is from a letter dated May 10 , 1789 , written to the United Baptist Churches in Virginia .
Here we find Washington emphasizing that we worship by the dictates of our own consciences , not by the dictates of organized church bodies or religious establishments , which are more than capable of inflicting spiritual tyranny on their congregations .
Washington held the belief ( common among many of the Founding Fathers ) that the individual alone is responsible for his or her relationship to God .
If I could have entertained the slightest apprehension that the Constitution framed in the Convention , where I had the honor to preside , might possibly endanger the religious rights of any ecclesiastical society , certainly I would never have placed my signature to it ; and if I could now conceive that the general government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure , I beg you will be persuaded that no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny , and every species of religious persecution .
For you , doubtless , remember that I have often expressed my sentiment , that every person , conducting themselves as a good citizen , and being accountable to God alone for their religious opinions , ought to be protected in worshiping the Deity according to the dictates of their own conscience .
Duracell plans to launch a line of " Smart Power " products , including a multi- purpose charging platform , it announced this weekend .
The flagship product of the range is the myGrid pad , which can charge a range of devices from phones to mp3 players without wires .
By attaching what Duracell is calling a " power clip " to a device , users can place it onto the pad and it will begin to charge it wirelessly .
It will come with clips for BlackBerry , Nokia and Motorola phones as standard .
Rick June , vice president of Duracell in North America , said in a statement : " Our new personal power solutions allow consumers the freedom to live their lives without the limits of staying tethered to today 's power grid .
It is charging made simple . "
The gadget will start shipping in October .
Duracell has suggested a price of $ 79.99 ( 48.45 ) for the pad with extra power clips selling for $ 34.99 .
Other products in the " Smart Power " range will include chargers for car cup holders , a pocket sized USB charger and a " Daylite " LED torch .
During the presidential campaign , Barack Obama promised that once a bill was passed by Congress , the White House would post it online for five days before he signed it .
“ When there ’s a bill that ends up on my desk as president , you the public will have five days to look online and find out what ’s in it before I sign it , so that you know what your government ’s doing , ” Mr. Obama said as a candidate , telling voters he would make government more transparent and accountable .
When he took office in January , his team added that in posting nonemergency bills , it would “ allow the public to review and comment ” before Mr. Obama signed them .
Five months into his administration , Mr. Obama has signed two dozen bills , but he has almost never waited five days .
On the recent credit card legislation , which included a controversial measure to allow guns in national parks , he waited just two .
We have n't heard all that much from Toshiba on the Blu-ray front since it finally bit its tongue and went Blu at the beginning of this month , but it looks like its now starting to bring the rest of its products up to speed , like this newly - revised Qosmio X500 gaming laptop .
As with its predecessors , this is one big and burly laptop , with it boasting an 18.4 - inch , 1920 x 1080 screen , a 2.8GHz Core i7 processor , NVIDIA GeForce GTS 250MNV graphics , up to 8GB of RAM , dual 500GB hard drives , and not just a Blu-ray drive , but a Blu-ray burner as the standard optical drive .
No word on a price just , if you need to ask , but it looks like this one should be available in the UK in late October . [ Via SlashGear

Fünf Gründe für einen überraschenden Ausgang ( vierter und letzter Teil der Serie )
von André F. Lichtschlag
Die geplante Kampagne gegen die Piratenpartei ob ihres Gesprächs mit der konservativen Wochenzeitung „ Junge Freiheit “ wurde zum Rohrkrepierer .
Am Ende war nicht die Piratenpartei , sondern eine junge „ taz “ - Autorin blamiert .
Wie konnte das geschehen ?
Wie so oft werden Hintergründe im Vergleich deutlich .
Der CDU - Politiker Peter Krause wurde im April letzten Jahres mit einer ähnlichen Schmierenkampagne noch erfolgreich als Bildungsminister Thüringens verhindert , weil er früher einmal für die „ JF “ geschrieben hatte .
Auch bei ihm ging es nicht um Inhalte des dort Gesagten , da fand man nichts , sondern alleine um den Ort , an dem seine Artikel erschienen .
Dazu äußerte sich damals „ Focus “ - Journalist und Buchautor Michael Klonovsky treffend mit der Feststellung , die „ Junge Freiheit “ sei doch „ geradezu exzessiv verfassungstreu “ .
Klonovsky erklärte : „ Wenn wir schon keinen Gott mehr haben , dann muss es wenigstens den Teufel geben .
Und einer muss der Teufel sein .
Diese Gesellschaft wird von nahezu nichts mehr zusammengehalten , sie braucht einen kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner des zu Verabscheuenden , zu Bekämpfenden .
Dafür steht der Kampf gegen Rechts und letztlich die ‚ Junge Freiheit ’ .
Die tatsächlichen Rechtsextremen sind ja intellektuell viel zu unterbelichtet und auch nicht wirklich greifbar , aus einer Distanzierung von denen lässt sich sowenig Kapital schlagen wie aus der Verspottung Paris Hiltons . “
Deshalb , so Klonovsky , bestehe das „ Pech “ der „ Jungen Freiheit “ nun „ darin , dass sie die Rolle des Teufels spielen “ müsse .
Eigentlich also ein höllischer Selbstläufer , sollte man meinen .
Und doch kam diesmal alles ganz anders .
Der erste Fehler trägt den Namen der Urheberin der Kampagne .
Nicht nur dass Julia Seeliger spätestens in ihren unbeholfenen Block - Kommentaren auch dem Gutgläubigsten zeigte , wes Geistes Kind sie ist .
Sie ist auch noch pausierende Politikerin der Grünen .
Das reichte den politisch unerfahrenen bis naiven Anhängern der Piratenpartei , sie der parteipolitischen Manipulation zu überführen .
Dass Journalisten – auch und gerade der „ taz “ – nicht Mitglied einer Partei sein müssen , um dennoch für gewöhnlich genauso parteiisch schreiben zu können , diese Tatsache konnte selbst Schreibtalent Julia Seeliger nicht zur Verteidigung heranführen , ohne rot zu werden .
Der zweite Fehler betrifft das Ziel der Kampagne .
Anders als in bisherigen Feldzügen stellte das unerfahrene Fräulein Seeliger nicht nur einen vermeintlich bösen Buben an den Pranger , sondern gleich eine ganze Partei .
Das konnte nicht gut gehen , vor allem nicht bei einer politisch so jungen und euphorischen Bewegung wie den Piraten , deren Fußvolk zumindest nun den Versuch starten musste , sich zu wehren .
Der dritte Fehler betrifft die Koordination .
Spiegel - Online beteiligte sich schnell wie gewohnt an der Hatz – doch dann riss die Kette .
Besonders wichtig sind bei vergleichbaren Kampagnen immer zwei Mitstreiter , öffentlich - rechtlichen Staatsfunker sowie die „ Bild “ - Zeitung .
Zumindest bei der ansonsten vor Rufmord nur ungern zurückschreckenden „ Bild “ - Zeitung gab womöglich taktisches Kalkül den Ausschlag , diesmal in Stille zu verharren .
Im Hause des „ Springer “ - Verlages hofft man nämlich auf eine schwarz - gelbe Koalition nach der Wahl .
Die Piratenpartei aber könnte , sofern sie am Ende knapp unter fünf Prozent landet , Rot -Rot - Grün die entscheidenden Stimmen kosten .
Vor Jahren hatten die Zeitungen des Springer - Verlages in Hamburg aus ähnlich niederen politischen Motiven zunächst die Schill - Partei mit aufgebaut und den „ Richter Gnadenlos “ ( eine „ Bild “ - Erfindung ) auf Titelseiten im Wahlkampf massiv unterstützt , um diesen danach nicht weniger gnadenlos wieder abzuschießen , als es auch ohne Schill für eine CDU - Regierung reichte .
Der vierte Fehler ist vielleicht der gewichtigste und zugleich zufälligste .
Anders als der jämmerliche Krause suchten die Angegriffenen am Ende doch die offensive Vorwärtsverteidigung .
Zunächst war noch alles nach Plan gelaufen : Auch der stellvertretende Vorsitzende der Piraten , Andreas Popp , flennte herum und bat demütigst „ um Entschuldigung “ , nachdem Seeliger ihm vorwarf , mit einer von ihr nicht gelesenen Zeitung gesprochen zu haben .
Auch der erste Piratenkapitän Jens Seipenbusch distanzierte sich erwartungsgemäß von Popps Gespräch , so wie es bei den lieben Parteifreunden auch andernorts üblich ist .
Doch dann kam heraus , dass auch Seipenbusch selbst der „ JF “ ein Interview gegeben hatte , was dieser offenbar vergessen hatte .
Und Seeliger plauderte am selben
Tag noch einmal mehr als eine Stunde lang mit ihrem nach wie vor offenbar völlig gutgläubigen Kampagnenopfer Popp .
Aus dem „ netten Gespräch “ machte Charakterkanone Seeliger am nächsten Tag einen zweiten vernichtenden Artikel über Popp , in dem sie diesen nun nach seiner hündischen Entschuldigung auch noch als dummen Jungen zeichnete .
Das war zuviel des Guten für die Herren Popp und Seipenbusch .
Nun setzte sich die bereits erfolgreich gespaltene Internetparteiführung doch noch einmal virtuell zusammen .
Irgendjemand muss ihnen verraten haben , dass eine solche Kampagne nur überlebt , wer nicht jammert , sondern zurückschießt und im Übrigen zu dem steht , was er tut .
Seipenbusch hielt der „ taz “ - Kampagne nun plötzlich das alte Lied des linken Barden Franz Josef Degenhardt entgegen : „ Mit Schmuddelkindern spricht man nicht “ .
Er warf seinerseits nun den Ex -Spontis indirekt Spießigkeit und Verrat an eigenen alten Idealen vor .
Sein Pressesprecher ging noch weiter .
Er hatte verstanden : „ Wer zurückrudert , kann nur verlieren . “
All das lässt auch den fünften und letzten Fehler deutlich werden :
Am Ende hielten die Parteifreunde unter der orangenfarbenen Fahne zusammen und die Denunziation musste erstmals mangels Heckenschützen aus den eigenen Reihen abgesagt werden .

A recent call for a unified web app UI theme reminded me that there are two awesome web UI themes you can use right now .
Both of the leading thick - client web frameworks recently released new themes that :
Look great
Are licensed as Creative Commons Attribution Share - Alike
Come part of a slick framework or as separate assets
Start with the letter A
Are blue
They ’re more similar than they are different , so which do you choose ?
Ace
Framework : SproutCore
Designer : Cocoia
GitHub : Available as sprited images
New for : SproutCore 1.0
Lickable and saturated , SproutCore ’s theme is clearly inspired by OS X’s Aqua .
Although their “ selected ” controls are very bright , their normal look is appropriately plain .
You can play with the controls using SproutCore ’s sample controls demo .
Aristo
Framework : Cappuccino
Designer : Sofa
GitHub : Available as PSD or a 3rd party CSS3 implementation
New for : Cappuccino 0.7
Cappuccino ’s theme is more focused at looking great on Windows as well as OS X , which is clearly a win for web applications .
Its more slate - like look will fit in better with “ serious ” apps , but does n’t have the pop that SproutCore ’s controls do .
They ’re available as a PSD file for download .
Update :
There is indeed an Aristo sample controls page .
What now ?
Build a great web app !
Consistent UI widgets have been a usability guideline for decades , but limited , ugly , or inconsistent widgets drove web designers to produce a new theme for every app .
Next time you start one , whether you ’re using the frameworks or stealing their themes , there ’s no excuse for having a weak UI theme .
So often , we hear government critics decry “ pork ” projects and “ pork ” spending .
These phrases are figurative , indicating wasteful use of public funds .
But never have these phrases had such a literal meaning , as our government actually bails out the pork industry when it overproduces and buys up volumes of surplus pork , typically by dumping these surplus commodities into our nation ’s schools , child care centers , and domestic food assistance programs .
A recent news article by the Iowa Pork Producers Association reports that the USDA has bought roughly 72 million pounds of pork valued at $ 117 million through commodity programs , and that more will be purchased when the government ’s new fiscal year begins on Oct.
1 . These commodity programs are only one of several avenues for providing USDA subsidies to the pork industry — with government giveaways to the industry transcending political party and occurring in every recent Administration .
Photo credit Farm Sanctuary
These routine handouts are not enough for the pork industry , though .
They now want an additional massive infusion of funds , at a time when our nation ’s debt is larger than ever — and they claim the bailout is needed because pork sales dropped when the media used the phrase " swine flu . "
The National Pork Producers Council wrote to USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack , asking for $ 250 million , and governors from nine large pork - producing states ( Colorado , Illinois , Iowa , Kentucky , Michigan , Nebraska , North Carolina , Oklahoma , and Wisconsin ) chimed in and requested a similar government bailout .
These amounts are staggering , particularly when you consider that these casual giveaways of hundreds of millions of dollars dwarf the entire USDA spending on animal welfare programs in the United States .
For enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act , which is supposed to ensure basic protections for millions of animals in laboratories , breeding facilities , zoos , circuses , and other facilities , the federal government invested just $ 21.5 million last year .
To enforce the Horse Protection Act , enacted to halt the widespread and abusive practice of “ soring ” — where intense pain is deliberately inflicted on show horses ’ legs and hooves to make them step higher in the Tennessee Walking Horse industry — the federal government invests a measly $ 500,000 .
And here ’s what the taxpayers get for their generosity to Big Pork — appalling mistreatment of animals , extreme confinement of breeding sows in crates where they can barely move , reckless overcrowding and non-therapeutic antibiotic dosing of pigs which threatens public health , and dangerous mismanagement of massive volumes of pig waste that pollute groundwater and putrefy the air in rural communities throughout the nation , killing aquatic life , dropping property values , and making life miserable for neighbors .
Does this sound like an industry that should get millions of your tax dollars ?
The federal government required changes in the banking industry and the auto industry when it gave those industries bailout funds .
If our government continues to give money to the pork industry — and we hope they get zero dollars in response to this latest request — the release of future taxpayer funds should be conditioned on the implementation of a written plan to move the industry away from its most reckless practices , as the government has done with other industries .
At hog factory farms , breeding sows suffer from intensive confinement in gestation crates .
Pigs raised for meat undergo painful mutilations — including castration and tail docking — without anesthesia .
These animals spend the majority of their lives in crowded , stressful , and unsanitary sheds , where they are routinely fed low doses of antibiotics to keep them from getting sick , a reckless practice that hastens the development of antibiotic - resistant bacteria .
During transport to slaughter , pigs may suffer from hunger , thirst , weather extremes , injury , and disease .
And “ downer ” pigs — animals too sick , injured or fatigued to stand up — may also be abused or dragged to slaughter .
The governors , in making their pitch for more money for the pork industry , argued that the money is needed , in part , because of the negative impact of the H1N1 swine flu virus on pork sales .
But this industry is not merely an innocent victim of forces of nature — the crowded , stressful , and unsanitary conditions at confined animal feeding operations ( CAFOs ) and in transport apparently led to the emergence of the ancestors of the current H1N1 swine flu threat ( please see humanesociety.org / swineflu ) , and these conditions contribute to continued risks of zoonotic disease emergence and spread .
It ’s time for the USDA to reward farmers who are producing healthful foods , including fruits and vegetables , in a more humane and environmentally sustainable manner .
And in an era of fiscal responsibility , the unchecked handouts to Big Agribusiness need to end .

Being exposed to stressful combat situations is a factor Half a million soldiers are being asked to take part in the biggest ever investigation into the number of suicides in the US armed forces .
Last year , 143 soldiers killed themselves and there were 113 suicides in the other armed services - the highest number since records began 30 years ago .
Already this year there have been more than 100 reported suicides among soldiers on active duty .
During the study , set to take three years , new recruits will be asked for personal information that will be used for psychological assessments .
Researchers will also interview serving soldiers .
Some will be asked to provide saliva and blood samples to try to establish whether there is a genetic reason why some people are more likely than others to take their own lives .
Rate doubled " The army sees the suicide rate as the canary in the coalmine .
It 's telling them that the force itself is strained , " says Robert Heinssen , director of the $ 50 m ( £ 30 m ) study , which is being conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health .
" Over the last several years , the rate of suicide in the army has doubled .
Before 2001 it was about half of what it is in the civilian population for the same demographic .
Now it 's caught up .
" So these are individuals that start out as being very resilient and it's in the face of these tremendous stressors - the war , the training cycles , the separation from family - that we 're seeing wear and tear on the force in general . "
There is still a tremendous stigma around seeking help
Steve Robinson
National Gulf War Resource Center
But he says being exposed to high stress and combat situations is just one of many complex factors that can lead to suicide .
The way people solve problems and how they deal with stress also play a part , and there could be genetic and neurobiological links .
Unlike most studies of its type , doctors will not wait for its completion to publish their conclusions .
They will report results as they emerge so that the army can make immediate use of the information .
The first findings are due in November .
But veterans ' advocacy groups and families of suicide victims say extra research is not necessary to prevent more deaths .
They say the suicides are due to a military culture that deters vulnerable soldiers from seeking help for mental health issues .
" This is a real issue - not something that happens once in while .
But until the culture is changed and the stigma is taken away , all the reports and questions wo n't make any difference , " says Charles McKinney , whose son Jeff shot himself while on patrol in Iraq .
First Sergeant Jeff McKinney had served in the army for more than 19 years and had no history of mental health disorders .
Then , in the space of one week in June 2007 , a series of roadside bombings killed and maimed several members of his brigade .
One bomb exploded just in front of his vehicle which , his father believes , caused an injury to his brain .
Felt responsible " As well as him suffering post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) his brain had been physically affected by this , " says Mr McKinney , a resident of Bedford , Texas .
" All the signs were there .
Everybody saw them but I do n't know whether they recognised what to do about them . "
Sgt McKinney served in the US Army for 19 years .
Sgt McKinney stopped eating and did not sleep for days on end .
His comrades say he felt personally responsible for every death and believed he was failing his company , but he declined to see an army physician .
The day before he died , his commanding officer ordered him to sleep and later said he would have stopped him going on patrol but was afraid that the soldiers would have lost confidence in Sgt McKinney 's leadership .
" When his company commander said he should n't have gone , he should have forced him not to , " says Mr McKinney .
" He said Jeff would have lost the respect of his men and his career would have been ruined .
I would rather have ruined his career than lost my son . "
Mr McKinney is himself a Vietnam War veteran and says soldiers then were expected to suppress their feelings .
Many returned to civilian life without being treated for PTSD and developed behavioural symptoms that included drug and alcohol abuse , domestic violence , homelessness - and suicide .
" It 's happening now to soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan .
We did n't learn the lessons of Vietnam , " says Mr McKinney .
Early intervention Former Army Ranger Steve Robinson agrees .
He works for the Swords to Plowshares Iraq Veteran Project and has testified to Congress on mental health issues and suicide in the military .
Soldiers who commit suicide did n't die in combat but they died fighting their own war
Charles McKinney
" There is still a tremendous stigma around seeking help , " he says .
" Because there is no education and training in the military to teach people how the brain and body react in war , leaders are left without knowledge of what to do . "
He says mental health training should become as integrated as weapons training , and that commanders should be taught to recognise problems and to intervene early .
The army says it has implemented a number of improvements to the force 's suicide prevention programmes in recent weeks .
There have been changes to the army 's health promotion policy and extra staff have been employed to improve access to counselling services for soldiers and their families .
" It 's not that the army lacks programmes to confront the problem of suicide , " says Brig Gen Colleen McGuire , director of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force .
" The long - term challenge is determining which programmes are most effective for our soldiers and ensuring that army leaders , from junior non-commissioned officers to the most senior leaders , know how to help their soldiers take advantage of these programmes . "
Recently Mr McKinney flew to Germany where his son's wife and children live .
There he visited Jeff McKinney 's grave and says he managed to find peace .
" Soldiers who commit suicide did n't die in combat but they died fighting their own war , " he says .
" I 'm proud of my son .
He was our hero . "

This blog post is the most recent Martenson Report , which I am now making available for wider distribution .
I believe this needs to be read and understood by as many people as possible .

Executive Summary
With the most recent bank failures , the FDIC is out of funds .
The FDIC is levying a one - time fee on member banks to cover the shortfall , but it will not be enough and it punishes the prudent .
The FDIC has been suspiciously slow at shutting down banks that have admittedly already failed .
Banks have been allowed to overestimate the actual worth of their assets using “ mark - to - fantasy ” accounting .
Hundreds of banks are likely already mortally wounded and set to fail .
The FDIC means well , but creates a moral hazard the effects of which now haunt us .
Take prudent action : Choose only high - rated banks , and keep cash out of the bank .
Five more banks failed this week , resulting in a long weekend for the FDIC ( see below ) .
The largest of these , by far , was Colonial Bank , which will cost the FDIC some $ 2.8 billion .
And that ’s assuming that their loss estimates pan out as expected and that the $ 15 billion in shaky assets on which the FDIC will share future losses do not turn into larger - than - expected losses .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) — Colonial BancGroup Inc. became the largest bank failure this year after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized the struggling Alabama - based lender Friday and sold it to BB&T Corp .
The Colonial BancGroup deal will knock roughly $ 2.8 billion off a pool of money , known as the Deposit Insurance Fund , which the FDIC maintains to guarantee bank customer deposits .
The FDIC and BB&T will share losses on $ 15 billion of Colonial ’s assets .
Loss - sharing deals have become common since the financial crisis struck last year , as the FDIC tries to encourage more stable banks to take over failing institutions .
( Source )
Here is the list of failed banks for the weekend of August 15 / 16 , 2009 :
( Source )
Let ’s add up the estimated costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) , which is the FDIC pool of money toward which banks pay a premium and out of which all bank failure costs are covered .
Union Bank :
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 61 million .
( Source ) Community Bank of AZ : The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 25.5 million .
( Source )
Community Bank of NV :
The cost to the FDIC ’s Deposit Insurance Fund is estimated to be $ 781.5 million .
( Source ) Colonial Bank :
The FDIC estimates that the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) will be $ 2.8 billion .
( Source )
All together , that adds up to $ 3.67 billion dollars in new costs to the Deposit Insurance Fund .
The problem is that this turns out to be $ 3 billion more than currently exists in the Deposit Insurance Fund :
( Source )
The incredible shrinking balance of the DIF is best viewed on a chart comparing it to total insured deposits :
( Source )
With this latest series of bank closings , the DIF ratio is now solidly in negative territory .
Interestingly , we might also note that insured deposits have declined for the first time since at least 1999 , which is as far back as I have found data .
I suspect this deposit decline reflects the fact that people who are out of work are drawing down their savings , but I lack the data to confirm it at this time .
Regardless of the cause , declining deposits are a significant threat to the banking system , which is only ever stable and happy when it is continuously growing .
Okay , so the FDIC is out of money .
Now what ?
Punishing the Prudent
In March 2009 , Sheila Bair , head of the FDIC , announced that the FDIC intended to levy a one - time fee on member banks to cover the looming shortfall .
Small and regional banks protested vigorously , noting that they were effectively being punished for remaining sound while Wall Street and a few notorious banks played with fire .
They have an excellent point .
Note the strong language used by ICBA president Camden Fine :
The group — made up of mostly small town , rural banks that never traded in exotic mortgage - backed securities — is outraged [ by the proposed levy ] .
[ Independent Community Bankers of America ] ICBA President Camden R. Fine compares the FDIC to Japan ’s attack on Pearl Harbor .
He calls the special assessment on the nation ’s 8,000 community banks “ crippling , ” and blamed “ greed , incompetence and sins of the Wall Street firms that so crippled this nation ’s economy . ”
“ We have now come to the point where the ‘ systemically unimportant ’ banks of Main Street must , along with the nation ’s taxpayers , bail out the ‘ systemically important ’
Wall Street firms , ” Fine said .
“ Not only are a handful of Wall Street CEOs holding a gun to the taxpayers ’ heads , they have the banks of Main Street America looking down the barrel as well . ”
Fine said it is ironic that on the day the special assessment was announced , struggling CitiGroup received another government bailout .
He says community banks are strong and are doing the economic work the bigger banks should be doing .
“ During the fourth quarter of 2008 , community banks had the largest percentage increase in lending across the industry , ” Fine said .
“ For every dollar paid in premium assessments , a community banks ’ ability to make loans and support economic recovery will be reduced at least eightfold . ” ( source )
His point , besides being asked to shoulder the burden for irresponsible banks ( which is galling enough in itself ) , is that every dollar sucked out of a small bank represents eight dollars of loans that can not be made into local communities .
It bears noting that recoveries are mostly made due to small business expansion and hiring , yet the effective result of the FDIC levy will be to siphon recovery fuel from small communities and transfer it to the big players .
This is not a small point .
It is a big deal .
After listening carefully to these concerns , the FDIC voted on May 22 , 2009 to go forward with the special levy :
The Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation today voted to levy a special assessment on insured institutions as part of the agency ’s efforts to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) and help maintain public confidence in the banking system .
The final rule establishes a special assessment of five basis points on each FDIC - insured depository institution ’s assets , minus its Tier 1 capital , as of June 30 , 2009 .
The special assessment will be collected September 30 , 2009 . ( source )
This is where the real test of the FDIC begins .
Long an underused form of bank insurance , it is now being severely tested .
You might note in the quote above that the levy will not be collected until September 30 , which is 45 days away .
Yet the FDIC is already out of money .
Ah .
Now we have a reasonable explanation for why the FDIC has been dragging its feet and not shutting down the numerous banks that are already bankrupt , yet still operating .
It ca n’t afford to .
Dead Banks Walking
It has seemed quite the puzzle to many financial observers that some effectively - bankrupt banks have been allowed by the FDIC to continue operating .
For example , there ’s the second - largest bank in Texas , Guaranty Bank , which practically begged to be taken over by the FDIC earlier this year .
When that failed , they submitted a filing with the SEC on July 23rd 2009 , which read :
Based on these adjustments , the Bank ’s core capital ratio stood at negative 5.78 % as of March 31 , 2009 .
The Bank ’s total risk based capital ratio as of March 31 , 2009 stood at negative 5.52 % .
Both of these ratios result in the Bank being considered critically under - capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action standards .
In light of these developments , the Company believes that it is probable that it will not be able to continue as a going concern .
( source )
That ’s about as clear as things can be , except for the case where the filing uses the phrase “ critically under - capitalized , ” when the more common , and accurate , term is “ bankrupt . ”
Also , when a bank notes in its filing with the SEC that it probably will “ not be able to continue as a going concern , ” you can be all but certain that it is truly and utterly bankrupt .
A similar story can be told for Corus Bank , which announced on June 30 , 2009 that it , too , was “ critically undercapitalized ” and that things are growing worse because two - thirds of their loans are non-performing .
In their filing , the Corus officers even went so far as to remind the FDIC of its regulatory obligations :
[ T ]he Bank reported negative equity capital as of June 30 , 2009 .
As such , the Bank expects to be notified by the OCC that it is “ critically undercapitalized ” within the meaning of PCA capital requirements .
Under the FDI Act , depository institutions that are “ critically undercapitalized ” must be placed into conservatorship or receivership within 90 days of becoming critically undercapitalized , unless the institution ’s primary Federal regulatory authority ( here , the OCC ) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “ FDIC ” ) determine and document that “ other action ” would better achieve the purposes of PCA .
If such a depository institution remains critically undercapitalized during the last quarter ending one year after the institution became critically undercapitalized , the appropriate Federal banking agency must appoint a receiver for that institution unless it and the FDIC affirmatively can determine that , among other things , the institution has positive net worth and the agencies can certify that the depository institution is viable and not expected to fail .
( Source )
Luckily for the FDIC ’s dwindling DIF account , the law gives them 90 days after the filing to act , during which time they will still remain in compliance .
Since Corus filed on June 30 , that gives the FDIC until September 30 .
But that ’s adhering to the letter of the law .
In times past , the FDIC moved promptly to shut down insolvent banks , because waiting only makes the problem grow larger .
So why has the FDIC been dragging its feet here ?
The answer , quite probably , is because the FDIC does not have the funds it needs to shut down these banks , and so it is buying whatever time it can .
The Pressure Mounts
The two examples of failed - but - operating banks , above , are merely the tip of the iceberg .
According to a Bloomberg article , even with the relaxed mark - to - fantasy asset rules in place for banks , there are hundreds of banks flashing bright red warning signs :
Toxic Loans Topping 5 % May Push 150 Banks to Point of No Return Aug. 14 ( Bloomberg ) —
More than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders own nonperforming loans that equal 5 percent or more of their holdings , a level that former regulators say can wipe out a bank ’s equity and threaten its survival .
The number of banks exceeding the threshold more than doubled in the year through June , according to data compiled by Bloomberg , as real estate and credit - card defaults surged .
Almost 300 reported 3 percent or more of their loans were nonperforming , a term for commercial and consumer debt that has stopped collecting interest or will no longer be paid in full .
The biggest banks with nonperforming loans of at least 5 percent include Wisconsin ’s Marshall & Ilsley Corp. and Georgia ’s Synovus Financial Corp. , according to Bloomberg data .
Among those exceeding 10 percent , the biggest in the 50 U.S. states was Michigan ’s Flagstar Bancorp .
All said in second - quarter filings they ’re “ well - capitalized ” by regulatory standards , which means they ’re considered financially sound .
Imagine how many more would appear mortally wounded if realistic mark - to - market asset valuations were used ?
One shudders to think of it .
Making Matters Worse
An additional pressure on the DIF stems from the fact that losses from prior FDIC enforcements have been dramatically higher than initial estimates .
With each new FDIC report , we see less money in the DIF kitty than expected .
This next article does a great job of articulating that this is because bank assets are worth a lot less than originally thought :
On January 1 2009 the FDIC reported it had $ 17,276 million in the DIF and according to press releases for each failed bank , the estimated total costs for FDIC ’s DIF during Q1 amounted to $ 2,146 million , leaving $ 14,997 million in the fund .
However , according to the latest FDIC Quarterly report the fund counted $ 13,007 million at the start of Q2 , – a difference of $ 1,990 million .
In other words , the estimated spending on failed banks during Q1 was $ 2,147 million , but the bill ended up around $ 4,137 million instead ( and probably still counting ) .
This is why Q2 is even more interesting , since the estimated costs are $ 11,504 million , thus leaving only $ 833 million in the fund for supporting failing banks in the future .
Moreover , the real total cost for the first quarter in 2009 was almost twice the estimates .
If Q2 is even close to this figure , the FDIC ’s DIF will ( very ) soon be out of funds .
However , we have detected that DIF costs / bank assets have steadily increased under the period of discussion .
We believe the main reason for this lies in a de facto relaxation of accounting standards , even before the FASB 157 amendment on March 15 earlier this year .
Basically the relaxation allows banks to write - off the parts of their losses caused by the slowdown in the market – but it does this by allowing them to decide what a fair price in a ‘ normal ’ market would be .
Allowing banks to control how they mark - to - market their assets , will likely backfire and when they ultimately end up failing , imply greater closure costs for the FDIC .
From the graph above one can infer that the average yearly DIF costs / bank assets have increased at an alarming rate to almost reach 31 % in 2008 and 2009 .
( Source )
To review , banks have been granted a waiver by the government to essentially overstate the value of their assets , a convenience that wags refer to as “ mark - to - fantasy ” accounting .
When the FDIC swoops in on a Friday afternoon and takes over a failed bank , they have to start with the bank ’s own estimates of asset values when assessing the possible losses .
To put it bluntly , these are pie - in - the - sky estimates that will only ever disappoint .
Looking carefully at the numbers above , we see that the FDIC estimated $ 2,147 million in losses , but spent $ 4,137 million , resulting in losses that were 92 % higher than expected ( and counting ) .
I do n’t know about you , but I happen to think that a 92 % variance is a lot .
None of this is the least surprising to those who have been paying attention .
It is another shell game , being conducted for the benefit of a very few at everyone ’s expense .
It works like this :
Allow banks to effectively lie about the value of their assets .
Let them operate until it is beyond obvious that they need to be shut down .
Act surprised when their losses are a lot higher than “ expected . ”
Nobody who is paying attention is fooled in the slightest , but unfortunately , very few seem to be paying attention .
Moral Hazard
This is just one more example of where giving banks extra maneuvering room , by allowing them to overestimate the actual worth of their assets , has only made matters worse .
The alternative ?
Let the bondholders and shareholders of failed banks get completely wiped out .
Let a large number of failed banks go out of business .
It is a complete fabrication to suggest that we need anything more than a fraction of the existing banks and financial institutions .
Certainly quite a few could go under , and we ’d be none the worse for the wear .
Then , if there ’s any additional exposure left in the remaining banks , have the problem assets be nationalized so that a healthy core remains .
At the most basic level , the FDIC itself is a very bad idea .
While protecting depositors is a good thing , the FDIC also encourages bad banks to engage in risky behaviors , because there ’s no detectible reason for depositors to prefer one bank over the other .
All pay essentially the same rate of interest , and all the monies are FDIC - insured .
Bad banks that take on a lot of risk make huge profits compared to their more sedate competitors .
Before you know it , perilously risky lending is the new normal .
And then the bad times hit , the bad banks are bailed out , and their safer competitors are left paying for their mistakes .
And here we are , reaping the ‘ rewards ’ of this well - intentioned – but ultimately destructive – government program .
Lest you think that this moral hazard is some sort of passive by - product about which I am merely speculating , I offer you this account from March of 2009 :
FDIC Criticizes Massachusetts Bank With No Bad Loans for Being Too Cautious
A Massachusetts bank that has defied the odds and remained free of bad loans amid the economic crisis is now being criticized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for the cautious business practices that caused its rare success .
The secret behind East Bridgewater Savings Bank ’s accomplishments is the careful approach of 62 - year - old chief executive Joseph Petrucelli .
“ We ’re paranoid about credit quality , ” he told the Boston Business Journal .
That paranoia has allowed East Bridgewater Savings Bank to stand out among a flurry a failing banks , with no delinquent loans or foreclosures on its books , the Journal reported .
East Bridgewater
Savings did n’t even need to set aside in money in 2008 for anticipated loan losses .
But rather than reward Petrucelli ’s tactics , the FDIC recently criticized his bank for not lending enough , slapping it with a “ needs to improve ” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act , the Journal reported .
Can you imagine ?
Even as the credit crisis is savaging the land , the FDIC , lacking more urgent matters we guess , was busy slapping “ needs to improve ” ratings on the safest and soundest bank in the land .
We wonder if Citibank got a “ needs to improve ” rating ?
But we doubt it – and that ’s the problem .
As an aside , we wonder if Sheila Bair , the current FDIC chairwoman , is n’t already grasping for a rope tied to the wharf :
Friday August 14 , 2009 , 6:54 pm EDT FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said Congress would not go along with expanding the Federal Reserve ’s authority to regulate large financial companies or with giving a new consumer protection agency enforcement powers over banks .
Power to enforce rules for banks now belongs to Bair ’s agency and other bank regulators .
“ There ’s a lot of resistance from a lot of different quarters to a lot of the things the administration has submitted , ” Bair told the AP on Thursday .
“ That is a reality the administration needs to deal with . ” ( Source )
Given what we ’ve reviewed here , that would be our preferred strategy too – find a side issue to create cover for the departure .
Our appreciation for Ms. Bair ’s skills just bumped up a couple of notches .
What this means
To begin with , one thing we can be completely certain about is that the FDIC is going to need a lot more money , and soon .
While there is a bolus coming in on September 30th from the special FDIC levy , I doubt that it will last more than 2 - 3 months , given the accelerating rate of failures and the number of banks that have already failed but are still operating .
I assume that the Treasury or the Fed will need to step in by year ’s end to provide additional funding .
Hopefully the US Treasury can continue to find adequate market demand for its ever - growing debt sales .
If not ?
Then the FDIC will be one of many demands upon an insufficient pool of funding .
And who knows how that will play out ?
I also fear that this drama is just getting started .
Like an asset bubble , a banking crisis has a trajectory and pace all its own .
In the chart below from Calculated Risk , we can see that the S&L crisis that began in 1980 / 81 took eight years to peak and another four to subside .
While it ’s possible that this banking crisis will be shallower and shorter than the S&L crisis , I consider it very unlikely .
Assuming that this crisis began in 2007/08 and that it , too , will take eight years to peak , we might expect the FDIC to find itself increasingly busy through 2019 , with a peak in 2015 .
Too bad the FDIC is completely out of money already , even as this crisis is just beginning .
So how do I protect myself ?
My immediate concern , should the FDIC find itself short of cash , is that it will simply turn from dragging its feet on closing banks to dragging its feet on paying out depositor claims .
This means that if you have money in a failed bank , it could be tied up for quite some time .
Here ’s the advice I gave last year when I wrote about the FDIC :
Do not keep more than $ 100 k in any one bank account ( okay , no genius insight there … )
Always keep 1 - 2 months worth of basic living expenses , in cash , out of the bank but in a safe place .
This way , if the banks close down , the ATMs are n’t working , and checks wo n’t clear , you ’ll still be able to go on with things as the crisis gets resolved .
And do n’t worry ; you wo n’t be losing much in the way of interest payments on that cash .
Be prepared to run , not walk , down to the bank to remove your funds if the bank looks like it ’s going down .
Being one step ahead of the legal machinery could save you a lot of anxiety , if not your money .
Here I would keep a sharp eye on the bank ’s stock price , because that will give you the earliest possible warning .
The FDIC is notorious ( and for good reason ) for keeping mum about a troubled bank prior to seizing the assets .
All banks are NOT created equal .
Only keep your money in a Blue Ribbon bank ( as rated by Veribanc in their Blue Ribbon Report ) or in one that is rated “ B + ” or higher by TheStreet.com .
If need be , separate your holdings across several banks to assure your risk is not overly concentrated .
Also , just ask around – some banks play a riskier game than their local brethren , and knowing who ’s who could be a real life saver .
Another great place to check on your bank is to see if it appears on this unofficial list of troubled banks maintained at Calculated Risk .
If my banks were on that list ( I use several , all highly rated , to spread the risk ) , I would switch to a different ( highly rated , naturally ) bank .
You might also want to read my prior report on the FDIC , because it covers the legal language from the FDI Act , which unequivocally states that depositors may only be paid from money that exists within the insurance fund ( which is now depleted ) .
Conclusion
The FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) , carefully built up over decades , has been completely depleted in the first two years of this crisis .
While there ’s a special levy on the way on September 30th that will help the FDIC continue to operate for a while longer , those funds will prove insufficient to last the year .
Funds will have to be found outside of the usual and customary system of assessing a premium on bank assets .
Adding to the FDIC money woes are the already - bankrupt but not - yet - seized banks that are waiting in the wings , the mark - to - fantasy accounting gimmick used by banks to understate the true extent of losses by nearly 100 % , and past losses from already - seized banks running out to be much worse than anticipated .
This banking crisis has a long way to go .
And if history is any guide , it may not peak for another 5 - 6 years .
The FDI Act provides for no additional source of funding to repay depositors other than funds located in the depleted DIF .
The FDIC will need to have that fund restocked by the Treasury or some other source later this year .
Smaller banks are already quite miffed about having been asked to pay higher premiums to pay for the all - too - predictable mistakes of their larger brethren .
Because of the potential funding problems for the FDIC , I continue to advise that it is prudent to keep some money out of the banking system entirely , avoid troubled banks , and be ready to rapidly withdraw funds from any bank that appears troubled .
Stay calm , be ready , there ’s more to come .
This is something to keep an eye on ; buried at the end of this Reuter ’s article shows the possible plan — a joint Lexus / Mercedes - Benz auto ?
Toyota ( 7203.T ) is considering building derivatives of Mercedes - Benz ’s ( DAIGn.DE ) A - Class and B - Class cars on its own so - called MC platform to better utilise its European plants in the long term , a German magazine said on Wednesday .
Citing sources at Toyota ’s Tokyo headquarters , auto motor und sport wrote that the company was thinking about the generation of Mercedes compacts due to follow the upcoming version , which is scheduled to be introduced in 2011 .
Typically , model lifecycle can last at least 6 years , so any production at a Toyota factory would not likely happen until at least 2017 .
According to the article , the two companies could also look at sharing development costs and even examine the possible joint production of Toyota ’s Lexus LS flagship luxury saloon and its Mercedes counterpart , the S - Class , the best selling car in its segment .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
A study of public attitudes has cast doubt on how juries deal with assessing whether a suspect has been dishonest , but what exactly is the Ghosh test ?
This man is probably aware he is being dishonest A survey of more than 15,000 people has revealed some strange ideas about what is considered dishonest .
It has led to calls for a re-examination of the " Ghosh test " , which has been helping juries make their decisions since 1982 - particularly in matters involving theft .
The test contains two parts , explains Jo Theobald , senior tutor specialising in criminal law at the College of Law , Guildford .
" It is a test that the jury have to apply in criminal trials where dishonesty is an element of the offence , that the prosecution have to prove .
The Theft Act ( 1968 ) does n't set out a definition of dishonesty .
It only sets out some specific situations where a person is considered not dishonest .
THE ANSWER
A two - part of test of whether the defendants behaviour considered dishonest by ordinary people , and whether defendant realised that ordinary people thought that way
Honesty test ' should be reviewed ' " It is a two - part test .
The first part is whether the jury think what the defendant did was dishonest according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people .
In criminal law this is an ' objective ' test .
If the answer is no , that 's the end of it .
The defendant is not dishonest .
" If the jury answer the question yes , it was a dishonest thing , before they convict the defendant they have to apply the second part .
Did the defendant realise that reasonable and honest people would regard what he did as dishonest ?
The second part of the test is not of what the defendant personally thought , according to his own criteria , but whether he realised what ordinary and reasonable people thought . "
In other words , if you used money from the church collection box to buy your lunch , the jury would be asked if ordinary people regarded that to be dishonest , and if so , did you know that ordinary people thought that way .
Slight problem
The " ordinary and reasonable person " is a creation of legal thinking like the " man on the Clapham omnibus " of yore .
The jury have to draw on their own life experience .
And there 's a slight problem in the matter of how you come to create an " ordinary person " .
A sociologist might say there was no such thing .
And with offences like fraudulent insurance claims or illicit use of work property , there could be widely diverging views .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines " An objective test based on what the ordinary reasonable person thinks is quite a difficult thing to apply in an increasingly diverse society , " says Ms Theobald .
The more out of touch the defendant is with ordinary standards of honesty in the community , the more likely he should be acquitted under the Ghosh test , she explains .
" This is referred to as raising a ' Robin Hood ' defence ie if the defendant thinks rightly or wrongly that the rest of the community would agree that it was not dishonest to rob the rich to give to the poor , then he is not dishonest under the Ghosh test . "
If your community was like the TV series Shameless , in other words , there could be real complexity in the dishonesty question .
But , in practice , the test still works .
" Although the Law Commission has expressed concerns about this , and other aspects of the Ghosh test , it has also concluded that the test seems to work in practice and does bring about appropriate outcomes , " says Ms Theobald .
And , there 's a curious phenomenon about the difference between our attitudes and our behaviour .
Many might agree that jostling people while wearing a hoodie is wrong " People do operate a kind of double standards - there are things that people , when put on the spot , admit is dishonest - like avoiding VAT - they nevertheless will admit to doing themselves . "
The test applies in a wide number of criminal offences , Ms Theobald says , including the Theft Act 1968 , the Theft Act 1978 and the Fraud Act 2006 .
And despite the objections a sociologist might have , the Law Commission has no plans to change it .
And who was Ghosh ?
Deb Baran
Ghosh was a surgeon convicted of obtaining property by deception , namely fees to which he was not entitled .
He appealed on the basis of how the jury was directed .
The Court of Appeal 's ruling has been helping juries ever since .
Ghosh , meanwhile , lost his appeal .

Bad Credit Payday Loans
If you need some extra cash to pay for an emergency in your life , like a broken washing machine or a flat tyre , you might decide to get a payday loan .
A payday loan is a kind of short - term loan designed to be paid off the next time you get money from your job .
Usually , this means that you ’ll only have the loan for a month or less .
Although payday loans are often easier to apply for than most cash advances , thanks to their short - term nature , you may still need a good credit rating if you want to get your hands on the best deals .
Whenever you apply for any loan , regardless of whether it ’s a personal cash advance or a payday loan , your provider will check your credit score to determine how big of a risk it is to lend to you .
The worse your credit score , the more likely it is that you ’ll need the specialist support of a provider that offers bad credit payday loans .
What is Bad Credit ?
Your credit score is the number that is kept on a file about you by credit agencies like Equifax .
If you go to a bank for a credit card , loan , mortgage , or car finance , they will check your credit score to determine how reliable you are as a lender .
The lower your score , the worse the deal that you get will be .
This is because a bad credit score means your lender is taking a greater risk .
Credit scores typically range between 300 and 850 .
Any score falling below around 579 is considered bad .
A bad credit score can be caused by various factors , including non-payment of debt , CCJs , and bankruptcies .
If you have bad credit , it can feel as though it ’s practically impossible to get financial help when you need it .
Most credit card and loan providers will avoid giving you the cash you need .
However , companies that offer bad credit payday loans may be able to help .
How much would you like ?

Is Bad Credit the Same as No Credit ?
Crucially , if you notice that your credit score is n’t as good as you had hoped , but you ’ve always paid your bills on time , the issue may be that you have thin credit .
Having thin , or no credit does n’t mean that you have a bad reputation in your credit history .
However , it can stop you from getting the best deals on your loan anyway .
When you do n’t a lot of information on your credit file that shows direct lenders how you use your money , it ’s difficult for them to see how much of a risk you might be .
After all , though there ’s no evidence that you would default on your loans , there ’s also very little evidence that you ’ll pay them off on time either .
Usually , having a thin credit file is n’t quite as bad as having bad credit .
However , it may be worth looking into ways that you can begin building up your credit if you ’re worried about your score .
For instance , using a credit card can be a helpful way to build your credit if you need some extra points in your history .
What Are Bad Credit Loans ?
If you find out that you have bad credit , and you need to apply for a payday loan fast , then you ’ll still have some options available to you .
While you might not be able to get the best deal on the market for your short - term loan , you should still be able to access some form of cash advance , thanks to this type of loan .
Bad credit payday loans are very similar to standard weekend payday advances .
The main difference is that they have been designed to take the concerns of people with bad credit into account .
Usually , the lenders that offer these deals will require a slightly higher level of interest to be paid than other providers .
However , in exchange , you ’ll be able to get a loan that could help you to improve your score in the long - term .
Bad credit loans also come with slightly lower limits than their counterparts .
The good news is that for a payday loan , the chances are that you wo n’t be trying to borrow a great deal of money anyway .
If you can pay off the money that you borrow quickly , then you can begin to show lenders that you can be trusted to take out capital again .
Additionally , with bad credit loan providers , you wo n’t have to worry about rejections dragging down your credit history .
Your provider will take other factors outside of your credit score into account .
For instance , they might look at your employment .
Who Can Apply ?
Most providers will determine your eligibility for a loan by looking at your current affordability .
This means examining your current incoming cash , and whether you have enough money to manage the minimum repayments .
Though the FCA requires that all loan providers conduct a credit check , your score will not be a priority with your credit provider .
The flexible nature of this type of loan makes them an appealing option to anyone who might not be able to get a cash advance from a standard loan provider .
As long as you can make the repayments on time , you ’re over the age of 18 , and you have a UK bank account , you should be able to apply .
You ’ll also need to be a citizen of the UK to successfully request a loan .
Most providers allow those looking for a bad credit loan to apply online .
Usually , you ’ll be able to go onto a company ’s website , use their calculator to choose the loan amount and term you need , then check the average price that you ’ll need to pay .
You can sometimes choose between paying your loan off all at once when you receive your next wage , or every month .
Throughout the application process , you will be asked questions about your monthly financial expenses , your income , and your bank details .
You will be given an offer for your loan online .
Remember that you should n’t just take out the first loan that you ’re offered .
Like any other financial product , you can compare your options online .

What Can Bad Credit Payday Loans Be Used For ?
In truth , this type of loan can be used for anything you like , ranging from an unexpected bill , to an emergency .
You can use your investment to purchase a new refrigerator or to make ends meet if you ’ve misjudged how much you need to live on before your next payday .
The amount of money you ’ll be able to access from a payday loan and the speed with which it is delivered to your account will depend on your lender .
Some providers will be able to get the cash you need to your bank account within the next 24 hours .
Others will even be able to deliver your money to you within the same day .
How Do These Loans Affect Your Credit Rating ?
If you ’re already suffering with a bad credit rating , then you may be worried that taking out another form of capital will make it harder for you to get cash again in the future .
However , you do n’t have to worry about bad credit payday loans making your current situation any worse .
You might discover that taking out a loan and paying it back on time is an excellent first step towards building your credit rating .
While getting a loan with bad credit is n’t always as straightforward as it should be , it gives you an opportunity to show lenders that you can be trusted to pay back the money that you borrow according to their terms and conditions .
This begins to build the score on your credit rating again .
Of course , you ’ll need to make sure that you pay the loan off on time if you want your credit score to benefit .
If you ’re worried that you ca n’t make repayments on time for a bad credit loan , then you ’ll need to contact your provider as soon as possible .
Some lenders will allow you to roll your loan over so that you have a little longer to pay it back .
However , you may need to pay a fee for this service .
Can You Improve Your Credit Rating ?
Most people do n’t have perfect credit in today ’s fast - paced financial world .
If you find that your credit score is n’t as good as you would like it to be , there are plenty of ways that you can begin to build your reputation again .
For instance , you can make sure that you ’re registered on the electoral roll for your current address and check to ensure that all of the details on your history are correct .
It ’s also a good idea to set up direct debit payments when you can so that you can make sure you do n’t fall behind on your payments for any bills or loans .
The critical thing to remember is that it does take time to build a good credit score .
During that time , it ’s helpful to know that you ’ll still be able to get emergency cash when you need it in the form of bad credit payday loans .
Just remember to compare your options before you commit to any provider so that you can always get the best deal on your lending opportunities .
Sometimes when watching for danger you look in the wrong direction

One thing you notice more and more the longer you hang around this sleazy world is the way mainstream types ca n’t admit to the obvious .
They always have to act shocked .
So it ’s like , “ Bond Mogul Convicted of Fraud ” - oh , the shock !
Like they did n’t know , like everybody over the age of nine does n’t know , that insider trading is the whole point of the market .
So much lying .
Makes me sick .
And if you say you were n’t surprised , you ’re the bad guy .
You ’re “ cynical . ”
I love that word , “ cynical . ”
Why not call the guy who discovered germs “ cynical ” ?
That ’s a nasty theory if I ever heard one : armies of little monsters too small to see , just waiting to turn your mucus membranes into their orgy pools .
It ’s true , sure , but gosh it ’s so darn “ cynical ” !
Let ’s pretend it is n’t true .
No , see - nobody calls germs cynical because they do n’t want to die of typhoid or diptheria or all the other stuff that people stopped getting once they faced up to the cynical facts like grownups for once in their wuss - ass lives .
But just ask them to face up to anything that real where big animals like people are concerned and eeeek !
They ’ll scream like a cartoon elephant in a tutu at a mouse .
So take Blackwater .
It ’s shock ’n’ horror time because a couple of ex-mercs blew the whistle on Erik Prince ’s Onward Christian Steroid Casualties operation in Iraq .
Yup , from shock ’n’awe to shock ’n’ horror in only goin ’ - on - seven short years : that ’s how fast normal healthy people can face facts .
Give ’em enough time , like at least until the statute of limitations runs out , which just happens to be seven years , and they ’ll face facts like anything .
A decent interval , that ’s what they love .
The Blackwater defectors have filed a sworn deposition in federal court that Blackwater zapped Iraqis at random , aimed to kill Muslims anywhere and any time they could , paid little Baghdadi girls a dollar a head , so to speak , for sexual services and just generally behaved like cartoon baddies .
David Axe at Wired.com ’s half - assed Inspector - gadget military blog “ Danger Room ” yukked it up with a headline calling Erik Prince a “ super - villain ” and called the defectors ’ story “ a fantastic litany of crimes , almost too fantastic to be believed . ”
This is crap , of course .
There ’s nothing unbelievable or even unusual about what these Blackwater mercs did in Iraq .
It ’s what mercs always do , wherever they go .
The only way you can be surprised about what happened is if you ’ve been lying to yourself for your whole life .
Number one , and this will be bad news to all the computer dweebs at Wired : insurgency and counterinsurgency war is made with people .
Not gadgets .
So it comes down to the quality of the people you put in the field .
While we ’re letting that sink in , and believe me it ’s a real bummer for these Popular Mechanix war fans so it ’ll take a while to sink in - while we wait , we ’ll go on to bad news item # 2 :
We hate the Iraqis .
We did n’t go there to save them or help them or paint their thumbs purple , we went there to punish them , hurt them , fuck them up .
This is one of the biggest and dumbest lies around , this “ saving Private Iraqi ” crap .
Before the war people were a little more honest : we ’re going to blast the fuckers , make them pay .
“ Pay for what ? ” was n’t very clear but then who was asking ?
Nobody cared .
Just make them pay .
Then they turned out to be unarmed , WMD - wise , and we were stuck like a Bakersfield cop standing over a dead cholo .
What do you do , plant a .38 on him ?
Not in Iraq , not after you stupidly invited every damn news crew in the world on a ride - along in your big barrio - patrol adventure .
So suddenly it was , “ Uh…we shot this guy to , um , save a buncha other people , yeah , that ’s it , because we love his cousins and his neighbors ! ”
So officially we love Iraqis , but the people saying that did n’t volunteer for Blackwater .
You know why ?
Because everybody , and I mean everybody , in America knows that the “ I heart Iraq ” thing is a total lie and always has been .
The guys who volunteered for Blackwater did n’t go there to build peace - corps girls ’ schools , they went to get rich in a free - fire , no -rules video game .
And those men are still volunteering , by the way , you can go to their site and sign up at one of their regional HQ right now :
Here ’s what I mean by people never ever looking at the obvious facts : go to an internet café if you can still find one and look over the shoulder of every male in the place ( which is usually everybody except one weird girl in the corner ) .
You ’ll find every one of those guys is playing a first - person shooter game or something like World of Warcraft –you know , Eric Cartman and his friends vs. Dragons or Wizards or some crap .
That ’s what ’s going on in the heads of every male of military age .
Now most of the guys in that internet place are nice Asian boys with moms who ’d skin them alive if they volunteered for Blackwater–ca n’t blame them either .
If I was Asian I would n’t feel all that safe on a Blackwater training compound , I ’d make my will and wait for an “ accidental ” frangible round in the back of the head from some redneck training buddy .
So they wo n’t actually go to Iraq to get head from little slave girls and shoot civilians for fun .
But they ’ll think about it .
It ’s the world most male human beings , if you wanna call us human , inhabit by preference .
In our free time , online , that is .
We do n’t actually live like that because our parents told us , you have to do your homework and get a job eventually .
We do n’t want to ; we want the world on that screen , killing and raping .
It ’s just not practical as a career .
Except around 2003 it was practical , for a whole lot of guys from places you would n’t want to live : Tennessee , Alabama , North Georgia , Oklahoma .
Guys who ’d never had a choice worth making , or only had a choice of WalMart or the Service , no money with no benefits vs. no money with at least VA for life .
Suddenly these guys were making $ 700 per day–yes , that ’s right , per day –to do what every boy at that internet café is doing : strutting around in armor shooting people .
And the people they were hired to shoot were already officially designated targets : Iraqis , ragheads , whatever .
I ’m not even gonna focus on the hate - speech crap , because ( and damn , I get so tired of having to repeat this , but I know you bastards will avoid reality if I give you half a chance ) — because , I repeat , hate speech is normal .
The human norm .
The only way you can think hate speech is weird or criminal is if you do n’t know anything about history and never ever even listen to the people around you .
I guarantee , even if you live in San Francisco–Hell , especially if you live there –you ’ll find most of the talk you hear is hate speech , because that ’s how people talk and always have and always will .
In SF maybe the hate speech is aimed at rednecks , fat white losers like , uh , me , but it ’s the same hate speech .
That ’s how one bunch of primates keeps itself together : by hating on another buncha primates in the next tree .
It ’s that simple .
The reason the SF haters do n’t go volunteer for Blackwater is ( a ) they can make more money without risking their necks ; and ( b ) they would n’t get to kill fat rednecks like me , so it would n’t be any fun for them .
I promise you , if Blackwater got a contract to “ protect ” someplace like Enid , Oklahoma from “ Christian Extremists ” you ’d get half of SF volunteering and they would n’t even ask what the pay rate was .
It ’s who we are , it ’s what we do .
I would n’t blame ’em .
Imagine the fun it ’d be for some Noe Valley yuppie , driving down those Okie alleys with your barrel playing eenie - meenie - miney - moe , catch an okie by the frontal lobe , or just making up games , “ Lessee , I ’m gonna shoot the next one I see with buck teeth … or a cowboy hat …no , maybe the next four - door pickup , I hate those things , shoot the next redneck driving a crew cab… . ”
And then you go home , take your steroids for the day to stay nice ’n’pumped ’n’pissed off , and wander over to the canteen where they ’ve got some nice orphan Okie girls , around ten or maybe twelve years old , and while you ’re getting head off them for a dollar you ’ve got the extra zip of knowing you ’re the all - conquerin ’ bastard that offed their parents at the traffic light last week an’ orphaned them , so you got them into their present line of employment .
That ’s how Genghis Khan felt , folks .
He was just honest enough to say so .
It ’s been a while since anybody was that honest , and it never did take hold on this side of the ocean .
We ’re liars , mealymouthed gospel - puking liars from the get - go , but once it gets dark–and it got nice ’n ’ dark in Iraq for a while there–once it gets dark , we act just like every other stinking male ape who ever got handed a gun .
So just stop lying and acting surprised .
That ’s all I ask .
Just stop lying for once .
Reminds me of that old NWA line , oughta be the national motto : “ Bitch , stop lyin ’ . ”
You ai n’t surprised at what these Blackwater apes did , you ’d do it yourself if you did n’t have better job ops stateside , and if you ever even looked around you or just remembered what you felt like when you were nineteen you ’d know there ’s nothing “ almost unbelievable ” about any of it .
Of course they did all that shit .
What did you think ?
More and more I think most moral , normal people spend most of their energy NOT thinking about anything –history , stats , money , or even remembering what they were like when they were still alive .
They spend about a gigawatt per hour NOT thinking about stuff , and anything left over goes to some crap peaceable - kingdom fantasy .
You see that even in the nature documentaries .
I ’ve noticed there ’s always some supposedly clean kind of ape , you know ?
When I was a kid they thought chimps were the nice ape .
Then somebody filmed chimps hunting down monkeys and eating them alive , tearing off KFC arms and legs still hot .
So much for the nice chimps .
Then it was the pygmy chimp , the bonobo … except some other party - pooper just filmed these nice little feminist chimps doing the same thing , just with smaller monkeys .
Whoops !
Where ’s the nice ape ?
And who ever said there was one ?

Tremendous in scope , breathtaking in its suspense , " Atlas shrugged " is Ayn Rand 's magnum opus , which launched an ideology and a movement .
With the publication of this work in 1957 , Rand gained an instant following and became a phenomenon .
" Atlas shrugged " emerged as a premier moral apologia for Capitalism , a defense that had an electrifying effect on millions of readers ( and now listeners ) who have never heard Capitalism defended in other than technical terms .
In Border States , BATFE Asks : “ May We See Your Guns ? ”
US Border States - -( AmmoLand.com ) - NRA -ILA has recently received several calls from NRA members in border states who have been visited or called by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
In some cases , agents have asked to enter these people 's homes , and requested serial numbers of all firearms the members possess .
In each case , the agents were making inquiries based on the number of firearms these NRA members had recently bought , and in some cases the agents said they were asking because the members had bought types of guns that are frequently recovered in Mexico .
This kind of questioning may or may not be part of a legitimate criminal investigation .
For example , when BATFE traces a gun seized after use in a crime , manufacturers ' and dealers ' records will normally lead to the first retail buyer of that gun , and investigators will have to interview the buyer to find out how the gun ended up in criminal hands .
But in other cases , the questioning may simply be based on information in dealers ' records , with agents trying to “ profile ” potentially suspicious purchases .
On the other hand , some of the agents have used heavy - handed tactics .
One reportedly demanded that a gun owner return home early from a business trip , while another threatened to “ report ” an NRA member as “ refusing to cooperate . ”
That kind of behavior is outrageous and unprofessional .
Whether agents act appropriately or not , concerned gun owners should remember that all constitutional protections apply .
Answering questions in this type of investigation is generally an individual choice .
Most importantly , there are only a few relatively rare exceptions to the general Fourth Amendment requirement that law enforcement officials need a warrant to enter a home without the residents ' consent .
There is nothing wrong with politely , but firmly , asserting your rights .
If BATFE contacts you and you have any question about how to respond , you may want to consult a local attorney .
NRA members may also call NRA - ILA 's Office of Legislative Counsel at ( 703 ) 267-1161 for further information .
Whether contacting a local attorney or NRA , be sure to provide as many details as possible , including the date , time , and location , agent 's name , and specific questions asked .

I just finished watching Writing Code That Does n't Suck by Yehuda Katz .
I think he also could have called it " Writing Tests That Don't Suck " .
I 'm going to write a summary of some of his points ( along with some of my own notes ) .
He covers a lot of the things I 've been thinking about over the last couple months as a Python coder coding in Rails using behavioral driven development ( BDD ) .
Most Rails programmers agree that tests are good .
However , we do n't spend enough time considering which tests are the most valuable .
In fact , Yehuda points out that a lot of tests are quite useless .
Unit tested code does n't mean bug free code .
In my own experience , I 'm often so tired after writing automated tests that I do n't have enough mental energy to do solid exploratory testing .
Having someone other than the programmer do some serious exploratory testing is necessary .
alias_method_chain is bad .
Having a chain of modules monkeypatching the same method leads to a brittle modularity nightmare that is unmaintainable and unreausable .
It 's also a sign of a poorly designed API .
Just because Ruby lets you do things like that does n't mean we should be content with poorly designed APIs .
Matz specifically does n't want to add interfaces to Ruby .
However , Yehuda argues that interface - oriented design is a very good thing .
Yehuda reminds us that everywhere other than Ruby , coders know that good design means coding to an interface , not to an implementation .
You might have code and unit tests that test that code .
You might refactor them both together , and all your tests might pass .
However , if you break the API to your code , you 've broken everyone else 's code that is reliant on that interface .
That 's why regression testing is important .
It does n't matter how the implementation works -- the only thing that matters is that your interface continues to behave as promised .
That 's why testing the external interface is so much more important than unit testing the internal implementation .
Heavily mocked and stubbed unit tests just are n't as useful as full - stack testing ( with , say , Cucumber and Webrat ) .
I personally think there 's nothing worse than a controller , model , and a view that are tested individually using mocks and stubs , but which blow up when combined .
That 's not to say that unit testing is n't useful - - it 's just that what I would call integration testing or what Yehuda would call regression testing is even more useful .
Test what you actually care about -- i.e. the external behavior .
" some_object.should respond_to(:some_method ) " is not a useful test .
If you 're not testing what some_method actually does , then why bother , and if you are testing what some_method actually does , then you do n't need to test for its existence .
I think that " some_object.should respond_to(:some_method ) " is sort of like sunbathing -- it makes you feel better about yourself and ( arguably ) makes you look good , but it 's not helpful for your overall health and well being .
At the risk of beating a dead horse , when I see tests like " some_object.should respond_to(:some_method ) " , it really makes me wish I were coding in Haskell .
Haskell 's type system can enforce interfaces like this without writing boring , do nothing tests .
Perhaps that 's why so many Ruby coders have switched to Scala .
Yehuta does think that TDD with unit tests is helpful for designing your code , but those tests are n't good as regression tests .
After your code is working , then you should write regression tests that cover the things that you actually care about , not the irrelevant implementation details .
Yehuda does n't have a computer science background .
Hence , he is relearning a lot of the lessons that MIT 's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has been teaching for decades , and I think that 's good .
It seems like much of the Rails world has forgotten a lot of the things we 've learned about modularity , encapsulation , and good design over the last 30 years .
Hopefully , thanks to Yehuda and Merb , that will improve .
It will be interesting to watch the synthesis of good design as taught by SICP with a strong commitment to testing that is popular in the Rails world .

Tracy Rose says she told Pembina Trail School Division officials she was worried about a troubled teen , who now stands accused of killing his father and dismembering the body .
SHE claims concerns about a troubled student were ig­nored in the weeks proceeding a grisly slaying .
Now a Winnipeg school caretaker says she 's being shut out of work for publicly blowing the whistle .
Tracy Rose believes officials with the Pembina Trails School Division are punishing her for speaking out about her experience with a 17 - year - old boy now accused of kill­ing his father , dismembering the body and hiding the re­mains .
" I can't believe they are doing this .
Schools always talk about the need to protect our children , but they seem to be the biggest bullies , " Rose told the Free Press this week .
She recently filed a formal complaint with the school division , believing the tragic killing could have been pre­vented had she been taken seriously .
School officials have confirmed an internal investigation is ongoing .
Rose , who was a casual employee but says she would regularly get close to full - time hours , claims a supervisor has now told her there is no longer any work for her .
" He said , ' I told you there was a chance you 'd lose your job over this . '
I can't believe it .
I did what I had to do be­cause I needed some closure .
Everything was fine when I was placing nicey - nice .
Now they 're going to continue step­ping on the little guy , " said Rose .
She has spoken with the provincial labour board but says they can't help her because of her casual status .
She has also talked to a lawyer and is debating legal action against the division .
" The question is do I want to put my family in debt to prove a point here ? " she said .
" At the very least , I think the next people coming up who want to blow the whistle on something may want to think twice , knowing their liveli­hood could be affected . "
Lawrence Lussier , the superintendent of Pembina Trails , refused to discuss spe­cifics of Rose 's employment status .
" I can't comment on rela­tionships between employers and employees .
It may be be­cause we just do n't have any work for her , or it could be for other reasons , " he said this week .
The 17 - year - old accused killer , who can't be named because of provisions in the Youth Criminal Justice Act , was arrested earlier this summer after family members and police learned the teen 's 49 - year - old father had been killed weeks earlier .
An investigation revealed the victim was beaten with a hammer and stabbed to death inside his Charleswood home on June 25 .
The teen has been charged with second - degree murder .
The accused allegedly lived in the home with his father 's body for several days while phone calls poured in from the man 's employer and concerned family members .
That 's when the teen allegedly moved the corpse .
Justice sources say the victim was beheaded and dis­membered , then placed in several garbage bags .
The re­mains were apparently driven more than two hours north of Winnipeg and placed in dense forest , underneath sev­eral large rocks .
Rose worked for three straight months at the boy's high school last spring and says he started hanging around the school after - hours , often conversing with her and two co­workers .
Rose said she went to the school vice - principal in May after the teen made a series of comments that alarmed all three custodians and suggested to them that he may have a propensity to violence .
Rose claimed the vice - principal brushed off her con­cerns .
She was n't happy with the vice - principal 's response and said she spoke to the school guidance counsellor , who said he would look into her concerns .
Rose does n't believe anything was done .
Weeks later , she returned from a trip to British Columbia to find a voicemail message from Winnipeg police homi­cide investigators , wanting to discuss her previous contact with the boy .

In the furious debate gripping America over the future of its health system , one voice has been lost amid the shouting .
It is that of a distinguished gynaecologist , aged 67 , called Dr Joseph Manley .
For 35 years Manley had a thriving health clinic in Kansas .
He lived in the most affluent neighbourhood of Kansas City and treated himself to a new Porsche every year .
But this is not a story about doctors ' remuneration and their lavish lifestyles .
In the late 1980s he began to have trouble with his own health .
He had involuntary muscle movements and difficulty swallowing .
Fellow doctors failed to diagnose him , some guessing wrongly that he had post - traumatic stress from having served in the airforce in Vietnam .
Eventually his lack of motor control interfered with his work to the degree that he was forced to give up his practice .
He fell instantly into a catch 22 that he had earlier seen entrap many of his own patients : no work , no health insurance , no treatment .
He remained uninsured and largely untreated for his progressively severe condition for the following 11 years .
Blood tests that could have diagnosed him correctly were not done because he could n't afford the $ 200 .
Having lost his practice , he lost his mansion on the hill and now lives in a one - bedroom apartment in the suburbs .
His Porsches have made way for bangers .
Many times this erstwhile pillar of the medical establishment had to go without food in order to pay for basic medicines .
In 2000 Manley finally found the help he needed , at a clinic in Kansas City that acts as a rare safety net for uninsured people .
He was swiftly diagnosed with Huntington 's disease , a degenerative genetic illness , and now receives regular medical attention through the clinic .
So how does he feel about the way the debate in the US has come to be dominated by Republican - inspired attacks on Britain 's NHS and other " socialised " health services which give people the treatment they need even if they cannot afford to pay for it ?
" I find that repulsive and an absolutely bone - headed way to go , " he says .
" When I started out practising I certainly did n't expect this would happen .
I thought the system would take care of everybody . "
Over the last month President Obama 's attempts to live up to his election promise to extend healthcare to all Americans has stalled in the face of a sustained rightwing guerrilla attack .
Opponents of Obama 's reforms have succeeded in distracting attention from Manley and the 46 million other medically uninsured , swinging the focus instead on to the " evils " of publicly funded healthcare .
The fear tactics were epitomised by Sarah Palin 's wholly inaccurate claim that the reforms would set up " death panels " that would force euthanasia on to older people .
Such scaremongering has dismayed and infuriated Sharon Lee , the doctor who now treats Manley in Kansas City .
" I 'm very angry , very angry , " she says .
" Many of the people I treat have already been in front of a death panel and have lost – a death panel controlled by insurance companies .
I see people dying at least monthly because we have been unable to get them what they needed . "
Lee 's clinic , Family Health Care , is a refuge of last resort .
It picks up the pieces of lives left shattered by a health system that has failed them , and tries to glue them back together .
It exists largely outside the parameters of formal health provision , raising funds through donations and paying all its 50 staff – Lee included – a flat rate of just $ 12 an hour .
Poverty line
Lee has just opened an outpost of her clinic in the outlying neighbourhood of Quindaro , an area of boarded - up houses and deserted factories where work is hard to find and crack plentiful and a per capita income is $ 11,025 .
A third of the population is below the federally defined poverty line .
And yet the local health department has decided the only health centre in the area will be closed by the end of this year and moved 30 blocks west to a much more prosperous part of the city where income levels are five times higher .
Before long , one of the poorest areas of Kansas – of America – will be left without a single doctor , with only Lee 's voluntary services to fall back on .
Even that is academic .
Many of the residents of Quindaro were unable to see a doctor in any case – because they were uninsured .
In Kansas , anyone who is able - bodied but unemployed is not eligible for government - backed health insurance as is anyone earning more than 39 % of federal poverty levels .
That leaves a huge army of jobless and low - income working families who are left in limbo .
" It 's the working poor who are most at disadvantage , " Lee says .
As a result , she sees the same pattern repeating itself over and over .
People with no insurance avoid seeking medical help for fear of the bills that follow , until it is too late .
" When people come in they are already very , very sick .
They have avoided seeing the doctor thinking that something may clear up , hoping they may be getting better . "
Beth Gabaree , who came in to see Lee for the first time this morning , has experiences that sound extreme but are in fact quite typical .
She has diabetes and a heart condition .
Until two years ago they were controlled through ongoing treatment paid for by her husband 's work - based health insurance .
But he was in a motorbike crash that pulverised his right leg and put him out of work .
That Catch 22 again : no work , no insurance , no treatment .
Except in this case it was Beth who went without treatment , in order to put her husband 's dire needs first .
He receives ongoing specialist care that costs them $ 500 a go , leaving nothing for her .
So she stopped seeing a doctor , and effectively began self - medicating .
She cut down from two different insulin drugs to regulate her diabetes to one , and restricted her heart drugs .
" I do what I think I need to do to keep four steps out of hospital .
I know that 's not the right thing , but I can't justify seeing the doctor when my family 's already in money trouble . "
The problem is that she has n't kept herself four steps out of hospital .
Her health deteriorated and earlier this year she became bedridden .
Even then , it took her family several days to persuade her to go to the emergency room because she did n't want to incur the hospital costs .
" It was hard enough without that , " she says .
After an initial consultation , Lee has now booked Gabaree for a new round of tests for her diabetes and is arranging for free medication .
" It 's wonderful , " Gabaree says .
" I 'm so blessed .
I did n't know you could get this sort of help . "
That she sees basic healthcare as a blessing , not as a right , speaks volumes about attitudes among the mass of the working poor .
Also revealing is the fact that Gabaree has absolutely no idea about the debate raging across America .
She has n't even heard of Obama 's push for health reform , nor the Republican efforts to prevent it .
" I do n't watch much television , " she says .
That provides Palin et al with a massive advantage : the 46 million people who would most benefit from Obama 's plans are also among the least educated and informed , and thus the least able to make political waves .
All of which leaves Lee fearful about the prospects for change .
She has , after all , been here before – in 1993 when Hillary Clinton 's pitch to overhaul the health system foundered .
That attempt ended up doing more harm than good from Lee 's perspective .
Many of her most important donors stopped funding the centre because they assumed that the White House was fixing the problems .
After the Clinton reforms crashed , brought down by the same rightwing assault that Obama is now enduring , it took many months for the centre 's funds to regain their pre-1993 levels .
Recession
Lee fears history could be repeating itself .
This time round there is the recession more unemployed equals more uninsured people who come knocking on the door of Family Health Care .
Last year Lee and one other doctor between them dealt with 14,000 visits , and the numbers are rising daily .
All of which leaves
Lee part despairing , part determined to fight even harder for the bare minimum of human dignity .
The frustration is that every day she must beg and plead with other health providers for simple treatments for her patients .
" It drives me crazy with frustration , " she says .
She rattles off a litany of horror stories .
There was the man who walked into the clinic with a brain tumour .
It took Lee three months to get him an MRI scan and another two to get an appointment with a neurosurgeon .
Or the patient whose nerves in his neck were pushed against his spinal cord so that he lost use of both arms ; by the time Lee found a way of getting him an MRI he was so sick he had to be operated on immediately .
Or the woman who had such heavy periods she would wind up in ER every three months requiring a blood transfusion .
What she really needed was a hysterectomy .
" It took us almost a year to beg hospitals until she finally did get a hysterectomy , " Lee says .
These are the stories , the broken lives , that have been obscured by the fury generated by the Republican rump .
Unless Obama finds a way to regain the political initiative , to remind Americans that only nine months ago they voted overwhelmingly for change , then the future of millions appears bleak .
" Here 's what I 'd like to ask Palin , " Lee says .
" People without health insurance are dying , here in America , right now .
So I 'd like to ask her : how does that fit into your vision of good and evil , Sarah Palin ? "
Obama 's plan : health of the nation
What is Obama trying to do ?
The goal is to increase access to healthcare by regulating costs .
His plan would guarantee all citizens eligibility for care , but the government is not proposing a " single - payer system " , like the NHS .
Instead , private health insurers would continue to operate under new rules that would lower premiums and remove loopholes that allow them to avoid paying for treatment when it is most needed .
Per person , healthcare costs are higher in the US than in any other country , and have been rising faster than the level of inflation .
The quality of care is less of an issue — although citizens with solid insurance may be frustrated by the paperwork and costs associated with the current system , they have fewer complaints about their doctors and hospitals .
Who 's opposing Obama 's plan ?
Those who fear the government would introduce congressional " death panels " to make end - of - life decisions for the elderly .
The insurance industry is worried about their bottom lines .
Members of Congress and voters on the left and right are concerned about the future tax burden .
Many Americans also object to any increase in government involvement in their personal lives .
How can healthcare costs get so out of hand ?
Many insurance plans do not cover " pre-existing conditions " , so it can be difficult for people who have a chronic ailment to secure cover .
Loopholes allow insurers to refuse reimbursement even if the policyholder did not know they had a particular condition when they took out insurance .
" Lifetime caps " allow insurers to set a maximum amount of cover .
Who are the uninsured ?
Up to 46 million Americans are uninsured , because they are unemployed , or their employer does not provide cover , or because they do not qualify for existing government - funded healthcare .
People 65 and older can qualify for Medicare , the poor can qualify for Medicaid , veterans and members of the military can qualify for Veterans Health Administration and Tricare and children can be covered under a programme called SCHIP .
Those overlooked by the system include the young just entering the workforce , the self - employed , the unemployed and people who work for small businesses .

If i assumed each thing I dreamed then i might have confidence that i'd desire to fly and fall off a cliff with out having as much as a bruise .
desires do not advise something , they are basically the concepts utilising its mind 's eye .
and you heavily think of God would not be happy with you having a gay son purchase could be happy with you killing your individual infant ?
in case you particularly have confidence that , you choose help .
And to your guidance , gay human beings can nonetheless be non secular and nicely - known via the church and via God .
The track minister on the church I grew up in become gay , and he become between the main non secular human beings i've got ever prevalent .
everybody interior the church enjoyed him , and he led a better than chuffed , effectual existence .
you will desire to be ashamed for thinking the way you 're .
it is your infant .
you will desire to love him no count what .
in spite of if he 's gay , obese , particular desires , etc . he 's your flesh and blood .
in case you do not think of you will possibly be a sturdy mom and settle to your infant for who he's , positioned him up for adoption and supply him to a kin which will love him unconditionally , the way mothers and dads are meant to .
I recently upgraded to KDE 4.3.1 ( from KDE 4.2.something ) .
As seems to be par for the course for the KDE 4 series , I then waded through nearly a dozen bugs / crashes / regressions for the next day , filing bugs where I had the energy .
This has got pretty old , and fills me with no confidence about the future of KDE — the stable desktop I ’m hoping for still has n’t materialised .
But there is one thing about KDE 4 that terrifies me , and this post is an attempt to get the KDE devs to change their approach before it ’s too late .
KDE 4.2 attempted to migrate some of my data to Akonadi , the new framework for storing PIM data .
There were a bunch of ways in which Akonadi did not provide the features that previously existed ( ca n’t have multiple writable calendars in KOrganizer , Kopete address book link did n’t work … ) , so I had to ditch it .
Thankfully this was not hard ( though the whole experience would have been extremely confusing to Joe User ) .
I was prepared to give KDE 4.3 another shot on this front ( after carefully backing up my data ) .
I cleared out any remnants of previous Akonadi data , and the settings which told it not to do the migration .
The results were pretty disappointing :
First , there was an initial setup process .
This failed .
Unfortunately , the popup simply disappeared before I could note down the error message .
It was something to do with creating an agent .
Did the process crash , or was it supposed to just disappear like that ?
Then , for individual applications , the migrations all partly failed .
Again , the popups telling me what was happening , including the error , just disappeared after a short delay .
The error was something about a timeout when creating an instance of an agent .
Did the process crash ?
Did the agent instance get created eventually , so the process could continue successfully ?
I ’ve no idea .
I ca n’t even file an bug without the error message .
Even while the popup remained , there was no indication of what I should do about the error , if anything .
So I ’m guessing all the migrations failed — my applications do n’t seem to be migrated to using Akonadi at all .
Why does this worry me so much ?
Well , I can cope with an unstable desktop .
It ’s a pain , it means I ca n’t recommend KDE to anyone I know in it ’s current state , but usually I can work around the pain points .
Plasma restarts itself , so although it is still pretty crashy ( far more than the Windows shell , for instance , has ever been in my experience ) , I do n’t have to worry about it too much .
But Akonadi is a different matter .
It is the proposed framework for handling all PIM data — all my e-mails , calendars and address book .
This data is extremely important to me .
Akonadi is clearly not up to the job of handling it — if their migration tool can fail like this , and fail with worrying errors about timeouts ( which actually suggests the migration process is non-deterministic — it ’s going to depend on how fast / busy your computer is ) , it ’s clearly far from ready .
It ’s not getting better , it ’s getting worse — this time the migration failed completely , and I ’m not even able to check whether it ’s up to feature parity with non-Akonadi methods .
Even worse than this , is that either the KDE developers :
think it ’s OK to start migrating to an alpha-quality framework for handling user ’s data .
To me , this is appalling .
Desktop eye - candy in exchange for a bit of instability is one thing , but my data is entirely different .
to start migrating to an alpha-quality framework for handling user ’s data .
To me , this is appalling .
Desktop eye - candy in exchange for a bit of instability is one thing , but my data is entirely different .
or , they are unaware that Akonadi is not there yet .
This is just as worrying .
Akonadi seems like an overly ambitious project .
If you look at its home page , the diagram includes the idea that other desktop apps , outside of KDE , will use Akonadi as a backend for all their data .
To me , this seems extremely unlikely and is a tell - tail sign of developers getting ideas that are just too big .
So , what do I propose ?
Simply this : ditch Akonadi .
Yes , I mean that .
KDE 4 seems to lack a BDFL who is willing to say “ this is not working , time to pull the plug ” .
Mark Shuttleworth did that with a pet project of his when the developers got distracted with shiny geek toys .
Windows Vista ditched the killer feature of Vista , their WinFS filesystem , because it just was n’t ready .
But it seems there is no - one in KDE who can make these kind of decisions .
The major obstacle is egos and pride — after all that work has gone in for years , can we ditch a big feature like that ?
Yes , you can , and you should , for the sake of your users and the future of KDE .
Of course , you can just move it to an experimental branch and come back to it for KDE 5 / 6/7 , but please do not turn it on until it ’s ready .
Akonadi is one instance of a bigger problem in KDE — grandiose ‘ we ’ll fix everything but it will take us five years ’ schemes that are prioritised over things users actually want , and could be implemented soon .
For example , I want desktop search and fast e-mail search .
After all , this is 2009 , right ?
Is it so much to ask for a decent way of searching all the files on my computer , and fast full text search for my e-mails ?
If I used Mac or Vista or Google docs & Gmail , I would have had this years ago .
Instead of that , KDE gives us : Nepomuk .
The usefulness of Nepomuk completely escapes me .
Even though it includes Strigi indexing ( which indexes all your files , though it can be a big pain to get working ) , there is no decent interface for searching those files .
( No KRunner is not a decent interface ) .
Currently , turning Nepomuk off has exactly one consequence — it makes my computer much more responsive and saves me 3 Gb of disk space .
AFAICS , there are no applications which make good use of Nepomuk .
I think there is tagging in Dolphin , but :
There is no interface for searching tags !
What kind of idiots do you take us for ?
Going round tagging files in the hope that one day we ’ll be able to make use of all that effort because someone actually implemented a UI ?
?
I do n’t want to manually tag files anyway , I want a decent desktop search tool !
Other applications that need tagging are better off implementing their own solution , and then extracting a simple KTagging library which can be shared .
Nepomuk is n’t as bad as Akonadi at the moment — it ’s useless , but I can turn it off , and it does n’t threaten my data .
But even then , all the effort that is going into Nepomuk could be directed into manageable , achievable goals of providing features that users will be able to make use of .
Please , KDE devs , stop the big grandiose schemes .
Stop doing anything that would threaten my data .
I ’ve been a loyal fan — pushed to the limits by the KDE 4 series , I ’ll admit — but if you foist Akonadi on me in anything like it ’s current state , I ’m taking all my data and going .
I do n’t yet know where I ’ll go .
I might go back to GNOME after a long time .
It still sucks IMO , and I ’m not sure how I ’m going find replacements for KMail ( very nice despite no fast full - text search ) , KOrganizer , Amarok , k3 b etc. KDE currently has the lion ’s share of the best Linux apps .
But it does n’t really deserve them at the moment , and it ’s going to lose all but its most stubborn and loyal users at the current rate .
If you got this far , thanks for bothering to read this .
I know the KDE developers have got a lot of flack for KDE 4 , and I have held back for a long time , but some of the criticisms are deserved , and you do need to listen occasionally …

Helsingin käräjäoikeus : Parodia ei ole parodiaa
Electronic Frontier Finland ry ( Effi ) huomioi Helsingin käräjäoikeuden päätöksen , että parodia ei ole parodia , koska se on parodia .
“ Oikeuden viesti on selvästi , että vain vakavia asioita saa sanoa ” , mielistelee Effin hallituksen jäsen Lars Wirzenius .
“ Hyvä hallintoalamainen jättää siis lehdistötiedotteenkin lyhyeksi .
Minä olen nyt hiljaa . ”
Käräjäoikeus on tänään tuominnut Matti Nikin sakkorangaistukseen .
Nikki oli tehnyt parodisen nettisivun , jolla hän pyrki kritisoimaan sitä , että Pelastakaa Lapset ry hoitaa poliisille kuuluvia viranomaistehtäviä .
Tuomion mukaan parodia ei saa olla halventava eikä samankaltainen kuin kohteensa .
Erityisen raskauttavaa on , jos parodia on lisäksi epäonnistunut .
“ Ehdotamme parodian käytön tekemistä luvanvaraiseksi ” , lisää Effin hallituksen jäsen Leena Romppainen .
“ On tarpeen määritellä kansalliset laatukriteerit parodialle .
Luvan saamiseksi tarvittaisiin psykiatrin puoltava lausunto , kirjallisuuden professorin arvio teoksesta jolle lupaa haetaan , sekä rikosrekisteriote . ”
Lisäksi Effi esittää , että parodiaan käytettäviä lupia hallinnoivana viranomaisena toimii jatkossa Sisäasiainministeriön arpajais - ja asehallintoyksikkö .

I met Judge Richard Goldstone at The Hague at the height of the Bosnian war , a small , dapper man whose belief in the righteousness of justice shone through his every word .
As head of the War Crimes Tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia , he pursued the blood - drenched gangsters of the Balkans – Croat Catholic , Bosnian Muslim , Serb Orthodox – with Nuremberg - like persistence .
He believed that one day even Slobodan Milosevic would be brought to book .
I doubted this .
But he was right , as they say , and I was wrong .
He was Jewish – and not afraid to talk of his hatred of apartheid in his native South Africa – and I thought he was a fine man .
So would he be pissed on by the Israelis when he investigated the crimes of the winter war in Gaza ?
Or would Israel – just this once – desist from its usual venom for all critics if this great jurist produced a report that blamed Israel as well as Hamas for crimes against humanity ?
Not because he was Jewish .
Not because he drew the sword of justice on behalf of the UN .
But because he was a patently decent and fair man .
" I accepted with hesitation my United Nations mandate , " he wrote last week , " because I believe deeply in the rule of law and the laws of war , and the principle that in armed conflict civilians should to the greatest extent possible be protected from harm . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Not a hope , of course .
Israeli investigations of the Gaza war , its government officials announced , were " a thousand times " fairer than the Goldstone investigation – a preposterous claim , given Israel 's constant inability to conduct fair inquiries of its own – and that his mission " gave legitimacy to the Hamas terrorist organisation " .
The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem found that 1,387 Palestinians were killed in the Gaza war , more than 770 of them civilians .
Thirteen Israelis were killed , four by their own troops , three of the others Israeli Arabs .
Goldstone bitterly condemned Hamas for firing at civilians – from civilians areas of Gaza – but Chapter 11 of his report , for example , found that Israel shelled a house in which Palestinian civilians had been forced to gather , intentionally bombed a hospital with white phosphorous shells , shot civilians who were waving white flags and refused to allow wounded to be evacuated .
But no , Israel – as unwilling to accept criticism as Hamas – which , typically and cynically , washed its own dirty hands of the report , even though it murdered at least 40 suspected Palestinian collaborators while killing only six of its military enemies – would n't face up to Goldstone 's conclusions , would n't accept that the casualties of this monstrous war were disproportionate .
Israel 's response was n't disproportionate .
It never was .
This nonsense is unworthy of a grown - up nation .
For not long before the Gaza war , Gadi Eisenkot , the Israeli army northern commander , defined his doctrine very carefully .
" We will wield disproportionate power against every village from which shots are fired on Israel , and cause immense damage and destruction ...
This is n't a suggestion .
This is a plan that has already been authorised . "
No wonder the world watches , amazed , at Israel 's response to Goldstone 's conclusions .
And the United States – which , of course , once defined Hiroshima as " a military base " – was either silent or took Israel 's side .
Barack Obama 's UN ambassador , Susan Rice , condemned the Goldstone investigation with the pathetic ( and , again , typical ) remark that " our view is that we have to remain focused on the future " .
But these things come by the bucketful .
Take the Toronto Film Festival that ended this week .
A group of eight actresses , actors and activists objected to the festival for embracing a city - to - city spotlight with Tel Aviv just a few months after the Gaza slaughter , accusing the Canadian organisers of helping to wash Israel 's image after the bloodbath .
They were n't trying to boycott the Israeli films at the festival – and by the way , I urge readers to watch the Israeli film Lebanon , filmed almost entirely inside a tank , when it comes your way – and five of the eight letter - signers were Jewish , one an Israeli .
It mattered not , of course .
They were accused of trying to organise a racist boycott , abused as hypocrites , censors and – since slanders are now part of the grammar of Israel 's so - called supporters – anti-Semites .
Naomi Klein , one of the most brilliant of North America 's journalists , was abused in Canada 's National Post ( " the strange , enduring rage of Naomi Klein " ) , thus cementing the paper 's role as Canada 's version of the Jerusalem Post .
But there was just one little hiccup for the protesters and their letter .
I noticed Jane Fonda 's name among them .
Fonda ?
Remember little Jane when she outraged her friends by visiting North Vietnam during America 's own disproportionate war in South - east Asia ?
Tough little Jane , we thought then .
But I went back to my files ( paper , of course ) and discovered that doughty Jane turned up in Lebanon in 1982 when Israel was besieging Beirut – with plenty of white phosphorous shells falling among civilians , of course – to entertain the Israeli soldiers whose war was to claim 17,000 lives .
According to Yediot Ahronot ( 4 July 1982 , if readers want to check it out ) , she " expressed her identification with Israel 's struggle against Palestinian terror ... " , later announcing her " unqualified support for Israel " , attributing protests at the invasion to " anti-Semitism " .
( Please read Al - Hamishmar of 5 December 1982 . )
Years later , she turned up in Egypt to marvel at the temples of Luxor , but refused to take questions from me on her enthusiasm for the 1982 Israeli invaders .
But then , bingo , up she pops in Toronto .
Until last week , when she said she 'd signed the letter " without reading it carefully enough ... some of the words in the protest letter did not come from my heart ...
Many ( Israeli ) citizens now suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder ... "
The letter did not " hear the narratives of both sides " and could be " inflammatory " .
Ye gods !
With Jane as a friend , you do n't need enemies .
But given her previous behaviour and now this grovelling backtrack , you have to admit that the Toronto protesters must have some right on their side .
Like Judge Richard Goldstone .

An Illinois district court has allowed a couple to sue their bank on the novel grounds that it may have failed to sufficiently secure their account , after an unidentified hacker obtained a $ 26,500 loan on the account using the customers ' user name and password .
As reported by the blog New York Criminal Defense , David Johnson , Marsha and Michael Shames - Yeakel sued Citizens Financial Bank in 2007 in the northern district of Illinois on several grounds , including a claim that the bank failed to provide state - of - the - art security measures to protect their account .
U.S. District Judge Rebecca
Pallmeyer refused last week to grant a summary judgment in favor of Citizens Financial , stating in her ruling ( .pdf ) that " assuming that Citizens employed inadequate security measures , a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the insufficient security caused Plaintiffs ’ economic loss . "
Larry Smith , an attorney for the Shames - Yeakels , told Threat Level that he 's surprised and happy by the judge 's ruling , particularly since the negligence claim was not the meat of their case against the bank .
" It 's a novel claim of negligence that we 're bringing , " he said .
" We were sort of throwing it out there .
That was not at the forefront of our minds in going forward with the case that we 've got to keep the negligence case alive . "
The couple , who run a home - based bookkeeping , accounting and computer programming business , have been customers of Citizens Financial , which is based in Illinois , for 30 years .
They maintained personal and business checking accounts with the bank as well as a $ 30,000 home equity line of credit , which was linked to the business checking account .
[ The judge 's ruling indicates the credit line was $ 50,000 , but the plantiffs ' lawyers say this is incorrect . ]
In February 2007 , someone with a different IP address than the couple gained access to Marsha Shames - Yeakel 's online banking account using her user name and password and initiated an electronic transfer of $ 26,500 from the couple 's home equity line of credit to her business account .
The money was then transferred through a bank in Hawaii to a bank in Austria .
The Austrian bank refused to return the money , and Citizens Financial insisted that the couple be liable for the funds and began billing them for it .
When they refused to pay , the bank reported them as delinquent to the national credit reporting agencies and threatened to foreclose on their home .
The couple sued the bank , claiming violations of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act , claiming , among other things , that the bank reported them as delinquent to credit reporting agencies without telling the agencies that the debt in question was under dispute and was the result of a third - party theft .
The couple wrote 19 letters disputing the debt , but began making monthly payments to the bank for the stolen funds in late 2007 following the bank 's foreclosure threats .
In addition to these claims , the plaintiffs also accused the bank of negligence under state law .
According to the plaintiffs , the bank had a common law duty to protect their account information from identity theft and failed to maintain state - of - the - art security standards .
Specifically , the plaintiffs argued , the bank used only single - factor authentication for customers logging into its server ( a user name and password ) instead of multi- factor authentication , such as combining the user name and password with a token the customer possesses that authenticates the customer 's computer to the bank 's server or dynamically generates a single - use password for logging in .
At the time of the theft , Citizens had been in the process of issuing such tokens to customers , but the plaintiffs say they were too slow in rolling out this security measure .
They pointed to a 2005 document from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council , which concluded that single - factor authentication was inadequate , and said that Citizens lagged behind other banks in offering this feature .
Citizens used a company named Fiserv to provide its online banking services , including information security services , and argued that Fiserv had a solid reputation in the banking industry and that its security measures were not the cause of the money transfer .
The bank also pointed to its online user agreement , which it said released it of liability .
The agreement stated to customers that it would " have no liability to you for any unauthorized payment or transfer made using your password that occurs before you have notified us of possible unauthorized use and we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice . "
Judge Pallmeyer , however , was not convinced .
She found court precedents showing that financial institutions have a common law duty to protect their customers ' confidential information against identity theft .
Specifically , Indiana courts – where the Shames - Yeakels live – have held that a bank “ has a duty not to disclose information concerning one of its customers unless it is to someone who has a legitimate public interest . ”
The judge therefore concluded in part that , " If this duty not to disclose customer information is to have any weight in the age of online banking , then banks must certainly employ sufficient security measures to protect their customers ' online accounts . "
With regard to Citizens ' slow rollout of tokens to customers , Judge Pallmeyer stated that , " In light of Citizens ’ apparent delay in complying with FFIEC security standards , a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the bank breached its duty to protect Plaintiffs ’ account against fraudulent access . "
She also concluded that the plaintiffs had grounds for claiming that the bank may have violated the FCRA in reporting them as delinquent to credit reporting agencies without revealing to the agencies that the outstanding debt was under dispute .
Plaintiffs attorney , Smith , said it 's unclear yet if they will use the negligence issue to spearhead their case against the bank , but he said , " Hopefully , we 'll get the jury angry enough with what 's going on with this story .
I think the story in and of itself brings in enough facts into each cause of action that we have . "
The central point is that as we pursue high rates of population growth , the issue always left out is our common environment , our common heritage required for our continued existence .
Until that is factored in on an equal footing with economic arguments and social arguments than we will continue to have a very facile and useless debate on immigration .
What do we know about individuals and their sense of population growth ?
Women in the developed world at least have control over their bodies to the point where now the average number of children per woman is only 1.6 .
United Nations figures released in March for the total population rates for the planet reveal that our population will peak at around 2050 at just over 9.1 billion human beings .
That 's a very serious issue for us people who live on this small planet of ours .
The 6.8 billion of us who are on the planet at the moment are using far more of the Earth 's resources than our planet can possibly sustain into the future .
As we seek to limit our growth in population , the focus is on the poorest countries in the world .
Women there have an average of about five children each .
If we 're to reach that level of just over 9 billion people in the world 40 years from now , that rate will need to drop to 2.5 children each .
But if we are requiring so much of the poorest countries in the world , what right do we have to grow our population at one of the fastest rates of any of the developed countries on the planet ?

As Predicted : A Psychic Failure
For the past eight years , September 11th has been a day that stands out as a date to remember and reflect on the worst terrorist attack in US history and one of the most shocking events in many of our lifetimes .
The attacks of that day have caused a lot of pain and lead to a great deal of disagreement over the cause and the response and the things done in the name of security and safety .
However , I 'd like to consider another aspect that is rarely discussed : the events were never in any way predicted by any of the self - proclaimed psychics or future - seers out there .
While some have claimed that the vague words of Nostradamus or some other cryptic phrase contains clues , the fact is that nobody , no professional nor amateur psychic gave any indication that there would be a major terrorist attack in New York City or Washington in September 2001 .
None said that the year 2001 would see commercial aircraft turned into weapons to bring down skyscrapers .
None stated that the World Trade Center would be destroyed .
Nothing like that has ever been verified .
I find this incredibly significant because it is one event which would be nearly impossible to miss , even if one only received the most scant and varied information on the future .
One thing that many self - proclaimed psychics have claimed is that they can't be expected to be right 100 % of the time or to get every event before it happens .
They will tell you that they do n't always have complete control over their powers or what they see .
Sometimes it works better than others and sometimes it does not come in very clearly .
One might imagine that their visions are like a cell phone or television with very poor reception .
It fades in and out , and sometimes you can make out a good picture through the static , but sometimes you can't .
Fair enough .
One can easily see how the imperfections in psychic powers might mean a certain event would be obscured , but the attacks of 9/11/2001 were not a single event .
They were the beginning of a number of events that changed things across the US and across the world .
If a psychic had even the briefest vision of what New York City would look like in years to come , it would be impossible not to notice that the twin towers were absent .
Anyone who had been to the city in 2001 or 2002 will also be aware that it was a very different place .
Much of lower Manhattan was covered in dust , pictures of lost loved ones were hanging on temporary walls in Grand Central and everywhere signs and memorials hung in windows .
If a person from the year 2000 were taken into the future and dropped in the city , it would be immediately apparent that something major and tragic had happened .
Beyond that , the attacks shaped life in the US and around the world .
For months , hardly a single newspaper front page did not mention the attacks or the war in Afghanistan afterward .
" Terrorism " and " 9/11 " were on the lips of everyone , especially politicians .
The TSA was formed as was the Department of Homeland Security .
Airports stopped allowing liquids , even beverages to be brought through security .
Political debates were dominated by talk of terrorism .
How is it possible , how is it even conceivable , that a psychic could see the future , even bits and pieces of the future and not pick up something verifiable .
It could be a statement as simple as " The numbers 9 and 11 will be significant and connected with a tragic event that is of a scale large enough to dominate politics for some time thereafter . "
But no .
No such thing .
The simple explanation is that psychic powers do n't exist .

Late Friday afternoon , Sarah Palin emerged from her worrying social - network hiatus to warn the nation of the dangers posed by the health - care - reform plan being debated in Congress .
And they ’re worse than you ever could have imagined .
The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama ’s “ death panel ” so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their “ level of productivity in society , ” whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil .
Palin ’s curious interpretation of a proposal that would require Medicare to cover optional consulting on end - of - life decisions was panned across the political spectrum on television over the weekend .
On CNN , revered Washington Post scribe Dan Balz thought the posting demonstrated Palin ’s “ difficulty figuring out how to enter into a serious debate about issues , ” and the network ’s Jessica Yellin labeled it a “ low blow . ”
Perhaps even more significantly , on Meet the Press , conservative Times columnist David Brooks called Palin “ crazy , ” while on Real Time With Bill Maher , congressman Jack Kingston of Georgia , one of the most reliably Republican votes in Congress , admitted Palin was using “ scare tactics . ”
We were right there with the critics — does Palin even hear how hysterically insane she sounds ?
( Not to mention — will she ever tire of involving her baby in her bizarre attempts at political demagoguery ? )
That is , until we received this video obtained by SarahPAC , which they tell us shows a congressional health - care task force performing a secret mock rehearsal of such a death panel .
Needless to say , it ’s a chilling look at the future that awaits us if Obamacare is to pass .
CONSERVATIVES SLAM PALIN ATTACK AS ‘ CRAZY ’ [ Political Animal / Washington Monthly ]
Teaching robots to find " food " and share it with others seems like a fairly worthwhile and noble endeavor , no ?
Well , it apparently was n't quite enough for a group of researchers from Switzerland 's Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , who had the bright idea to augment said robots with a new artificial neural network that let the robots learn a host of new abilities -- namely , scheming , lying and deceiving .
Apparently , in their younger days , the robots would flash a light whenever they found food to let their buddies know where it was , but that of course caused the food to dwindle a lot quicker .
After a bit of trial and error and a few tweaks from the researchers , however , the robots apparently discovered that they could keep more of the food for themselves if they did n't flash the light , and it seems like its been Lord of the Flies on an incredibly tiny scale ever since .

Ian Button had a terminal illness A man who gave his father a gun in hospital so that he could shoot himself has been jailed for three years .
Guy Button , 30 , of Wycombe Road , Princes Risborough , Buckinghamshire , took the gun to a ward in Northampton General Hospital on 20 October .
Ian Button , 63 , from Northampton , shot himself in the head after being told he had terminal lung disease .
Button , who admitted four offences , including transferring a firearm , was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court .
The judge told the music teacher he will have to serve at least half of the jail term .
At an earlier court appearance in Northampton the court heard Button had arrived on his father 's ward with a bag containing the World War II gun and 19 rounds of ammunition .
This is the stuff of tragedy because his late father , in doing what he did , put his son in a position anybody could see was unbearable
Luke Blackburn Mr Button , a car leasing manager , had become more depressed before deciding to take his own life , the judge was told .
His 63 - year - old wife Christine was in a care home with Alzheimer 's disease at the time .
He drew a curtain around his bed on the six - bay Benham Ward and shot himself through the right temple .
He was discovered , still breathing , by a ward sister but medical staff did not try to resuscitate him as he had asked for this not to be carried out .
Mr Button left a suicide note addressed to police , in which he claimed that he had taken the gun to the hospital .
The judge questioned the decision by prosecutors not to pursue a charge of assisting a suicide against Button which carries a maximum prison term of 14 years .
He said : " Is n't there abundant evidence that the defendant took the gun in to the hospital so his father could kill himself ? "
Graham Reeds QC , prosecuting , replied : " With the available evidence there was insufficient evidence to make a conviction probable . "
Sensitive music teacher Judge Wide said he did find that there were " exceptional circumstances " in the case which allowed him to pass a sentence of less than five years .
He had received " numerous glowing testimonials " from the defendant 's friends and relatives .
Button has lost his job as a teacher at the High Wycombe Music Centre in Buckinghamshire .
Luke Blackburn , defending , said : " Guy Button is a man of impeccable character .
He is a sensitive man who takes his greatest pleasures from playing and teaching music .
" This is the stuff of tragedy because his late father , in doing what he did , put his son in a position anybody could see was unbearable . "

About 2.5 million Americans slipped below the poverty line as recession and layoffs hammered the economy last year , driving poverty to its highest level since 1998 , the U.S. Census Bureau reported Thursday .
The annual survey showed that more than one in eight U.S. residents - 13.2 percent - are living on less than $ 10,991 for an individual - slightly more than $ 200 a week - or $ 22,025 for a family of four .
The report came as no surprise to those who work daily with the poor and homeless .
B.J. Iacino , public affairs director for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless , said her organization has been stretched to the limit by the heightened demand for services .
“ We are definitely seeing dramatic increases in the numbers of people coming here for help , both for housing and for medical and mental health care , ” she said .
Barbara Droher Kline , president and chief executive officer of Lutheran Social Services of Northern California , said the economic crisis has driven up the number of families in need of food , housing , employment and youth services .
“ It ’s just so monumental , so widespread , ” said Ms. Kline , whose administrative offices are in Concord , Calif .
“ Fresno is in tough straits , all the way down to Bakersfield .
It ’s like , ‘ Where do you look ? ’
There is so much of it going on , and I do n’t know how some people are getting by . …
“ Everybody here is trying to figure out how to stretch everything as much as they can .
It ’s really , really rough . ”
The increased poverty rate was accompanied by falling real incomes for all Americans , the Census Bureau report showed .
The country ’s median household income fell to $ 50,303 from $ 52,163 a year earlier , the first drop in four years .
The data also showed poverty disproportionately affecting families , which accounts for a 19 percent poverty rate last year among children , or those younger than 18 .
That was up from 18 percent the year earlier .
“ The number of families , as opposed to individuals , coming to us is increasing , and that ’s a trend , ” Ms. Iacino said .
The effects of rising poverty also were disproportionately felt among minorities and in certain regions of the country .
The bureau reported that 23.2 percent of Hispanics and 24.7 percent of blacks were living below the poverty line in 2008 .
The hardest - hit regions were the Midwest , where poverty rose to 12.4 percent from 11.1 percent a year earlier , and the West , where the rate rose to 13.5 percent from 12.0 percent .
The Northeast and South were statistically unchanged , the Census Bureau said .
The increased poverty rate in the Midwest resulted in part from layoffs in the auto industry , which have hit Detroit and surrounding areas particularly hard .
“ This time of year , I ’m seeing more people here than any other time , even our cold months , ” said Mike Hayes , a worker at the City Rescue Mission in Lansing , Mich .
He said the shelter has increased its number of overnight beds for those who have no jobs from 24 to 44 , and most of the time they are filled .
“ More and more houses are for sale or vacant , more than I ’ve seen in my life .
Michigan has really been impacted , ” he added .
Census Bureau statistician Chuck Nelson said the poverty numbers reflect the recession that began in December 2007 and that increased poverty and lower incomes are “ consistent with recent recessionary periods . ”
The bureau ’s report , “ Income , Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States : 2008 , ” also included numbers on health care coverage , which President Obama cited Thursday in his effort to reform health care .
The number of people without coverage increased from 45.7 million in 2007 to 46.3 million in 2008 , according to the agency .
Over the same period , the number of people covered by private health insurance decreased from 202 million to 201 million , while the number covered by government health insurance increased from 83 million to 87.4 million .
The number covered by employment - based health insurance declined from 177.4 million to 176.3 million .
Mr. Nelson said the agency felt no political pressure in putting out the numbers this year , despite the intense debate in Washington and raging arguments over the extent to which a lack of health insurance in a national problem .
“ For us , this is the most important time of the year every year , ” he said .

Beck ,
Fox source dispute vacation [ UPDATED ]
The industry blog TVNewser is reporting that a campaign to push advertisers off the Glenn Beck Show appears to have taken its toll — but an e-mail provided by Beck 's camp seems to show otherwise .
From TVNewser :
Tipsters inside Fox News tell us Glenn Beck 's vacation this week from his Fox News show was not planned .
We hear Beck was told to take this week off to let some of the heat surrounding him die down .
That heat began July 28 on " Fox & Friends " when Beck said he thought Pres.
Obama has " a deep - seated hatred for white people , " adding , " This guy is , I believe , a racist . "
UPDATE : An aide to Beck ( not Fox ) , Matt Hiltzik , e-mails with evidence that , contrary to what 's apparently the company 's spin , Beck is n't being punished , but is rather off on a planned vacation .
Hiltzik forwards a July 14 internal e-mail from Beck 's production company stating that Beck will be off " the week of August 17 . "
[ I 've changed the item as the e-mail pretty clearly contradicts the first report 's central claim . ]
It remains unclear whether the TVNewser item was an unsanctioned leak or an attempt from somewhere inside Fox to send a conciliatory message .
A
Fox spokeswoman has n't responded to an e-mail seeking comment .
Five years ago , Suzette Wilmsmeyer was driving home from work in Los Angeles when she noticed seven helicopters circling her block , an upper - middle - class neighbourhood a kilometre outside Beverly Hills .
She turned onto her street .
A SWAT van was blocking her driveway .
" There was some huge car chase or something , " recalls Wilmsmeyer , who was fearful for the safety of her son , then just a year - and - a - half old .
" The violence was getting to me , so I decided to come here . "
She pauses , looks up and down Eglinton Ave. W. , where she now owns a restaurant , and laughs : " Yes . I see the irony . "
Her neighbourhood , with its low - income population and shuttered homes , has long had problems with drugs and related street crime .
But earlier this year , all - out war seems to have erupted .
In two - and - a - half weeks , beginning in late April , four young men were shot dead within two kilometres of the Keele St. and Eglinton Ave. intersection .
Half a dozen others have been killed in the same police division since January .
A city - wide analysis of crime trends pinpoints the area as one of two " hot spots " for violence .
( The other is Jane and Finch . )
Police Chief Bill Blair deployed his anti-violence task force , TAVIS ( Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy ) , to the area last month .
Its arrival was timed to a massive drug sweep , Project Spring Clean , which closed dozens of grow - ops and crack houses and left 120 people facing more than 400 charges .
Two men arrested in the project , Shane and Sheldon Evans , are alleged by police to be the two leaders of the Five Point Generals street gang .
Last week , Blair celebrated 57 days without a homicide in 12 Division : " Knock on wood . "
But TAVIS officers are scheduled to leave at the end of the summer .
Their departure will leave peacekeeping to locals like Wilmsmeyer .
ON A RECENT Friday morning , Wilmsmeyer is in front of her restaurant , Z Bar and Grille , finishing a cigarette before the lunch rush , her curly , chin - length red hair tucked under a black baseball cap .
Z Bar , a four - minute walk east of Keele , is one of the few sit - down restaurants in the area , so Wilmsmeyer knows most of the locals by name : families from the apartments across the street , the crackheads , hookers and drug dealers working the alleys behind her shop .
Since opening the business three years ago , Wilmsmeyer has found unique ways to coexist with her sometimes challenging neighbours .
She keeps a bowl of condoms by the bar for the local prostitutes – or embarrassed teenagers .
It 's a neutral zone , she says .
On a typical day , local cops may be snacking on jerk chicken in the front , while known gang members shoot pool in the back .
" Everyone is welcome , as long as they follow the rules , " she says .
Rule No. 1 is : No colours , no patches – no exceptions .
For the most part , gang members respect her wishes , tucking their bandanas into their pants pockets before entering .
Back in California , Wilmsmeyer ran customer service for a dot - com firm and dabbled with stand - up comedy in the evenings .
Her sense of humour is her biggest weapon .
When some bikers sporting gang patches stopped by in May , they complained about Rule No. 1 .
" You can either turn that inside out , " Wilmsmeyer said , disappearing behind the bar and returning with a fuchsia - coloured T - shirt , " or you can wear this . "
They chuckled and changed .
Police cooperate , too .
When officers come by on breaks , she asks if they could park down the street .
" No one is going to come in here if three cop cars are parked outside . "
Before moving to Toronto , Wilmsmeyer had no ties to the city .
She and her then husband were visiting and fell in love with the clean streets and friendly people .
At the time , the L.A. housing market was booming and the loonie was at 63 cents .
They were able to buy a house near the restaurant outright .
" It actually belonged to a crackhead with five kids .
Her advice to me was get pregnant , get a divorce and start collecting the government cheques . "
SGT .
JAMES HOGAN pedals south down Trethewey Dr. and hangs a left on Eglinton .
It 's the first week TAVIS is on the streets and he is still getting to know the area 's nooks and crannies .
" The way I like to think of it is , TAVIS is kind of like having surgery .
You go in and the doctors fix the problem .
Now that you 're better , you may have to change certain behaviour to stay healthy . "
Officers flood troubled areas , weed out the bad apples , persuade residents to trust police and then leave locals to essentially watch out for themselves .

The initiative has proven so successful it 's being studied across the world .
It has already been adopted by more than a dozen forces in Ontario .
Paradoxically , the problems the Keele and Eglinton area is now facing may have been caused by the unit 's success .
Crackdowns in neighbouring divisions over the past few years have pushed dealers into the area .
Keele and Eglinton already possessed the necessary ingredients for a burgeoning drug trade – including high unemployment and low education levels .
Police believe the global recession then stoked the flames .
More dealers were fighting for fewer buyers and dwindling turf .
By spring , police intelligence showed a spike in drug dealers .
" Most of these people are n't even from here , " says a frustrated local BIA chairman Steve Tasses , standing behind the counter of Variety and Video , a shop he 's run for 25 years just three storefronts from Keele and Eglinton .
" We just have to be ready for when they leave . "
In 2006 , the BIA purchased 22 custom lampposts to illuminate the sidewalks and 40 trees .
Mosaic sidewalks were reconstructed .
The streets were lined with fresh flowers in summer .
The BIA recently got the go - ahead to hire a community development coordinator , Mark Fernandez , who has been listening to residents ' concerns and signing up volunteers .
Last month , Fernandez met 23 - year - old Manuela Carreiro in a local park .
The single mother , who lives nearby , offered to help .
At a recent barbecue to launch the TAVIS initiative , Carreiro and her sister ran a face - painting booth for kids .
" I worry for my son sometimes , living up here , " she says , " so anything I can do to help . "
Councillor Frank Di Giorgio says landlords are having trouble finding solid business tenants , so they 're more likely to accept seedy tenants , such as booze cans .
" Property owners need to take more responsibility , there 's no question , but so many really good things are happening there too , " Di Giorgio says .
But no matter how much they accomplish , Tasses knows one shooting can unravel it all .
" Whatever we do ... if there 's a shooting or a stabbing and it makes the newspaper , it sets us back and we have to start all over again . "
WILMSMEYER knows all about starting over .
Z Bar initially launched as an Italian - style pizza and burger joint , but Wilmsmeyer soon realized that was n't going to work .
" There just was n't the call for goat cheese , sun -dried tomatoes , gourmet pizza up here , " she said wryly .
One night , she rented the place to a group of locals .
A Caribbean chef served jerk chicken and pork to a packed house .
He never left .
Even with the makeover , Wilmsmeyer is barely keeping afloat .
Between the recession and escalating violence , it 's hard to get people to come north of St. Clair for a pint .
Business at her tattoo parlour next door is just starting to pick up .
" You know , it 's funny , " she says , waving goodbye to a customer .
" I really think here is one of the friendliest parts of Toronto .
You go to Bloor ( St. ) or Mt. Pleasant ( Ave. ) , there 's not that vibe .
There is something really good here .
And I wo n't be defeated . "
Even though Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 is mere months away , developer Infinity Ward continues to support the first Modern Warfare title .
Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare was released in 2007 , to critical acclaim and massive worldwide sales .
But it was n’t without its share of problems .
Case in point , Community Moderator thebigb82 has announced on the Infinity Ward forums that Sony Computer Entertainment of America ( SCEA ) has released Patch 1.40 for the PS3 version of Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare .
You will be able to download the patch when you get in the game , and it will address things like glitching and modding in order to give the community a fair playing environment in which to partake in .
And also please note that European users of the title have not yet received the patch , and Infinity Ward will most likely announce when that will hit as well .

As President Barack Obama heads to Moscow in an attempt to bury the lingering legacy of the Cold War , Rupert Wingfied - Hayes tries to judge the mood of Russia 's leaders behind the Kremlin 's walls .
Russian horse flies are huge and carnivorous .
I know this from the personal experience of being eaten alive by them while trudging through a forest in western Russia this week .
While the US put most of its nukes on submarines and hid them in the oceans , Russia hid its massive arsenal in its trackless forests
The real monsters are as big as a cockroach and can bite you through your shirt .
It is very unpleasant .
Why was I not better prepared ?
Why had I left the tin of extra strong insect repellent on my desk in Moscow ?
Good questions .
But more important is why I was there in the first place .
The answer is that I was looking for a nuclear missile base .
Well , actually a disused nuclear missile base .
Scattered through the forests of Russia and Ukraine , and as far away as the Kazakh steppe , is a vast network of ruins , testament to the once huge size of the Soviet war machine .
While the US put most of its nukes on submarines and hid them in the oceans , Russia hid its massive arsenal in its trackless forests .
Now armed only with a grimy satellite image from the internet I was trying to find the place where one part of it was kept .
Eventually after walking for what seemed like hours , exhausted and covered in bites , we found it .
Nuclear arsenal
The reality was rather a disappointment .
A collection of broken concrete buildings , half demolished .
Ransacked by locals for window glass and bricks .
The legacy of the Cold War can still be found in the Russian countryside
It was hard to imagine that this was once a top secret facility , ready to deliver death on a massive scale .
Even the missile silos were a disappointment , stagnant concrete pools with old oil drums floating around in them .
The huge , metre - thick concrete lids had been cast aside like old pieces of rubbish .
" If we 'd come here 20 years ago , we 'd have been locked up as spies , " one of my colleagues quipped .
And of course he was right .
It suddenly struck me just how far the world has come since the bad old days of the Cold War .
A huge part of that is because of a treaty called Start I .
By the end of the 1980s Russia and America had amassed nuclear arsenals of an astonishing size - 60,0000 warheads , enough to blow the world up many times over .
But then , in 1991 , the two countries signed a truly historic deal that would slash their stockpiles by 80 % .
The ruins all around me in the forest were the result .
But since then , despite many attempts , no new deal to cut nuclear weapons further has ever been put in to effect .
Russia and the United States still have around 23,000 nuclear warheads , still more than enough to destroy the planet .
Challenging task
One reason is a lack of will , but the main one is a lack of trust .
This week , as he prepared to welcome Barack Obama to Moscow , Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev said relations between the two countries have sunk nearly as low as they were during the Cold War .
Negotiating nuclear disarmament is likely to be a lengthy process
This is the hill that President Obama has set himself the task of climbing .
In April , in Prague , the US president set out his vision for a world free of nuclear weapons .
To get there , the two countries that possess 96 % of all the nuclear weapons in the world will have to start by cutting their own arsenals .
That will be impossible unless America and Russia can learn to trust each other again .
' Anti-American ' feelings I went to a party at the US embassy in Moscow this week .
It was the annual Independence Day bash .
Will Presidents Obama and Medvedev be successful in rebuilding trust ?
Everyone who is anyone in Moscow society was there , Gary Kasparov the former chess grand master , actors , writers , business leaders , politicians .
But try as I might , I could not spot a single member of the current Kremlin leadership , big or small .
It is a far cry from the days when President Boris Yeltsin used to turn up in person to toast his American friends .
Since the election of Barack Obama there has been a dramatic change , at least in the rhetoric .
In her first meeting with the Russian foreign minister , Hilary Clinton famously pressed a big red button symbolically resetting the relationship .
President Obama 's visit will put the seal on this rapprochement .
But as I stood in the garden of the US ambassador 's palatial mansion , I heard a very different view .
It came from a former journalist who has watched US - Russia relations for two decades .
" The current Kremlin leadership is deeply anti-American , " he told me .
" For the last eight years they have been able to hide that fact by pretending it is really George W Bush that they did not like .
" Now they have to face an American president who is genuinely popular around the world .
" He terrifies them , " he said , " and they still have n't figured out what they are going to do . "

More than half of Americans agree that marijuana is safer than alcohol .
Rassmussen Reports has the details here :
51 % Rate Alcohol More Dangerous Than Marijuana
via Rasmussen Reports
Fifty - one percent ( 51 % ) of American adults say alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana , according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey .
Just 19 % disagree and say pot is worse .
But 25 % say both are equally dangerous .
Just two percent ( 2 % ) say neither is dangerous .
Younger adults are more likely than their elders to view alcohol as the more dangerous of the two .
Fifty - three percent ( 53 % ) of women say alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana , compared to 48 % of men .
Men by a two - to - one margin over women say pot is riskier , but women are more inclined to say both are dangerous .
Unmarried adults are more critical of alcohol than those who are married .
Those with children at home think alcohol is more dangerous than those without kids living with them .
I 've decided to go back to vi mode with my shell .
Of course , by default , BASH , ZSH and others use emacs mode for the keyboard bindings .
This is fine for the generic case , but if I 'm using Vim for my default editor , it makes sense to use the Vi keyboard bindings in my shell as well .
However , I have an extremely dynamic shell , so if I 'm going to start using Vi mode , I better have my shell tell me when I 'm in command mode or insert mode .
On Vim , the default mode is command mode , and when you go into a different mode , you 're notified , such as going into insert mode .
However , with the ZSH , when you start up your prompt , you are in insert mode by default , and you must press your ESC key to go into command mode .
So , seeing as though insert mode is default , rather than be notified constantly that I 'm in insert mode , I 'd rather be notified when I enter command mode .
Also , I wanted a way to do this dynamically , so when I pressed my ESC key , I got an immediate visual that I entered command mode .
The same event should happen when I go back into insert mode - my visual should disappear .
I was n't sure how to approach this , so after a bit of Googling , I discovered that I need to write a ZSH widget .
I 've never written a ZSH widget before .
In fact , to be honest , I did n't even know they existed .
However , I was curious , and learned that I need to use the 'zle - N ' command on a widget .
By doing so , this widget will operate on the shell in real time , without waiting for the enter key to be pressed .
This is exactly what I 'm after .
So , the only thing left to do was write a bit of logic handling when I 'm in command mode , and when I 'm not .
Here 's the relevant bit of code :

# If I am using vi keys , I want to know what mode I 'm currently using .
# zle - keymap - select is executed every time KEYMAP changes .
# From http://zshwiki.org/home/examples/zlewidgets
function zle - keymap - select {
VIMODE = " $ {$ {KEYMAP/vicmd/ M:command} /( main|viins ) / } "
zle reset - prompt
}
zle -N zle - keymap - select
Fairly straight forward I think .
If the KEYMAP variable is set to " vicmd " , then we 're in command mode with vi on the shell , and we can set our VIMODE variable to " M:command " ( to match the rest of my prompt ) .
If the KEYMAP variable is set to " main " or " viins " , then we can unset VIMODE .
The way we do this is using inline ZSH substitution using $ {VARIABLE / PATTERN} syntax .
This says to search for our pattern anywhere within our variable .
Check out the zshexpn ( 1 ) man page for more info and examples .
Notice I 'm running ' zle reset - prompt ' .
Because this is a widget , I can take advantage of redrawing the prompt whenever I need .
Now , the only thing left to do is put the $ VIMODE variable in my prompt , and I 'll have a dynamic visual of when I enter command mode and when I leave it .
Here 's some screenshot candy :
For the need - to - have - it readers , here 's the full source to my prompt .
Just source the file in your .zshrc , and make sure that your TERM variable is set appropriately to handle terminal colors .

* China could consider IMF ’s sale of 403 tonnes of gold
* China looking to diversify , has 1,054 tonnes already
* Market value of IMF sale around $ 13 billion ( Adds comments of central bank officials , paragraphs 7 - 15 )
BEIJING , Sept 21 ( Reuters ) - China is considering buying gold being offered for sale by the International Monetary Fund , Market News International said on Monday , citing two unnamed government sources , but the report could not immediately be confirmed .
“ China will consider buying if the price is right and the return is relatively high , ” MNI quoted one of the government sources as saying .
Gold XAU= , which had dipped just below $ 1,000 an ounce , rebounded to $ 1,003.45 after the report .
That would put the market value of the 403.3 tonnes on offer from the IMF at close to $ 13 billion .
“ There was a small reaction to the news that China may discuss its gold plans at the G20 , it recovered a little , but overall the market is n’t overly concerned , not yet anyway , ” a Europe - based trader said .
China , the world ’s biggest producer and buyer of gold , revealed earlier this year that it had lifted its own stocks of gold to 1,054 tonnes from 400 tonnes when it last reported its holdings in 2003 .
The IMF formally endorsed a plan on Friday to sell 403.3 tonnes of gold , one eighth of its holdings , to central banks or in the gold market .
[ ID :nN18272627 ]
Two Chinese central bank officials not directly involved in the issue told Reuters China should consider buying the gold being put up for sale by the IMF , but only at a big discount .
The officials , neither of whom had direct knowledge of the gold strategy , said they were expressing personal opinions .
“ China only has about 1,000 tonnes of gold reserves and the investments in other assets are performing not very well , ” said one official , who declined to be named .
“ I think we should build up more gold with foreign reserves , but when to buy is the key .
It ’s a good idea if China can buy the gold from IMF at prices well below market level . ”
The official said he had no idea if the sale would be on the agenda for the G20 summit .
“ I personally think China should buy the IMF gold .
It will help China to diversify its reserve assets , ” the second official said .
“ For the purpose of reserve safety , it is also good to increase the proportion of gold by a suitable amount . ”
The estimated $ 13 billion cost of the is small beer for the Chinese exchequer , with foreign exchange reserves of more than $ 2 trillion .
If it decided to buy the gold , China would be likely to seek a discount for the bulk purchase , since a market sale would put heavy pressure on the price .
The IMF has said it will try to sell the gold , one - eighth of its holdings , to central banks .
If there are no takers , it could sell to the market , which saw world gold demand of 3,880 tonnes last year , according to World Gold Council figures .
The huge increase in reserves that China announced earlier this year had had little impact on the market because the gold was accumulated over a long period and mainly through direct purchases from Chinese producers .

The archaeological excavations at the royal palace in the ancient city of Qatna , north east of the Syrian city of Homs , have once again unfolded a remarkable archaeological discovery .
The summer excavations , due to end September 25 , located a rock tomb - cellar underneath the palace containing hundreds of artifacts as well as human bones from the period 1600 - 1400 BC .
In 2002 , excavations at this site found a tomb with accessibility from the central palace rooms .
The present excavation , led by the German - Syrian team of Dr. Michel al - Maqdissi , Director of Excavations at the Directorate General of Antiquities in Damascus , and Professor Dr. Peter Pfälzner from the University of Tübingen , brings to light the existence of an unexpected second underground tomb - cellar .
Heike Dohmann - Pfälzner is the excavation coordinator on site .
The Institute for Ancient Near Eastern Studies ( IANES ) in Tübingen spearheads the excavations which have been in existence for the last eleven years in cooperation with the Syrian Directorate General of Antiquities .
The archaeologists made their discovery during excavations of the north - west wing of the palace .
They located a “ slope basement ” below ground floor level , its walls almost completely intact .
A chamber bearing a collapsed timber roof , acting as an antechamber to the tomb - cellar , exists beneath the basement .
A stone rock - cut leads from here into the spacious cellar itself .
It is 4.90 by 6.30 metres large and is divided into two chambers by a wall hollowed out of the rock .
The cellar is accessible from the palace and is integrated architecturally into its whole structure .
Its use can be verified back to the later period of the palace in 1400 BC .
A huge number of clearly visible human bones has been found in the tomb - cellar .
The discovery of 30 skulls suggests at least the same amount of burials .
The fact that the bones are stacked in groups rather than lying in anatomical formation is significant here .
Particles of wood found suggest that at least some of them were placed in wooden crates or coffins indicating a secondary burial .
The amount of bones found is immense and significantly surpasses the findings of 2002 .
Their condition is good under the circumstances .
The anthropologists Dr. Carsten Witzel and Dr. Stefan Flohr from the University of Hildesheim are carrying out an intricate examination of these human remains on site .
Numerous vessels of ceramic and granite have been found .
The latter are Egyptian imports whose production in the Old Egyptian Kingdom dates to a period 1000 years prior to the existence of the tomb .
Furthermore , the archaeologists discovered alabaster vessels which might also stem from Egypt .
In one of these a collection of gold jewelry was found consisting of rings , rosettes and gold foils .
In other parts of the tomb , chased gold foils possibly used for textile or furniture decorative purposes have been uncovered .
Notable among the bronze artifacts is a heavy spearhead and a dress pin .
A further finely crafted dress pin made from gold , a cylinder seal made from lapis lazuli as well as a seal in the shape of a scarab complement the inventory of artifacts found .
Of particular interest due to its fine craftsmanship and beauty is a stone sculpture of a monkey holding a vessel used to hold facial paint .
Of great interest from the perspective of art history is the discovery of an ivory human statuette with a very finely carved face .
The identification of those buried in the tomb - cellar is now the task facing researchers , but the lack of inscriptions makes this difficult .
Most probably the remains stem from members of the royal family or royal household of Qatna .
However it is also possible that the remains originate from earlier royal burials placed in the cellar at a later point of time .
Qatna was one of the most important kingships during Syria ’s middle and late Bronze Age .
It reached the height of its prosperity between 1800 and 1600 BC and was among one of the most powerful states in the Orient .
The royal dynasty continued until its destruction by the Hittites in 1340 BC .
The recent excavations give us a wealth of new information about the death cult of the kingship of Qatna , its artistic excellence and its relationships to other Old Orient powers 3500 years ago .
In the next branch of Haskell Platform we ’ll be adding and removing packages from the specification for the first time .
The Haskell Platform steering committee will make recommendations for additions and removals based on individual proposals to add and remove packages from the list .
It is hard to come up with “ notability ” criteria for why a package should be added or removed .
There are many competiting reasons why people use the Haskell Platform , and what packages they need .
The goal though should be an almost fully automated criteria for determining when a package should be added , based on objective data .
Then , combined with strategic and other concerns , packages will be added or , sometimes , removed .
Possible Criteria for Notability
A quick list of possible criteria by which to evaluate whether a package is “ blessed ” :
How popular is the package in Hackage downloads ?
How many packages depend on it ?
Do any applications of note depend on it ?
Does it meet a stated end - user need ?
Do similar systems include such a library ( e.g. Python ) ?
Is it portable ?
Does it add additional C libraries ?
Does it follow the package versioning system ?
Is the code of good quality ?
Does it have a good development history ?
Is it on hackage ?
Does it provide haddock documentation ?
Does it come with examples ?
Does it have a test suite ?
Does it have a maintainer ?
Does it in turn require new Haskell dependencies ?
Does it have a simple / configure - based Cabal build ?
Does it conflict / compete with existing functionality ?
Does it reuse existing types ?
Does it follow the hierarchical naming conventions ?
Is it - Wall clean ?
Have declared correctness or performance statements ?
Is it BSD licensed ?
Is it thread - safe ?
A Point System
One way of determining notability for a package would be to use a points system against an agreed - upon set of such criteria .
Does anyone know of similar examples , or would like to code up some programs to experiment with these ratings ?
Distro Page Rank
Another source of raw data may well be a sort of “ Page Rank ” across unix distros for how often a package is used .
On the Arch Linux distribution , we have 3 level support for Haskell .
In the core system some Haskell apps and tools are provided in binary form .
In the “ community ” binary repo there are yet more packages .
Finally , in the user - contributed repository are around 1300 other packages ( ~90 % of Hackage ) .
Does your distro have popularity statistics ?
Could you determine the top 100 Haskell package by vote ?
Most Popular Packages in Arch Linux
Some users install packages with the ‘ yaourt ’ tool , and some of those users opt in to voting when they install .
Here ’s the top 100 packages sorted by votes in Arch Linux , with those that are in the Haskell Platform already , indicated :
Now , one of the other constraints on the Haskell Platform is sustainable growth .
We ca n’t add 1000 packages tomorrow and hope to maintain quality .
Instead , something like 10 - 20 % growth per release cycle seems plausible .
This would mean adding 4 to 9 new packages .
If we were to judge only on download popularity , the 10 new packages would be :
Now , one of the other constraints on the Haskell Platform is sustainable growth .
We ca n’t add 1000 packages tomorrow and hope to maintain quality .
Instead , something like 10 - 20 % growth per release cycle seems plausible .
This would mean adding 4 to 9 new packages .
If we were to judge only on download popularity , our first 5 new packages would be :
Merely because one killer app , darcs , depends on them , and so they are widely built ( they may also fail to satisfy many of the other critieria noted above ) .
If we ignore those packages popular for being dependencies , we get a different top 5 :
Now we ’re getting there .
pandoc is both a library and a popular app , so we might treat it specially .
gtk2hs is very popular , but not cabalised , so we might also set that aside , leaving ( and I ’ll ignore ghc - paths as it is used by ghc ) :
Which is starting to look like a plausible list .
In turn however , you can find fault with all these packages in various dimensions ( utf8 - string may be obsoleted by Data .
Text , haxml is LGPL licensed ) .
Coming up with an obvious list is non-trivial !
Finally , this is clearly only one very small data set , which should only have a small influence .
If we step over an look at the Hackage download statistics , sorted by popularity , our top 5 new packages would be :
Popularity by Category
If instead we thought that having a comprehensive library set was the key goal , we may choose to include libraries via category , no matter how popular in the global list .
This would yield , according to Hackage ,
For example .
What Is The Decision Model ?
So how do we decide what goes in ?
One model would be :
Have people propose packages
Sort them by category need Identify the top rank package in each category using a points system or page rank Add or remove packages based on this ?
What do you think ?
What is a good way to decide when a package is sufficiently notable to add to the Haskell Platform ?
What critieria would you use to determine when a package is blessed ?
Barack Obama is close to brokering an Israeli - Palestinian deal that will allow him to announce a resumption of the long - stalled Middle East peace talks before the end of next month , according to US , Israeli , Palestinian and European officials .
Key to bringing Israel on board is a promise by the US to adopt a much tougher line with Iran over its alleged nuclear weapons programme .
The US , along with Britain and France , is planning to push the United Nations security council to expand sanctions to include Iran 's oil and gas industry , a move that could cripple its economy .
In return , the Israeli government will be expected to agree to a partial freeze on the construction of settlements in the Middle East .
In the words of one official close to the negotiations : " The message is : Iran is an existential threat to Israel ; settlements are not . "
Details of the breakthrough deal will be hammered out tomorrow in London , where the Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , is due to hold talks with the US special envoy , George Mitchell .
Netanyahu met Gordon Brown today in Downing Street , where the two discussed both settlements and the Iranian nuclear programme .
Although the negotiations are being held in private , they have reached such an advanced stage that both France and Russia have approached the US offering to host a peace conference .
Obama has pencilled in the announcement of his breakthrough for either a meeting of world leaders at the UN general assembly in New York in the week beginning 23 September or the G20 summit in Pittsburgh on 24 - 25 September .
The president , who plans to make his announcement flanked by Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas – plus the leaders of as many Arab states as he can muster – hopes that a final peace agreement can be negotiated within two years , a timetable viewed as unrealistic by Middle East analysts .
Obama had hoped to unveil his plans before the start of Ramadan last weekend but failed to complete the deal with the Israelis or the Arab states in time .
As well as a tougher US approach to Iran , which the Israelis see as their top priority , the deal would see Israel offering a temporary and partial moratorium on the expansion of settlements on the West Bank in return for moves by Arab states towards normalisation of relations .
This would allow Obama to announce talks on the bigger Israeli - Palestinian issues – borders , the future of Jerusalem and the future of Palestinian refugees – with the US sitting in as a mediator .
After the meeting at No 10 today , Netanyahu said he was hopeful that a compromise would be reached to allow the peace process to restart while Israeli settlers could " continue living normal lives " .
Brown said he emerged from the talks more optimistic about Middle East peace .
He also pledged that if there were no immediate progress on the Iranian nuclear impasse , further sanctions would be " a matter of priority " .
Although Netanyahu told his cabinet before leaving Israel that the deal would not be sealed in London tomorrow , he and Mitchell are now down to the fine detail .
Israel is offering a nine - to 12 - month moratorium on settlement building that would exclude East Jerusalem and most of the 2,400 homes that Israel says work has already begun on .
Ian Kelly , a US state department spokesman , on Monday reflected the increasing optimism within the Obama administration , saying " we 're getting closer to laying this foundation " for the resumption of talks .
Another official closely involved in the discussions said : " It has been pretty hard going but we are getting there .
We are closer to a deal with the Israelis than many think .
The Arabs are more difficult to pin down . "
If Iran does not respond to UN demands that it stop enriching uranium by time of the UN and G20 summits , the US , Britain and France are to lead a UN security council push to expand sanctions , expected to target Iran 's dependence on imports of refined petroleum products and its reliance on foreign technology to develop its oil and gas industry .
Russia and China are expected to object to such punitive measures , and any western attempt to enforce a partial embargo threatens to breach the broad international consensus on handling Iran .
A report on the Iranian programme by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , due to be published by the end of this week , will be crucial in setting the scene for such sanctions , and the outgoing IAEA director general , Mohamed ElBaradei , has come under intense western pressure to make the report sharply critical of Tehran .
Israel , in return for a deal on settlements , is seeking not only a tougher line over Iran but normalisation of relations with Arab states , such as overflight rights for its airline El Al , establishment of trade offices and embassies , and an end to the ban on travellers with Israeli stamps in their passports .
Bahrain , Qatar , the United Arab Emirates and Morocco have so far tentatively agreed .
Saudi Arabia has refused , saying Israel has had enough concessions .
But the US is taking comfort from the fact that , crucially , Saudi Arabia has not tried to block other Arab states from signing up .
" They may come on board last , but they will come on board , " a European official said .
A coalition of Arab states , thought to include the Saudis , has been in secret contact with Israel to discuss what they see as a common threat posed by Iran .
JACKSON , Georgia ( CNN ) --
" I gave up smoking , women and drinkin ' last night , " the singer shouts , " and it was the worst 15 minutes of mah life ! "
The Rev. Joe Hunter hears all types of stories from drivers at his truck stop chapel .
more photos »
The music blaring from the radio tonight is country .
The dessert special is peach cobbler .
And the customers are wide - bodied truck drivers , lumbering into a Georgia truck stop at suppertime .
But another group of truckers nearby is singing a new song .
They amble into a truck stop trailer adorned with pictures of Jesus and sing the hymn " O Happy Day " in wobbly bass voices .
" I 've been back and forth between God and Satan over the years , " trucker Harold " Jumper " McBride says as he stands to share his story .
" It was a rough life , but I finally found that saving grace to make life a whole lot better . "
It 's the Wednesday night service at " Chaplain Joe 's " truck stop chapel service .
The chaplain himself , a lanky , bearded man with tan cowboy boots , sits in the back of his narrow chapel , saying the loudest amens .
For 28 years , the Rev. Joe Hunter has been a chaplain to the truckers .
Though most ministers preach to people in the pews , he takes God to people on the go .
He reaches out to truckers at fuel stops , in parking lots , on the CB and through a radio show called " Heaven 's Road . "
He hears all sorts of stories : tales of loneliness , thoughts of suicide , struggles with guilt .
A Vietnam veteran , he 's even lived a little of what he 's heard .
Yet Hunter says most truckers reaffirm his faith in human nature .
" Every snowflake is different , and God created us that way to be unique , " he says .
" I 've learned to appreciate the goodness of people .
I believe there 's some good in everybody , and I love to try to find it . "
Watch as Hunter explains truckers ' need for a place of worship »
' Last American cowboys '
Trucking is n't simply Hunter 's ministry .
It was his first love .
He started working at a truck stop at 16 years old and drove a truck for 20 years .
" America moves by trucks , " he says .
" Without trucks , America stops . "
Hunter 's Truckstop Ministries Inc. works like a spiritual gas station .
He prays with truckers , coaxes them to make tough decisions and hands out taped sermons that fortify them on lengthy business trips .
" The greatest thing about being a truck driver is that you have a lot of time to think , " Hunter says .
" The horrible thing about being a truck driver is that you have a lot of time to think . "
There 's plenty of time to do ill as well .
Drug dealers , prostitutes , runaways -- they all hover around some truck stops , Hunter and drivers say .
" People being away from home -- a lot of people think they 're just free to do whatever they want , " McBride says .
McBride can spend up to four weeks away from the Florida home he shares his wife , Kathy .
" Lonesome .
I miss home a lot , " he says when asked to describe life on the road .
Despite the trucker 's grind , those at Hunter 's chapel talk about their profession with pride .
" I call truckers the last American cowboys , " says Robert Ryan , president of the Atlanta Travel Center truck stop in Jackson , Georgia , home of Hunter 's main chapel .
" They 're pretty much out there on their own , " Ryan says .
" They 're doing their own thing .
They 're good people . "
And , like cowboys , Hunter says , truckers have a " yearning to wander . "
" You leave Florida in the winter , headed for Detroit , " Hunter says .
" When you leave , you 're in short sleeves .
When you get in Detroit , you 're surrounded by ice .
It 's like life is on fast - forward . "
Service inside the truckers ' chapel
Truckers looking for relief from their wanderlust can spot Hunter 's chapel from the highway at night .
A neon red cross is perched above the chapel like a beacon .
See photos of the truckers ' chapel »
The tiny chapel 's walls are plastered with scenes of Jesus ' crucifixion .
Paperback Bibles and pamphlets urging conversion are scattered about the seats .
The service begins with prayer , then hymns and a short sermon .
No collection plate is passed .
The truckers linger afterward and talk about a painting hanging on the chapel 's back wall .
The painting , entitled " In His Hands , " depicts a truck about to slide off an icy ledge .
The truck is yanked back to safety by God 's hands .
McBride , the Florida trucker , glances at it and smiles .
He says he was once hauling a load of 55 - gallon drums of orange concentrate down an unfamiliar mountain road when he hit an s - shaped curve and lost control .
Yet somehow , he did n't crash .
" Somebody told me I was on nine tires , " McBride says .
He motions to the painting .
" That hand is probably the only thing that kept me on the road , " he says .
The conversation turns to preaching .
Gene Smith , another trucker , talks about filling up on taped sermons while driving .
" As long as you tune in to God , you 're a lot happier , " Smith says .
" I 'm living heaven on Earth .
Everything is going perfect .
I 've been connected to God since I was 5 years old . "
Hunter 's journey : from Vietnam to the road
Hunter 's connection to God did n't come as easy , he says .
He was born in rural Georgia , and his father died when he was 3 years old .
He dropped out of school at 14 and was drafted five years later to go to Vietnam .
Hunter became a trucker four days after returning from Vietnam .
He slipped into drinking and drugs , and " Satan blessed me for a while . "
Then , one Sunday night , he stumbled into a tiny Baptist church service in rural Georgia .
The preacher seemed to know all of his secret sins , Hunter says .
" I thought somebody told him that I was coming , " Hunter says .
" He read my mail , boy . "
Hunter became a Christian that night .
He returned home and told his wife , Jan , that she was going to be saved .
They 've been married now for 42 years and have two children and 10 grandchildren .
Hunter calls Jan his partner in ministry .
God had more plans for him , though , Hunter says .
While trucking , he grew frustrated because he could rarely find a church to attend when he was on the road .
" Most churches can't park 18 - wheelers , " he says .
Hunter decided to take church to the truckers .
He established his first Bible study in 1981 at an Atlanta truck stop .
He says he now has offices at 74 truck stops in 29 states , with at least 500 chaplains working with him .
Many of his chaplains are volunteers recruited from local churches .
" God is good , " he says .
" I 'm in awe every day of what he 's allowed me to do . "
Hunter now has a national reputation .
Scott Weidner , president of Transport for Christ , a 58 - year - old company that provides mobile chapels to truck stops in North America , knows Hunter .
He and Hunter oversee arguably the two largest groups for trucker chaplains in the nation .
" He 's a former trucker , so he relates very well to truckers , " Weidner says .
" He 's got a heart for the Lord , for the lost and for truckers . "
Churches heard of Hunter 's talents as well .
Once , leaders from one church asked him to be their pastor .
Hunter refused .
He says he 's no longer driven by that " yearning to wander . "
He 's found his home .
" I would n't trade places with anybody , " he says outside his chapel .
" I love what I 'm doing .
I 'm where I 'm supposed to be . "

In a flat , piney river valley deep in the Alaska interior , the village of Takotna is marked by a dozen or so houses , a shop , a tiny post office and a school .
Intrepid gold miners ventured here decades ago .
A small tribe of Athabascan Indians has hunted and fished the woods and riverbanks for generations .
This summer Takotna , population somewhere between 46 and 61 , has become one of the best - known villages in Alaska -- thanks to the $ 18.7 - million airstrip the federal government is funding on the edge of town .
The 3,300 - foot gravel runway , complete with night lighting , will replace the short one on a wind - swept hill where several planes have crashed .
The cost of keeping rural Alaska afloat has been one of the state ’s most enduring challenges .
Now a place that sees itself as the nation ’s last frontier , where countless communities depend on bush planes and boats for their food and fuel deliveries , is having to support its outposts in an age of cable television , cellphone networks and the Internet .
And in an era of dwindling public revenue , even Alaskans increasingly wonder how much they can afford to support those who choose to live miles from civilization .
Advertisement
“ For decades , Alaskans have numbed themselves to the shock and oddity of the state and federal expenditures that fall all around us .
The latest example is . . . a new airfield for the tiny community of Takotna .
Why does this sort of expenditure occur ? ” the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner asked in a recent editorial .
According to the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska , about $ 1.4 billion a year in state and federal government subsidies , purchases and wages goes to more than 200 far - flung villages in the state -- from the frigid Arctic coastal plain to the soggy , impenetrable tundra of the deep Alaskan interior .
Federal dollars help pay for airline service and mail delivery , subsidize electricity rates and fund health clinics , among other things .
This year , more than $ 42 million of President Obama ’s federal stimulus package has been earmarked to supply plumbing for remote Alaskan villages that still use portable toilets and haul water in by the barrel .
And $ 70 million will go to rural airport improvements -- not including Takotna ’s , which is being funded under a separate government grant .
Advertisement
A year ago , the infamous $ 398 - million “ Bridge to Nowhere ” federal earmark dogged former Gov. Sarah Palin ’s Republican vice presidential bid .
But no Alaska governor has been able to turn down the federal dole .
To do so would be to isolate thousands of citizens so poor they ca n’t afford to move to the cities .
The federal Office of Management and Budget , in a 2004 review , noted that 70 % of the residents in 54 remote Alaskan villages were unemployed , and 70 % of those in 128 villages made less than $ 14,800 a year .
“ The public health conditions of the developing Third World are still a reality up here , ” said a recent report by the inspector general for the Denali Commission , which brokers federal aid to the Alaskan bush .
The state , the report added , needs better barometers to determine which “ micro- settlements ” such as Takotna should qualify for public aid .
“ While national lore may abstractly decry construction to ‘ nowhere , ’ the choices are very real , and very serious , for rural families that must go without what most of America takes for granted , ” the inspector general ’s report said .

Takotna ’s new landing strip has been dubbed an “ airport to nowhere ” -- although residents who have had to wait hours or even days for medical evacuations or supplies disagree .
“ If there ’s a medical emergency , you basically just have to wait for daylight , ” said the village administrator , Terry Huffman .
“ The state has refused to put lights on [ the old ] runway .
They say it ’s just too dangerous . ”
Takotna is 300 miles west of Fairbanks and 18 miles from the tiny town of McGrath , which has a long , lighted runway -- part of a network built across the state by the federal government during the Cold War .
But there is no road to McGrath .
Advertisement
The Air Force maintains another good runway 10 miles from Takotna , at a military radar site called Tatalina .
But because of security concerns , locals are able only about twice a year to get permission to drive out and use it .
Takotna residents -- nobody agrees on exactly how many there are , and some live here only during the summer -- fly in and out via the old 1,700 - foot - long strip on small , four - seat bush planes from McGrath .
Major supplies , including fuel for home heating and the village ’s power plant , are brought in by barge .
But that only works when the Takotna River is high enough .
Advertisement
Last fall it was n’t , and the town had to race against the onset of snow and ice to haul the fuel in by truck from 33 miles up the river .
The last of three loads was flown into Tatalina .
The delivery pushed the fuel cost to $ 6.74 a gallon .
“ I ended up hauling that fuel with a foot of snow on the ground .
. . .
We had to put tarps over the truck and put heaters underneath it just to get it started , ” said Dick Newton , 78 , who moved to Takotna in 1976 to operate a hotel and cafe for miners .
“ But we were in an emergency .
That fuel was for the power plant and for home heating .
You lose that power plant , and there goes everything , ” he said .
Local , state and federal officials all agree a new runway has been badly needed in Takotna .
Advertisement
Several planes have crashed in recent years on the existing dirt strip , which in the winter turns into an icy slide , bordered by tall trees and steep drops .
“ Sometimes they have 90 - degree crosswinds on that ridge top , ” Huffman said .
“ Now imagine [ landing ] on the ice , ” Brian Martin , a pilot for Tanana Air Service in McGrath , said as his plane plunked onto the runway one recent day .
He hit the brakes for all they were worth .
Advertisement
“ The runway ’s short , it ’s cut into the side of a hill , and the windsocks are always kind of pointing toward each other .
Plus the runway drops off at both ends , so there ’s not a lot of room for error , ” Martin said with classic bush pilot aplomb .
“ Other than that , it ’s a great runway . ”
Not long ago , a young boy in the village died of pneumonia when he could n’t be flown out for treatment .
“ When you get somebody that ’s got to be flown out of here at night , ” Newton said , “ we got these flares . . . and as soon as the airplane ’s in sight , then two snow machines start running down each side , trying to outline the strip .
. . .
We ’ve done that maybe a dozen times . ”
Huffman added : “ The air ambulances wo n’t come here even in daylight .
It ’s not long enough for them .
They go to McGrath . ”
Advertisement
The Denali Commission , in channeling federal aid to rural Alaska , has made the determination that every village is entitled to a basic level of health and safety and some opportunity for residents to support themselves .
But for a new runway to be built in Takotna with federal funding , Federal Aviation Administration rules required a long , wide strip with lights .
“ One of our dilemmas , I guess , is that some of the most substandard airports have the lowest populations , ” said Roger Maggard , airport development manager for Alaska ’s Department of Transportation .
“ So there is a balancing act when we are trying to correct our potentially worst safety issues .
“ Our mission is to provide safe transportation , and to provide airports that are capable of 24 - hour medical evacuation for our communities . ”

Instead of providing expensive infrastructure facilities in every village , officials are looking to connect them when possible at regional hubs , said George Cannelos , federal co-chairman for the Denali Commission .
For example , in Toksook Bay , a western village of about 500 , the commission helped build a clinic that serves half a dozen nearby villages , along with a hybrid wind - diesel project with power lines extending to outlying settlements .
The commission ’s funding for rural Alaska -- only a portion of the federal dollars channeled into the bush -- is about to drop precipitously .
Four years ago the commission distributed $ 140 million ; in 2010 it expects to spend about $ 50 million .

“ Everybody should have a guarantee of access to education , public safety and basic sanitation , ” Cannelos said .
“ But after that , I think you accept some standard of risk when you live in rural communities . ”

Quadriplegic man wins legal right to to starve himself to death while watching TV
A man who became a quadriplegic after a road accident has been given the legal right to starve to death while watching TV .
A court in Perth , Western Australia , granted the suicidal wish of 49 - year - old Mr Christian Rossiter , who said he wanted to die by not eating or drinking .
Once an active sportsman who enjoyed rock climbing , former stockbroker Mr Rossiter told the Supreme Court of West Australia that his condition meant he could not even blow his nose or ' wipe the tears from my eyes . '
Suicide mission : Christian Rossiter , pictured outside the Supreme Court of West Australia in Perth , has been awarded the right to starve to death
Asking the court to be given permission to have all nutrition stopped at the nursing home where he is being cared for , he said his last wish would be for painkillers to make him drowsy and to be watching TV ' to make the time pass ' before he died .
' I want to say that the painkillers make me drowsy and I would like to be made drowsy in my final moments so the time would pass more quickly , ' he told the court , speaking through a tracheotomy tube .
' And I would like to watch Foxtel on the television to pass the time . '
Chief Justice Wayne Martin said the Brightwater Care nursing home should follow the wishes of Mr Rossiter , adding that anyone who stopped giving him nutrition and hydration through a tube to his stomach would not be criminally responsible .
The ruling sets a legal precedent in Australia , where assisting someone to take their own life is a crime punishable by life in prison in some States .
The judge added that any person providing palliative care , making his last days easier , would also not be criminally responsible .
Justice Martin said it was clear Mr Rossiter had the right to direct his treatment and nutrition and hydration ' should not be administered against his wishes . '
Mr Rossiter , who sustained his severe injuries when he was hit by a car , told the court he was of sound mind and that he wanted to die in Western Australia .
He said he had been prepared to go to Switzerland to die at the Dignitas clinic where several Britons have taken their own lives , but he understood the Swiss government could slow down his quest with lengthy procedures .
At an earlier hearing , when he pleaded to be allowed to end his suffering , he described his life as a ' living hell ' .
' I'm Christian Rossiter and I 'd like to die , ' he told reporters later .
' I am a prisoner in my own body .
I can't move .
' I have no fear of death , just pain ..
I only fear pain . '
He explained that he developed spastic quadriplegia as a result of two separate accidents when he fell 100ft from a building and was then hit by a car whilst riding his bicycle .
He did not say whether the accidents were on the same day .
' I believe quadriplegics should be allowed to exercise their freedom of choice but my choice is to die , ' he said .

When he eagerly joined the mass street protests that followed Iran ’s tainted June 12 presidential elections , Ibrahim Sharifi , 24 , hoped only to add his voice to the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators demanding that the government nullify the results .
He never imagined that he would eventually have a far greater impact , as the only person willing to speak publicly about the brutal treatment he was subjected to in prison , including rape and torture .
Mr. Sharifi , who recounted his ordeal to the opposition leader and former presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi , and then released a video account last month on opposition Web sites , is now in Turkey .
He said he fled Iran after a stranger stopped him on the street to tell him his family would be killed if he testified before a parliamentary committee that was investigating the torture and rape accusations .
“ I felt that I was not safe anymore and I could put my family ’s life in danger , too , ” he said in a series of telephone interviews , in which he spoke in detail about the protests , his imprisonment and the psychological scars he said the abuse had left .
Since he was dumped by his captors on the side of a Tehran highway , he said , he has been terrified of being alone .
First , he had trouble sleeping , fearing that the guard who raped him in prison would attack him again .
Now he is convinced he is being followed by someone who means to kill him .

Bargain - basement sale price ; Anti-trust complaints to be filed ; Dreadful history of failure by both companies
Merger causes concern among Election Integrity experts ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/3/2009 , 7:10 pm PT
The world 's largest corporate e-voting supplier is about to become even larger .
Today , TX - based Premier Election Solutions , the beleaguered and oft - failed voting division of OH - based parent company Diebold , Inc. , announced they have been purchased by oft - failed e-voting goliath Election Systems & Software , Inc. ( ES&S ) .
The move , if allowed to stand , would " consolidate most U.S. voting under one privately held manufacturer , " according to one election watchdog who has announced plans to file an anti-trust complaint concerning the sale with the Department of Justice .
Diebold , facing lost money , lost reputation , lost votes and multiple legal battles , has been trying to unload its election division for several years .
Having failed at first , the company created an " independent " entity , Premier --- same pig , damned near same lipstick --- in hopes of regaining money and reputation , if not votes .
That failed too .
But somehow , as reported today , Diebold was able to convince Nebraska - based ES&S , the nation 's largest election company and supplier of 100 % unverifiable voting systems , to agree to the purchase .
Diebold says it purchased the election division from Global Election Systems , Inc. , for $ 31 million in 2002 .
Today , Diebold announced it will sell to ES&S for just $ 5 million , plus 70 % of any cash from outstanding accounts receivable as of August 31 .
Unless they 've made special arrangements already with Diebold , the people at ES&S --- no stranger to lost votes themselves --- may quickly be saddled with a fair amount of liability from the storied past and continuing failures of Diebold products across the country .
That is , if the acquisition , which is sure to quash any such " competition " in the market which might still exist , is allowed to stand in the first place ...
Anti-trust
Shortly after today 's announcement , election watchdog organization BlackBoxVoting.org ( BBV ) announced its intentions to challenge the sale under anti-trust statutes .
BBV founder Bev Harris wrote that " An ES&S / Diebold - Premier acquisition would consolidate most U.S. voting under one privately held manufacturer .
And it 's not just the concealed vote - counting ; these companies now also produce polling place check - in software ( electronic pollbooks ) , voter registration software and vote - by - mail authentication software . "
She notes there is precedent for blocking such an acquisition in the U.S. election industry .
" ES&S attempted to consolidate the electronic voting industry in 1997 with a purchase of Business Records Corporation ( BRC ) , " Harris says , " but the purchase was blocked by the US Security and Exchange Commission on antitrust grounds , and the acquisition of BRC was split between ES&S and Sequoia Voting Systems . "
Harris noted , in an email follow - up , that the group intends to file first with the Dept. of Justice , and is " looking at options for SEC sanctions next . "
She adds that filing a complaint with the DoJ 's anti-trust division is not the same as filing a lawsuit , but that she hopes to encourage others to file similar complaints as well .
Of the four major players in the e-voting industry , ES&S already dwarfs all competitors for market share .
Diebold / Premiere is the second largest player , followed by the smaller , cash - starved Sequoia Voting Systems , and then Hart - Intercivic .
ES&S ' purchase of Diebold / Premier results in a single company , larger than all of their remaining major competitors combined , counting the majority of votes cast in the U.S. .
Undermining U.S. Elections
The deal is certain to raise further concerns among the U.S. Election Integrity community whch has , for years , been alarmed by the private take - over of public elections by unaccountable corporations , and the increasing use of secret software used to both cast and tally votes .
That takeover was accelerated in 2002 , by the passage of the federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) , which pumped some $ 4 billion dollars into local jurisdictions for so - called " upgrades " of voting systems in the wake of Florida 's 2000 Presidential Election debacle .
HAVA was a gold mine for the few private e-voting companies in the U.S. , but a disaster for U.S. elections and voters .
Last Summer , election watchdog organization VotersUnite.org 's Ellen Theisen released a report titled " Vendors are Undermining the Structure of U.S. Elections " [ PDF ] .
In the report , Theisen ( who has guest blogged at The BRAD BLOG on a number of occasions over the years ) , argued that " the structure of elections in the United States --- once reliant on local representatives accountable to the public --- has become almost wholly dependent on large corporations , which are not accountable to the public .

" If the vendors withdrew their support for elections now , " she warned , " our election structure would collapse . "
Moreover , as Theisen details in her report , " vendors exploit the local jurisdictions ' dependency by charging exorbitant fees , violating laws and ethics , exerting proprietary control over the machinery of elections , and disclaiming unaccountability . "
Over the years , ES&S has shown itself , through our own reporting at least , to be amongst the worst of all the major e-voting players when it comes to the exploitation of " local jurisdiction dependency . "
The xompany has gained a reputation for " charging exorbitant fees " and strong - arming local officials who , as Theisen argues , have allowed themselves to become wholly dependent on their products to run our public elections .
That ability to use heavy - handed tactics will undoubtedly increase , as the options become still fewer for election officials set on using private companies to help carry out their public elections .
Diebold 's Liabilities
It 's unclear at this time what , if any , of Diebold 's existing liabilities ES&S will be forced to absorb in the takeover , and whether existing lawsuits against Diebold / Premier will now be extended to the new owner .
One version of Diebold 's optical - scan voting system was recently decertified in California , after it was discovered the company 's tabulating system discarded hundreds of ballots without notice .
The company , as The BRAD BLOG reported at the time , had long been aware of the software failure in its systems .
A further investigation into the matter revealed that all versions of Diebold 's tabulation software , used in some 34 states across the nation , allow for the simple deletion of ballots without notice in the so - called " audit logs , " and that those audit logs themselves are not secure , and can be easily deleted or over - written , in violation of federal voting system standards .
The Secretary of State in California is continuing an investigation into versions of Diebold 's tabulators which have not yet been decertified , as well as those of other companies , to determine whether there remain additional problems with audit logs in the other systems as well .
Those logs have long been pointed to , by voting machine companies and e-voting supporters , as assurance that any problems or tampering could be easily discovered post-election .
Unfortunately , it 's frequently very difficult , if not impossible , for citizens , and even candidates , to review those logs --- even when they work as they are supposed to .
Diebold itself is still facing a class - action securities fraud lawsuit pertaining , in part , to its election division .
Diebold has been under SEC investigation since 2006 , a DoJ investigation since 2007 , and in 2008 , it was forced to admit having overstated earnings .
In a 2007 BRAD BLOG exclusive , we detailed what appeared to be a case of insider trading at the company , when a massive sell - off was carried out by a number of company executives , all on the same day , at a nearly - historic high for the company 's stock .
Share prices tumbled some 50 % almost immediately afterwards , when plans for the " independent " spin - off , Premier , were announced publicly .
The insiders sold at $ 53 per share , and the stock has remained in the $ 20 and $ 30 zone largely ever since .
Diebold stock closed at $ 30.69 tonight , jumping 2.2 % following today 's announcement .
ES&S : A Track Record of Failure
ES&S has faced its own history of failures .
These are just a few that we 've covered over the years ( you can peruse many more on these category pages ) :
In the Republican 2006 primary in Pottawattamie County , IA , results of several races were changed after an error in the ES&S optical - scan system was discovered , forcing a hand - count of all elections .
In the 2006 general election , ES&S touch - screen voting systems in Sarasota , Florida , managed to simply lose some 18,000 votes in a U.S. House election that was decided by just 369 .
In 2006 , polling places in eight counties in Arkansas were forced to find alternate voting systems for a scheduled runoff election when they discovered programming errors in the ES&S touch - screen machines .
In the Summer of 2007 , an investigative report by HDNet revealed that ES&S touch - screen systems were built in a Philippine sweatshop , with virtually no quality controls whatsoever .
The use of the foreign plant had not been reported to U.S. authorities , as required by law .
In the 2008 election cycle , ES&S touch - screen voting systems were among the most frequently reported to flip the votes of users while they were trying to cast votes .
Reports of such visible vote - flipping --- there is no way to track votes flipped invisibly inside such voting systems --- also surfaced in the 2006 election cycle .
In 2008 , the states reporting vote - flipping on ES&S touch - screen voting systems included WV , SC , TN , and MO , among others .
Earlier this year , ES&S agreed to a multi-million dollar settlement with the state of California , after it was discovered it had sold uncertified voting systems in several counties , while representing the systems as federally and state certified .
They were n't .
Also earlier this year , six election officials in Clay County , KY , were arrested after it was discovered that they had been exploiting an interface flaw in ES&S touch - screen systems to change the votes of voters after they thought they had completed casting their votes .

Google launched an overhauled , polished Market place few days back .
Major improvements had been with the UI .
A big step from a boring interface to the one like App Store .
Now , Google has made the latest Android SDK available , introducing a complete view of all the new features that “ Donut ” ( Android 1.6 ) will provide .
Google had been revealing future plans as they proceeded , this is the first time they have been presented to the public bundled into a single package .
What ’s New – Feature Breakdown
New Android Market–
This update , as mentioned earlier , completely redesigns the Android Market .
It features new Top Apps pages , adds screen - shots to app descriptions , adds more intelligence to searches , thereby improving the overall shopping experience .
Custom Gesture Support – A new tool in the SDK called GestureBuilder gives the developer the power to create entire libraries of new app - specific gestures .
This will encourage developers to leverage Full MultiTouch int he new applications .
Better Camera App :
The native camera app has been overhauled in design and get ’s new features .
User can now switch between still and video camera modes easily , and look through the gallery .
Additionally , it ’s faster , camera launches 39 % faster , and there is 28 % less time lag between consecutive shots .
Text - to - speech API–
A multi-lingual speech engine called Pico made by SVOX is included in Donut .
This was one of the earliest features shown off for Donut at Google I /O this year .
Previously , Google had removed the support of gesture control on Apple ’s request .
But now as they became offical Rivals , it ’s here to compete .
CDMA networks –
The CDMA mobile stack is now supported , in addition to the previous support for GSM .
iPhone seriously lacks on this .

So chin up , residents of low - lying cities everywhere .
While we can't seem to figure out how to put the brakes on global warming , at least we know we can embrace the rising water .
The Citadel is proof that when the sea threatens our living spaces , we can rise above it .
To quote someone who sums up the intellectual times in which we live , Sarah Palin : “ now is not the time to experiment with socialism ”
This , during the worse crisis since the 1930s !
Anarchists would say that is precisely the time – but only as long as we are talking about libertarian socialism !
Capitalism in crisis ( again ! ) and the failure of state socialism could not be more clear .
Social democracy has become neo-liberal ( New Labour ? New Thatcherites !) while this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the collapse of Stalinism in Eastern Europe .
With its state capitalism and party dictatorship , Stalinism made the disease ( capitalism ) more appealing than the cure ( socialism ) !
In this anarchists should be feel vindicated – the likes of Bakunin predicted both these outcomes decades before they became reality .
So there is an opening for a real alternative .
For we must not forget that capitalism is but the latest form of economy .
To Proudhon : “ the radical vice of political economy , consists . . . in affirming as a definitive state a transitory condition , – namely , the division of society into patricians [ a wealthy elite ] and proletaires . ”
So we have seen slave labour , followed by serfdom , followed by capitalism .
What is capitalism ?
As Proudhon put it , the “ period through which we are now passing . . . is distinguished by a special characteristic : WAGE LABOUR ” ( “ la salariat ” , to use the Frenchman ’s favourite term for it ) .
So capitalism is an economic system based on hired labour , that is selling your labour ( liberty ) piecemeal to a boss .
For anarchists , this is best called “ wage slavery ”
Anarchism aims for associated labour , free labour in other words – the situation where those who do the work manage it .
In the longer term , the aim is for abolition of work ( work / play becoming the same thing ) .
To quote Kropotkin , we aim to “ create the situation where each person may live by working freely , without being forced to sell [ their ] work and [ their ] liberty to others who accumulate wealth by the labour of their serfs . ”
Origins of anarchism
Anarchism was not thought - up by thinkers in a library .
Its origins , as Kropotkin stressed in his classic work “ Modern Science and Anarchism ” , lie in the struggle and self - activity of working class people against exploitation and oppression .
We do not abstractly compare capitalism to a better society , rather we see the structures of new world being created in struggle within , but against , capitalism .
Thus the assemblies and committees created to conduct a strike are seen as the workplace organisations which will organise production in a free society .
To quote the Industrial Workers of the World : Building the new world in the shell of the old .
Different schools of anarchism
There are generally three different schools of anarchism ( or libertarian socialism ) : Mutualism , Collectivism and Communism .
Anarcho - Syndicalism more a tactic than a goal and so its adherents aim for one of these three ( usually , anarcho - communism although Bakunin , who first formulated anarcho - syndicalist tactics , called himself a collectivist ) .
In practice , of course , different areas will experiment in different schemes depending on what people desire and the objective circumstances they face .
Free experimentation is a basic libertarian principle .
While these three schools differ on certain issues , they share certain key principles .
In fact , if someone claims something as “ anarchism ” and it rejects any one of these then we can safely say it is not anarchism at all .
The first principle is possession , not private property .
Following Proudhon ’s “ What is Property ? ” , use rights replace property rights in a free society .
This automatically implies an egalitarian distribution of wealth .
The second is socialisation .
This means free access to workplaces and land , so the end of landlords and bosses ( this is sometimes called “ occupancy and use ” ) .
The third is voluntary association , in other words self - management of production by those who do it .
While the name given to these worker associations vary ( co-operatives , syndicates , collectives , workers companies are just four ) , the principle is the same : one person , one vote .
The last key principle is free federation .
This is based on free association , which is essential for any dynamic economy , and so horizontal links between producers as well as federations for co-ordination of joint interests .
It would be rooted in decentralisation ( as both capitalist firms and the Stalinist economies prove , centralisation does not work ) .
It would be organised from the bottom - up , by means of mandated and recallable delegates
Bakunin summarised this kind of economy well when he stated that the “ land belongs to only those who cultivate it with their own hands ; to the agricultural communes . . . the tools of production belong to the workers ; to the workers ’ associations . ”
The rationale for decision making by these self - managed workplaces would be as different from capitalism as their structure .
To quote Kropotkin , economics in a sane society should be the “ study of the needs of mankind , and the means of satisfying them with the least possible waste of human energy . ”
These days we would need to add ecological considerations – and it is almost certain Kropotkin would have agreed ( his classic Fields , Factories and Workshops has an obvious ecological perspective even if he does not use the term ) .
Critique of Property
To understand anarchist visions of a free economy , you need to understand the anarchist critique of capitalism .
As is well known , Proudhon proclaimed that “ property is theft ” .
By that he meant two things .
First , that landlords charged tenants for access to the means of life .
Thus rent is exploitative .
Second , that wage labour results in exploitation .
Workers are expected to produce more than their wages .
To quote Proudhon :
“ Whoever labours becomes a proprietor – this is an inevitable deduction from the principles of political economy and jurisprudence .
And when I say proprietor , I do not mean simply ( as do our hypocritical economists ) proprietor of his allowance , his salary , his wages , – I mean proprietor of the value his creates , and by which the master alone profits . . .
The labourer retains , even after he has received his wages , a natural right in the thing he was produced . ”
This feeds into Proudhon ’s “ property is despotism . ”
In other words , that it produces hierarchical social relationships and this authority structure allows them to boss workers around , ensuring that they are exploited .
To quote Proudhon again :
“ Do you know what it is to be a wage - worker ?
It is to labour under another , watchful for his prejudices even more than for his orders . . .
It is to have no mind of your own . . . to know no stimulus save your daily bread and the fear of losing your job .
The wage - worker is a man to whom the property owner who hires him says :
What you are to do is to be none of your business ; you have nothing to control in it . ”
To achieve this , as noted above , use rights replace property rights .
Personal possession remains only in the things you use .
To quote Alexander Berkman , anarchism
“ abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution , and with it goes capitalistic business .
Personal possession remains only in the things you use .
Thus , your watch is your own , but the watch factory belongs to the people .
Land , machinery , and all other public utilities will be collective property , neither to be bought nor sold .
Actual use will be considered the only title – not to ownership but to possession .
The organisation of the coal miners , for example , will be in charge of the coal mines , not as owners but as the operating agency .
Similarly will the railroad brotherhoods run the railroads , and so on .
Collective possession , co-operatively managed in the interests of the community , will take the place of personal ownership privately conducted for profit . ”
Proudhon summarised this well as “ possessors without masters ”
Socialisation
While not all anarchists have used the term " socialisation " , the fact this is the necessary foundation for a free society and , unsurprisingly , the concept ( if not the word ) is at the base of anarchism .
This is because it ensures universal self - management by allowing free access to the means of production .
As Emma Goldman and John Most argued , it “ logically excludes any and every relation between master and servant ”
This has been an anarchist position as long as anarchism has been called anarchism .
Thus we find Proudhon arguing in 1840 that “ the land is indispensable to our existence ” and “ consequently a common thing , consequently insusceptible of appropriation ” and that “ all accumulated capital being social property , no one can be its exclusive proprietor . ”
This means “ the farmer does not appropriate the field which he sows ” and “ all capital . . . being the result of collective labour ” is “ collective property . ”
Unsurprisingly , Proudhon argued for “ democratically organised workers associations ” and that “ [ u ] nder the law of association , transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour , so cannot become a cause of inequality . ”
As economist David Ellerman explains , the democratic workplace “ is a social community , a community of work rather than a community residence .
It is a republic , or res publica of the workplace .
The ultimate governance rights are assigned as personal rights . . . to the people who work in the firm . . .
This analysis shows how a firm can be socialised and yet remain ' private ' in the sense of not being government - owned . ”
Self - management
Socialisation logically implies that there would be no labour market , simply people looking for associations to join and association looking for associates .
Wage - labour would be a thing of the past and replaced by self - management .
This is sometimes termed “ workers ' control ” or , in the words of Proudhon , “ industrial democracy ” and the turning of workplaces into “ little republics of workers . ”
For Kropotkin , a libertarian economy would be based on “ associations of men and women who . . . work on the land , in the factories , in the mines , and so on , [ are ] themselves the managers of production . ”
This would be based on one member , one vote ( and so egalitarian structures and results ) ; administrative staff elected and recallable ; integration of manual and intellectual work ; and division of work rather than division of labour .
Thus , as Proudhon suggested , workplaces “ are the common and undivided property of all those who take part therein ” rather than “ companies of stockholders who plunder the bodies and souls of the wage workers . ”
This meant free access , with “ every individual employed in the association ” having “ an undivided share in the property of the company " and has " a right to fill any position ” as “ all positions are elective , and the by - laws subject to the approval of the members . ”
While these principles underlie all schools of anarchism , there are differences between them .
Mutualism
The first school of anarchism was mutualism , most famously associated with Proudhon . [ 1 ]
This system has markets .
This does not imply capitalism , as markets are not what define that system .
Markets pre-date it by thousands of years .
What makes capitalism unique is that it has the production of commodities and wage labour .
[ 2 ]
So this means that mutualism is based on producing commodities but with wage labour replaced by self - employment and cooperatives .
This implies that distribution is by work done , by deed rather than need .
Workers would receive the full product of their labour , after paying for inputs from other co-operatives .
This does not mean that co-operatives would not invest , simply that association as a whole would determine what faction of their collective income would be distributed to individual members and would be retained for use by the co-operative .
It should be noted here that neo-classical economics argues that co-operatives produce high unemployment .
However , like the rest of this ideology this is based on false assumptions and is , ultimately , a theory whose predictions have absolutely nothing to do with the observed facts .
As well as co-operatives , the other key idea of mutualism is free credit .
People ’s Bank would be organised and would charge interest rates covering costs ( near 0 % ) .
This would allow workers to create their own means of production .
Again , neo-classical economics suggest that there would be a problem of inflation as mutual banks would increase the money supply by creating credit .
However , this is flawed as credit is not created willy - nilly but “ rationed ” , i.e. , given to projects which are expected to produce more goods and services .
Thus it would not be a case of more and more money chasing a set number of goods but rather money being used to create more and more goods !
Lastly , there is the Agro- industrial federation .
Proudhon was well aware of the problems faced by isolated co-operatives and so suggested associations organise a federation to reduce risk by creating solidarity , mutual aid and support .
As all industries are interrelated , it makes sense for them to support each other .
In addition , the federation was seen as a way to stop return of capitalism by market forces .
It would also be for public services ( such as railways , roads , health care and so forth ) which would be communally owned and run by workers co-operatives .
Mutualism is reformist in strategy , aiming to replace capitalism by means of alternative institutions and competition .
Few anarchists subscribe to that perspective .
Collectivism
The next school of anarchist economics is collectivism , most famously associated with Bakunin .
It is similar to mutualism , less market based ( although still based on distribution by deed ) .
However , it has more communistic elements and most of its adherents think it will evolve into libertarian communism .
So it can be considered as a half - way house between mutualism and communism , with elements of both .
As such , it will not be discussed here as its features are covered in these two .
Like libertarian communism , it is revolutionary , considering that capitalism cannot be reformed .
Communism
First , this is not like Stalinism / Leninism !
That was state capitalism and not remotely communistic , never mind libertarian communist .
Most anarchists are libertarian communists and the theory is most famously associated with Kropotkin .
Unlike mutualism and collectivism , there are no markets .
It is based on the abolition of money or equivalents ( labour notes ) .
So no wage labour AND no wages system ( “ From each according to their abilities , to each according to their needs ” ) .
Communist - anarchism extends collective possession to the products of labour .
This does not mean we share toothbrushes but simply that goods are freely available to those who need it .
To quote Kropotkin : “ Communism , but not the monastic or barrack - room Communism formerly advocated [ by state socialists ] , but the free Communism which places the products reaped or manufactured at the disposal of all , leaving to each the liberty to consume them as he pleases in his [ or her ] own home . ”
These anarchists urge the abolition of money because there are many problems with markets as such , problems which capitalism undoubtedly makes worse but which would exist even in a non-capitalist market system .
Most obviously , income does not reflect needs and a just society would recognise this .
Many needs cannot be provided by markets ( public goods and efficient health care , most obviously ) .
Markets block information required for sensible decision making ( that something costs £ 5 does not tell you how much pollution it costs or the conditions of the workplace which created it ) .
They also systematically reward anti-social activity ( firms which impose externalities can lower prices to raise profits and be rewarded by increased market share as a result ) .
Market forces produce collectively irrational behaviour as a result of atomistic individual actions ( e.g. , competition can result in people working harder and longer to survive on the market as well as causing over - production and crisis as firms react to the same market signals and flood into a market ) .
The need for profits also increases uncertainty and so the possibility of crisis and its resulting social misery .
Rather than comparing prices , resource allocation in anarcho - communism would be based on comparing the use values of specific goods as well as their relative scarcities .
The use - values compared would be both positive ( i.e. , how well does it meet the requirements ) and negative ( i.e. , what resources does it use it , what pollution does it cause , how much labour is embodied in it , and so on ) .
In this way the actual cost information more often then not hidden by the price can be communicated and used to make sensible decisions .
Scarcity would be indicated by syndicates communicating how many orders they are receiving compared to their normal capacity – as syndicates get more orders , their product ’s scarcity index would rise so informing other syndicates to seek substitutes for the goods in question .
Evidence
Fine , it will be said , but that is just wishful thinking !
Not true as the empirical evidence is overwhelming for libertarian economic ideas .
For example , workers ' participation in management and profit sharing enhance productivity .
Worker - run enterprises are more productive than capitalist firms .
A staggering 94 % of 226 studies into this issue showed a positive impact , with 60 % being statistically significant .
Interestingly , for employee ownership to have a strong impact on performance , it needs worker participation in decision making .
Co-operatives , moreover , have narrow differences in wages and status ( well under 1 to 10 , compared to 1 to 200 and greater in corporations ! ) .
Unsurprisingly , high levels of equality increase productivity ( as workers do n’t like slaving to make others rich off their labour ! ) .
What about a lack of stock market ?
No real need to discuss how stock markets are bad for the real economy in the current cycle but suffice to say , they serious communication problems between managers and shareholders .
Moreover , the stock market rewards short - term profit - boosting over long - term growth so leading to over - investment in certain industries and increasing risk and gambling .
Significantly , bank - centred capitalism has less extreme business cycle than stock market one .
The successful co-operatives under capitalism , like Mondragon , are usually in groups , which shows sense of having an agro-industrial federation and are often associated with their own banking institutions ( which , again , shows the validity of Proudhon ’s ideas ) .
Then there is the example of various social revolutions around the world .
No anarchist talk would be complete with a reference to the Spanish Revolution of 1936 and this is no exception .
Yet we do so for a reason as this shows that libertarian self - management can work on a large - scale , with most of industry in Catalonia successfully collectivised while vast areas of land owned and managed collectively .
More recently , the revolt against neo-liberalism in Argentina included the taking over of closed workplaces .
These recuperated factories show that while the bosses need us , we do not need them !
Getting there
So , with the desirability and validity of libertarian socialism sketched , the question becomes one of how do we get there .
Obviously , one elements of this would be creating and supporting co-operatives within capitalism ( Proudhon : “ That a new society be founded in the heart of the old society ” )
This could include promoting socialisation and co-operatives as an alternative to closures , bailouts and nationalisation .
However , most anarchists see that as just a part of encouraging a culture of resistance , or encouraging collective struggles against capitalism and the state .
In other words , encouraging direct action ( strikes , protests , occupations , etc. ) and ensuring that all struggles are self - managed by those within them and that any organisations they create are also self - managed from below .
The goal would be for people to start occupying workplaces , housing , land , etc. , and so making socialisation a reality .
By managing our struggles we learn to manage our lives ; by creating organisations for struggles against the current system we create the framework of a free society .
Together we can change the world !

Schumer ’s fell on a 10 - 13 vote .
Rockefeller ’s was rejected , 8 - 15 , with two other Democrats also voting no .
But the two votes hardly end the debate on the provision .
Liberals are expected to push for more votes on the Senate floor , Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) is insisting the House bill include a public option and GOP centrist Sen. Olympia Snowe ( Maine ) is floating the idea of “ triggering ” a public option if the insurance industry fails to meet certain requirements .
Baucus , the panel ’s chairman , said his “ no ” votes were born of a pragmatic view that a bill with a public option could not pass the Senate .
Despite Democrats controlling 60 seats , several centrists have expressed opposition to , or at least skepticism over , the public option .
“ My job is to get a bill that can get 60 votes , ” Baucus said .
“ If this provision is in the bill coming out of the committee , it will jeopardize real , meaningful healthcare reform .
I want a bill that can become law . ”
The markup , which began on Sept. 22 , is expected to finish this week , with a debate on the Senate floor to follow .
Obama supports the public option , but the White House has sent numerous signals that leaving it out would not be a deal - breaker for the president .

In spite of the losing votes Tuesday , Rockefeller , Schumer and other liberals said the Finance Committee ’s actions were just one step on a journey .
The public option will gain support among Democrats , Schumer said , though he acknowledged he still had work to do .
“ We do n’t have the 60 votes on the floor for the public option , ” Schumer said .
“ I will be the first to admit that . ”
Baucus indicated that he has no objection to the proposal itself .
“ I see a lot to like in the public option , ” he said .
“ The public option would help to keep the insurance companies ’ feet to the fire .
There ’s no doubt about that . ”
But Baucus defended his bill , pointing to new insurance market reforms requiring companies to sign up anyone regardless of pre-existing conditions and limiting insurers ’ ability to charge higher premiums to older and sicker people .
The bill also would assess $ 67 billion in fees on insurers over 10 years .
“ Some of your questions sort of leave the indication that the mark is easy on the insurance industry , and it ’s not , ” Baucus said to Rockefeller .
Schumer said that the committee ’s liberals do not hold a grudge against Baucus .
“ We understand that his job is to pass a bill .
I think we can show him that we can , ” he said .
The Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committee has already approved a bill with a public option .
Pelosi is adamant that any measure that passes the lower chamber include a public option , though she faces resistance from a centrist Democratic voting bloc .
Schumer ’s amendment would have established a so - called level - playing field public option that would negotiate payment rates for medical providers .

Often when we listen to music , it ’s over little white headphones that connect to our iphones or ipods , literally plugging us into our music .
We own music , download it and possess it .
For many , music is a very personal experience .
Monotonix turns that relationship completely on its head by creating a concert experience where people are compelled to come together to experience the music rather than consume it individually .
Monotonix has very little regard for the conventional structure of a concert .
They assemble their instruments on the floor of the venue surrounded by a ring of fans .
When the concert starts , it ’s an explosion .
The entire room moves .
It ’s not like a mosh pit where people flay and spin bashing into each other ; rather , it ’s one big circular mass that moves as one .
The Music Fest NW set was a lot more tame than their previous Portland performances .
Monotonix lead vocalist Ami Shalev spent a lot less time showing off his ass or simulating fellatio with audience members and spent a lot more time singing and rocking .
This was a nice change for Monotonix , who seem to be continually refining and focusing what they do .
Ami also spent a lot more time hoisted above the crowd .
I was struck at site of the the constant sea of hands hosting and holding Ami , drums and the occasional crowd surfer .
It was profoundly beautiful .
The final song of the set was performed with Ami sitting on a stool playing the drums all hosited in the air by the audience .
There ’s something about a Monotonix show that creates an instant community .
As two people collided at the periphery of the circle , their glasses went flying , and immediately the crowd around them made room and began looking for the glasses .
In an almost perfect moment the two both emerged holding each other ’s glasses .
It was n’t a moment you ’d expect at an ‘ Israeli Punk ’ show .
I ’ve seen Monotonix now three times , and I can honestly say they ’re not a one trick pony .
Musically I do think there ’s some room for growth .
Their song Body Language ( off their debut album of the same name ) shows off some real potential for what they can do .
I did n’t feel that some of their new songs were at the same level although the performance overall has certainly grown .
But you do n’t go see Monotonix for just music .
It ’s an absolutely amazing experience and one which anyone who loves rock music should have .
Seeing Monotonix at Music Fest NW was a fantastic reminder to me of why I love music and why I go see live music .
Music can be so much more than just consumed and it ’s great to be reminded of just how alive it really is .

[ digg - reddit - me ] I pride myself on being the type of guy who tries to see the other side .
And I believe in America , everyone has a right to their own opinion – and to express their own opinion .
And I think that our media often presents too narrow a range of opinions .
But can somebody please explain to me how either of these men can be allowed a soapbox to speak from ?
Fox News should take Glenn Beck off the air for this – and ban Michael Scheurer , despite his experience and knowledge of Al Qaeda .
There are certain things that are acceptable – and then there is what is beyond that .
Wishing for a major terrorist attack is over the line .
Every conservative or right - winger that railed against Ward Churchill blaming the victims of 9/11 for their own deaths should be on this bandwagon – as these two commentators hope for more American deaths so that their political agenda will be adopted .
Tell me how else to interpret this ?!
Tell me how this is n’t treason !
Explain to me why this is n’t over the line :
The only chance we have as a country right now is for Osama bin Laden to deploy and detonate a major weapon in the United States … Only Osama can execute an attack which will force Americans to demand their government to protect them …
Go ahead , somebody please talk me down from this – or if on the other hand email UPS and other sponsors of the Glenn Beck show to demand that they stop their sponsorship .
( UPS is the only major sponsor I have seen – though let me know if you know of any others . )
Edit : I ’ve contacted UPS to ask them to confirm their relationship with Glenn Beck and am waiting for a callback .
When I get a response , I will find out a better method of directing these emails .

A federal judge has ruled that the government failed to adequately assess the environmental impacts of genetically engineered sugar beets before approving the crop for cultivation in the United States .
The decision could lead to a ban on the planting of the beets , which have been widely adopted by farmers .
In a decision issued Monday , Judge Jeffrey S. White of Federal District Court in San Francisco , said that the Agriculture Department should have done an environmental impact statement .
He said it should have assessed the consequences from the likely spread of the genetically engineered trait to other sugar beets or to the related crops of Swiss chard and red table beets .
The decision echoes another ruling two years ago by a different judge in the same court involving genetically engineered alfalfa .
In that case , the judge later ruled that farmers could no longer plant the genetically modified alfalfa until the Agriculture Department wrote the environmental impact statement .
Two years later , there is still no such assessment and the alfalfa , with rare exceptions , is not being grown .
In the new case , Judge White has not yet decided on the remedy .
A meeting to begin that phase of the case is scheduled for Oct. 30 .
WASHINGTON --
When Woody Harrelson escapes the living dead in " Zombieland " , a new movie opening this Friday , should he head for the hills or the mall ?
A recently published research paper suggests that he 's probably better off hiding in the mall to save his delicious brain .
The world is full of things that move in zombie - like fashion , such as particles flowing through a turbulent fluid or the unpredictable price changes of the stock market , so physicists seek insight into this behavior by creating so called " random walking " models .
Physicist Davide Cassi at the Università di Parma in Italy looked at how long an entity hiding in a complex structure could survive if being pursued by predatory random walkers .
Cassi's paper , recently published in the journal Physical Review E , is the first to describe a general principle of a prey ’s likelihood to survive over time while hiding in an irregular structure .
Though the paper itself does not specifically refer to fleeing from zombies , it describes " the survival probability of immobile targets annihilated by random walkers . "
The conclusions suggest that the people trapped in a mall in " Dawn of the Dead " may be better off than the folks stuck in a farmhouse in " Night of the Living Dead . "
Cassi found that the likelihood of survival when threatened by predatory random walkers is closely related to how complex the prey ’s hideout is .
The more twists and turns , the safer you 'll be .
In structures that are highly complex and irregular , the chances of the predator coming into contact with its target shrinks down to almost zero .
Cassi formulates a model to describe the behavior of randomly moving particles as they travel through maze - like networks .
He said that his work could apply to a wide variety of situations including the distribution of information through the internet and medicine spreading through the human body .
" There are a lot of applications of these results in a lot of fields of sciences , " Cassi said .
" The most amazing field of applications of these results are in biology , biochemistry and other organisms . "
So remember , when the zombies come , flee to the biggest shopping mall you can find and remember that , using zombie movies as a guide , the undead often win .

This article by Javier Collado expands the set of web scraping techniques shown in his previous article by looking closely into a more complex problem that cannot be solved with the tools that were explained there .
For those who missed out on that article , here ’s the link .
Web Scraping with Python
This article will show how to extract the desired information using the same three steps when the web page is not written directly using HTML , but is auto - generated using JavaScript to update the DOM tree .
As you may remember from that article , web scraping is the ability to extract information automatically from a set of web pages that were designed only to display information nicely to humans ; but that might not be suitable when a machine needs to retrieve that information .
The three basic steps that were recommended to be followed when performing a scraping task were the following :
Explore the website to find out where the desired information is located in the HTML DOM tree
Download as many web pages as needed
Parse downloaded web pages and extract the information from the places found in the exploration step
What should be taken into account when the content is not directly coded in the HTML DOM tree ?
The main difference , as you probably have already noted , is that using the downloading methods that were suggested in the previous article ( urllib2 or mechanize ) just do n’t work .
This is because they generate an HTTP request to get the web page and deliver the received HTML directly to the scraping script .
However , the pieces of information that are auto - generated by the JavaScript code are not yet in the HTML file because the code is not executed in any virtual machine as it happens when the page is displayed in a web browser .
Hence , instead of relying on a library that generates HTTP requests , we need a library that behaves as a real web browser , or even better , a library that interacts with a real web browser .
So that we are sure that we obtain the same data as we see when manually opening a page in a web browser .
Please remember that the aim of web scraping is actually parsing the data that a human user sees , so interacting with a real web browser would be a really nice feature .
Is there any tool out there to perform that ?
Fortunately , the answer is yes .
In particular , there are a couple of tools used for web testing automation that can be used to solve the JavaScript execution problem : Selenium and Windmill .
For the code samples in the sections below , Windmill is used .
Any choice would be fine as both of them are well documented and stable tools ready to be used for production .
Let ’s now follow the same three steps that were suggested in the previous article to solve the scraping of the contents of a web page that is partly generated using JavaScript code .
Explore
Imagine that you are a fan of NASA Image of the day gallery .
You want to get a list of the names of all the images in the gallery together with the link to the whole resolution picture just in case you decide to download it later to use as a desktop wallpaper .
The first thing to do is to locate the data that has to be extracted on the desired web page .
In the case of the Image of the day gallery ( see screenshot below ) , there are three elements that are important to note :
Title of the image that is being currently displayed
Link to the image full resolution file
Next link to make it possible navigate through all the images
To find out the location of each piece of interesting information , as it was already suggested in the previous article , it ’s better to use a tool such as Firebug whose inspect functionality can be really useful .
The following picture , for example , shows the location of the image title inside an h3 tag :
The other two fields can be located as easily as the title , so no further explanation will be given here .
Please refer to the previous article for further information .
Download
As explained in the introduction , to download the content of the web page , we will use Windmill as it allows the JavaScript code to execute in the web browser before getting the page content .
Because Windmill is mostly a testing library , instead of writing a script that calls the Windmill API , I will write a test case for Windmill to navigate through all the image web pages .
The code for the test should be as follows :
1 def test_scrape_iotd_gallery ( ) :
2 " " "
3 Scrape NASA Image of the Day Gallery
4 " " "
5 # Extra data massage for BeautifulSoup
6 my_massage = get_massage ( )
7
8 # Open main gallery page
9 client = WindmillTestClient ( __name__ )
10 client.open(url='http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html')
11
12 # Page is n't completely loaded until image gallery data
13 # has been updated by javascript code
14 client.waits.forElement(xpath=u"//div[@id='gallery_image_area ' ] /img " ,
15 timeout=30000 )
16
17 # Scrape all images information
18 images_info = {}
19 while True :
20 image_info = get_image_info( client , my_massage )
21
22 # Break if image has been already scrapped
23 # ( that means that all images have been parsed
24 # since they are ordered in a circular ring )
25 if image_info [ ' link ' ] in images_info :
26 break
27
28 images_info[image_info[' link ' ] ] = image_info
29
30 # Click to get the information for the next image
31 client.click(xpath=u"//div[@class='btn_image_next ' ] " )
32
33 # Print results to stdout ordered by image name
34 for image_info in sorted ( images_info.values ( ) ,
35 key=lambda image_info : image_info[ ' name ' ] ) :
36 print ( " Name : %( name ) s n "
37 " Link : %( link ) sn " % image_info )
As it can be seen , the usage of Windmill is similar to other libraries such as mechanize .
For example , first of all a client object has to be created to interact with the browser , ( line 9 ) and later , the main web page , that is going to be used to navigate through all the information , has to be opened ( line 10 ) .
Nevertheless , it also includes some facilities that take into account JavaScript code as shown at line 14 .
In this line , the waits .
forElement method has been used to look for DOM element that is filled by the JavaScript code so when that element , in this case the big image in the image gallery , is displayed , the rest of the script can proceed .
It is important to note here that the web page processing does n’t start when the page is downloaded ( this happens after line 10 ) , but when there ’s some evidence that JavaScript code has finished the DOM tree manipulation .
For navigating through all the pages that contain the information needed , this is just a matter of pressing over the next arrow ( line 30 ) .
As the images are ordered in a circular buffer , the point when it is decided to stop is when the same image link has been parsed twice ( line 25 ) .
To execute the script , instead of launching it as we would normally do for a python script , we should call it through the Windmill script to properly initialize the environment :
$ windmill firefox test=nasa_iotd .py
As it can be seen in the following screenshot , Windmill takes care of opening a browser ( Firefox in this case ) window and a controller window in which it ’s possible to see the commands that the script is executing ( several clicks on next in the example ) :
The controller window is really interesting because not only does it display the progress of the test cases , but also allows to enter / record actions interactively , which is a nice feature when trying things out .
In particular , the recording may be used under some situations to replace Firebug in the exploration step .
This is because the captured actions may be stored in a script without spending much time in xpath expressions .
For more information about how to use Windmill and the complete API , please refer to the Windmill documentation .
Tom Friedman may be the single stupidest figure in American public life , and certainly is the stupidest writer with such a large platform .
I do n't mean that he 's wrong on everything ( although he is substantively wrong on a lot of things ) - I mean that he 's actually an extremely dim bulb in that he displays a stunning lack of basic cognitive function .
Specifically , he shows almost zero ability to realize that the arguments made by Tom Friedman often undermine the arguments made by Tom Friedman .
A great example of this is Friedman 's recent column , decrying the truly lamentable fact that federal stimulus money is subsidizing job off - shoring and foreign green industries , and not building jobs and green industries at home :
So , right now , our federal and state subsidies for installing solar systems are largely paying for the cost of importing solar panels made in China , by Chinese workers , using hi-tech manufacturing equipment invented in America ... if you like importing oil from Saudi Arabia , you 're going to love importing solar panels from China .
He 's right on the substance , of course .
Stimulus money is subsidizing all of that , as many of us predicted well before the stimulus passed .
Why ?
In part because Tom Friedman , other pundits and corporations all made sure that the stimulus 's " Buy American " provisions were severely watered down .
Here was Friedman not - so - subtly attacking " Buy America " provisions as " protectionist " back during the stimulus debate :
President Obama has been doing his best to keep the worst protectionist impulses in Congress out of his stimulus plan .
... Each Indian state tries to protect its little economy with its own rules .
America should not be trying to copy that .
...
Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression , but it sure helped to make it " Great . "
So here you have the same pundit who helped water down the " Buy America " provisions in the stimulus bill now complaining that the stimulus bill is being used to buy products from other countries .
Likewise , this same pundit continues to aggressively support " free " trade policies that encourage the outsourcing he now decries - the policies that he admits he does n't even bother to read .
Clearly , Friedman also does n't bother to read his own columns - or perhaps he does and does n't care that he contradicts himself all the time .
Frankly , while I think Friedman is so self - obsessed he probably does read his old columns over and over and over again , I also think his contradictions are not so much a product of dishonesty as they are of sheer stupidity .
Putting all ( admittedly strong ) desire to insult aside , I 've genuinely come to believe that he 's just an extraordinarily unintelligent and incurious person - a 12 - year - old mind trapped in a pudgy , 50 - something body .
Only this is n't the movie Big and we 're not talking about a toy company headed by Robert Loggia - Friedman is respected as a Great Thinker worthy of advising the President of the United States and influencing U.S. government policy .
Maybe that says all you need to know about the American Idiocracy and why we 're so far up shit 's creek .

The video of the man who tried to feed a six - week - old kitten to a python has surfaced , and this guy is a bigger dirt bag than originally anticipated .
You can see the video here , but if you ever want to smile again , we suggest you just take our word for it ; it 's awful .
The video shows Jeremy Tuffly in a backyard , repeatedly throwing the kitten into a plastic container that had a giant python in it .
The snake does n't seem all that interested in the cat until Tuffly throws it directly onto the back of the snake .
The kitten kept running back towards Tuffly as if he were going to rescue him , only to be tossed right back onto the snake .
Tuffly , by the way , is standing a cautious 15 feet away from the giant snake , not wanting to go near it , and using the top of the container as a pseudo shield .
It should also be noted that several New Times readers have pointed out that the 28 - year - old loser still lives with his grandma .
Looks like we now know who the real pussy in this situation is .
It 's not often that you hear a CEO praise a competing product , but late this week , Sprint CEO Dan Hesse sat down with Charlie Rose and had some interesting things to say about the iPhone and the mobile industry as a whole .
Since it first made its debut at CES last January , the Palm Pre has been hyped up as the only smartphone that can give the iPhone a run for its money .
Like the iPhone , the Pre comes with a multitouch screen and a polished UI , and relative to other smartphones on the market , the Pre certainly stands out .
Initially , Palm executives were quick to dismiss any notions that the Pre was an " iPhone killer " and that they were competing directly with Apple .
Instead ,
Palm touted the Pre as a device that stood on its own two feet , a smartphone that was a winner in its own right .
But since its release this past June , friction between Palm and Apple has steadily increased , in large part due to the cat and mouse game rooted in the Pre 's on - again off - again ability to sync up with iTunes .
Add in the fact that a few of Palm 's executives and many of its engineers are former Apple employees , and we have a good old fashioned Silicon Valley shootout on our hands .
Granted , Sprint is a mobile carrier and not a handset manufacturer , but it nonetheless is in direct competition with Apple to the extent that the iPhone is an AT&T exclusive and the Pre a Sprint exclusive .
That said , when Hessee was recently asked by Charlie Rose about how the Palm Pre has been doing against the iPhone , Hesse candidly remarked that it 's not really a fair comparison .
Q : Is the Palm Pre making a dent into the iPhone market ?
A : Aaah ...
It 's - it 's doing well , but you can almost put the iPhone , to be fair , in a separate category .
The Apple brand and that device have done so well , it 's almost not ... it 's like comparing someone to Michael Jordan .
Hesse 's remarks are surprising because most executives , be they from Palm , Microsoft , or Verizon , have been quick to downplay the success of the iPhone and trump up their own products and services .
To his credit , Hesse seems to understand that it 's better to acknowledge that there 's work to be done instead of blindly asserting that things could n't be going better .
And for what it 's worth , MJ was just inducted into the hall of fame .
Just sayin ..

President pays off unions , tells 80 % of American construction workers to go # $ %@ themselves
The OMB ( Office of Management and Budget ) has issued an “ union only ” edict that bans non-union workers from all federal construction projects over $ 25 million .
Stats from the Bureau of Labor shows that a mere 15.6 % of private construction workers in America belong to unions .
So the net result of this fiat will be that 85 % of American construction workers are being told to pound sand .
Experts estimate that this could increase the cost of federal construction by 10 - 20 % .
How ?
RedState.com reports that the new regulation will require “ all contractors to either use union workers or apply inefficient union apprenticeship and work rules to their employees .
Contractors would also be required to make contributions to union pension funds and other union programs that non-union workers will never benefit from . ”
The bottom line : Unions get their blood money from Obama even on non-union projects .
We ’re thinking of unionizing here at IHateTheMedia.com .
Problem is that the editor will immediate declare a wildcat strike if the administrator is named shop steward .
And vice versa .

Last week we showed you the ingenious hard drive enclosure made from a broken Game Boy .
We caught up with [ _n3 o_ ] , the person responsible for this mod , and he was nice enough to share some pictures of the inside of the project .
Let ’s get down to business and take a look .
[ _n3 o_ ] opened this project back up and took these pictures by popular request .
Here ’s the overview of the guts .
You can see the 2.5 ″ drive on the right .
The circuit board on the top is the SATA to USB converter .
The two gray cables are to relocate the LED and USB ports .
He did mention that before taking these pictures he swapped the 80 GB drive out for a 20 GB one in order to use it for another project .
Here we see the inside of the rear half of the Game Boy .
The board all the way to the right is the original headphone connector from the Game Boy .
At the top the volume control dial can be seen hot - glued in place .
Here is a closeup of the original headphone connector and volume dial of the Game Boy .
The dial has been cut in half and glued in place .
Both were left in the hand - held for a realistic look .
This is a closeup of the SATA to USB adapter that [ _n3 o_ ] salvaged from a generic 2.5 ″ external USB hard drive enclosure .
A second USB socket was connected to the board using some ribbon cable in order to locate the USB connector in the same place the Game Link Cable is normally found .
The LED was removed from the circuit board and relocated to the front of the case using the gray cable on the right .
Here is the front case of the Game Boy .
Cardboard is used to keep the control buttons in place .
The electrical tape to the left covers the back of the screen .
You will remember from our original post that [ _n3 o_ ] simulated an image on the screen by removing the reflective backing from the LCD screen and put a paper printout in its place .
The LED from the hard drive enclosure is located in the battery indicator window of the gaming unit .
The gray cable seen here connects that indicator to the circuit board in the back half of the unit .
Voilà , the finished product .
A peek inside makes this project even more delightful .
Thanks for sharing those extra pictures with us [ _n3 o_ ] !
Hi Res :
[ photo1 , photo2 , photo3 , photo4 , photo5 , photo6 ]
This article first appeared in Alternet .
The right - wing anti-Obama - care movement is OK with killing off tens of thousands of Americans each year .
That ’s what this is all about :
The right - wingers and their corporate sponsors are protecting a medieval and violent health care system that kills more Americans each year than all the Americans who have died in the war on terror since 2001 , including the 3,000 victims of 9/11 , and the 5,000 - plus U.S. service members who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Every two months , the American health care industry is party to the slaughter of more Americans than al - Qaida managed to kill .
Osama bin Laden must look at the Tea Baggers , FreedomWorks , health - industry billionaires like Rick Scott and the rest , and think , “ If only I could kill as many Americans as they do !
These guys are pros ! ”
They need to answer for this — they need to explain why they are trying to protect a system that kills 22,000 Americans per year — a figure based on a landmark report by the prestigious Institute of Medicine .
In fact , 22,000 is a conservative figure — one of the authors of that report thinks the real figure in 2006 alone was 27,000 Americans killed from our health care system , perhaps as high as 40,000 .
But I ’ll stick to the conservative casualty number of 22,000 , which is horrific enough .
If you believe in making health care available to every American , there ’s no reason to be skittish about talking about it on these terms .
The right wing sure as hell is n’t : in fact , its whole argument against health care reform is a hypothetical , future - tense dystopia of Americans murdered by their government , a fiction invented by hired marketing whizzes .
It ’s winning the “ debate ” based on a lie that has n’t even happened , whereas in this present - tense reality we all inhabit now , one American dies every 24 minutes because of this health care system .
It ’s time we protect ourselves and those we love , and that means stopping this slaughterhouse and saving Americans .
That ’s why health care reform is n’t the place for wonkish debate and complicated rational arguments — this is a battle to protect ourselves from people who are fine with their fellow citizens dying in horrible pain , not a debate - club tournament .
The right - wing thugs crashing Obama - care town hall meetings do n’t seem to mind being party to the mass murder of Americans , because they hate our freedoms .
For example , the freedom to elect a president whom they disagree with , or whose skin color they find repulsive .
These goons hate Americans so much that they ’re willing to get violent — actually , that ’s almost redundant , because it ’s like saying , “ They ’re willing to get violent in order to kill 22,000 of us . ”
But that ’s how it is :
They ’re attacking anyone who threatens to pull the plug on a health - care monster that ’s responsible for slaughtering some 200,000 Americans this decade .
If you go back to the first successful campaign to destroy first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s health care program in 1993 , then the total number of Americans killed is well over 300,000 — that ’s more than the 292,000 American servicemen who died on the battlefield fighting Fascism in World War II .
Let me repeat : Since 1993 , more Americans have been killed by our health care system than were killed on the battlefield in World War II .
It ’s no coincidence that the same rat who led America into the disastrous war in Iraq — pundit Bill Kristol — is the same one who led the fight against health care reform in 1993 and 2009 .
Kristol has more American blood on his hands than a thousand Benedict Arnolds — he was party to the slaughter of more than 4,000 Americans in Iraq and the death of America ’s geopolitical power .
And with health care , Kristol has been one of the health care junta ’s prime ideologues , resulting in deaths of a few hundred thousand Americans here at home .
Not that he ’s hiding it .
Kristol himself wrote recently , “ This is no time to pull punches .
Go for the kill . ”
Let ’s take Kristol at his word — he sees Americans trying get the sort of health care he has , and his response is to “ Go for the kill . ”
And that ’s exactly what they ’re doing : killing us .
So let ’s stop pretending that the health care battle is a “ debate , ” because it ’s not .
It ’s a fight , a struggle to the death , to avoid death and suffering .
The right wing understood this long ago , and that ’s why its winning — again .
The right - wingers are fighting for a system that kills Americans for their personal profit .
And like colonial overlords , they ’re now unleashing hired thugs to attack anyone who threatens their riches .
It ’s the oldest and most serious battle of all : the battle for life and death , between misery and happiness — all of which are scarce resources .
When you look at this stripped of the silly civics - class sheen that too many progressives adhere to , then the right wing ’s vicious tactics are n’t at all shocking , but rather , obvious .
[ Just today , a man was arrested in Maryland for standing outside a community college and holding up two death - threat signs , including one that read , “ Death To Obama , Michelle And His Two Stupid Kids . ”
This comes after a man was arrested lurking inside a school where Obama was scheduled to speak , carrying a loaded unlicensed handgun .
And several Democrat members of Congress have received death threats as well . ]
Since the dawn of time , man has murdered , terrorized and plundered in order to live longer and healthier .
That ’s all that ’s going on — but in this fight , one side showed up to the battlefield ready for blood , and the other side — the majority of Americans who voted for Obama , or the 76 percent of Americans who support a public option plan — showed up armed with debate points and sneers .
No wonder we ’ve all but lost .
And we ’ll remain stuck in this retro-Middle Ages nightmare , in which health care CEOs earn billions and golf in luxury until they ’re well over 100 years old , while 52 million Americans have no health care coverage at all .
It ’s a transfer not only of this nation ’s wealth but of American blood and vital organs — transferred from the bodies of tens of millions of Americans and into the richest 1 percent ’s longevity , just like the way Grandpa in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre stayed alive by eating the flesh and blood of gullible Americans .
Grandpa relaxes after eating another American : “ And the sweet thing is , Medicare gives me free government health care ! ”
The stats prove that we are ruled by cannibals : the gap between the lifespan of America ’s wealthiest and its poorest has doubled since 1980 .
Overall the lifespan of the average American has plummeted from its No. 13 world ranking in 1960 to No. 42 today , lower than Costa Rica’s .
Usually , you only find this sort of plummeting longevity ranking in countries occupied and exploited by brutal colonial powers that could give a damn how many natives die under their watch .
The Congo under Belgium ’s King Leopold saw lifespans plummet while a handful of royal outsiders looted the country as quickly as they could .
America is the new Congo : we ’re subject to a handful of King Leopold billionaire colonialists , like the veiny - headed freak Rick Scott , looting the wealth and murdering tens of thousands , employing embittered natives as thug collaborators to keep the local population from demanding better conditions for ourselves .
Scott is literally a Texas Chainsaw Massacre character — the one - time business partner of former President George W. Bush in the Texas Rangers scam , Scott made millions for himself in the 1990s by creating a health care monster called Columbia / HCA Healthcare Corp. , which defrauded American taxpayers out of billions through false Medicare bills .
It paid the largest corporate fraud fines in history — $ 1.7 billion — and squeezed even more money by downsizing staff to the point where “ babies were attended as infrequently as every three hours .
Once , the only nurse caring for seven ill infants was so busy she failed to hear an alarm when a baby stopped breathing .
A parent dashed to the baby and stimulated breathing , the state report said . ”
[ New York Times , 5/11/97 ]
Scott should not be allowed to walk free .
By any standard I know of , he is a traitor who profits off the deaths of Americans , and he should be tried for his crimes against this country .
All of his hundreds of millions of dollars are blood profits extracted from American corpses .
Rick Scott should be tarred and feathered , shipped off to Guantanamo until he gives up all of his blood money , and then strapped into a space capsule and fired off into deep space to ensure that this monster never harms another American again .
That ’s in a just world .
But in our Congo - America reality , Scott is a respectable oligarch , all over the airwaves and Washington as the leader of the Conservatives for Patient ’s Rights group , back in the health care clinic business , fighting to keep his loot and that of his fellow health care billionaires , at the expense of tens of thousands of American lives .
And guess what ?
He ’s winning .
He ’s winning because he ’s willing to see Americans die in order to enrich himself .
Two Congolese “ Tea Bagger ” patriots shown here defending their liberties : “ It ’s our choice to serve this Belgian overlord ’s wife , and no Native has the right to tell us not to ! ”
The colonized peoples of Africa , India , China and elsewhere had to fight to overthrow the vampires that ruled them and killed them .
It ’s time we understood that these people hate us , and America for them is merely a slaughterhouse whose profits fund their pat lives .
Until we understand what ’s at stake as much as they do , we ’ll never have a chance in hell of saving ourselves .
Late Note : Reuters today has an article on Health Care Wetbacks –American health care refugees who increasingly are slipping into Mexico to get reasonable health care treatment .
The article focuses on an ex-cop who has insurance , but still ca n’t afford treatment .
Imagine that : Tea Baggers and FreedomWorks scum literally forcing Americans to flee into Mexico just to stay alive .

Glenn Beck , of all people , is shocked , shocked we tell you , at the kind of langugage that 's being used to describe the ginned - up teabaggers who are invading health - care forums with the intent of disrupting them and destroying the discourse these events are intended to engender .
Yesterday on his Fox News show , he brought on Republican pollster Frank Luntz to shake his head :
Luntz :
And for the comments of people like actress Janeane Garofalo ... it 's hateful .
And it 's awful to use that word , Glenn .
But what 's coming out of the White House , the language that they are using , and that you see also occasionally from L.A. , is pure hate .
This , on the Glenn Beck show .
At least Beck had some vague awareness of this irony , and mentioned it a little earlier in the exchange , though without having thought through its implications :
Beck : I 'm looking at the words you used here : " right - wing extremists , " " desperate Republicans , " " angry mobs , " " the mob " , " manufactured anger , " " Brooks Brothers brigade . "
I do n't remember hearing these words coming from the Bush White House .
And I 'm not a defender of the Bush White House by any stretch of the imagination .
But I do n't remember anyone saying anything like that coming out of George Bush 's ... realm .
There are political hacks that said some awful things , um , but this ?
Really ?
Did we call Democrats " mobs " ?
Luntz :
It 's character assassination is what it is .
And it 's something that was learned under the Clinton administration .
They began this in ' 94 , ' 95 , we saw this with the whole Monica Lewinsky thing , when anyone said , ' Hey , what happened here ? ' , if you challenged the Clinton administration , they went after you , they went after your family , they went after your business .
It 's a viciousness that you see on the left .
Beck : Look , there is -- there was -- I 'm a political , um , um , talk - show host and anchor .
I have said vicious things .
That 's different than the administration coming out and saying these kinds of things .
You have an official endorsement of this kind of talk is dangerous in this country , is it not , Frank ?
Actually , Glenn , vicious talk gets " officially endorsed " when it is not only permitted and condoned but celebrated on television and radio shows like yours .
And when it 's you doing the talking , we hear that President Obama is a racist who hates white people and white culture ; that he 's leading the country down the path to fascism , or to socialism , or whatever flavor of totalitarianism you 're flinging about this week ; that his policies will enslave us .
But it 's good of you to notice that this kind of talk is indeed " dangerous " -- no matter who 's using it .
However , if you 'll notice , the only provocative talk coming out of the White House is actually more derisive and decidedly not hateful .
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called the protests " manufactured " and suggested they were like the " Brooks Brothers " protests in Florida in 2000 : " I hope people will take a jaundiced eye to what is clearly the Astroturf nature of grass - roots lobbying , " he said .
The language that most upsets Beck actually comes from Democratic National Committee communications director Brad Woodhouse :
" Republicans and their allied groups -- desperate after losing two consecutive elections and every major policy fight on Capitol Hill -- are inciting angry mobs of a small number of rabid right wing extremists funded by K Street Lobbyists to disrupt thoughtful discussions about the future of health care in America taking place in Congressional Districts across the country . "
Woodhouse said : " The right wing extremists ’ use of things like devil horns on pictures of our elected officials , hanging members of Congress in effigy , breathlessly questioning the president 's citizenship and the use of Nazi SS symbols and the like just shows how outside of the mainstream the Republican Party and their allies are .
This type of anger and discord did not serve Republicans well in 2008 -- and it is bound to backfire again . "
This again is more highly partisan than hateful , and not terribly different in that regard from what you might find at the Republican National Committee 's website ( where , among other things , you 'll find they 've already declared Obama 's presidency " a failed experiment after 200 days " ) -- though less so now , it seems , than in former years .
But commentary does n't have to come from the halls of officialdom to receive an official imprimatur , especially when it comes to movement conservatism , for whom the true seal of official approval is stamped " Rush Limbaugh " and " Glenn Beck . "
And from those two alone , the bile has been a deluge of Biblical proportions .
Funny that they should be the first to clutch their pearls and hit the fainting couch over the comparatively mild remarks coming from the DNC and the White House .
But then , that 's what we 've come to expect from these losers .
The Simpsons are household names all over the world
Only one in four could name more than one of the five freedoms it upholds but more than half could name at least two members of the cartoon family .
About one in five thought the right to own a pet was one of the freedoms .
A new museum dedicated to the First Amendment said the findings showed there was a pressing need to explain one of America 's basic laws better .
" We have our job cut out for us , " said Joe Madeira , director of exhibitions at the McCormick Tribune Freedom Museum .
Another finding from the poll , a telephone survey of 1,000 random adults with an error margin of 3 % , was that 22 % of Americans could name all five Simpson characters .
By comparison , just one in 1,000 people could name all five First Amendment freedoms .
The names of American Idol TV show judges and popular advertising slogans also proved more memorable than the five freedoms - speech , religion , press , assembly and petition for redress of grievances .
