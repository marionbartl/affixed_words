Fat women are traditionally seen as more desirable Obesity is so revered among Mauritania 's white Moor Arab population that the young girls are sometimes force - fed to obtain a weight the government has described as " life - threatening " .
A generation ago , over a third of women in the country were force - fed as children - Mauritania is one of the few African countries where , on average , girls receive more food than boys .
Now only around one in 10 girls are treated this way .
The treatment has its roots in fat being seen as a sign of wealth - if a girl was thin she was considered poor , and would not be respected .
But in rural Mauritania you still see the rotund women that the country is famous for .
They walk slowly , dainty hands on the end of dimpled arms , pinching multicoloured swathes of fabric together to keep the biting sand from their faces .
" I make them eat lots of dates , lots and lots of couscous and other fattening food , " Fatematou , a voluminous woman in her sixties who runs a kind of " fat farm " in the northern desert town of Atar , told BBC World Service 's The World Today programme .
When they are small they do n't understand , but when they grow up they are fat and beautiful
Fatematou
' Fat farm ' manager Although she had no clients when I met her , she said she was soon expecting to take charge of some seven - year - olds .
" I make them eat and eat and eat .
And then drink lots and lots of water , " she explained .
" I make them do this all morning .
Then they have a rest .
In the afternoon we start again .
We do this three times a day - the morning , the afternoon and the evening . "
Punishment
She said the girls could end up weighing between 60 to 100 kilograms , " with lots of layers of fat . "
Obesity is seen as a sign a husband cares for his wife Fatematou said that it was rare for a girl to refuse to eat , and that if they did , she was helped by the child 's parents .
" They punish the girls and in the end the girls eat , " she said .
" If a girl refuses we start nicely , saying ' come on , come on ' sweetly , until she agrees to eat . "
Fatematou admitted that sometimes the girls cried at the treatment .
" Of course they cry - they scream , " she said .
" We grab them and we force them to eat .
If they cry a lot we leave them sometimes for a day or two and then we come back to start again .
" They get used to it in the end . "
She argued that in the end the girls were grateful .
" When they are small they do n't understand , but when they grow up they are fat and beautiful , " she said .
" They are proud and show off their good size to make men dribble .
Do n't you think that 's good ? "
Change
However , the view that a fat girl is more desirable is now becoming seen as old - fashioned .
A study by the Mauritanian ministry of health has found that force - feeding is dying out .
Now only 11 % of young girls are force fed .
We 're fed up of fat women
Yusuf , 19 " That 's not how people think now , " Leila - a woman in the ancient desert town of Chinguetti , who herself was fattened as a child - told The World Today .
" Traditionally a fat wife was a symbol of wealth .
Now we 've got another vision , another criteria for beauty .
" Young people in Mauritania today , we 're not interested in being fat as a symbol of beauty .
Today to be beautiful is to be natural , just to eat normally . "
Some men are also much less keen on having a fat wife - a reflection of changes in Mauritanian society .
" We 're fed up of fat women here , " said 19 - year - old shop owner Yusuf .
" Always fat women !
Now we want thin women .
" In Mauritania if a woman really wants to get married I think she should stay thin .
If she gets fat it 's not good .
" Some girls have asked me whether they should get fat or stay thin .
I tell them if you want to find a man , a European or a Mauritanian , stay thin , it 's better for you .
But some blokes still like them fat . "
And while there still men who like their women big , Fatematou is on hand to fatten them up with her years of experience .
I asked her if she ever felt cruel , beating and force feeding children ?
" No !
It 's not cruel to make girls fat ! " she said .
" Me , I 've seen 10 - year old girls give birth .
I tell you , 10 years old !
" Once they are fat and beautiful they can serve their men well , once they are fat they can be married . "

Proving that you do n't have to be an official member of the Bush administration to be completely wrong about Iraq , in an appearance on last night 's Larry King Live , Laura Bush weighed in with her deep thoughts :
And many parts of Iraq are stable now .
But , of course , what we see on television is the one bombing a day that discourages everybody .
Yes , it 's that one bombing a day that 's getting us all down .
But of course , as is often ( always ) the case with her husband , reality tells another story .
And reality says that during this week alone , there has been 34 bombings in Iraq , which works out to nearly 5 a day .
But perhaps we should cut the First Decider some slack because after all , she has to live , 24/7 , with the knowledge that there are troops in harms way .
And how does she " balance " the stress of that knowledge ?
... we go to church .
We exercise together , we watch movies together .
We do all the other things that -- watch baseball on television , for instance -- that we both find relaxing .
KING : Do you -- do you talk about it a lot ?
BUSH : We talk about it a lot .
I mean , we live it .
So there you have it .
From the beautiful White House , Laura and George Bush are living the war in Iraq .
U.S. Air Force
“ WE ARE not planning for a war with Iran . ”
So said Robert Gates , America 's new defence secretary , on February 2nd .
You can not be much clearer than that .
With a weak and isolated president , and an army bogged down in the misery of Iraq , the American Congress and people are hardly in fighting mood .
Nonetheless , and despite Mr Gates 's calming words , Iran and America are heading for a collision .
Although the risk is hard to quantify , there exists a real possibility that George Bush will order a military strike on Iran some time before he leaves the White House two years from now .
America and Iran have been at loggerheads ever since Ayatollah Khomeini 's revolution of 1979 .
But four things are making this old antagonism newly dangerous .
One is Iran 's apparent determination to build nuclear weapons , and a fear that it is nearing the point where its nuclear programme will be impossible to stop ( see article ) .
The second is the advent of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , a populist president who denies the Holocaust and calls openly for Israel 's destruction : his apocalyptic speeches have convinced many people in Israel and America that the world is facing a new Hitler with genocidal intent .
The third is a recent tendency inside the Bush administration to blame Iran for many of America 's troubles not just in Iraq but throughout the Middle East .
Any one of these would be destabilising enough on its own .
Added together , they make the possibility of miscalculation and a slide into war a great deal more likely .
That is all the more so when they are combined with a fourth new source of friction between America and Iran .
This is the predicament of Mr Bush .
A president who is now detached from electoral considerations knows that his place in history is going to be defined by the tests he himself chose to put at the centre of his foreign policy : bringing democracy to the Middle East and preventing rogue regimes from acquiring weapons of mass destruction .
Given his excessive willingness to blame Iran for blocking America 's noble aims in the Middle East , he may come to see a pre-emptive strike on its nuclear programme as a fitting way to redeem his presidency .
That would be a mistake .
Never attack a revolution
This newspaper supported America 's invasion of Iraq .
We believed , erroneously , that Saddam Hussein was working to acquire nuclear weapons .
And we judged that the world should not allow a mass - murderer to gather such lethal power in his hands .
In the case of Iran , the balance of risks points , though only just , in the other direction .
Even if it became clear that Iran was on the threshold of acquiring an atomic bomb , an American strike on its nuclear facilities would be a reckless gamble .
Without America invading and occupying Iran — unthinkable after Iraq — such a strike would at best delay rather than end Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
It might very well rally support behind a regime that is at present not conspicuously popular at home , emboldening it to retaliate inside Iraq , against Israel and perhaps against the United States itself .
Besides , it is far from clear exactly how dangerous a nuclear - armed Iran would be .
Unlike Iraq under Saddam , Iran has a complex power structure with elements of pluralism and many checks and balances .
For all its proclaimed religiosity , it has behaved since the revolution like a rational actor .
To be sure , some of its regional aims are mischievous , and in pursuing them it has adopted foul means , including terrorism .
But the ayatollahs have so far been shrewd calculators of consequences .
There are already small signs of a backlash against the attention - seeking Mr Ahmadinejad .
Like the Soviet Union , a nuclear Iran could probably be deterred .
But do n't think Iran is n't dangerous
All of this suggests that in present circumstances it would be wrong for America to launch a military strike against Iran .
But it would be the height of self - deception for anyone to jump to the conclusion that a nuclear - armed Iran would not be dangerous at all .
It would be very dangerous indeed .
For a start , there is a danger that Iran 's nuclear efforts will provoke a pre-emptive strike by Israel , which is already a nuclear power , albeit an undeclared one .
For Israelis , whose country Mr Ahmadinejad says he wants to wipe off the map , it is not all that reassuring to hear that Iran can “ probably ” be deterred .
Even if Israel were to decide against such a strike , Iran 's going nuclear could destroy what is left of the international non-proliferation regime .
It has proved hard enough for Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia to live with Israel 's undeclared bomb ; if their Iranian rival got one too , the race to copy might soon be on .
On top of this is the danger that a nuclear Iran would feel safe to ramp up attempts to spread its revolution violently beyond its own borders .
Every effort should be made to stop an Iranian bomb .
But there is a better way than an armed strike .
In 2002 Mr Bush consigned Iran along with Iraq and North Korea to an “ axis of evil ” .
Since 2004 , for lack of good alternatives , he has been helping the efforts of Britain , France and Germany to talk rather than bludgeon Iran into nuclear compliance .
Iran claims that its nuclear programme is for civil purposes only .
Last year , the Europeans called its bluff by offering trade , civil - nuclear assistance and a promise of talks with America if it stopped enriching the uranium that could produce the fuel for a bomb .
When Iran refused , diplomacy led in December to the imposition of economic sanctions by the Security Council .
This is a promising approach .
The diplomacy at the United Nations proceeds at a glacial pace .
But Iran is thought to be several years from a bomb .
And meanwhile the Americans , Europeans , Russians and Chinese have at last all lined up on the same side of the argument .
What is required now is a further tightening of the economic squeeze coupled with some sort of an incentive — most usefully an unambiguous promise from Mr Bush that if Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear rules it will face no attempt by America to overthrow the regime .
Even then , America and Iran may be fated to lock horns in the Middle East .
But the region , and the world , will be a good deal safer without the shadow of an Iranian bomb .
_” Perfection is achieved , not when there is nothing left to add , but when there is nothing left to remove . ”
Antoine de Saint - Exupery _
Such a simple statement ; yet one of such power .
This statement carries a new impact as the concept of “ Extreme Simplicity ” gains ground .
The idea is that instead of focusing on adding more features ( Microsoft ) , do a few things , and do them very well ( Apple ) .
This is a great concept , focus on the user , focus on what the user spends most of their time doing and keep all the rest out - of - the - way .
I ’ll be the first to admit , I ’m addicted to gold plating .
If I think it ’s cool , I ’ll add it , which is most certainly at conflict with this concept .
This is one area were the two goals leave me quite torn , giving the user every feature possible versus a simple – even minimalistic interface .
All things considered though , this is where things are going .
Simple , intuitive designs sell ; it ’s that simple .
People expect technology of any form to fit in their lives , as simply as if it was n’t even there .
By building around the core of what the user does and minimizing fluff to enhance the user experience , you ’re giving the end users what they want .
As written by Andreas Pfeiffer , here are the 10 fundamental rules of Extreme Simplicity :
More features is n’t better , it ’s worse .
You ca n’t make things easier by adding to them .
Confusion is the ultimate deal - breaker .
Style matters .
Only features that provide a good user experience will be used .
Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users .
Unused features are not only useless , they can slow you down and diminish ease of use .
Users do not want to think about technology : what really counts is what it does for them .
Forget about the killer feature .
Welcome to the age of the killer user - experience .
Less is difficult , that ’s why less is more .
We all know that users do n’t want to think ; this design philosophy further refines the concept and simplifies it to the point that it can be applied to almost any form of technology .
By designing with a goal of maximizing simplicity , you create software that fits in the users ’ life , instead of fitting them into your product .
If you want your product to sell , find a way ( though difficult it may be ) for your product to be both indispensable and unobtrusive .
We still have not cracked the secret of Greek Fire , a napalm - like weapon of terror and unmitigated destruction unleashed by the Romaioi of Constantinople on besieging Arabs in the 7th century .
In fact , it 's possible that they did n't , either , at least after the time of its original deployment , as almost all of our knowledge of the substance is legend and literary legerdemain .
It 's entirely possible that the unextinguishable incendiary formula , which kept the Eastern Roman Empire in business for so long , was itself a pale copy of the stunning invention of a single genius , Kallinikos , who took the true , original recipe to his grave .
While a more sober reading of the facts suggests it lived and died with the Roman Empire itself , until 1453 , it 's easy to imagine the horror faced by anyone assaulting the city walls or leaping aboard an enemy trireme , only to see that odd metal pipe extending directly above their heads :
" Siphons ! " the old man said , as gouts of flame filled the darkness , pouring from the carved heads .
I stumbled backwards , the back of my skull cracking against the ground .
Pain blinded me , and I clutched at my scalp , hearing my sword clattering on the stone .
Hot blood wet my hair as fire spilled across the rock .
As I tried to rise , it fulminated over my shins .
...
The old man walked forward as soon as the torrent receded .
Drips of blazing light continued to drool from the stone dragons ' beaks .
" Naphtha , lime and old bones , " he said , without a hint of anger or fear .
" Not Greek ! "
Marlow said from within , his voice falling to a stammer .
" My own formula ! "
The key to its effectiveness was its ability to continue burning under any circumstances , even on the surface of water , making it a " wet , dark , sticky fire , " and a key maritime weapon .
Possible ingredients include sulphur , petroleum , quicklime , phosphorus , naptha and saltpeter .
But this is only the first twist in the tale , as with incendiary chemicals , the method is just as important , determining how the precursor chemicals are stored , the logistics of transport , and how they are mixed and deployed in battle .
Did greek fire ignite on contact with air , water , or naked flame ?
Were its fumes poisonous ?
How could such a devastating weapon remain a secret for so long ?
To know the truth , however , would be to rob the mystery of its allure –like nostalgia and futurism , the journey itself is always more rewarding than the destination .
n September 19th , 2006 , Python enthusiasts were rewarded with a new version .
Python 2.5 continues the honorable tradition of improving and enhancing the language carefully while extending its impressive standard library .
This article is the first part in a three - part series about Python 2.5 .
I 'll begin with a broad - stroke summary of the changes in Python 2.5 and set the stage for a detailed exploration .
The rest of this article discusses the major language enhancements in Python 2.5 .
Part 2 of this series will present the major new and improved modules in Python 2.5 , and Part 3 will discuss a whole bag of smaller improvements and changes that are relevant to specific subsets of the Python community .
Python 2.5 at a Glance
Python 2.5 introduced some significant language changes .
The venerable try - except and try - finally blocks have been unified .
The functional programming style got a boost via partial functions and other additions to the functools module .
The new ' with ' statement enables safer resource management and brings along the contextlib module .
Generators are more interactive and it is possible to insert values into existing generators .
Conditional expressions might seem a little weird at first , but there is a good reason for their syntax .
I 'll cover these features in the remainder of this article .
In the next article I 'll cover the ctypes , sqlite3 , and xml.etree .
ElementTree packages that are both super-cool and super - important for hassle - free deployments of Python systems without distributing a slew of external modules and libraries .
ctypes allows calling C code in dynamic libraries directly from Python code .
sqlite3 is a Python front - end to the excellent sqlite embedded database , and ElementTree is a highly pythonic and efficient XML parser .
Major Language Changes
Python 2.5 brings quite a few language enhancements while staying backward compatible with Python 2.4.x .
These include :
http://rubyforge.org/projects/hatenaapiauth/
先日ローンチしたはてな認証API の Ruby 版のモジュールを作りました。rubyforge にアップしたので、gem を使ってる人 は
# gem install hatenaapiauth
でインストールできるかと思います。perl の Hatena :: API :: Auth と同じインターフェイスです。認証に失敗すると例外
Hatena :: API :: AuthError が発生します。また認証時に返す値が perl 版では Hatena :: API :: Auth :: User を作って返してますが 、Ruby 版では Hash になってます 。
はてな認 証API を使った Rails の認証系 plugin も作れそうなのでそのうち作ろうと思ってます 。
以下は簡単なサンプルアプリとそのソース。gem パッケージの中の examples ディレクトリの中にも同じモノが含まれてます。

Update , September 2015 : I saw the HN thread about Dan Luu 's review of this post , and felt people were a little too generous with the scoring .
So I 'll offer my own scores and justifications here .
1 ) XML databases will surpass relational databases in popularity by 2011 .
Nope .
I had the right problem and right solution space , but called the wrong solution .
NoSQL data stores in their various incarnations apparently have equalled or slightly surpassed RDBMS as of 2014 - 2015 , according to some reports I just read .
I would have given myself a higher score if I had n't been so damned specific .
Score : 0.2
2 ) Someone will make a lot of money by hosting open - source web applications .
Yes , this became 100 % true .
It 's called PaaS now , and includes things like Google App Engine and Heroku .
Score : 1.0
3 ) Multi - threaded programming will fall out of favor by 2012 .
This is beginning to come true , on a language - by - language basis .
The Go language is a good example , as is parallel processing in big data .
Even in Java , you generally manipulate threads these days via robust higher - level abstractions such as concurrent data structures and worker pools .
I 'm not sure it 's " out of favor " yet , but alternative approaches have come a long way in the past 10 years .
Score : 0.5
4 ) Java's " market share " on the JVM will drop below 50 % by 2010 .
Definitely has n't hit 50 % .
However , Scala has really tremendous adoption , with quite a few large companies writing significant portions of their software in Scala -- LinkedIn , Twitter , Netflix , Tumblr , etc .
Groovy is also big , and there are large systems emerging in Groovy , notably Netflix Asgard , as well as the Gradle build system .
So while Java still accounts for the majority of software written for the JVM , there are thriving language communities that are gaining serious momentum .
Given that in 2004 , JVM languages were still pretty experimental , and today they 're being used to run large parts of Fortune 500 companies , I 'm giving myself a high - ish score , even though the percentage is n't there yet .
( Frankly , I think the main reason Java is still so big is that the Java language has become worlds better between Java 5 in 2004 and Java 8 today . )
Score : 0.7
5 ) Lisp will be in the top 10 most popular programming languages by 2010 .
Haha , no .
I had high hopes for Clojure for a while , but they 're fairly user - hostile , even if they think ( and loudly assert ) that they are n't .
I think Racket 's maybe the best thing going in Lisp - land these days .
But even I do n't use Lisp anymore , other than the occasional Emacs hacking .
Score : 0.0
6 ) A new internet community - hangout will appear .
One that you and I will frequent .
Well , yeah .
In retrospect it seems completely obvious , but at the time I wrote this , Facebook basically did n't exist .
Score : 1.0
7 ) The mobile / wireless / handheld market is still at least 5 years out .
Nope , it was 3 years out .
iPhone came out in 2007 .
Pretty easy to calculate this one .
Score : 0.6
8 ) Someday I will voluntarily pay Google for one of their services .
Yes , I 'm doing this now , for Google Cloud Platform , for my own external / personal / non - Google projects .
Call me a brand loyalist , but I 'm not on AWS .
I did n't anticipate that it would be for compute services , though , so I 'm not awarding myself full points .
Score : 0.8
9 ) Apple 's laptop sales will exceed those of HP / Compaq , IBM , Dell and Gateway combined by 2010 .
I screwed myself on this one .
I should have omitted the word " laptop " , so that I 'd be able to include phones and tablets , and it'd be a slam - dunk 1.0 score .
I shot myself in the foot , and Apple Macs only have 13 % market share as of late 2014 .
It looks like according to Wikipedia / Gartner , the non-Apple vendors I listed account for about 40 % .
Windows has continued to enjoy IMO surprising success , largely driven by the brand loyalty of generations of XBox and PC gamers , most of whom Microsoft successfully alienated at E3 two years ago .
Yay .
Unfortunately Apple is n't really going after that market , so Windows looks like it 's got some life left .
Yuck .
I would have given myself a 0.8 if I had n't restricted myself to laptops .
Oh well .
Score : 0.3
10 ) This one was a joke , arguably in poor taste , so : no score .
Total score : ( 0.2 + 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.7 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 0.6 + 0.8 + 0.3 ) / 9 = 57 % .
So accounting for slop in my scoring , I hit roughly 50/50 .
Is that good ?
I dunno .
Meh .
I encourage you to make your own public predictions for the next 10 years , and we 'll see how it goes !
There was also some discussion on HN about whether I thought NBL was JavaScript .
Yes indeed I did , and said so on stage at OSCON -- though I shouted it while they were dragging me offstage , so I 'm not sure if people heard me .
I did n't say as much in the blog post , though , because people would have eviscerated me .
I 'm glad it happened , in any event , and JavaScript seems to pick up more steam every year .
Good stuff !
( Original , unedited rant starts here )
Our industry seems to be changing faster over time .
It 's hard to keep up ; the best way to keep up seems to be to read a lot .
Serious programmers should read as much as they can .
I read as much as I can , but I still wish I had more time for it .
If you read a lot , you 'll start to spot trends and undercurrents .
You might see people talking more often about some theme or technology that you think is about to take off , or you 'll just sense vaguely that some sort of tipping point is occurring in the industry .
Or in your company , for that matter .
I seem to have many of my best insights as I 'm writing about stuff I already know .
It occurred to me that writing about trends that seem obvious and inevitable might help me surface a few not - so - obvious ones .
So I decided to make some random predictions based on trends I 've noticed , and see what turns up .
It 's basically a mental exercise in mining for insights .
Plus it 's a wonderful opportunity to kick the beehive and see which ideas generate the most indignant blog comments , which is always fun .
In this essay I 'll make ten predictions based on undercurrents I 've felt while reading techie stuff this year .
As I write this paragraph , I have no idea yet what my ten predictions will be , except for the first one .
It 's an easy , obvious prediction , just to kick - start the creative thought process .
Then I 'll just throw out nine more , as they occur to me , and I 'll try to justify them even if they sound crazy .
Important Note : the predictions themselves do n't matter !
Most of them are probably wrong .
The point of the exercise is the exercise itself , not in what results .
You should try this experiment yourself — it may show you things you 're thinking that you were n't really aware of .
And other people might find it interesting reading , even if there are factual errors or whatever .
Prediction # 1 : XML databases will surpass relational databases in popularity by 2011 .
Reason for prediction : Nobody likes to do O/R mapping ; everyone just wants a solution .
XML is the most popular vehicle for representing loosely - structured , heirarchical data .
Relational databases can't do this very well .
Many common types of data are intrinsically heirarchical and loosely structured , so storing them in an RDBMS can be difficult .
Examples : books , articles , and most other written documentation .
HTML .
Search indexes .
Filesystems .
Game worlds .
Classical music scores .
It 's just easier to model some things this way .
XML can be mapped straightforwardly to the objects and data structures of modern programming languages , so it works better than relational modeling for serializing things like object graphs .
It leads to much more natural persistence interfaces in programming languages than what you get with , say , JDBC or DBI .
The industry is in a heated race to improve XML databases .
All major RDBMS vendors are starting to support persistent , indexable , queryable XML .
There are various standards in the works , including XPath 2.0 , XQuery , XQuery 2.0 , XUpdate , XPointer , XLink , and who knows what else .
XML databases already support ( or will support soon ) transactions , indexing , CRUD , schemas , and many of the other trappings normally associated with an RDBMS .
Microsoft has prototyped embedding XPath support directly into the C# programming language ; rumor has it that C# will have a great deal of XML support in the near future .
XML is big , and it 's useful .
There 's a huge amount of attention on persisting it in something other than CLOBs .
XPath searching is amazingly rich , and XQuery , if it 's anywhere near as usable as SQL , will surpass SQL in expressive power .
So there 's every reason to expect that most data stores will eventually be XML stores .
( They may be relational under the hood , but that does n't count if the database is being used as an XML database . )
Incidentally , I just heard that that the University of Washington Databases course ( CSE 444 ) , which used to be almost 100 % about relational databases , is now 50 % relational and 50 % XML , focusing for the last half the quarter on concepts like DTDs , Schemas , XPath , XML / SQL interfaces , and XQuery .
Prediction # 2 : Someone will make a lot of money by hosting open - source web applications .
Reason for prediction : most small development shops would pay a monthly fee not to have to administer the apps themselves .
We 're rapidly entering the age of hosted web services , and big companies are taking advantage of their scalable infrastructure to host data and computing for companies without that expertise .
Most software development shops have a set of fairly similar applications for supporting development , and traditionally they 've administered these apps in - house .
But they do n't really want to be administering them .
Having a high - quality bug database is an enabler , but it does n't contribute directly to your bottom line .
You want a bug database to be a commodity application .
It just exists , and you enter bugs into it .
Same goes for your source - control system .
They 're a lot of work that 's just overhead .
You almost need a full - time administrator for these systems .
Backups , performance tuning , branch administration , lots of issues .
All you really want is for it to work , so you can focus on your problem domain .
For both bug databases and source - control systems , the obstacle to outsourcing them is trust .
I think most companies would love it if they did n't have to pay someone to administer Bugzilla , Subversion , Twiki , etc .
Heck , they 'd probably like someone to outsource their email , too .
This is exactly what dev teams within Amazon do .
They use Perforce , Wiki , Exchange and so on as services , which frees them up to focus on their goals .
But would an external dev team trust some big company like Amazon with with their intellectual property ?
Potential hosting companies might balk before trying it , guessing that most potential customers would hesitate before hosting their source code somewhere else .
However , my prediction is that someone will decide to try it .
And I think they 'll find that there are many , many dev teams in the world who are willing to pay a reasonable recurring fee for this service .
If a startup company were 100 % confident that their intellectual property ( IP ) is secure with an outsourcer , then it would boil down to a simple ROI analysis .
They 'll do whatever 's cheapest .
One of the most important brand characteristics that Amazon has established is trustworthiness .
Customers do n't give their trust lightly , especially with online transactions , but people trust Amazon .
It seems reasonable to assume that companies might trust Amazon as well .
There are other companies that could potentially do this innovation - infrastructure outsourcing , but not many .
They 'd have to establish several different kinds of trust .
If I 'm planning on outsourcing my development infrastructure , I 'd want an outsourcer who meets the following trust tests :
Honest —
I would want assurance that this company is n't out to steal my secrets , and that they will take the high road and not look at my stuff .
And there would have to be agreements and contracts in place that give me recourse options if they were to violate this trust .
Secure —
I 'd want to feel confident that the outsourcer will keep my data secure .
Even if the company is honest , I still want protection from people who are trying to steal my IP .
Security is especially sensitive because an innovation - infrastructure outsourcer would be a prime target for attackers .
Reliable — I 'd want 24x7 service ; my dev team should never be held up because the outsourcer 's systems are down , or slow , or buggy .
The outsourcer 's service latency , throughput , availability and quality are all critical factors in my decision process .
Responsive —
If there are issues , I need someone to contact .
I 'd expect to have multiple cost / response options ; if I want to minimize cost , I might settle for 2 - day turnaround , but I 'd be willing to pay more on a sliding scale for better support SLAs .
Comprehensive —
All else being equal , if two outsourcers offered similar packages , I 'd go with the one who gives me the most functionality .
I actually would want to put all my eggs in one basket .
I would n't want my bugs at company A , and my source code at company B , and my email at company C. Stable — I do n't want my outsourcer to go out of business ; at best I 'd have to take downtime to migrate everything in - house or to another outsourcer , and at worse , I 'd lose all my data .
It has to be a big , well - funded , stable company , which limits the field slightly .
Not all software development shops in the world are focused on building distributed computing platforms .
There are plenty of people working on important but domain - specific software .
Government , medical , automotive , insurance , aeronautics and astronautics , aviation , bioengineering , entertainment , education , you name it — there 's a lot of software being written in the world , and a lot of money riding on it .
So I predict that someone will come along and offer an innovation hosting service , and make a lot of money off it .
If I were the hosting company , I 'd use open - source products .
There is n't a huge amount of precedent for this model , but it seems like a good one .
So good , in fact , that it boggles my mind that nobody has started doing it yet .
There are lots of reasons to go with open - source .
For starters , there are plenty of polished , high - quality applications that you could begin hosting with almost no development effort .
And good open - source apps are usually well - documented ; you can even find books about most of the bigger ones .
So you would n't have to spend a bunch of time writing your platform documentation .
And you'd be able to tap into the thousands of developers who are already using those apps ( but hosting them themselves ) ; they'd have no learning curve and no technical barriers to migrating to your hosted version of the application .
It 's a no-brainer .
In fact , I quit .
I 'm going to go do this .
Bye !
Oops , scratch that .
Nobody would trust SteveySoft with their intellectual property .
They'd be afraid that I 'd laugh at their source code .
And with good reason , I might add .
So I guess someone else will have to do it .
Prediction # 3 : Multi - threaded programming will fall out of favor by 2012 .
Reason for prediction : Cost / benefit ratio is n't high enough .
If I were going to write the Ten Golden Rules of Software , the top of the list would be :
Error Prone == Evil
Although this concept is obvious to 99.999 % of the general population , it 's only accepted by 2 % of computer programmers .
The remaining 98 % subscribe to a competing philosophy , namely : " Error Prone = Manly " .
Never mind that they just assigned " Manly " to the variable " Error Prone " , and the expression always returns true ; that happens to be the correct value in this case , so it 's an acceptable hack .
So when safe alternatives to existing unsafe technologies come along , it takes about ten to fifteen years before everyone 's switched over .
Not that the unsafe users actually switch ; that 's just how long , on average , it takes the majority of them to be killed accidentally by their product , leaving only the new , safer programmers behind .
Hence , many programmers prefer to use C++ instead of far safer alternatives such as Java or Objective - C .
And many programmers prefer to use Perl instead of far safer alternatives such as Ruby or Python .
Many programmers prefer debugging weird problems in production over the much safer alternative of writing unit tests for their own code .
And virtually all programmers prefer programming by side - effect over safer alternatives such as functional or declarative programming .
Multi - threaded programming has officially been declared hazardous to your health since , oh , roughly the week after it was invented .
Everyone knew it was really tricky from the outset .
It provided all sorts of exciting and ( if I do say so myself ) rather manly new failure modes : deadlocks , livelocks , missed signals , race conditions , read / write conflicts , write / write conflicts , and so on .
But it did offer some ease - of - use advantages over IPC .
And C++ programs already crash or corrupt data so often that occasional threading errors do n't usually make much of a difference .
So multi - threaded programming was an instant hit .
Multithreading has been studied extensively to see if it can be made less error - prone .
And it can !
Concurrency theory researchers have generously provided us with a nice basket of rigorous mathematical tools for analyzing our concurrent programs , including the formal partial - order pi-calculus , the temporal propositional logic systems , the axiomatizing flat iteration scheduling algebrae , the much - loved quantum Chu space automata , and of course the ever - popular Brouwer - Heyting - Kolmogorov bisimulation and propositional intuitionistic logic , famous for its canonical model proving the bisimilarity of finite Kripke structures .
Sign me up !
Unfortunately the O'Reilly book for these models , The Quantum Chu -Space Cookbook ( colophon : Schroedinger 's Cat ) has n't hit the shelves yet ; it 's expected to be in copy - edit for another 47 years .
So software - engineering researchers have stepped in and published many books describing patterns , idioms , and best practices for multi-threading .
The most popular recommendation appears to be " do n't use threads " , although other thread design patterns include " do n't let them ever talk to each other " , " do n't ever kill runaway threads " , and " favor immutability over side - effects " ( although that 's widely considered to be an unmanly approach . )
So we have a nice basket of patterns , and even some O'Reilly books .
In the past , oh , 20 years since they invented threads , lots of new , safer models have arrived on the scene .
Since 98 % of programmers consider safety to be unmanly , the alternative models ( e.g. CSP , fork / join tasks and lightweight threads , coroutines , Erlang - style message - passing , and other event - based programming models ) have largely been ignored by the masses , including me .
Ironically , multi - threaded programming is far more popular among Java and Ruby programmers than among C++ and Perl programmers , who generally prefer using OS processes over threads .
I 'm not sure if that 's because Java and Ruby provide language - level thread support , or because it 's virtually impossible to write correct multi- threaded programs in C++ and Perl , or some combination of the two .
In any case , it 's interesting that Java and Ruby programmers use the most error - prone concurrency framework .
Anyway , the jury 's been out on threading vs. event - based programming for a long time , but now we 're in the distributed computing world , where event - based programming is the only option .
It seems to make sense to migrate to the event - based models , purely in the interest of using the same messaging and parallelism constructs for your in - process , inter- process , and distributed code .
I 'd say this has been widely known for about five years , so I predict that the programming community at large , even Java programmers , will finally deprecate multithreaded programming around seven or eight years from now .
That 's about par for the course .
Prediction # 4 : Java's " market share " on the JVM will drop below 50 % by 2010 .
In other words , over half the code written for the Java platform will not be Java .
It 'll be Python , Ruby , Haskell , Lisp , and a variety of other languages .
The Java programming language will become more like " assembly - language for the JVM " — something you use for building frameworks in Java , but most app code will be in higher - level languages compiled into Java bytecode .
Reason for prediction :
The Java core language is the weakest part of the otherwise strong Java platform .
People think they love Java because of the language , and to be sure , it 's more expressive ( in some ways ) than C and a lot saner than C ++.
But that does n't qualify it as a great language .
People actually love Java for a variety of reasons that are unrelated to the core language .
One reason is the huge , well - designed standard library .
It 's everything C++ should have had , but does n't .
Another reason is the platform :
The JVM and libraries present a clean abstraction of the underlying operating system .
It gives you access to the standard functionality of an OS , but that functionality is ( almost ) transparently portable .
People also like the security model , the reasonably intelligent community - standardization process , the high - quality tools such as Ant and Eclipse , the widely - available documentation , the mostly - usable built - in multithreading , and of course the community and the hype .
Oh , and they like Duke , Sun 's version of Mr. Tooth .
That 's a whole lot of reasons to like Java , even if you have reservations about the core language .
The Java language just is n't cutting it , though .
It 's really hard to see this if you 're coming from a C/ C++ background , because Java is so much better than C++ that it feels like you 've died and gone to Programmer Heaven .
Java has real strings , and real exceptions , and real namespaces , and and real runtime typing , and real pure - virtual interfaces , and a real security model , and real memory management , and a real library system , and fast compilation times , and it 's portable , and it does n't crash .
C++ is a miserable , poisoned purgatory , and Java delivers you from it .
So as you might imagine , it takes a few years before you start to chafe at Java 's limitations .
But Java is verbose and somewhat uncompressible : it lacks a macro system , so it 's not extensible in the way XML and Lisp are extensible .
What they decide to give you is all you 've got .
And it has no first - class functions , no preprocessor , no metaprogramming , and no templating system .
So it takes forever to say certain complex things in Java , and it's hard to to avoid certain kinds of code duplication .
Java code bases tend to be pretty large — smaller than equivalent C++ code bases , possibly , but you still wind up with a lot of code .
Java 's also not well - suited for dynamic , incremental development .
Java still uses the old batch - based development cycle : shut the app down , make your changes , recompile , start the app back up , get it back to its previous state , and THEN test your changes .
It sucks to restart your app every time you want to do so much as change a string literal in your code .
Java development is much slower than it needs to be .
Much faster than C++ development , but still slow .
The JVM supports other languages — not very well , not as well as .NET or ( maybe ? ) Parrot .
But well enough .
And Groovy has finally got the Java community is starting to notice higher - level languages , even if Groovy itself is awful .
It will be interesting to see what happens .
I suspect that most Java programmers wo n't upgrade to the new languages , but lots of people coming to the JVM from other platforms will use those languages .
So I predict that in six years , less than half of all ( new ) Java bytecode will be compiled from Java code .
Prediction # 5 : Lisp will be in the top 10 most popular programming languages by 2010 .
Reason for prediction : Lisp is a keeper .
And it 's getting a lot of good press these days .
I think it 'll be in the top 10 , but not in the top 5 .
If you count all Lisp dialects including Scheme , it might make # 6 , though .
That would include ANSI Common Lisp , Emacs Lisp , Scheme , Guile , Arc , and probably a few other dialects as well .
Heck , if you just count lines of code , Lisp is already the fourth most - used language in a RedHat Linux distribution .
There are some other very solid functional - programming languages out there ;
Lisp is n't the only player in the field .
Each of them has its advantages : Erlang has the world 's best distributed - computing facilities ;
Haskell appears to be the world 's most elegant and succinct language ; OCaml binaries fairly consistently outperform C++.
Most functional languages are pretty nice in at least one dimension .
But Lisp has a secret weapon : Paul Graham .
Programming languages do n't become successful based on their technical merits .
The masses of programmers out there do n't know or care about technical merit .
They just want someone to look up to , someone to tell them what to do .
Languages are religions , and religions need a spiritual leader .
It 's best if it 's a person , but a faceless corporation will do in a pinch , if they have a good marketing department .
And now Lisp has a new thought - leader and champion in Paul Graham : successful author ; influential essayist ; inventor of Yahoo !
Store ; the man who killed Spam .
He has an impressive resume , and he appears to be only just getting started .
He 's creating the next - generation Lisp ( called " Arc " ) , and his essays have been making the world sit up and pay attention .
Largely because of Paul 's leadership , everyone 's talking about Lisp .
And as luck would have it , when the world started sniffing around for Lisp documentation , they found it .
Lots of it .
Lisp is the most thoroughly documented language in the world .
There are hundreds of published books about Lisp , and hundreds of others in various fields that use Lisp as their primary language .
Although many are out of print , since Lisp did go through a slump there in the 90's , there are at least a hundred Lisp books in print , with new ones coming out every month .
There 's more online documention available for Lisp than for any other language , in the form of articles , wikis , tutorials , manuals , and sample code .
Once you start looking , it starts to feel like Lisp is everywhere .
It 's the extension language for many Gnu tools ( Gimp , Gnome , Emacs ) .
It 's the first programming language they teach you at U.C. Berkeley , MIT , and several other major universities .
There are several high - quality Lisp implementations for the Java VM that compile down to Java bytecode , and several implementations for .NET as well .
Heck , they even used Lisp for much of the computer animation in Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings .
And would n't you know it : Lisp was one of the only two languages originally allowed at Amazon ( the other being ANSI C ) .
Bet you a dollar you did n't know what .
Oh , and an Amazon dev team over in Slough is using Common Lisp right now .
Hi , guys !
Maybe I 'm wrong .
Maybe it will be in the top 5 by 2010 .
We 'll see .
But I think I need to brush up on my Lisp .
Prediction # 6 : A new internet community - hangout will appear .
One that you and I will frequent .
Reason for prediction : People like to socialize .
Where 's the internet community ?
I do n't see it .
People do n't hang out on Amazon 's website , or Google 's , or eBay 's , or Microsoft's .
Not anywhere , really .
There are little chat rooms here and there , and some static link - in sites where you can answer a bunch of questions about your hair color and favorite taco sauce .
Yawn .
Someone told me recently that the consensus among online gamers is that the success of Sony 's EverQuest is largely due to its strong in - game community .
In order to support so many simultaneous players , Sony had to make the monsters really tough , and you have to spend a long time ( like half an hour ) healing after every fight .
So people have nothing to do but sit around campfires and taverns , and socialize .
Hey , remember AOL ?
There 's a blast from the past , eh ?
Oh wait , I guess they 're still around .
Admittedly no self - respecting geek would ever use AOL , but you have to admit : AOL 's big draw , for those who use it , is the community features .
And that 's a big draw .
Big enough to let AOL buy giant entertainment / media conglomerates like Time Warner .
Socialization has to be real - time ; i.e. , things like chat rooms , IRQ , instant messaging .
But those are so boring , so passé .
People also need a reason to hang out , some sort of shared goal or shared frustration that gives them something to talk about during those awkward silences .
Like , games .
Or sports .
Or gambling .
Or discussion groups about books with names like " He 's Just Not That Into You : The No- Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys . "
It 's an uncomfortable truth that most Americans spend the majority of their free time watching television .
They like their mindless entertainment .
But going to the movies is more fun , because there are people there , all ooh - ing and aaah - ing and boo-ing along with you .
Too bad you can't go to the movies and stay at home on your couch simultaneously , eh ?
Games , movies , and chat rooms are all converging , because people want to hang out , be entertained , and be slightly challenged , all while sitting on their couch .
Or possibly sitting in an internet cafe , as 5 percent of the population of Korea does at any given time , playing the online game " Lineage " .
They 've got it figured out better than most other countries .
Wikis , newsgroups , mailing lists , bulletin boards , forums , commentable blogs — they 're all bullshit .
Home pages are bullshit .
People want to socialize , and create content , and compete lightly with each other at different things , and learn things , and be entertained : all in the same place , all from their couch .
Whoever solves this — i.e. whoever creates AOL for real people , or whatever the heck this thing turns out to be — is going to be really , really rich .
Prediction # 7 : The mobile / wireless / handheld market is still at least 5 years out .
Reason for prediction :
My spider - sense is n't tingling yet .
Every year for at least the past decade , pundits have been predicting that next year will be the Year of Wireless Mobile Computing .
They say every human being and most pets on the planet will spend the majority of their disposable income on mobile wireless services for their tiny handheld supercomputer phones .
These devices will have 1900x1200 resolution , 1500 - hour battery lives , T1 connection speeds , microsecond latency , a reception range that covers the planet surface to a depth of six miles , and will cost less than a pack of Mentos .
Every year , it 's next year .
Every next year , it does n't happen .
And you know what ?
Frankly , I 'm getting tired of hearing about it .
When I go to Best Buy or Costco or Rat Shack , I do n't see tiny handheld devices and service plans that are " almost " tempting .
What I see is crap that I would n't buy with someone else 's money .
Every three years I buy the latest and greatest wireless handheld PDA gizmo , and without fail , the gizmos have wound up with a centimeter - thick layer of dust on them .
I have a cold , dead Sharp Zaurus sitting within my peripheral vision even as we speak .
They were going to offer some sort of wireless cellular modem for it , " any time now " .
I was ready to sign up for the service .
I even tried — I called and called , and watched their website like a hawk .
But the service was , alas , never to appear , not even after 18 months of waiting .
My money is still safe in my wallet .
The hip trend for dying companies these days is to change focus overnight , and announce : " We 're making a play in the Wireless market " .
Look a Real Networks .
Or Geoworks .
Or AnythingWorks .
Saying you 're going into Wireless is a hail - Mary play ; a last - ditch attempt to secure another round of VC funding while you pray for the mobile market to explode soon .
Maybe even next year .
But the carriers do n't know what the hell they 're doing , and the content and distribution models are n't worked out yet , and wo n't be for a long time .
A lot of players need to get their collective acts together for the mobile market to take off , and it just has n't been happening .
And today 's mobile devices still suck .
I 'm sure it 's nice to be able to read your Outlook email on your $ 500 Blackberry , but I doubt teenagers are and housewives quite as enamored of the idea as you are .
And I 'm sure it 's nice to be able to scrape enough grease off your PocketPC - phone LCD to deep - fry a country turkey , but it 's maybe not so nice that the grease came from your face .
Do n't get me wrong : it will happen someday .
But I think it 's not going to be any time soon .
Betcha !
Prediction # 8 : Someday I will voluntarily pay Google for one of their services .
Reason for prediction :
They 're putting technological heroin in their services , and someday they 're going to start charging .
Every year I fork over hundreds and hundreds of dollars to Amazon , buying techie books , video games , clothes , kitchen stuff , all sorts of goodies .
And I fork over about three times that much to Starbucks , for lattes .
( My New Year 's Resolution this year was to make absolutely sure I never calculated how much I spend at Starbucks .
2 months to go ! )
I 've never paid Google a dime , as far as I know , and I 'd venture to guess that I 've spent a lot more time on their website than on Amazon's .
Or Starbucks '.
I do a lot of Googling for free , and so do you .
For the life of me , I do n't know how they make their money .
Maybe I 'm missing something really obvious here , but I do n't see how they can be a 2 gazillion dollar company , or whatever they are nowadays , purely on search engine sales and ad revenues .
I was under the impression that internet companies that make money make it from consumers .
B2B failed .
Eyeball counting failed .
Well , that 's what I thought , anyway .
But I can tell you this : Google has changed my life .
If I can't find what I 'm looking for in Google in 3 tries , looking no further than the first 10 search results on each try , then it probably does n't exist .
Google is every bit as important a programmer - tool for me as my compiler is .
And it 's pretty darn important for my day - to - day life , too .
As one example , I never use a phone book anymore .
Want Uwajimaya 's number ?
Type " Uwajimaya " into Google .
You can even find it by spelling it incorrectly as " Uwajamaya " .
I just tried it .
Google is , for now at least , the font of all knowledge .
There are a few upstarts here and there — Wikipedia , IMDB , dictionary.com , and a handful of other reasonably useful information sources .
Even Amazon 's search - inside - the - book is handy pretty often .
But I still use Google a hundred times as often as those other sources combined .
And just when I thought they had it licked , they came out with the desktop search appliance .
I just installed it yesterday .
Only took 10 seconds .
I proceeded to forget about it immediately .
A few minutes later , one of my normal Google searches scared the pants off me — it turned up some stuff that I thought only existed on my computer .
Oh .
Duh .
LXR ?
I doubt it 'll be useful anymore , once Google has indexed my source code , which I 'm sure it has .
Lemme check .
Yup .
I just typed a Java identifier name into my IE Google toolbar , and the first two search results were source files that I 'd written .
( Bizarrely , it 's not pulling up the file when I click on it , though .
Maybe I have the . java extension bound to some app that 's not starting up . )
In any case , Google has just changed my life again , this time by organizing my filesystem for me .
Sort of .
It 's just the way it was before , but now nothing is lost .
And believe you me , up until yesterday , I used to misplace documents frequently .
I had things stashed in too many places .
But it 's suddenly a non-issue .
They 're all in my browser window now .
And I still have n't ever paid Google a dime .
But I 'm convinced — someday , I will .
As soon as they want me to .
Prediction # 9 : Apple 's laptop sales will exceed those of HP / Compaq , IBM , Dell and Gateway combined by 2010 .
Reason for prediction : Macs rule .
Windows laptops are as exciting as a shiny disco ball in the ceiling .
I bought a Powerbook for my wife Linh about 8 months ago , and she uses it so much that I can't even sneak a peek at it once in a while .
I just looked over at its little spot on our desk , and it 's not there .
She 's using it right now .
I bet she 's on that thing for 3 hours a day at least , maybe more — playing games , reading mail , surfing the web , sharing pictures with her sisters .
Doing Google searches , and I did n't tell her about Google .
She just sorta found it .
Before I bought her that Powerbook , her average computer usage was around an hour a year .
When 's the last time you saw a movie in the theater , and someone was using a laptop , and it was n't some flavor of Mac ?
I think it 's been at least 3 years for me .
Everyone in the movies uses Macs , because Macs are hip .
They 're in .
That 's what you use if you 're cool .
You see them in TV commercials , TV shows , movies .
You see them on airplanes , and at Starbucks .
You see them in your co-workers ' cubes .
Macs are a triple - threat right now : they 're trendy ( which rarely correlates with quality ; it 's simply a marketing feat ) , they 're actually easy to use for non-computer users , and they 're a powerful platform for developers and power - users .
There 's something there for everyone .
Actually , I know exactly squat about laptop sales figures , and I do n't know what Apple 's market share is , or how fast it 's growing .
And this blog has gone on so long that I do n't feel like researching it right now , even though Google would probably tell me in under 10 seconds .
But I can tell you that their market share is growing .
Fast .
Any idiot could tell you that .
I can tell you because I want one .
Bad .
And the desire is growing .
My rule of thumb for products and services is : if I would go pay for it today , then it 's going to be big .
( If I 'd stand in line to pre-order it , it 'll be huge ) .
It 's not always an accurate predictor , but it 's pretty reliable .
If you 're building a product or a service , and you keep thinking to yourself : " I would n't use this .
Who would use this ?
I do n't know anyone who would use this , " then it 's a sure bet that you 're right , and nobody will use it .
Investors and marketeers and executives and product managers regularly fool themselves into thinking that something will be cool , but when it lauches , it 's a flop .
That 's because they 're building things for other people .
But that 's not the way great things get built .
You have to build them for yourself .
Apple does things right .
Steve Jobs is a smart guy .
I do n't think Microsoft really builds things for themselves , or maybe they 're just not very good at knowing what they like .
I 'm using Windows machines today , but only because the open - source community has helped turn Windows into a reasonable platform .
I 'm using Windows mostly for the device drivers ; in most respects , my Windows desktop looks like Unix .
But now the open - source community likes Macs just as much as you and I do .
So before long , maybe even now , Macs will be a better choice for the majority of my computer activities , including programming .
And when that happens , who would buy a PC laptop ?
Not me , that 's for sure .
My next one will be a Mac .
Prediction # 10 : In five years ' time , most programmers will still be average .
Reason for prediction :
That 's just how the math works out .
Of course most programmers will still be average , by definition .
The problem is that the average level of quality and productivity probably wo n't have changed all that much .
The difference between great hackers and average plodders is a hundred - fold , which implies great potential for improving the average .
But I doubt the industry average productivty / quality per-capita output will go up even 50 % over the next 5 years , let alone 2 orders of magnitude .
Partly because there are too many J2EE consultants out there ruining the numbers .
But more importantly , most people are just doing this gig for a living .
So most people will still be average , and average will still be ho-hum .
What will you be ?

Interesting stuff all around .
I just thought I would mention that I got the hairs raising on the back of my neck feeling when I reached number 4 .
Just this morning I dusted off my copy of " Jython Essentials " in another attempt to sneak into the world of Java development by using a different language , and had been enjoying it immensely .
Do you happen to know the names of any of the LISP dialects that are available on the JVM ?
Posted by : Brian W. at November 12 , 2004 11:35 PM
Cool .
Last time I got that feeling was after watching The Ring by myself one night .
Jython 's a good choice , possibly the best one right now .
Clean , simple , powerful language , and it does n't have anything missing ; you can do anything in Jython that you can in Java , including subclassing Java classes .
And there are at least two books out on it , maybe three .
I 've done a lot of programming in Jython , and I still enjoy it quite a bit .
Armed Bear Common Lisp is ( apparently ) the best - supported CL implementation for the JVM .
I 'm going to be experimenting with it over the next week or two .
Kawa
Scheme is by far the most complete Lisp implementation for the JVM , and has bells and whistles you 'd scarcely believe .
It 's even got CL - style macros and the ability to use static typing , which even Jython does n't have .
It 's amazing .
Kawa 's main problem is that it's not yet a drop - in replacement for Java ; for instance , when I checked 2 months ago , there was no way to declare a non -default constructor that took parameters , although Per Bothner was allegedly going to add it soon .
But I do n't think anyone has made a concerted effort to check whether Kawa matches Java feature - for - feature .
Needs to happen at some point , or there will be certain Java APIs you simply can't use .
A secondary problem with Kawa is that the docs do n't teach you Scheme ; they just explain the diffs between Scheme and Kawa , and give you a brief overview of what the JVM integration looks like .
I think the only way to get up to speed on it , really , is to work your way through the examples in a Scheme book ( or books ) with Kawa , and whenever something does n't work , look at Kawa 's docs to figure out how Kawa does it .
Those are the two I 'm planning on using from now on .
I 've decided that I can't waste any more time ; if Lisp is the future , then I need to master it , and the only way to do that is to program in it .
So I 'm going to do ALL my personal coding in Lisp and Scheme from now on ( * gulp * ) , mostly on the JVM though , so I can at least ease into it by knowing the libraries already .
Good luck !

Steve , you got yourself a bad case of ' Paul Graham ' - itis ...
You need to seriously stop reading / buying into his Lisp self - indulgence .
Lisp and the like have existed for years ... you do n't see them taking over yet , do you ?
They have n't and they wo n't .
I admire the guy do n't get me wrong , but sometimes I think he's on the verge of being delusional ...
Posted by : Anonymous at November 15 , 2004 08:17 AM
Hello Anonymous Commenting Person ,
Paul Graham has to be that way .
Not just because he 's a rich bastard who ( with two friends ) implemented an application in Lisp that we 've been unable to match at Amazon , and Yahoo bought him out for $ 40 million in stock that proceeded to soar .
That 's not the main reason he comes off the way he does , although as far as I 'm concerned , it gives him at least a halfway decent excuse .
Paul comes off the way he does because he 's good at marketing , and he realizes that in a world full of egotistical programmers , the only way to be heard in all the noise is to be an arrogant bastard .
Stroustroup 's the same way , and James Gosling has a big company that can set him up on a pedestal , or he'd have to be that way too .
And Larry Wall - well , Larry outdoes them all .
Larry says that God talks to him and tells him He only likes Perl programmers .
If Paul Graham appears to be delusional to you , read some of Larry 's speeches sometime , like this one : http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html
We work in a fashion industry , and marketing really matters .
Paul 's marketing is getting the appropriate attention , so you can't fault his methods .
I 'll stick with my prediction .

Cascading dialogs are a common thing web developers want to do .
This is often a major pain in traditional web frameworks .
Seaside and Scriptaculous make this a trivial task without posting back the form or pre-loading all the data at the client .
Let 's build a simple component to demonstrate this .
First , we need some data to put in these drop downs , lets play with Smalltalk reflection and use all the subclasses of WAComponent , and all their categories as our data sources .
For the first drop down list , the categories .
We collect all the categories from all the subclasses , flush out the dupes by sending asSet .
Since categories are just strings , we can sort them alphabetically by sending asSortedCollection .
componentCategories ^( WAComponent allSubclasses collect : [ : each | each category ] ) asSet asSortedCollection
Now , we 'll need to store the currently selected category , so we create accessors for that ...
currentCategory ^currentCategory currentCategory : aCategory currentCategory := aCategory
Now we 'll need a list of all the components in the currently selected category for the second drop down list ...
components ^( WAComponent allSubclasses select : [ : each | each category = self currentCategory ] ) asSortedCollection : [ : a :b | a name < b name ]
So we select matching classes , and then alphabetize them with a sort block on the classes name .
We 'll also want to store the current component , so we 'll create accessors for that as well ...
currentComponent ^currentComponent currentComponent : aComponent currentComponent := aComponent
OK , this gives us a model capable of having a currentCategory , currentComponent , and the data sources necessary for rendering the UI .
Ordinarily you'd be getting this data from a database or something , but the Smalltalk class hierarchy will do for demonstration purposes .
Now let 's render the Seaside UI , which will consist of the following three methods .
I like to factor down to very small methods , this comes in handy when you start wanting to re-render small parts of a page .
renderContentOn : html super renderContentOn : html .
html form : [ self renderCategoriesOn : html ] renderCategories
On : html ( html select ) id : # theCategory ; list : self componentCategories ; on Change : ( ( html updater ) id : # theComponents ; triggerFormElement : # theCategory ; on : # renderComponentsOn : of : self ) ; on : #currentCategory of : self .
( html span ) id : # theComponents ; with : [ self renderComponentsOn : html ] renderComponentsOn : html ( html select ) list : self components ; on : #currentComponent of : self
That 's it , we 've rendered the form , the category list , bound it to the componentCategories we created earlier .
Hooked an updater to the #onChange : event to make it re-render the contents of the span named # theComponents , which is the second drop down list .
The second list has its own render method , so that it can be rendered by itself , a necessity for binding the updater to it , and we simply call that method in the initial rendering when we first render the span that contains it .
Now whenever the selected item changes , an Ajax callback is invoked , and the contents of the span are replaced with a re-rendered list after it updates the currentCategory .
If you tossed in a submit button , you could then post the form and do something useful with the data , but I 'll leave that as an exercise for the reader .
One last thing to note , we did n't write a lick of Javascript , it was all done in pure Smalltalk .
For almost 60 years , the evidence of Britain 's clandestine torture programme in postwar Germany has lain hidden in the government 's files .
Harrowing photographs of young men who had survived being systematically starved , as well as beaten , deprived of sleep and exposed to extreme cold , were considered too shocking to be seen .
As one minister of the day wrote , as few people as possible should be aware that British authorities had treated prisoners " in a manner reminiscent of the German concentration camps " .
Many other photographs known to have been taken have vanished from the archives , and even this year some government officials were arguing that none should be published .
The pictures show suspected communists who were tortured in an attempt to gather information about Soviet military intentions and intelligence methods at a time when some British officials were convinced that a third world war was only months away .
Others interrogated at the same prison , at Bad Nenndorf , near Hanover , included Nazis , prominent German industrialists of the Hitler era , and former members of the SS .
At least two men suspected of being communists were starved to death , at least one was beaten to death , others suffered serious illness or injuries , and many lost toes to frostbite .
The appalling treatment of the 372 men and 44 women who were interrogated at Bad Nenndorf between 1945 and 1947 are detailed in a report by a Scotland Yard detective , Inspector Tom Hayward .
He had been called in by senior army officers to investigate the mistreatment of inmates , partly as a result of the evidence provided by these photographs .
Insp Hayward 's report remained secret until last December , when the Guardian secured its release under the Freedom of Information Act .
The photographs seen here were removed before the Foreign Office released the report , apparently because the Ministry of Defence did not wish them to be published .
That decision was reversed last week , following an appeal by the Guardian .
One of the men photographed , Gerhard Menzel , 23 , a student , was arrested by British intelligence officers in Hamburg in June 1946 .
He had fallen under suspicion because he was believed to have travelled to the British - controlled zone of Germany from Omsk in Siberia , where he had been a prisoner of war .
His weight , measured several weeks after his arrest at 10st 3lb , had fallen to 7st 10lb by the time he was transferred from Bad Nenndorf to a British - run internment camp eight months later .
In the meantime , he told Hayward , his hands had been chained behind his back for up to 16 days at a time , periods during which he was repeatedly punched in the face .
He had also been held in a bare , freezing cell for up to two weeks at a time and doused in cold water every 30 minutes from 4.30 am until midnight , a practice the detective discovered to have been common .
A doctor at the internment camp reported that Mr Menzel was one of a group of 12 inmates transferred from Bad Nenndorf , all emaciated and dressed in rags .
Previous arrivals had also been half - starved .
Some had facial scars , apparently the result of beatings .
A few had scars on their shins , said to be the result of torture with shin screws which had been retrieved from a Gestapo prison at Hamburg .
Mr Menzel " was only skin and bones , " the doctor wrote .
" He could neither walk nor stand up without assistance , and could only speak with difficulty because his tongue and lips were swollen and broken open .
" It was impossible to take his body temperature because it was not higher than 35 degrees Celsius and the thermometer only starts at 35 . "
The prisoner was also confused , anxious and suffering memory loss , his lungs were badly infected and his blood pressure was dangerously low .
Only after being washed , fed and heated with lamps could his body temperature be raised to 36.3C , but the doctor feared his chances of survival were slim .
Another man pictured , Heinz Biedermann , 20 , a clerk , had been arrested in October 1946 because he was in the British zone , while his father , who lived at Stendal in the Russian zone , had been identified as " an ardent communist " .
By the time he was transferred from Bad Nenndorf four months later his weight had fallen from 11st 3lb to 7st 12lb .
He said he had been held in solitary confinement for much of the time , threatened with execution , and forced to live and sleep in sub - zero temperatures while barely clothed .
One British army guard told Inspector Hayward that Mr Biedermann had " wasted like a candle " during his imprisonment .
Another , a private in the Essex Regiment , told the detective that he complained that he and his comrades were behaving as badly as Germans .
" I became very unpopular after this ... the sergeant appeared to take a poor view of my remarks . "
On Mr Biedermann 's transfer to the internment camp , an officer at Bad Nenndorf requested he be detained " for an adequate time " to prevent him giving the Soviets " detailed information on this centre and methods of interrogation " .
Foreign
Office records show that the navy officer commanding the internment camp , Captain Arthur Curtis , was so shocked by the condition of the men being sent to him that he ordered these photographs be taken to support his complaints about the treatment of these " living skeletons " .
Photographs of several other prisoners , taken at the same time , appear to have vanished from the Foreign Office files .
On the other side of the British zone , meanwhile , a Royal Artillery officer was complaining about the state of Bad Nenndorf inmates who were being dumped from a truck at the entrance to a military hospital .
Some weighed little more than six stones , and two died shortly after their arrival .
The records show that Bad Nenndorf was run by a War Office department called the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre ( CSDIC ) .
By late 1946 , CSDIC appears to have lost interest in Nazis , and was targeting communists .
It appears the prisoners were questioned about Soviet methods and intentions , rather than about the Communist party itself .
Some of Bad Nenndorf 's inmates were indeed spying for the Soviets : one prisoner , who was half - Norwegian and half - Russian , told Hayward he was an officer in the NKVD , the predecessor of the KGB , and had been operating continuously in Germany since 1938 .
Another , a German journalist who had been freed by the Soviets from a Gestapo prison , was caught flying into Croydon aerodrome with false British papers .
Both men were starved and badly tortured .
Others clearly were not spies , however .
One man who was starved to death was a gay ex-soldier caught with forged papers while crossing into the British zone in search of his lover , while the other was a young German who was being interrogated because he had volunteered to spy for the British in the Russian zone , and was wrongly suspected of lying because of an official error over his medical records .
Four British officers were court martialled after Hayward 's investigation .
Declassified documents show that the hearings were held largely behind closed doors to prevent the Soviets from discovering that Russians were being detained .
Another consideration was admitted to be the determination to conceal the existence of several other CSDIC prisons .
While it is now known that one interrogation centre was in central London , little is known about those in Germany , other than their locations .
Following the courts martial , the prison at Bad Nenndorf , which was in a converted bath - house , was replaced with a purpose - built interrogation centre near an RAF base at Gütersloh , and orders were issued for inmates to be examined by a doctor before interrogation .
It is unclear when this centre closed .
The only officer at Bad Nenndorf to be convicted was the prison doctor .
At the age of 49 , his sentence was to be dismissed from the army .
The commanding officer , Colonel Robin Stephens , was cleared of a charge of " disgraceful conduct of a cruel kind " and told he was free to apply to rejoin his former employers at MI5 .

Trotz einiger spektakulärer Projekte , die Linux als Client - Betriebssystem einsetzen , dominiert Microsoft den Desktop mit erdrückender Übermacht .
Warum fällt es Linux so schwer , außerhalb der Serverwelt Fuß zu fassen ?
Alljährlich zum Jahreswechsel vollzieht sich das gleiche Ritual : Experten resümieren das alte Jahr und versorgen uns mit einem Ausblick auf die heißen Themen des neuen Jahres .
Dauerbrenner dabei ist das seit Jahren immer wieder prophezeite Jahr des Linux - Desktops .
Mehrere Linux - Anbieter haben Desktop - Lösungen im Programm , und spektakuläre Projekte wie die dieses Jahr beginnende Migration von 14.000 Arbeitsplatztrechnern bei der Stadt München auf Linux zeigen , dass Linux durchaus Chancen auf dem Desktop hat .
Aber nachdem sich rund 97 Prozent der computernutzenden Weltbevölkerung bis heute nicht an die Prophezeiung halten , werden die Stimmen , die Linux auf dem Desktop kurz vor dem Durchbruch sehen , zunehmend leiser .
Dabei sind die Ansprüche der meisten Computernutzer an den Desktop recht gering : Programme starten und Dateien öffnen , kopieren und löschen , mit der Maus , versteht sich .
Alles weitere fällt streng genommen schon in den Verantwortungsbereich von Dienstprogrammen und Anwendungen .
Die schlichte Datei - und Applikationsverwaltung beherrschen die Linux - Desktops von KDE bis Gnome schon seit Jahren ; heutzutage sind sie durchaus mit den Bedienoberflächen von Windows und Mac OS vergleichbar .
Unterschiede sind eher geschmacklicher Art , als dass der Funktionsumfang große Lücken aufweisen würde .
Und trotzdem bleiben die meisten Windows - Nutzer bei ihrem System , trotz der unbestreitbaren Anziehungskräfte Freiheit , Flexibilität und Sicherheit bei Linux .
Marktanalyse
Wer mit E - Mail , Browser und einem Office - Paket zufrieden ist , kann problemlos unter Linux glücklich werden .
Mittlerweile gibt es sogar schon einige Fach - oder Spartenanwendungen .
Zwei Jahre , nachdem Novell mit Ximian und Suse eine Portion Linux - Desktop - Know - How eingekauft hat , hat das Unternehmen jetzt erstmals die Anwender gefragt , welche Desktop - Programme ihnen unter Linux fehlen .
Die ersten Ergebnisse der Umfrage sind nicht weiter verwunderlich , korrelieren sie doch recht gut mit den Software - Verkaufscharts der letzten Jahre - wenn man Firewalls und Antiviren - Software , für die unter Linux auf absehbare Zeit kein Bedarf besteht , beiseite lässt .
Interessant an dieser Umfrage ist etwas ganz anderes :
Da beginnt einer der beiden großen Lieferanten von kommerziellen Linux - Distributionen , sich Gedanken zu machen , was der Markt eigentlich will .
Jeder , der mit Produktentwicklungsprozessen vertraut ist , dürfte jetzt verstehen , warum auch dieses Jahr Linux noch weit weg vom Mainstream - Desktop ist : Bekanntlich steht die Produktplanung ja recht weit am Anfang der Produktentwicklung .
Ein gutes Gefühl für die Weite des Weges bekommt man allerdings erst , wenn man bedenkt , daß weder Novell noch Red Hat oder sonst einer der Linux - Distributoren die gefragten Programme selber schreiben wird .
Die Top 10 der vermissten Anwendungen umfasst Programme wie Quickbooks , Autocad , Photoshop , itunes oder Dreamweaver , allesamt Produkte großer Windows - oder Mac - OS - Softwarehäuser .
Welchen Grund hätten diese Firmen , Geld für eine Linux - Version ihrer Programme auszugeben ?
Zur Erinnerung : 97 Prozent der Computernutzer weltweit verwenden kein Linux .
Wo kein Markt ist , entwickelt niemand Produkte .
Und wo keine Produkte sind , entsteht kein Markt .
Dies ist ein Teufelskreis , der nur schwer zu durchbrechen ist .
Immerhin dürfte der ein oder andere Mutige durchaus einen Versuch mit Linux wagen .
Einige haben es ja bereits schon getan : Mit Acrobat Reader , Duden , Real - und Flashplayer stehen erste portierte Programme zur Verfügung .
Allerdings : Alle diese Linux - Ports existieren schon länger , und ihre Anzahl wächst kaum .
Ja , es gibt sogar rückläufige Tendenzen : Bot Skype Anfang letzten Jahres noch Linux - Versionen seiner VoIP - Software im Monatstakt an , wird es langsam fraglich , ob die für Windows bereits im November letzten Jahres erschienene Version 2 überhaupt jemals für Linux erscheint .
Wer braucht was ?
Um die Chancen von Linux auf dem Desktop beziffern zu können , muß man das Profil der einzelnen Anwendergruppen verstehen .
Eine sehr aufschlussreiche Betrachtungsweise charakterisiert das Desktop - Benutzerspektrum nach dem Wissenstand des Anwenders und dem Umfang der verwendeten Softwarepalette .
Am einen Ende des Wissensspektrum befinden sich die reinen Anwender , für die der Computer ein Mittel zur Lösung alltäglicher Aufgaben ist .
Das benötigte Programmsortiment beschränkt sich weitgehend auf einen Browser , vielleicht noch ein E - Mail - Programm und ein Office - Paket .
Am anderen Ende des Wissensspektrums stehen die Softwareentwickler .
Ihre Programmpalette ist zwar etwas größer , aber ebenfalls übersichtlich und auf die Softwareentwicklung fokussiert .
Existiert eine benötigte Anwendung nicht , können sie sie notfalls selbst schreiben .
Die meisten Programme verwenden die so genannten Poweruser .
Sie liegen etwa in der Mitte des Wissensspektrums , kennen sich also mit Rechner und Betriebssystem einigermaßen aus .
Sie versuchen , für jedes mögliche Problem das passende Programm zur Hand zu haben - unabhängig davon , ob sie das Problem überhaupt jemals haben werden .
Sie leben am Rechner häufig ihren Spieltrieb aus .
Vom Poweruser sinkt die Anzahl der verwendeten Programme in Richtung der beiden Ränder des Wissensspektrums .
Derzeit erfüllt Linux die Bedürfnisse der beiden Randgruppen am besten .
Programmierer können sich aufgrund der Offenheit des Systems voll entfalten und Lücken bei den Anwendungen mit Hilfe Gleichgesinnter stopfen .
Die Freiheit , sich derart selbst verwirklichen zu können , ist ihnen wichtiger als die Verfügbarkeit vieler kommerzieller Programme .
Auch die Bedürfnisse des genügsamen Computernutzers kann Linux gut bedienen , sofern zur Installation und bei Problemen ein Experte zur Hilfe gerufen werden kann - in Firmen mit IT - Abteilung ebenso wie beim heimischen PC , den Sohn oder Enkeltochter zum gelegentlichen Surfen und Mailen eingerichtet haben .
Die einfache Wartbarkeit , die geringe Anfälligkeit für Schädlinge und der Kostenvorteil sind die Hauptgründe , weshalb Linux hier an Popularität gewinnt .
Die Poweruser allerdings können sich derzeit kaum für Linux begeistern : Sie möchten nicht auf ihre Spiele und Tools , Multimedia - Anwendungen und GUI - Helferlein verzichten .
Money will not make you happy , unless you ’re very poor , in which case a little money goes a long way .
And yet individuals and societies seem to regard increased spending as the only reliable measure of success , and the main goal of most governments is to achieve an economic growth rate that beats out that of comparable countries .
In Happiness : Lessons From a New Science economist Richar Layard argues that this is a totally wrong approach , which will not improve people ’s lives .
As an example consider indonesia where the average annual income is less than 1/10 of that of the US – but where people are just as happy .
Layard draws much inspiration from the philosopher Jeremy Bentham who had it right as far back as the 1800 ’s when he said that “ The greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation ” .
The goal of the individual is to be happy , this has been known since Aristotle who said that whatever else we desire , we want it because we expect it to make us happier .
Therefore happiness is the underlying “ why ” of all human activity – including constructing and governing societies .
So what can a society do to make its people happier ?
Layard mentions the 7 factors that have been shown to have the greatest influence on people ’s happiness :
* family relationships
* financial situation
* work
* community and friends
* health
* personal freedom
* personal values
It ’s interesting to note , that an economic policy that seeks to encourage people to work more , eg. lowering taxes or increasing the mobility of the work force , will in fact decrease people ’s situation in several of these areas and thus make people less happy .
One country has in fact acted on this :
In Bhutan , a tiny nation in the Himalayas , King Jigme Singye Wangchuck decreed that “ Gross national happiness is more important than gross national product [ because ] happiness takes precedence over economic prosperity in our national development process . ”
I feel quite sure that more countries will come to make similar decisions .
Western materialist culture has made us happy over the last few decades , but constantly increasing consumerism has probably taken us as far as it possibly can happiness - wise .
We will not be happier because we can buy more or bigger cars , TV’s and houses .
More time and an increased ability to enjoy time with our friends , families and communities is a whole different matter , and this is where society needs to focus .
Layard ’s is the most cogent and readable book on happiness on a national and global scale , and seeing as Layard is an economist rather than a psychologist , most of it is based on hard - core numbers and statistics .
Layard ’s main point is that happiness can be objectively quantified in individuals and in socities and can thus be used as a measure of success .
I wish every political leader would read it – I think I ’ll send our prime minister a copy :o )

Your old GameBoy is good for more than just collecting dust , as these five modders prove .
Highlights include the ATAPI CD player , iBoy , and more .
Which one is your favorite ?
GameBoy Pocket ATAPI CD
Player
If you ’ve got an old GameBoy laying around , why not interface it to play CDs using an ATAPI CD - ROM drive from a computer .
Here ’s what you need to build your own : A GameBoy ( show track information ) , GameBoy cartridge , ATAPI drive , and a 12V power supply

iBoy : The Gameboy iPod Case
File this under : Creative Uses for the Gameboy .
The iBoy is basically the coolest iPod case we ’ve seen , though a bit bulkly .
Plus , it sports “ an internal dock connector — buttons on the Gameboy were wired up to control the iPod . ”
The on / off switch is wired so that the buttons only work if it is in the “ on ” position ( like with the Game Boy , the battery light indicates that these functions are turned on ) .
Essentially , it is a hold switch with an indicator light … in case you ever want to put this mammoth in your pocket

GameBoy Mouse
If you have an old broken GameBoy lying around why not make good use of it ?
Aaron Myradon decided to create the “ Mouseboy ” , a fully functional optical GameBoy mouse .
The “ A ” and “ B ” keys act as the right / left click mouse buttons .
GameBoy Advance LEGO Robot
Charmed Labs introduces the Xport 2.0 , a homebrew application for the Nintendo GameBoy Advance that plugs into the cartridge slot .
Practical applications include robot competitions , custom sensor development , and force reflection / haptics .
… allows the Xport hardware to be tailored to your target application , and the 64 digital I/O signals provide programmable I/O for interfacing to practically any hardware device .

PSPBoy
Why not turn your old GameBoy into the PSPBoy ?
Created by “ MOD SOUL ” , this impressive mockup gives us a glimpse at what might have been if Sony and Nintendo had partnered to develop a portable gaming system .
I ’m going to put my Sony and PSP hating aside to just mention how freaking awesome this mod is .
I mean come on , a PSP , inside of an older Gameboy , how awesome is that ?
In 1960 , U.S. Air Force pilot Joe Kittinger flew 30 km straight up into the sky using a pressurized , high - altitude balloon .
This very nearly made him the first man in space .
He then jumped Kittinger free - fell for over twenty kilometers – at which point he was moving so fastHe had all but left the earth 's atmosphere ; the sky around him was pitch black ; he could see the outlines of entire continents ; and the haiku - like abstraction of his available reference points – earth , balloon , space – made it impossible to tell if he was really falling .
Luckily , there 's a film
Gururaj Deshpande 's first entrepreneurial venture netted $ 26.95 .
The chairman of Sycamore Networks keeps a framed copy of the check as a reminder that finding his passion for building companies was the real payoff .
Deshpande rejected the idea of returning to his life as a professor and software engineer after his first failure .
Instead — in the wake of financial ruin —
Deshpande would light out in search of his next entrepreneurial adventure , emboldened by a taste of his true calling .
Gururaj " Desh " Deshpande Chairman of Sycamore Networks Born : Nov. 30 , 1950 in Dharwar , India Two sons Stock Symbol : SCMR Companies Started :
1987 — Coral Networks 1990 — Cascade Communications 1998 — Sycamore Networks Education :
BS Electrical Engineering — IIT Madras , India ME Electrical Engineering — University of New Brunswick , Canada PhD Data Comunications — Queens University , Canada , where he was voted best professor
If it 's something you really believe in , he asserts , " you do n't really [ have ] look for anybody else to approve of that conviction .
...
You 're going to make it happen . "
And he did .
Six months later , Deshpande launched into his next endeavor .
Cascade Communications , as the company was called , would be a gamble at manufacturing Internet equipment .
His doubters were many , reinforced in their pessimism by an industry dominated by Cisco Systems .
Desphande stayed the course , always keeping true to his vision .
Conviction is central to the serial entrepreneur 's success , he maintains , because " everybody that you talk to is only going to try to discredit you .
They 're going to try to tell you that it 's probably not something that is going to work . "
In 1997 , Cascade was sold to Ascend Communications for $ 3.7 billion .
By that time 72 percent of all Internet traffic was coursing through Cascade 's products .
Success or failure , it was the doing he loved .
So he did it again .
" You always have to do , at least in order of magnitude , more and different than what you 've done in the past , " explains Deshpande .
Sycamore was founded a year after Cascade in anticipation of the optical - networks boom .
In a little over two years , Deshpande built the company up to a market valuation of over $ 23 billion .
With his second multibillion - dollar company , Deshpande has succeeded in making himself one of the richest men in the world .
His net worth tops $ 4 billion .
All thanks to an earlier experience worth just $ 26.95 .

In public 's mind , White House is guilty /
Its campaign to discredit its detractors will be remembered after Libby is forgotten 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
2007-03-07 04:00:00 PDT
Washington --
People will soon forget the details of the Lewis " Scooter " Libby case , if they knew them in the first place .
Whether the vice president 's former chief of staff gets 25 years in prison or even a presidential pardon after his conviction Tuesday for lying and obstructing justice is of little consequence to most Americans .
What will endure is damning testimony that confirms the public 's worst fears about the Bush administration 's behavior during the lead - up to the war in Iraq and its truthfulness since then .
The monthlong trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that White House officials at the highest level conducted a campaign to discredit those who questioned their declarations about Iraq 's weapon capabilities -- declarations that turned out to be wrong .
And the testimony showed that President Bush either was lying about the White House 's role in outing a CIA officer at the center of the scandal or was kept in the dark by top aides who defied his orders to come forward .
" I do n't know of anybody in my administration who leaked classified information , " Bush declared in September 2003 .
" If somebody did leak classified information , I 'd like to know about it , and we 'll take the appropriate action .
... I want to know who the leakers are . "
Testimony at the trial made plain that when Bush spoke those words , Karl Rove , his top political aide ; Ari Fleischer , his press secretary ; Richard Armitage , the No. 2 man at the State Department ; and Libby had each discussed the matter , on background , with reporters .
Prosecutors apparently did not feel they had enough evidence to prove that the leaks were criminal , and Libby 's conviction was limited to his dishonesty .
Yet the trial raised questions about who directed the leaks and why it took a federal investigation to uncover information that apparently was widely known inside the administration .
" The trial has been very embarrassing to the White House , " said Jonathan Turley , a professor of law at George Washington University who has been closely monitoring the case .
" This is one of the most closed administrations in modern history , overtly hostile to any transparency over how it operates , " Turley said .
" The trial riveted the city because it gave a rare insight into the Bush White House .
And what we saw was hardly flattering to either the president or the vice president . "
Bush watched news of the verdict on television in the Oval Office and was " saddened for Scooter Libby and his family , " according to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
Vice President Dick Cheney issued a two - sentence statement that said he was " disappointed with the verdict . "
Libby showed no emotion as the verdict was read and declined to talk to reporters as he left the courthouse .
" We have every confidence Mr. Libby ultimately will be vindicated , " Libby 's attorney Theodore Wells told reporters , pledging to push for a new trial or to appeal the verdict if that effort fails .
" We believe Mr. Libby is totally innocent and that he did n't do anything wrong . "
Jurors spent 10 days dissecting the testimony of 19 witnesses and hundreds of pages of documents to determine whether Libby had lied to federal investigators and a grand jury about his role in the leaks or had simply suffered -- as he asserted -- from a poor memory .
The complexities of the case made it difficult to follow even for many Washingtonians with a stake in the outcome .
Libby was charged with impeding an investigation into whether anyone violated a little - known law that makes it a crime to disclose information about a covert agent with the intention of exposing the agent 's identity .
The circumstances involved former Ambassador Joseph Wilson 's trip to Niger in 2002 to gather evidence regarding allegations that Saddam Hussein was purchasing enriched uranium and other materials there needed to build a nuclear bomb in Iraq .
Wilson , dispatched by the CIA , quickly determined that the charges were not credible and informed the administration .
He was surprised to hear Bush repeat the allegations during his 2003 State of the Union Address and wrote an op - ed piece in New York Times in the summer of 2003 titled " What I did n't find in Africa . "
" Based on my experience with the administration in the months leading up to the war , I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq 's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat , " Wilson wrote .
Within days of the article 's appearance , administration officials , including Libby , began telling reporters that Wilson 's wife , Valerie , worked for the CIA , which was classified information .
The leaks appear to have been motivated by Cheney 's concern about reports that his office had dispatched Joseph Wilson to Niger .
Apparently they were intended to undermine Wilson 's credibility by making it appear that he had been sent on a junket by his wife , who was known by her maiden name , Valerie Plame .
Some Bush critics have suggested that Valerie Wilson 's identity was leaked to ruin her career in retribution for her husband 's outspoken criticism of the administration .
Libby told a grand jury that he simply repeated information told to him by Tim Russert , NBC Washington bureau chief .
Russert testified that such a conversation never took place .
Libby did not testify at his own trial , but his lawyers insisted his misstatements were the result of a bad memory , not any intention to deceive .
In the end , the jury found Libby guilty of one count of obstruction of justice , two counts of perjury and one count of lying to the FBI .
Sentencing is scheduled for June 5 .
Libby faces up to 25 years in prison , but experts said it is unlikely he will receive a sentence longer than several years .
The felony convictions are likely to further erode the White House 's credibility on Iraq , which is already at an all - time low .
Bush has never reconciled his public statements demanding to know the identity of the leakers with evidence that showed they included some of his top aides .
If Bush did n't already know their identity , his most trusted advisers were willfully defying his instructions .
" We could clarify this thing very quickly if people who have got solid evidence would come forward and speak out .
And I hope they would , " Bush declared to no avail in 2003 .
Among those who likely had a good knowledge of the leakers was Cheney , who discussed the identity of Wilson 's wife with Libby a few weeks before it became public .
The trial showed the extent to which senior Bush aides , including Cheney , were alarmed at Wilson 's public rebuke of their assertions about Iraq 's nuclear weapons .
Among the evidence submitted was a copy of Wilson 's op - ed piece with Cheney 's notes scribbled in the margin demanding to know if Wilson 's wife had sent him there on a " junket . "
" Clearly Cheney understood immediately that this article could produce a cascading political crisis for the White House , " Turley said of the evidence .
" The trial revealed a surprising level of both hysteria and hypocrisy in the White House . "
The White House was not the only institution tarnished in the trial .
The witnesses included at least nine prominent Washington journalists , whose testimony made plain the cozy relationship between some top administration officials and the reporters who cover them .
" This is a quintessential Washington morality play where there are no redeeming characters , " Turley said .
The Libby verdict
What happened : Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff , Lewis " Scooter " Libby , was convicted of lying and obstructing the investigation into how the name of CIA official Valerie Wilson - wife of an Iraq war critic - was leaked to reporters in 2003 .
Counts : Libby was found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice , two counts of perjury and one count of making false statements to the FBI .
He was acquitted on one count of making false statements to the FBI .
Punishment :
At his sentencing June 5 , he could receive a total of 25 years in prison and could be fined as much as $ 1 million .
Case chronology
2003
Jan. 28 : President Bush asserts in his State of the Union address : " The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . "

With over 800 delegates and the peak oil educator stalwarts of Campbell , Heinberg and Leggett amongst the speakers this was the largest and potentially most significant peak oil communication event yet .
Last summer they launched a major peak oil initiative going by the name of Food and Farming – Post Peak Oil .
This theme was the focus of their 26 - 27th Jan 2007 annual conference , subtitled “ Preparing for a post - peak oil food and farming future ” .
I ’ve been to many peak oil conferences over the years , they all had one thing in common .
They were organised by people interested in peak oil , for people interested in peak oil .
It ’s a small community with virtually the same few hundred people at each one !
Okay , I exaggerate a little but it is true to say the core messages from these conferences have , for the most part remained within the peak oil “ community ” .
This was different .
A step change .
This conference was n’t organised by or for the peak oil community .
It was the first time ( that I ’m aware of ) the peak oil message – as delivered by Campbell and Heinberg et al – was core to the annual conference of a major organisation .
The event kicked off on the Thursday night with a discussion between the Soil Association ’s president , Jonathan Dimbleby and director Patrick Holden .
From this I got the impression the peak oil focus was Holden ’s rather than Dimbleby ’s doing .
Holden described the subject of this conference as making it the most important conference in the Association ’s 60 years history .
Justifying this by explaining that to date the Soil Association had been focused on :
Development , defining , of a prescription for the application for sustainable agriculture .
And that this was now doubly important as things are changing , due to climate change , decline of fossil fuels and food security meaning the Association needs to consider the wider issues .
Holden mentioned he “ argued very hard ” for the peak oil theme so presumably someone was arguing almost as hard against .
Dimbleby did say he was sympathetic to the direction Holden was taking the conference but suggested there were other problems , today ’s problems , prices , DEFRA , standards , attracting more people to organic farming etc. and that perhaps they should be the focus , that peak oil is a case of biting off more than one can chew ?
Holden ’s defence was to say that was the day job but peak oil was :
... far far bigger than that , it ’s going to completely threaten all the systems that we take for granted .
… but then I realised that when my food gets to the farm gate it goes into a centralised distribution system which is entirely dependent on the existing fossil fuel driven national distribution infrastructure .
And if this scenario of progressive decent of fossil fuel energy which could halve it or maybe even reduce it to a quarter or less than that by the late 2020s happens I ’m going to have to rethink all that .
Which means maybe I ’m going to have to rethink how the food is sold which begs the question , can I get loyalty of the citizens around me because at the moment they are buying food on price or they are buying a commodity food ...
Having described his own farm as quite radically sustainable he went on to say :
The following day covered the meat of the conference in a series of plenary sessions where the following spoke :
Jonathon Porritt , One Planet Agriculture
Dr Colin Campbell , Energy Shortages :
How soon and how serious ?
Dr Jeremy Leggett , Climate change and peak oil :
The two great oversights of our time
Rob Hopkins , Energy descent plans : The Kinsale and Totnes projects
Carwyn Jones , Minister 's address
Richard Heinberg , Implications of peak oil for agriculture
André Viljoen , Agriculture without external inputs : The Cuban experience
Peter Melchett , Organic farming and food distribution : Present strengths and weaknesses
To their credit the Soil Association have made MP3 audio recordings of each speech available on their conference page here .
I wo n’t describe the content in detail however I will especially recommend Porritt ’s , for a well articulated , intelligent , linking of a broad range of difficulties , Hopkins ’ for a humours and inspirational account of his response to peak oil , Melchett ’s for discussion of climate change impacts of farming , land use , nitrous oxide and carbon loss from soil and Leggett 's for bringing together climate change and peak oil in his authoritative manner .
Jeremy Leggett has also recorded his thoughts on the conference at his blog hosted by the Guardian newspaper in an article titled Take to the fields :
If the peak - oil proposition is correct , the tipping point of global oil production will happen - largely unexpectedly - in this decade or early in the next , accompanied by a dire energy shock .
The people in the room will be in the front rank of those first affected .
They can also be in the vanguard of those who can offer a proactive vision of what a survivable post - shock future could look like .

A 13 page booklet containing contributions from the speakers was given to the delegates and is available to download as a pdf from Rob Hopkin 's Transition Culture site here or by clicking the above picture .
This will be expanded upon over the coming weeks based on output from the conference workshops .
The closing address was given by Dr Vandana Shiva , physicist , ecologist , activist , editor , and author of many books .
In India she has established Navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
She directs the Research Foundation for Science , Technology and Natural Resource Policy ( blurb lifted from here ) .
Her speech on " how to get the oil out of food " is also available to download from the link above - probably worth the 36 minutes of your time .
Impressive lady .
Whist the core peak oil message was not new to me , I left the conference enthused .
Agriculture and food security is a vital aspect of peak oil , climate change and our future .
The organic farmers at the conference I met and who contributed to the workshops came across as incredibly smart and well informed people .
These people know what ’s going on , know what is important and seemed to accept peak oil without batting an eyelid .
As the unsustainabilities of industrialised farming come home to roost , organic farmers represent the future of agriculture and by extension our very civilisation itself .
Unfortunately the mainstream media have not widely reported on the conference .
The BBC's Environment Correspondent Sarah Mukerjee reports on the conference here , however she seems to have missed the point .
She does n't mention peak oil itself with her only mention of oil being quoted from Holden " ... when oil demand outstrips supply , and it becomes too expensive to import food from around the world , we will have to think fairly radically about how we use the land to support ourselves . "
Instead Mukerjee focuses on the growing popularity of the organic movement :
Within a few years , the organic movement has found itself swept from tree - hugging hippy obscurity to the mainstream .
And for an organisation that has spent most of its existence shouting angrily from the sidelines , this entry into the establishment takes quite a bit of getting used to .
They face a question that many other environmental charities are asking themselves :
Now we have won many of the arguments , what do we do next ?
And what do we say to all the people who are finally listening ?
Well , Sarah , the Soil Association had a very powerful message this conference , they know exactly what they are saying .
It would seem however you still are n't listening !
The old schoolhouse stands alone at the end of a quiet country road flanked by snow - flecked wheat fields .
From behind the locked door , opaque with smoked glass , comes the clatter of sewing machines and , improbably enough , the babble of young female voices speaking Korean .
The elementary school closed long ago for lack of students .
The entire village 20 miles west of Prague has only about 200 people .
The schoolhouse is now a factory producing uniforms .
Almost all the workers are North Korean , and the women initially looked delighted to see visitors .
It gets lonely working out here , thousands of miles from home .
They crowded around to chat .
“ I ’m not so happy here .
There is nobody who speaks my language .
I ’m so far from home , ” volunteered a tentative young woman in a T - shirt and sweatpants who said she was from Pyongyang , the North Korean capital .
Advertisement
But as she spoke , an older woman with stern posture and an expressionless face -- a North Korean security official -- passed by in the corridor .
The young women scattered wordlessly and disappeared into another room , closing and bolting the door behind them .
Hundreds of young North Korean women are working in garment and leather factories like this one , easing a labor shortage in small Czech towns .
Their presence in this recent member of the European Union is something of a throwback to before the Velvet Revolution of 1989 , when Prague , like Pyongyang , was a partner in the Communist bloc .
The North Korean government keeps most of the earnings , apparently one of the few legal sources of hard currency for an isolated and impoverished government believed to be living off counterfeiting , drug trafficking and weapons sales .
Experts estimate that there are 10,000 to 15,000 North Koreans working abroad in behalf of their government in jobs ranging from nursing to construction work .
In addition to the Czech Republic , North Korea has sent workers to Russia , Libya , Bulgaria , Saudi Arabia and Angola , defectors say .
Almost the entire monthly salary of each of the women here , about $ 260 , the Czech minimum wage , is deposited directly into an account controlled by the North Korean government , which gives the workers only a fraction of the money .

To the extent that they are allowed outside , they go only in groups .
Often they are accompanied by a guard from the North Korean Embassy who is referred to as their “ interpreter . ”
They live under strict surveillance in dormitories with photographs of North Korea ’s late founder Kim Il Sung and current leader Kim Jong Il gracing the walls .
Their only entertainment is propaganda films and newspapers sent from North Korea , and occasional exercise in the yard outside .
“ This is 21st century slave labor , ” said Kim Tae San , a former official of the North Korean Embassy in Prague .
He helped set up the factories in 1998 and served as president of one of the shoe factories until he defected to South Korea in 2002 .
It also was Kim ’s job to collect the salaries and distribute the money to workers .
He said 55 % was taken off the top as a “ voluntary ” contribution to the cause of the socialist revolution .
The women had to buy and cook their own food .
Additional sums were deducted for accommodation , transportation and such extras as flowers for the birthdays of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il .
The women even had to pay for the propaganda films they were forced to watch .
By the time all the deductions were made , each received between $ 20 and $ 30 a month .
They spent less than $ 10 of it on food , buying only the cheapest local macaroni .
Advertisement
“ They try to save money by not eating , ” said Kim , the former embassy official .
He says that his wife , who accompanied him on visits to the factory , was concerned that women ’s menstruation stopped , their breasts shriveled and many experienced acute constipation .
“ We were always trying to get them to spend more on food , but they were desperate to bring money home to their families . ”
Kim said that Czechs often mistook the North Korean women for convict laborers because of the harsh conditions .
“ They would ask the girls , ‘ What terrible thing did you do to be sent here to work like this ? ’ ”
In fact , the women usually come from families deemed sufficiently loyal to the government that their daughters will not defect .
With salaries at state - owned firms in North Korea as low as $ 1 per month , the chance to work abroad for a three - year stint is considered a privilege .
Having shed its own communist dictatorship , the Czech Republic is sensitive to human rights issues .
On the other hand , the country has to employ about 200,000 guest workers , largely to replace Czechs who have left to seek higher wages in Western Europe .

At the beginning of December , there were 321 North Korean garment workers in six locations in the country , according to the Czech Labor Ministry .
The North Koreans declined to speak publicly about the factories .
“ It is not in our interest to provide information .
This is a private thing and nobody should care about it , ” said a North Korean Embassy employee supervising factory workers in Nachod , a town near the Polish border .
Czech officials say the North Koreans are model workers .
“ They are so quiet you would hardly know they are here , ” said Zdenek Belohlavek , labor division director for the district of Beroun , which encompasses Zelezna and Zebrak , a larger town where about 75 North Korean seamstresses stitch underwear .

Belohlavek displayed a thick dossier of photos and vital statistics of the women , most of whom were born between 1979 and 1981 .
All their paperwork is in perfect order , and the factories appear to be in full compliance with the law , he said .
Belohlavek acknowledged that labor investigators had only communicated with the workers through an interpreter from the North Korean Embassy .
He said they were troubled by the women ’s apparent lack of freedom .
“ They have guards .
I do n’t know why .
It ’s not like anybody would steal them , ” he said .
Another labor investigator , Jirina Novakova , who has visited the factories , also complained that the women ’s salaries were deposited into a single bank account in the name of a North Korean Embassy interpreter .
Advertisement
“ Frankly , we have some difficulty with that , ” she said .
“ But if they do it voluntarily , there is not much we can do about it . ”
Jiri Balaban , owner of the Zelezna factory , said it was none of his business what the workers did in their free time or how they spent their money .
“ My business is that they work , ” he said .
In theory , the women could escape .
Although the doors are locked from the inside in Zelezna , the windows are not barred .
But where would they go ?
Few speak any language other than Korean .
Zelezna has one pay phone , a mayor ’s office that is open once a week for two hours and a general store so small that you have to order bread a day in advance .

In Zebrak , the North Koreans only go downtown to the supermarket in groups on Fridays between 4 and 6 p.m .
They live in a pleasant - looking , lemon - yellow dormitory that was recently constructed across the parking lot from their factory .
Blinds are kept drawn and the doors locked .
Deliverymen must leave packages on the front stoop .
The Baroque town square in Nachod , its Christmas lights , Chinese restaurant and movie theater showing “ Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ” and “ March of the Penguins , ” was off - limits for the 40 North Korean women who stitch leather suitcases and belts along with guest workers from Vietnam , Mongolia and Ukraine .
“ They ca n’t go anywhere .
You ca n’t talk to them , ” security guard Antonin Janicek said .
“ The other women go to the pub and the cinema .
Some get married here .
But not the Koreans . ”
Last year , when a Czech television crew attempted to film a shoe factory in Skutec , a group of irate North Koreans broke their camera .
After the incident , the factory decided it would no longer employ North Koreans because of bad publicity and human rights concerns .
Advertisement
“ They oftentimes do not even have enough [ money ] for food , ” Vaclav Kosner , financial director of the factory , was quoted as telling the CTK news agency .
“ They are sometimes truly hungry . ”
The seamstresses were first sent abroad at the height of North Korea ’s famine to raise money to buy raw materials for North Korean shoes and clothing .
North Korea officially was a partner in the factories through two trading companies , but former diplomat Kim said that this was a front to cover the government ’s embarrassment about having to send workers abroad .
The factories are mostly Czech - owned , but the underwear factory in Zebrak is owned by an Italian company .
By far the largest number of North Koreans working outside their country are in Russia , where they do mostly logging and construction in military - style camps run by the North Korean government .
When the camps were set up in the early 1970s , the workers were North Korean prisoners .
But as the North Korean economy disintegrated in the late 1980s , doing hard labor in Siberia came to be seen as a reward because at least it meant getting adequate food .
Kim Yong
Il , who got a job in mine construction in the 1990s because of his brother ’s political connections , said he and a dozen other men were kept in a house with bars on the windows and a padlock on the door .
He received no money , but his family in North Korea received extra food rations .
He defected in 1996 and now lives in Seoul .
He is one of about 50 North Koreans who escaped the camps in Russia and are now living in South Korea , according to the Christian North Korean Assn. , a defector group in Seoul .

There have been no such incidents with the seamstresses in the Czech Republic .
The fact that they come from Pyongyang , home only to the most loyal North Koreans , means that their families have privileges that could be taken away in an instant if a relative were to defect .
“ If they were to run away , their families would vanish into thin air and they would never see them again , ” said Kim , the former diplomat .
In 2002 , the diplomat and his wife defected in Prague and sought asylum from South Korea .
Soon afterward , their adult son and daughter were taken away .
He believes they were sent to a prison camp .
Kim , 53 , recently asked a contact in North Korea to gather some information about relatives .
“ Even my wife ’s relatives , down to the second cousins , have disappeared , ” he said .
“ We could n’t find a trace of them . ”
November 10 , 2006 at 11:15 Tags Lisp
A couple of days ago a typical post appeared in the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup .
In his post , titled " Lisp and Scheme with fewer parentheses " , the poster suggested " using a lisp / scheme with Python - style indentation for lists " .
That is , indentation instead of the parentheses .
Sample code :
defun factorial ( n ) if ( <= n 1 ) ^ 1 * n factorial (- n 1 )
Expectedly for comp.lang.lisp , the post triggered a few acrid responses .
But I 've raved about this already .
Now I want to discuss something else .
It eludes me why people want to take from Lisp the one feature that makes it superior to all the other programming languages - the list representation of code using those so - hated parentheses .
In his wonderful book Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence programming , Peter Norvig lists seven features of Lisp that make it different from ( and better than ) other languages .
Those features are :
Built in support for lists
Automatic storage management
Dynamic typing
First class functions
Uniform syntax
Interactive environment
Extensibility
Now , recall that the book was written in 1993 , when there was yet no Java and the dynamic languages were in diapers .
Compared with C++ , Ada and Pascal , these features truly make Lisp stand out .
But this no longer is the case !
Perl shares six of these features with Lisp .
So does Ruby , which also adds excellent object orientation on top .
Guess which feature they do n't share , though ...
Uniform syntax , of course .
Uniform syntax - this wonderful feature of Lisp which makes code the same as data , allows the omnipotent macros that make the language so powerful .
And this uniform syntax goodness is what those parentheses are for !
The Lisp concept of " form " - a list of symbols enclosed by opening and closing parentheses , which can either be data or code , is uniform syntax .
So , let me return to my original question .
What on earth makes people want to take Lisp and remove the one feature that makes it so special ?
If you have a problem with uniform syntax , just use Ruby or Perl .
WHY DEMOCRACY IS WRONG Democracy does not deserve the semi-sacred status accorded to it .
In Europe , democratically elected politicians such as Jörg Haider , Jean - Marie Le Pen , Silvio Berlusconi , Umberto Bossi , Gianfranco Fini and Pim Fortuyn are a reminder of democracy 's defects : an anti-racist dictatorship is preferable to a racist democracy .
Democracy is expanding globally , but not because of its moral superiority .
Military intervention is now the standard origin of democratic political systems .
Any universal ideology will tend to crusades and messianic conquest , and democracies feel entitled to ' bring freedom ' to other countries .
Below , more on the ethical problems , definitions of democracy , the issue of inequality , the defects of democratic culture , the nation as the ' demos ' , the claimed justifications for democracy , and alternatives to democracy .
Revised December 2002 , last changes 13 May 2006 .
So 90 million people starve .
Yet all electoral procedures on both islands are free and fair , the media are free , political campaigning is free , there is no political repression of any kind .
According to democratic theory , any outcome of this democratic process must be respected .
Two perfect democracies have functioned perfectly : if you believe the supporters of democracy , that is morally admirable .
But it clearly is not : there is something fundamentally wrong with democracy , if it allows this outcome .
The defect is not hard to find : the people most affected by the decision are excluded from voting .
The issue is the composition of the demos , the decision - making unit in a democracy : it is a recurrent theme in the ethics of democracy .
Democratic theory can legitimise a political community in the form of an island of prosperity , and then legitimise the selfish decisions of that community .
This theoretical possibility corresponds with the real - world western democracies .
Millions of people are dying of hunger and preventable disease , yet the electorate in rich democracies will not accept mass transfers of wealth to poorer countries .
They will not accept mass immigration from those countries either .
A causal relationship has developed at global level , between democracy in the rich countries , and excess mortality elsewhere ( famine , epidemics , endemic diseases ) .
This is not the only such problem with democracy .
Despite its quasi - sacred status , democracy has many ethical defects which are either evident in practice , or easily illustrated by hypothetical examples .
The treatment of minorities is perhaps the most recognised defect of democracies .
Between the mid-1930's and the mid-1970's , the Swedish government forcibly sterilised thousands of women , because of ' mental defects ' , or simply because they were of ' mixed race ' .
Yet Sweden has been a model democracy for the entire period .
The democracy worked : the problem is that democracy offers no protection to marginalised and despised minorities .
The usual answer of democrats is that excesses can be prevented by constitutionally enforced individual rights .
There are two problems with that .
First , no constitutional rights are absolute : President Bush showed how easy it is to overturn fundamental constitutional protections .
Simply by redefining some American citizens as ' illegal enemy combatants ' , he was able to intern them .
Some groups are in any case openly excluded from the usual democratic rights , most notably illegal immigrants ( more on this later ) .
The Australian government detains asylum seekers in internment camps in the desert : its hard line accurately reflects the attitudes of a racist electorate .
The detainees can't vote , can't engage in political activities , and have no free press , but Australia is still considered a democracy .
The second problem is that basic rights allow wide limits .
Treatment of minorities may be harsh and humiliating , without infringing their rights .
A recent example in the Netherlands is a proposal to impose compulsory genital inspections for ethnic minorities .
The aim is to combat female genital mutilation , but every ethnic Somali parent , regardless of their own circumstances , would be obliged to present their daughters for annual genital inspection .
Eritreans , Egyptian and Sudanese might be included under the legal obligation , even if they were naturalised Dutch citizens .
The proposal has majority support in Parliament .
It is not law yet , but since Somali's are a marginalised and often despised minority in the Netherlands , there is nothing they can do to prevent its implementation .
So long as they avoid certain types of policy , and outright violence , democracy allows a democratic majority to impose its will on a minority .
They can impose their language and a culture , and both impositions are normal practice in nation states .
They can also impose their values , which may be unacceptable to the minority : the best example is democratic prohibitions of alcohol or drugs .
Alcohol prohibition in the United States , enforced through a constitutional amendment , was a direct result of democracy .
Since there was ( and is ) no ' right to drink ' , the Christian anti-alcohol majority could simply use the democratic process , to make their values the national values .
' Prohibition ' was repealed in 1933 , but the ' War on Drugs ' of the last 20 years is at least as comprehensive in terms of policy and effects .
Successful prohibition movements are a special case of the inherent anti-minority bias in democracies .
There is a more general effect : it is very difficult for an innovative minority to succeed in a democracy - and most innovations are first proposed by a minority .
Like many political systems , democracy has an inherent bias toward the existing , as against the possible .
Innovations must go through the political process , which in that sense is an anti-innovative barrier , but the existing social order does not have to prove its existence rights .
A large - scale example of failed innovation in democracies is the European high - speed rail network , first proposed in the 1970's .
Since then , not even planned national networks have been completed .
The pan-European project failed primarily due to lack of political enthusiasm .
But should it be abandoned , simply because there is insufficient ' will of the people ' ?
If an innovation has no democratic mandate then a democracy will not implement it - but should democracy have this priority over innovation ?
The issues are scarcely considered in democratic theory : the priority is simply taken for granted .
Empirical : testable propositions about democracies
The best - known classic hypothesis about democracies is the so - called democratic peace theory .
It is promoted by pro-democratic campaigners and by politicians , as ' scientific evidence ' of the need for democracy .
The claim is that ' democracies do not go to war with each other ' .
The research typically compares dyads - pairs of countries / states .
A statistical measure ( frequency of war ) is possible for different categories - democracy against democracy ; democracy against non-democracy ; and non-democracy against non-democracy .
It is one of the few classic ' testable hypotheses ' in international relations theory .
Unfortunately for the democracy lobby , research failed to demonstrate conclusively that democracies are more peaceful among themselves .
Nevertheless , it suggests other testable propositions about democracy .
Several of the criticisms of democracy presented here , can be stated as sociological or political - science hypotheses , indicating possible research projects : they are given in separate boxes such as this one .
Definitions of democracy Definitions of democracy follow a standard pattern , a sign of a stable and established ideology .
Often , as in the version by Thomas Christiano , the definition separates the historical ideal , and the structure of modern democracies .
The historical ideal is usually Athenian democracy , but there is no real continuity between ancient and modern democracy .
The comprehensive survey Antike Traditionen in der Legitimation staatlicher Systeme shows that most western political regimes appealed to classical predecessors .
a ) Reiche in der Nachfolge des Imperium Romanum .
b) Absolutistisch verfaßte Fürsten - Staaten .
c ) Aristokratische Stadt - Republiken .
d) Stände - Konföderationen .
e ) Herrschafts - Vikariate und Kolonialverwaltungen .
f ) Konstitionelle Republiken .
g ) Demokratische Republiken ( i. S. eines parteilichen Volksbegriffs ) .
h ) Konstitutionelle Monarchien .
i ) Moderne Diktaturen .
k ) Moderne imperiale Systeme .
l ) Moderne internationale Gemeinschaften .
Antike Traditionen in der Legitimation staatlicher Systeme , Christian Gizewski , TU Berlin .
Robert Dahl 's version is the best known of the dual definitions .
He was one of the first to revise the simple definitions of democracy , and introduced the word ' polyarchy ' to describe modern democracies .
The polyarchy definitions , which emphasise political pluralism and multi-party elections , have become the standard political science definitions of democracy .
The newest definitions emphasise democratic rights , rather than the democratic regime itself .
But remember that most definitions of democracy ( including those quoted below ) have themselves been written by supporters of democracy .
No neutral definitions exist ...
... the Greek democracies were not representative governments , they were governments run by the free , male citizens of the city - state .
All major government decisions and legislation were made by the Assembly ; the closest we 've come to such a system is " initiative and referendum , " in which legislation is popularly petitioned and then voted on directly by the electorate .
The Greek democratic states ran their entire government on such a system .
All the members of a city - state were not involved in the government : slaves , foreigners , and women were all disbarred from the democracy .
So , in reality , the democratic city - states more closely resembled oligarchies for a minority ruled the state - it was a very large minority , to be sure , but still a minority .
World Civilizations general Glossary : Democracy , Richard Hooker
World Civilizations general Glossary : Democracy , Richard Hooker
Let us focus more closely on the basic ideals of democracy .
First , in a democracy , the people rule .
Popular sovereignty implies that all minimally competent adults come together as one body to make decisions about the laws and policies that are to regulate their lives together .
Each citizen has a vote in the processes by which the decisions are made and each has the opportunity to participate in the deliberations over what courses of action are to be followed .
Second , each citizen has the right to participate as an equal .
Political equality implies equality among citizens in the process of decision - making .... Third , each citizen has the right to an opportunity to express his or her opinions and supporting reasons to every other citizen as well as a right and duty to hear a wide spectrum of views on subjects of public concern .
Each has a right , as well as a duty to participate in open and fair discussion .
These are the ideals of democracy .
These ideals are partly realized in features of modern democratic societies .
One - person one - vote is observed in the process of electing representatives to the legislative assembly ; anyone may run for election to public office ; in elections , a number of political parties compete for political power by advocating alternative visions of the society ; the political campaigns of candidates and parties consist in large part in discussion and argument over the worth of these opposing views , and everyone is permitted to have a say in this process ; and the society tolerates and often encourages vigorous debate on all issues of public interest .

These ideals are partly realized in features of modern democratic societies .
One - person one - vote is observed in the process of electing representatives to the legislative assembly ; anyone may run for election to public office ; in elections , a number of political parties compete for political power by advocating alternative visions of the society ; the political campaigns of candidates and parties consist in large part in discussion and argument over the worth of these opposing views , and everyone is permitted to have a say in this process ; and the society tolerates and often encourages vigorous debate on all issues of public interest .

Democracy literally means rule or government by , or power of , the people .
Logically and historically implicit in this is the notion of majority rule .
Representative democracy is a form of democracy in which the people govern indirectly , through elected representatives , rather than directly governing themselves .

It is by now a truism that what 's most important is not a country 's first election , but rather its second and third .
And what matters is not simply that people have the right to vote , but that they are offered a real choice , under conditions that are truly free and fair .
Elections , moreover , are but one note in the democratic symphony .
A full orchestra is required , including markets that reward initiative ; police that respect due process ; legal structures that provide justice ; and a press corps that is free to pursue the facts and publish the truth .

In der alten DDR war es also mit der demokratischen Legitimation nicht weit her , wie in allen autoritär - kommunistischen Staaten , auch wenn eine erste Grundbedingung erfüllt war : es existierte eine formal - demokratische Verfassung .
Diese Bedingung ist aber nicht hinreichend .
Die Verfassung muß zweitens auch materiell rechtsstaatliche Verfahren , die Willkür ausschließen , garantieren .
Drittens müssen Grundrechte und Grundwerte durch Verfassung und Rechtspraxis auch für kritische Minderheiten verläßlich garantiert und geschützt werden .

What exactly is democracy ?
We must not identify democracy with majority rule .
Democracy has complex demands , which certainly include voting and respect for election results , but it also requires the protection of liberties and freedoms , respect for legal entitlements , and the guaranteeing of free discussion and uncensored distribution of news and fair comment .
Even elections can be deeply defective if they occur without the different sides getting an adequate opportunity to present their respective cases , or without the electorate enjoying the freedom to obtain news and to consider the views of the competing protagonists .
Democracy is a demanding system , and not just a mechanical condition ( like majority rule ) taken in isolation .

At a minimum , a democracy is a political system in which the people choose their authoritative leaders freely from among competing groups and individuals who were not designated by the government .

Voor wie de klassieke idealen van de democratie wil handhaven , lijkt het daarom voor de hand te liggen , in een zekere analogie tot Dahl , onderscheid te maken tussen democratische idealen en democratie .
Deze is dan een specifiek procedureel en grondrechtelijk kader dat gebaseerd is op de democratische idealen van vrijheid , gelijkheid en volkssoevereiniteit en waarin deze idealen tegelijk in open competitie staan met andere doelstellingen .
Zo is elk land waarin dit kader bestaat een democratie .

Democracy is a political system in which different groups are legally entitled to compete for power and in which institutional power holders are elected by the people and are responsible to the people .

The book summarises definitions of democracy of the last 40 years on p. 28-31 .
Most contemporary definitions of democracy have several common elements .
First , democracies are countries in which there are institutional mechanisms , usually elections , that allow the people to choose their leaders .
Second , prospective leaders must compete for public support .
Third , the power of the government is restrained by its accountability to the people .
These are the essential characteristics of political democracy .
Some writers add additional criteria to the list of what makes a polity a democracy .
Larry Diamond argues that a democracy must have " extensive civil liberties ( freedom of expression , freedom of the press , freedom to form and join organizations ) . "
Samuel Huntington recognizes that democracy " implies the existence of those civil and political freedoms to speak , publish , assemble and organize that are necessary to political debate and the conduct of electoral campaigns . "

It is now standard to include political and / or civic rights in the definition of democracy .
The best known example of this approach is the Freedom House Annual Survey .
In fact , rights checklists seem to be the emerging standard definition of democracy .
The online paper
The theory and measurement of democracy ( Gizachew Tiruneh ) includes a list and comparative table of indices of democracy : most are rights checklists .
Here is the Freedom House political rights checklist :
Is the head of state and / or head of government or other chief authority elected through free and fair elections ?
Are the legislative representatives elected through free and fair elections ?
Are there fair electoral laws , equal campaigning opportunities , fair polling , and honest tabulation of ballots ?
Do the people have the right to organize in different political parties or other competitive political groupings of their choice , and is the system open to the rise and fall of these competing parties or groupings ?
The Freedom House checklist on civil liberties and the rule of law includes :
Are there free and independent media and other forms of cultural expression ?
Are there free religious institutions and is there free private and public religious expression ?
Is there freedom of assembly , demonstration , and open public discussion ?
Is there freedom of political or quasi-political organization ( political parties , civic organizations , ad hoc issue groups ) ?
Is there an independent judiciary ?
Does the rule of law prevail in civil and criminal matters ?
Is the population treated equally under the law ?
Is there protection from political terror , unjustified imprisonment , exile , or torture , whether by groups that support or oppose the system ?
Is there open and free private discussion ?
Is there personal autonomy ?
Does the state control travel , choice of residence , or choice of employment ?
Is there freedom from indoctrination and excessive dependency on the state ?
Note again that this is largely a checklist of rights , yet I am quoting it as a definition of democracy .
That is how it is used in practice .
It reflects the current idea of democracy , among theorists and public in the democratic countries .
Civil rights , political rights , and democratic government are all seen as integral components of democracy .
the opposite of democracy Supporters of democracy refer to Hitler and Fascism , to imply that anyone who opposes democracy is " like Hitler " .
That is usually intended as an insult , rather than an insight into the nature of democracy .
However , political theorists do contrast democracy with dictatorship , authoritarianism , and totalitarianism , and the last of these is indeed based on the Nazi regime , as a historical model .
The theory of totalitarianism was formulated in the United States in the early 1950's , in a climate of anti-Communist hysteria .
Its central claim is that the ideology , regimes , and social systems under Hitler and Stalin were more - or - less identical .
In the Second World War the United States and the Soviet Union were allies against Hitler , but the ' reversal of alliances ' at the start of the Cold War made the theory of totalitarianism attractive .
Coined in the interwar years , but coming into wide usage only after 1945 , the term pointed to features of Nazi and Communist regimes that were said to make them " essentially alike " and that distinguished them from traditional autocracies .... Whatever the theory 's analytic merits , in the 1940s and 1950s it performed admirable ideological service in denying what to the untutored eye was a dramatic reversal of alliances .
It only seemed this way , the theory asserted ; in fact the cold war was , from the standpoint of the West , a continuation of World War II : a struggle against the transcendent enemy , totalitarianism , first in its Nazi , then in its Soviet version .
Peter Novick ( 2000 ) .
The Holocaust in American Life .
New York : Houghton Mifflin. ( p. 86 ) .
With hindsight , the definition of totalitarianism is too obviously a description of regimes and political styles of the 1930's and 1940's .
Like George Orwell 's ' 1984 " , also written at the start of the Cold War , its image of oppression now seems dated .
In 1953 , Carl J Friedrich listed 5 defining characteristics of totalitarian societies :
1 . An official ideology , consisting of an official body of doctrine covering all vital aspects of man 's existence , to which everyone living in that society is supposed to adhere at least passively ; this ideology is characteristically focused in terms of chiliastic claims as to the " perfect " final society of mankind .
2 . A single mass party consisting of a relatively small percentage of the total population ( up to 10 per cent ) of men and women passionately and unquestioningly dedicated to the ideology and prepared to assist in every way in promoting its general acceptance , such party being organized in strictly hierarchical , oligarchical manner , usually under a single leader ....
3 . A technologically conditioned near - complete monopoly of control ( in the hands of the party and its subservient cadres , such as the bureaucracy and the armed forces ) of all means of effective armed combat .
4 . A similarly technologically conditioned near - complete monopoly of control ( in the same hands ) of all means of effective mass communication , such as the press , radio , motion pictures , and so on .
5 . A system of terroristic police control .
depending for its effectiveness upon points 3 and 4 and characteristically directed not only against demonstrable " enemies " of the regime , but also against arbitrarily selected classes of the population , such arbitrary selection turning upon exigencies of the regime 's survival , as well as ideological " implications " and systematically exploiting scientific psychology .
Carl J Friedrich ( 1954 ) ' The unique character of totalitarian society '
in : Totalitarianism .
New York : Grossett & Dunlap .
Historically , the vast majority of regimes were non-democratic - but most of them do not fit this profile .
And today , a society with none of these characteristics might also be seen as fundamentally undemocratic .
In 1953 ' human rights abuses ' were not mentioned - yet they are now considered a definitive characteristic of non-democracies .
So totalitarianism is not usable as a general '' definition of non-democracy ' .
Probably , the early theorists did not intend that anyway , but the term has acquired a secondary meaning of ' non- democratic ' .
Since the definitions of democracy are increasingly checklist definitions , the word totalitarian is used simply to mean ' a regime without a , b and c' - without free elections , without political pluralism , without a free press , without all the other elements on the checklists .
So although most pre-modern regimes had none of Friedrich 's characteristics , they are sometimes thrown into the general category ' totalitarian ' .
A similar problem exists with ' authoritarian ' and ' authoritarianism ' ( and often with ' autocratic ' as well ) .
Although specific definitions exist for specific types of authoritarian political system , the term is often used to mean simply ' non- democratic ' ...
There are a wide range of alternatives to democratic government .
We shall call regimes that have little or no element of democracy , authoritarian or autocratic governments .
There are , of course , many kinds of authoritarian regimes including traditional monarchies and aristocracies ; non-traditional dictatorships and military juntas ; and totalitarian regimes .
For the purposes of this paper , we will ignore the important differences between these different authoritarian regimes .
Are Democracies Stable ?
Compared to What ? , Marc Stier and Robert Mundt .
Democracy exists where the principal leaders of a political system are selected by competitive elections in which the bulk of the population have the opportunity to participate .
Authoritarian systems are non-democratic ones .
Samuel Huntington and Clement Moore ( eds. , 1970 ) , in their ' Conclusion ' of Authoritarian Politics in Modern Society : the Dynamics of Established One - Party Systems New York : Basic Books . ( p. 509 ) .
When Huntington and Moore wrote that in 1970 , the one - party state seemed the definitive modern form of non-democratic state .
Like the definition of totalitarianism , however , that now seems too historically specific , too obviously based on the ' Soviet Bloc ' state .
defining the democratic ethic : legitimacy and secession The ' democratic ethic ' is easier to formulate , than a definition of a democratic system .
In a perfect democracy with no anti-democrats , the inhabitants would all adhere to this ethic .
Two of its basic principles are given below .
It is not fictional or hypothetical - most inhabitants of the democracies do indeed think like this .
However , that can not in itself justify democracy .
The first and most important component of the democratic ethic is so obvious , that it is rarely explicitly named .
It is the principle of ethical and political legitimacy : " a democratic government should not be overthrown " .
In the normal course of affairs , democratic states rely on legitimacy to preserve their own existence and cohesion .
Overthrow of the government is totally off the political agenda : it is taboo to even discuss it .
There is no large army to suppress armed revolts , because there are no large armed revolts - and no small ones either .
The United States is a nation of gun-owners , but despite a month of political feuding over the Gore - Bush election result in 2000 , not a shot was fired for political reasons .
That was a remarkable achievement , in a country with a history of secessionism , Civil War , and military conquest of ethnic minorities .
The ' normal course of affairs ' is historically not normal at all .
What would happen if legitimacy disappeared completely ?
In principle , you could hold free and fair multi-party elections in an open society - and then overthrow the democratically elected government , after each election .
That could happen every week , but it would not be considered ' democracy ' .
This emphasises the formalism and proceduralism of democracy : once followed , the democratic procedures are claimed to produce legitimacy .
The government which is elected by the democratic procedures becomes the absolutely legitimate government .
If legitimacy is strong , then it becomes culturally taboo to overthrow it .
It even becomes taboo not to see it as ' our government ' .
Because US citizens think this way , the United States is politically stable .
To be a democrat means , that you think this should happen : you believe that the democratically elected government is legitimate and must be accepted as legitimate ( unless it is itself anti-democratic ) .
The procedures are not an ornament , they are the essence .
This legitimacy claim is a major ethical defect of democracy - because procedure is no substitute for morality .
Most democrats go much further , and would claim explicitly that a democratically elected government , which has acted on a decision made in accordance with democratic procedures and the rule of law , should not be overthrown , even if the action is morally wrong .
At the heart of democracy is something which is morally unacceptable .
What democrats are saying , is that no value may override democracy .
In terms of regime preference , they are saying , for instance , that a democracy which tortures , is preferable to a dictatorship which does not .
Now , all states claim political legitimacy - that their laws should be obeyed , that their judges are entitled to judge , that they may raise taxes .
However , the claims of democrats imply ethical legitimacy , a claim to moral authority .
It is more like the infallibility claim made by the Catholic Church , which asserts that certain declarations by the Pope are the absolute moral truth .
The democracy theorist Christiano writes ...
Other values may compete with democratic ideals and sometimes override them ...
Thomas Christiano ( 1996 ) The Rule of Many : Fundamental Issues in Democratic Theory .
Boulder : Westview . ( p. 4 ) .
In the democratic ethic , the only remedy for any defect of democracy is democracy itself .
In a democracy , there is certainly no political authority external to the democratic process : there is no ' appeal to a higher tribunal ' .
No other method or process is accepted as a legitimate response to the democratic process , and certainly not the use of force .
The word ' undemocratic ' is used as a synonym for ' criminal ' or ' hostile ' .
It is used to suggest an attack on society , a form of terrorism .
Christiano and other theorists of democracy are ignoring these political realities , if they suggest democracy is not an absolute .
In practice , democrats accord an absolute moral priority to democracy , and an absolute legitimacy .
The evidence for this is simple : they will concede nothing that overrides it .
Not even principles such as justice : the democrat will simply say that democracy is itself justice , or at least the path to justice .
If democrats deny that any moral principle can override democracy , then it is correct to say that they treat democracy as a moral absolute .
These claims for democratic legitimacy indicate the primary function of democratic theory in western democracies .
It serves to legitimise the existing order , however wrong that order may be .
Pro-democracy theorists have a lot on their conscience .
The second important component of the democratic ethic is the prohibition of secession .
Unlike the legitimacy claim , the democratic principles concerning secession are often discussed - for instance in Canada , in connection with Québec secessionism .
Unlimited secession would make democracy pointless .
If free and fair multi-party elections are held in an open society , but anyone who disagrees with the result can set up a separate state , no democrat would accept that as a democracy .
For democrats there must be a unit , beyond which secession is not permitted : this unit is the ' demos ' .
Again , its modern expression is the democratic nation state .
The indivisibility of the demos is as important as legitimacy , because legitimacy collapses in the face of secessionism .
Secessionists see the existing government as ' foreign ' , and they no longer feel any obligation to its laws , institutions , and policies .
So a democratic government ultimately depends on military power to sustain itself in office , and to prevent the unlimited secession of minorities .
This aspect of the democratic ethic brought democrats into a long - term alliance with nationalism .
No guns , no democracy .
Inequality and democracy Democracy has failed to eliminate social inequality , and this seems a permanent and structural failure .
It is undeniable that all democratic societies have social inequalities - substantial differences in income , in wealth , and in social status .
These differences have persisted : there is no indication that inequality will ever disappear in democracies .
In the stable western democracies , inequality is apparently increasing .
The pattern established in the United States is , that the lowest incomes do not grow : all the benefits of economic growth go to the higher - income groups .
Average household income before taxes grew in real terms by nearly one - third between 1979 and 1997 , but that growth was shared unevenly across the income distribution .
The average income for households in the top fifth of the distribution rose by more than half .
In contrast , average income for the middle quintile climbed 10 percent and that for the lowest fifth dropped slightly .
Furthermore , income growth at the very top of the distribution was greater yet : average income in 1997 dollars for the top 1 percent of households more than doubled , rising from $ 420,000 in 1979 to more than $ 1 million in 1997 .
Historical Effective Tax Rates , 1979 - 1997 . , Congressional Budget Office , 2001 , p. 5
Some form of social inequality is inherent in democracy - a fact neglected by most democratic theory .
In a theoretical democracy of 100 voters , a party of 51 voters can confiscate the property of the other 49 .
They can divide it among themselves .
However , if one voter is sick on election day , they lose their majority .
A party of 52 has more chance to divide the property of the minority , but now the minority is 48 and there is slightly less to divide .
A party of 99 will have guaranteed success against a minority of one , but the shares after division will be small .
In practice , a coalition of two - thirds , or three - quarters , can successfully disadvantage a minority ( one third , one quarter ) .
For instance , the majority might exclude the minority from the main labour market , and then force this excluded underclass into workfare .
The emergence of an underclass is usually seen as a structural change within a society , but it might be simply a side - effect of democracy .
Every democracy is a temptation ( to the majority ) to disadvantage minorities .
In practice , every existing liberal democracy is a dual society , with some politically marginalised minority ( typically the urban underclass ) .
Testable propositions : inequality Several testable propositions are available for the hypothesis of structural reinforcement of inequality in democracies : in all democratic states there is inequality of wealth and income
inequality of wealth and income has not declined permanently in any democratic state
in democracies stable over more than one generation , inequality of wealth increases
in democracies stable over more than one generation , inequality of income increases
The first proposition is more or less self - evident : the inequality is there .
The fact that democracy is rarely investigated as a causal factor is itself a political choice .
Most sociologists are democrats : they are not likely to blame democracy for inequality .
In the past , aristocratic conservatives feared that democracy would allow the poor to confiscate the wealth of the rich .
In reality , the historical trend seems exactly the opposite .
Increasingly , western democracy is not about ' ordinary people ' against the elite : it is about ordinary people joining with social elites to ' bash the underclass ' .
Guarantees of fundamental rights do not prevent a low - status minority being targeted , politically and socially .
In several European countries political parties compete against each other , to show how tough they are against an unpopular minority - for instance asylum seekers .
There is nothing the minority can do , so long the political parties do not infringe their rights .
Unfortunately this development is probably still in the early stages : the worst is yet to come .
In a democracy , those at the bottom of the social scale can expect steadily worsening conditions of life .
a fatal transition to democracy
The post -1989 transition in central and eastern Europe provided the first comprehensive indication of the negative effects of democracy .
( Liberal democracy in combination with the free market , which is what western media and governments mean , when they talk of democracy in eastern Europe ) .
In the older democratic states , the present model of democracy was formed over 100 or 200 years .
Britain in 1800 can not be compared with Britain two centuries later : the huge differences are not simply ' the result of democracy ' .
However , in eastern Europe modern states acquired a new political and economic system within a few years - with a complete statistical record .
Russia in 1985 can be compared with Russia in 1995 : the difference is largely due to the economic and political transition .
The UN Development Program listed 7 social - economic costs of the process ( the reference to " life expectancy levels achieved in the 1990s " should apparently read " 1980's " ) :
The process of transition in the region has had huge human development costs , many of which still continue unabated ....
The biggest single ' cost of transition ' has undoubtedly been the loss of lives represented by the decline in life expectancy in several major countries of the region , most notably in the Russian Federation , and most strikingly among young and middle - aged men ....
Most regrettably , the trends in life expectancy have meant that several million people have not survived the 1990s who would have done so if the life expectancy levels achieved in the 1990s had been maintained ....
The second cost of transition has been the rise and persistently high level of morbidity , characterized by higher incidence of common illnesses and by the spread of such diseases as tuberculosis that had been reduced to marginal health threats in the past ....
A third cost of transition has been the extraordinary rise in poverty - both income and human poverty ....
A major contributor to the increase in poverty - along with falling incomes and rising inflation - has been the rise in income and wealth inequality , and this has been a fourth cost of transition ....
A fifth cost of transition has been rising gender inequalities .
During the Soviet era , quotas for women helped to incorporate them into positions of economic and political decision - making and authority , but the advent of more democratic regimes has led paradoxically to lower percentages of women in such positions .
Women have found themselves progressively pushed out of public life .
Simultaneously , their access to paid employment has declined and their total work burden both within the household and outside it has increased ....
A sixth cost of transition has been the considerable deterioration of education ....
A seventh cost of transition has been the rise in unemployment , underemployment and informalization of employment ....
Summing up the seven costs of transition across the whole region underscores the dramatic and widespread deterioration of human security ....
TRANSITION 1999 : Human Development Report for Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS , UNDP ( Chapter 1 ) .
The report itself has more detail on all of these aspects , and especially on poverty .
In historical perspective , this is clearly not indicative of a voluntary choice for emancipation and progress .
Instead these characteristics are consistent with the traditional historical pattern of expansion by conquest : more on this ' democratic conquest ' below .
So what would happen if the existing market democracy was abolished , in an older liberal - democracy such as Britain or the Netherlands ?
It is not possible to recreate 1980's ' Soviet - bloc ' societies in these countries , but experience in eastern Europe indicates the possible benefits of a reverse transition ...
life expectancy would rise
public health would improve : the incidence of infectious diseases would fall
poverty would decline sharply , although the mean income would probably also fall
income inequalities would fall
women would have higher social status , more access to political - administrative structures , and more access to employment
there would be more resources for education , and access to education would improve
unemployment would fall : there would be fewer people in insecure jobs , and possibly also fewer in low - productivity ' junk jobs ' ( also a form of underemployment )
Supporters of democracy themselves use social and political comparisons between very different societies - for instance between Stalin 's Russia ( or Hitler 's Germany ) and the present USA .
The western lobby in favour of the transition process in eastern Europe also quote its successes - again using longitudinal comparisons of non-comparable societies .
If cross-generational , cross-cultural , cross-societal comparisons are acceptable in justification of democracy , then why not in criticism of it ?
death in democracy
Income inequality is probably not the best indicator of structural inequalities in democracies .
The statistics on health give a more comprehensive picture of a fundamental , long - term , inequality - apparently resistant to all declared government policy .
The evidence for a worsening gap is also clearer in the health statistics .
Above all , inequalities in mortality are a moral defect of democracies .
This comment is on western European countries : all of them are democracies :
The differences in mortality and morbidity are quite shocking .
Economically inactive men have three times the risk of premature death observed for employed men .
While strong health selection increases the risk of exclusion from the labour market , it seems likely that there is also reverse causation due to social isolation and stress .
Finland and Norway were used to illustrate the concept of healthy life - expectancies .
Norwegian and Finnish men with post secondary education live 3 - 4 years longer than men with basic education , and 10 - 12 years more of healthy life , that is , without chronic debilitating illness .
One important change between the 1970s and the 1980s is that Sweden , Norway and Denmark have lost their relatively favourable international position in terms of the size of mortality differences between classes .
There are some other striking findings ;
French men in lower socio economic groups had much greater excess mortality than the European average , which Kunst et al suggest may be due to the level of alcohol consumption ; and while Nordic countries show large morbidity differences by education level , Great Britain shows large mortality differences by income .
Health and health care policy : inequality and the risks of exclusion , Council of Europe Human Dignity and Social Exclusion Project .
See the CoE site for footnotes and references , deleted here .
Public health and epidemiology journals are full of such examples of health inequalities .
In several countries there have also been major national studies , which confirm that health and mortality inequalities are a general pattern .
In Britain , the 1998 Acheson Report on health inequalities showed that they had worsened since the last major study , the Black Report in 1980 .
Those were the years of the Conservative governments in Britain , so perhaps the Conservative policies are responsible .
But that is the point : those Conservative governments were democratically elected .
If democracy was a system which prevented inequalities in death rates , then democracy would prevent a government which worsened those inequalities .
If democracy was a system which prevented inequalities in death rates , then there would be no inequalities anyway .
But there are , and democracy is apparently making them worse ....
Over the last twenty years , death rates have fallen among both men and women and across all social groups .
However , the difference in rates between those at the top and bottom of the social scale has widened .
For example , in the early 1970s , the mortality rate among men of working age was almost twice as high for those in class V ( unskilled ) as for those in class I ( professional ) .
By the early 1990s , it was almost three times higher .
This increasing differential is because , although rates fell overall , they fell more among the high social classes than the low social classes .... not only did the differential between the top and the bottom increase , the increase happened across the whole spectrum of social classes ....
Death rates can be summarised into average life expectancy at birth .
For men in classes I and II combined , life expectancy increased by 2 years between the late 1970s and the late 1980s .
For those in classes IV and V combined , the increase was smaller , 1.4 years .
The difference between those at the top and bottom of the social class scale in the late 1980s was 5 years , 75 years compared with 70 years .
For women , the differential was smaller , 80 years compared with 77 years ....
Premature mortality , that is death before age 65 , is higher among people who are unskilled .
Table 4 illustrates this with an analysis of deaths in men aged 20 to 64 years .
If all men in this age group had the same death rates as those in classes I and II , it is estimated that there would have been over 17,000 fewer deaths each year from 1991 to 1993 ....

The estimate of excess deaths - excess in comparison with equal death rates - gives an idea of the scale of suffering involved .
Research in Spain estimated a national 10 % excess mortality by geographical areas :
Excess number of deaths in the most deprived geographical areas account for 10 % of total number of deaths annually .... Total annual excess of deaths was estimated to be about 35 000 people in Spain .
Juan Benach and Yutaka Yasui .
Geographical patterns of excess mortality in Spain explained by two indices of deprivation , Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health 53 ( 1999 ) : 423-431 .
It is hard to show that democracy causes these deaths , but it certainly does not prevent them .
That is , in itself , reason to question its moral legitimacy .
In eastern Europe , the scale of deaths associated with the transition to market democracy was far greater .
Roland Scharff estimated the total excess deaths in the reform years ( 1992 - 1996 ) at 3,5 million .
Als vorläufiges Fazit bleibt festzuhalten , dass sich während der fünf Reformjahre ein Natürlicher Bevölkerungsverlust in einem Umfang von 3,5 Mio. " toten Seelen " aufsummiert hat .

This mortality episode is the best documented in history , and the transition itself was its cause .
Yet even this fades into insignificance , compared with excess mortality at global level ....
the issue of Africa : global inequality Although the democratic states are the most prosperous in history , democracy has failed to eliminate inequality at global level .
Despite the great personal wealth evident in some democratic nations , millions of people in the poorest regions of Africa live under conditions , comparable to mediaeval European averages .
Although not all states were democratic during the 20th century , the richest states were .
Nevertheless , the general global distribution of wealth has not shifted substantially in the last 150 years .
This also seems a permanent and structural failure of democracy .
Democracy does not induce the rich to give their money to the poor : not locally , not globally .
Not as individuals , not as societies , not as states .
Every year the wealth of the democracies increases : every year the gap between the richest democracies and the poorest countries increases .
Mass resource transfer , for instance in the form of transfer taxes , is increasingly feasible - and also increasingly urgent .
Some democratic states have organised programmes of resource transfer : the largest in history is probably the aid to East Germany after reunification , financed by an extra income tax .
But that is a special case of a divided ' Volk ' .
The European Union has an explicit policy that no regional ' GNP ' should stay below 75 % of EU average .
It also aids applicant states , with a maximum of 6 % of their GNP in any one year .
Yet no such transfer programme exists for the poorest countries .
Probably , only the German programme matched the level of resource transfer from the Soviet Union to Mongolia : approximately 30 % of GNP .
The collapse of the Soviet Union promptly led to widespread extreme poverty in Mongolia , with famine in the spring of 2000 .
The pro-democracy development theorist Amartya Sen claims that democracy prevents famines :
... in the terrible history of famines in the world , no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent and democratic country with a relatively free press .
We cannot find exceptions to this rule , no matter where we look : the recent famines of Ethiopia , Somalia , or other dictatorial regimes ; famines in the Soviet Union in the 1930s ; China 's 1958 - 61 famine with the failure of the Great Leap Forward ; or earlier still , the famines in Ireland or India under alien rule .
China , although it was in many ways doing much better economically than India , still managed ( unlike India ) to have a famine , indeed the largest recorded famine in world history : Nearly 30 million people died in the famine of 1958 - 61 , while faulty governmental policies remained uncorrected for three full years .
The policies went uncriticized because there were no opposition parties in parliament , no free press , and no multiparty elections .
Indeed , it is precisely this lack of challenge that allowed the deeply defective policies to continue even though they were killing millions each year .
The same can be said about the world 's two contemporary famines , occurring right now in North Korea and Sudan .
Democracy as a Universal Value , Amartya Sen , 1999 .
Yet the rich democratic states had enough resources to feed all these people : and they did not .
Structurally , they did not .
They could have flown these millions of hungry people to the United States , western Europe , or Japan , where there was enough food .
They did not .
Amartya
Sen does not regard this as a defect of democracy : indeed , he seems blind to the issue .
If opposition parties in parliament , a free press , and multiparty elections stop famines , and the worlds richest state has all of these , then why are there still famines on this planet ?
A causal relationship between democracy and famine exists primarily at a global level .
It would be most acute , in a world order of perfectly democratic nation states .
Such a world order would institutionalise the selfish behaviour of the hypothetical rich democracy , described in the introduction .
Nation states generally consider the national wealth as reserved for that nation - not available for total redistribution to others .
In nation states , by definition , the national territory is reserved for members of the nation .
The democratisation of a nation state reinforces there inherent qualities .
The electorate generally does not want to give ' their money ' to foreign countries , and they do not want to dilute their standard of living by mass immigration .
A democratic and national world order does not cause droughts or crop failures .
However , it destroys two standard historical responses to famine : redistribution of food , and migration to non-famine areas .
Although there is no historical tradition of mass migration for medical care in response to high mortality , it destroys that option also .
The national - democratic world order - the dream of Kofi Annan - imprisons the poor in poverty and ill - health .
In some cases their situation is improving : in Africa it is acutely worsening .
Testable propositions : global inequality
In terms of inequality , it seems that a planet is better off without any democracies .
Historically , the rise of democracies coincided with a period of unprecedented global inequality .
Supporters of the democratic peace theory imply causal relations from this kind of simple correlation ( " if there is no war , then democracy caused the peace " ) .
Similar conclusions can be drawn in connection with these testable propositions , such as these about inequality ... absolute global inequality between states , as the gap between the gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in the poorest and the richest state , is greater since modern democracies emerged
relative inequality between states , as the ratio of per capita GDP in the richest and poorest states , is greater since modern democracies emerged
statistical measures of ' national - income ' inequality will show a greater coefficient of inter-state inequality in the period of democracies ( about the last 150 years ) than before it
inter - state inequalities of this kind are greater between democracies and non-democracies , than within the group of democracies , or the group of non-democracies Testing some of these would be difficult : historical economic data is limited .
But it would be very surprising if they are not true - for the simple reason that the democratic countries are the rich countries .
There is already enough data on long - term patterns of economic growth , to conclude that the rich - poor gap among states is increasing .
Research by Angus Madison for the OECD , indicated that the gap ( in GDP / capita ) between western Europe and sub-Saharan Africa was about 3 - to - 1 , in 1820 .
By 1990 it had increased to 20 - to - 1 . During this long period western Europe was not continuously democratic , so this Europe - Africa gap is not equivalent to the gap between democracies and non-democracies .
However , that has changed : in the last generation , ' democracy ' and ' rich country ' have become almost equivalent .
According to the 2004 World Bank estimates , over 1,1 billion people live on less than $ 1 a day , the same as a decade earlier .
( These figures are already corrected for the differences in purchasing power ) .
In sub -Saharan Africa the proportion living under this official ' extreme poverty ' limit rose to 46 % .
The income ratio - of the poorest 20 countries to the richest 20 - has doubled in the last 40 years .
And for that time at least , most of these rich countries were democracies .
There are a few rich non-democracies , such as the United Arab Emirates , and some poor democracies such as Cape Verde .
But the correlation between a democratic regime and prosperity is now so strong , that some democracy theorists see prosperity as a precondition of democracy .
Others claim a causal link in the other direction - " democracy makes you rich ' .
Perhaps - but the statistics suggest it does so by keeping others poor .
In broad terms , sub -Saharan Africa has a European 19th - century standard of living .
It would take 150 or years to follow the path to prosperity taken by western Europe - and western Europe had no massive HIV / AIDS epidemic .
150 years may not even be enough .
At the current rate of progress , according to the UNDP Human Development Report 2002 , it would take more than 130 years , simply to rid the world of hunger .
The UNDP seeks to reduce child mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa by two - thirds by 2015 , but the 2003 Human Development Report estimates it will take 150 years more at current trends .
Figure 2.1 gives estimates of the time needed to achieve all the ' Millennium Goals ' relating to poverty , health and equality : it extends to 2200 .
In some areas ' progress ' is negative - at current trends the goals will never be reached .
Here too , the negative trend at global level is most acute in the mortality statistics :
.... while there is heated debate on whether income inequality is increasing between rich and poor countries , inequality in child mortality has gotten unambiguously worse .
In the early 1990s children under five were 19 times more likely to die in Sub -Saharan Africa than in rich countries - and today , 26 times more likely ( figure 2.2 ) .
Among all developing regions only Latin America and the Caribbean saw no worsening in the past decade relative to rich countries , with children still about 5 times more likely to die before their fifth birthdays .
United Nations Development Programme .
Human Development Report 2003 , 39 - 40 .
But huge differences - up to a hundred - fold - exist in the risk of pregnancy between women in rich and poor countries , the highest differential of any public health indicator monitored by WHO .
The lifetime risk that a woman in West Africa will die in pregnancy or childbirth is 1 in 12 .
In developed regions , the comparable risk is 1 in 4,000 .
Because they receive prompt and effective treatment , women in the developed world rarely die or experience permanent disabilities from pregnancy - related problems .
United Nations Population Fund .
State of World Population Report 2004 , 52 .
On current trends , the goals of reducing child and maternal mortality will not be attained in most regions , and only a small proportion of countries ( 15 to 20 percent ) appear to be on track .
The goal of halting and reversing the spread of HIV / AIDS and other major diseases ( malaria , tuberculosis ) appears daunting ; their incidence continues to rise , further aggravating conditions affecting child and maternal mortality and entailing broad and serious economic and social consequences .
The risks of failure to halt the spread of HIV / AIDS are especially high in Sub- Saharan Africa ...
IMF / World Bank
Global Monitoring Report 2004 , Summary
And the UNICEF progess report on the Millenium Goals ( May 2006 ) confirmed that goals for reduction in undernutrition are not beng met either .
Again , in Africa there is no progess at all ...
But little improvement has been seen in sub-Saharan Africa , where underweight prevalence remained roughly the same over the 1990 - 2004 period .
In fact , given this lack of progress and due to population growth , the total number of underweight children actually increased in sub- Saharan Africa .
It is not morally acceptable to insist that Africa should ' develop itself ' by duplicating the poverty and inequality of 19th - century England , while suffering a demographic crisis comparable to the Black Death .
It is not morally acceptable to demand 130 years of avoidable hunger , even if the result is universal prosperity .
The ' development ' option is no longer an option at all .
Yet this is apparently what the democracies are demanding .
Certainly there is no ' political will ' in the democracies , to introduce the massive transfer taxes that would be necessary to close the gap .
Democracies seem structurally unable to generate this political will .
The UN aid target of 0,7 % of GNP has never been reached .
According to the OECD Development Assistance Committee , its member states donated 0.33 % of GNI in 2005 .
That was up from 0.26 % in 2004 , but most of the rise in ' aid ' was accounted for by one - off debt relief arrangements , and the Development Assistance Committee expects a fall in aid in 2006 and 2007 .
The UNCTAD Least Developed Countries Report 2004 shows a total aid to the poorest countries of $ 15 137 million ( Table 23 ) .
For their 700 million inhabitants , that is $ 22 per year , or 6 dollarcent per person per day .
That is a gesture , not a transfer of wealth and income .
An indicator of the unwillingness to transfer is provided by the World Health Report 2004 : 4 to 8 million people need immediate treatment for AIDS , and at most 10 % are getting it .
All the DAC members are democracies , with maximum scores for ' political rights ' in the Freedom House Survey .
What chance is there , that they will ever approve the 70 % income transfers needed to evenly spread global ' GNP ' ?
The realistic answer must be : it is simply not possible to close this gap , so long as they are democracies .
The conservatism of democratic culture
At best democracy is no more than a system of government , but in western democracies it has acquired a sacred status , and it is taboo to question it .
Yet there is no moral basis for this cult of democracy , for this sacralisation .
As Bhikhu Parekh says of liberalism :
Unless we assume that liberalism represents the final truth about human beings , we cannot indiscriminately condemn societies that do not conform to it .
Bhikhu Parekh ( 1993 ) .
The cultural particularity of liberal democracy , in David Held ( ed. ) Prospects for Democracy : North , South , East , West Cambridge : Polity . ( p. 169 ) .
The uniformity and conformity of liberal - democratic societies has been criticised , for almost as long as they exist - from the 19th century on .
At first , these criticisms amounted to a nostalgia for aristocratic individualism , and it is still a favourite tactic of democrats to label all criticism of democracy as ' elitist ' .
John Stuart Mill is typical of this type of aristocratic criticism , directed at the emerging mass society :
It does seem , however , that when the opinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or becoming the dominant power , the counterpoise and corrective to that tendency would be , the more and more pronounced individuality of those who stand on the higher eminences of thought .
It is in these circumstances most especially , that exceptional individuals , instead of being deterred , should be encouraged in acting differently from the mass .
In other times there was no advantage in their doing so , unless they acted not only differently , but better .
In this age the mere example of non-conformity , the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom , is itself a service .
Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach , it is desirable , in order to break through that tyranny , that people should be eccentric .
Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded ; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius , mental vigor , and moral courage which it contained .
That so few now dare to be eccentric , marks the chief danger of the time .
On Liberty , John Stuart Mill 1859 .
( Chapter III : On individuality , as one of the elements of wellbeing ) .
However not all anti-conformist criticism can be dismissed as aristocratic nostalgia .
In the 100 years after Mill wrote , the aristocratic culture of noble eccentricity became culturally marginal .
Instead , new forms of individualist ' eccentricity ' emerged within mass culture , especially from the 1960 's onwards .
Criticism of conformity is primarily criticism of liberal society , rather than democracy as a political regime .
Democracy in itself can not be blamed for a uniform culture , a static culture , or social conformity .
But in their political culture , democracies have failed to match the image they present .
Pro-democracy propaganda , for instance in eastern Europe just after 1989 , presents democracy as politically dynamic and internally diverse .
In reality , all western democracies have stable party systems , dominated by elites : together they form what in Italian is called the classe politica .
It is extremely difficult to break open this ' political class ' , from outside : the system is neither dynamic , nor open to innovation .
As a result , it is not a force for social and cultural innovation either .
Testable propositions ...
The idea of increasing political conformity and uniformity is difficult to operationalise , but these propositions could be investigated ... in democracies , the range of political ideas ( in the manifestos of parties elected to parliament ) shrinks .
in democracies , the difference in stated aims between major parties ( those with more than 5 % of the vote ) also shrinks
democracy inhibits the formation of major new political parties ( fusions of existing parties excepted ) : the chance that , in any 10 - year period , a completely new party will gain more than 5 % of the vote , is small .
democracy inhibits the formation of major new political - ideological groups of parties ( comparable to the green parties in western Europe , the only such example in the last generation )
Democracy has brought societies which are monotonous and uniform , at least to some of the people who live in them .
But not only that .
Democracy has failed to bring utopia .
That is , it has failed to bring into existence any proposed ideal society , or any other proposal of a ' utopian ' type .
Democracy itself can be labelled a ' utopia ' , and the present liberal - democratic societies are historically unique - nothing like them existed before the 19th century .
So , in that sense , democracy has brought at least a new democratic society , which is itself an ideal society for some people .
But nothing else .
No dramatically new type of society has emerged among the democracies , differing from the standard model of these societies .
And most liberal - democrats would in fact be hostile to the label ' utopia ' being applied to these liberal - democratic societies .
The liberal tradition is resolutely hostile to utopias : anti-utopianism seems a defining characteristic of liberal ideology .
That hostility has shaped the present liberal - democratic societies .
Liberal anti-utopianism and democratic anti-totalitarianism are in practice the same thing .
Some liberals explicitly equate the two , and see totalitarianism as the result of utopian ideals .
They believe that the 20th - century totalitarian regimes derive from the European utopian tradition .
The early - modern ideal city , the ideal city - states of the type described in Thomas More 's original book ' Utopia " , were for them the source of all later evil .
( Many postmodernists share this distaste for utopia , and the belief that there is a direct line from Thomas More to Auschwitz ) .
In other words , there are liberal - democrats who believe that the political system should be so structured , as to save society from utopian experiments .
To them , democracy is ( at least partly ) a mechanism to prevent utopia .
I think they are right about the nature of democracy : but it is democracy , not utopia , which must disappear .
.... historical inevitability dictated the triumph of individual human rights that was inherent in the political transformation that mankind was experiencing , particularly in the phenomenon of mass political awakening with which we wanted to identify the forces of democracy and freedom .
This was our response to the challenge posed by the notion that so dominated our century : that a coercive utopia derived from dogmatic hubris , that a perfect society , a form of heaven on earth , could be constructed by political compulsion .
Zbigniew Brzezinski , Morgenthau Memorial Lecture 1995 .
The resistance of democracy to innovation , is clearly related to the reluctance to accept any criticism of it .
Although pro-democratic theorists often say they are not claiming democracy is perfect , in practice it does have a semi- sacred status .
So in democratic societies , criticism of democracy , even without questioning its fundamental principles , is regarded with suspicion and hostility .
Especially , democrats are reluctant to accept that a democratic system can be corrupted .
They may try to associate this criticism with fascism : corruption and ' decadence ' were indeed major themes of anti-democratic propaganda in the 1930's .
Logically , that implies that there is an underlying belief that democracy is in some way ' pure ' or ' perfect ' .
In turn this creates a tendency to social self - worship , at its most extreme in the United States .
Widespread belief that the existing society is perfect or quasi - sacred , creates a climate for complacency and social conformity , not for innovation .
Sacralisation is , by definition , a contra - innovative social phenomenon : the sacred is preserved , to abolish it is sacrilege .
A conservative and anti-utopian bias has specific effects inside a nation state .
No existing democracy began in an ethical and cultural vacuum of the kind used in social - contract theories .
Their values are the pre-existing values of the constituent demos ( nation ) .
The ' democratic values ' in a democratic nation - state are the values of the dominant ethno- cultural group , which first constituted that nation - state .
Danish democratic values are Danish values , Norwegian democratic values are Norwegian values .
Rejection of these values would require an individual moral choice , and the truly democratic citizen does not exercise individual moral judgment , but blindly accepts election results .
That mentality is unlikely to produce innovation in the core values : most will be transmitted unchanged from one generation to the next .
Paradoxically , the source of values in a democracy is often not the voters , but the voters ' ancestors .
The myth of moral superiority of democracy Democratic states can claim no morally superior origin .
Their own mythology places their origins in the political movements of ' the people ' ( starting with the older western democracies ) .
Let me sum up the past two hundred years of democratic history .
The intertwined histories of democratic legitimations , social movement activism and institutional changes generated , in some of the world 's states , a significant democratization of the institutions of government .
Despite antidemocratic countertrends , the long run direction of change in some of the states was a democratization of state power .
Globalization and the Future of Democracy , John Markoff .

the military origins of democracy in Europe The NATO actions in Kosovo were the first explicit ' war for democracy ' in Europe , since the end of the Cold War .
With hindsight , this seems an inevitable development .
By the end of the Second World War in 1945 , citizens of western Europe or the United States found it normal to enforce democracy by war .
During the geopolitical stability of the Cold War , however , fear of a nuclear holocaust eroded that attitude .
Now , democratic conquest is back , inside and outside Europe .
Once again , democratic values are explicitly claimed to justify war .
Most democratic regimes in Europe were enforced from outside anyway - by invasion , occupation , or as a condition of economic aid .
Democracy in Europe came from the barrel of a gun , or from the power of the dollar , but rarely from the people ....

The present democracies in Europe do not match the democratic mythology .
They are not the product of successive popular uprisings against absolutist monarchies or totalitarian regimes .
A far more appropriate term is ' democratic conquest ' , more on that below .
There is nothing inherently noble , admirable , or moral , in such a war of conquest .
Tutu Vanhanen reviews the explanations for democratisation in Prospects of Democracy : a Study of 172 Countries ( London : Routledge .
1997 . p. 10 - 21 ) .
At least , the explanations which have been proposed in English - language political science , including the many theorists who say there is no single factor .
The list includes no mention of military intervention ( or economic warfare ) as causal factors in the transition to democracy .
A theory of colonialism which did not mention the colonising powers , and suggested the transition to being a colony was a process internal to each colony , would be unacceptable .
testable propositions
If democratisation was categorised historically on the analogy with colonial conquests , these hypotheses could be researched ... of the states which have made a transition from non-democracy to democracy since 1939 , most have done so following a military intervention by democratic powers .
past military intervention by a democratic power , rather than any traditional explanation such as economic development , is the best predictor that a country will be a democracy .
of the military interventions since 1900 with the stated purpose of imposing a political system on a state , the majority ( if not all ) were to impose or restore democracy
Even when the explanation of democratisation is expanded to include non-internal factors , there is a reluctance to mention military force .
Laurence Whitehead suggest three basic models for the international spread of democracy : contagion , control and consent .
The essential point is that approaching two - thirds of the democracies existing in 1990 owed their origins , at least in part , to deliberate acts of imposition or intervention from without ( acts , moreover , that were undertaking within living memory ) .
Given this , an interpretation which excludes from consideration the roles played by external actors , their motives , or their instruments of action is bound to produce a highly distorted image of the international dimension of democratization ...
Laurence Whitehead ( 1996 )
Three international dimensions of democratization , in The International Dimensions of Democratization : Europe and the Americas Oxford : OUP . ( p. 9 ) .
Since that was published , there have been more explicit examples of the ' international dimension ' , in Kosovo , Serbia and Timor .
The invasion of Iraq , for the declared purpose of ' regime change ' , is probably the best example of ' external actors ' in democratisation .
Several years before the Iraq war , USAID ( the official US aid agency ) , had prepared a list of pro-democracy tactics .
It indicates how thorough the ' external actors ' can be - especially with military backing ...

Credible and effective elections , where voters have confidence in the process .
Local , national , regional , and international organizations that protect human rights , including the rights of workers , indigenous peoples , minorities , and women .
Trade unions , professional associations , women 's groups , educational entities , and a wide range of indigenous NGOs , particularly those that are partners in development programs .
Political parties and other national mechanisms of political expression in a strictly nonpartisan manner and , consistent with statutory limitations , in a manner that does not influence the outcome of an election .
Independent media outlets and groups formed to promote and protect freedom of expression .
Improved civil - military relations , including effective civilian control of the military establishment .
Institutions and organizations that increase government responsiveness and accountability at the national , state , and local levels .
Educational efforts for children and adults that reflect community participation , promote the development of local NGOs , and encourage tolerance within society .
Finally , as a natural complement to longer - term democracy - building efforts , USAID , in consultation with other U.S. Government agencies and with adequate human rights safeguards , will support programs in transition situations for the establishment of democratic political institutions and for the demobilization and retraining of soldiers and insurgents .
USAID'S Strategies - Building Democracy
This is quite different from a popular uprising .
By definition , no process initiated by USAID or other external agency , derives ' from the people ' inside the territory concerned .
In Bosnia and Kosovo , democratic powers could implement a democratisation programme because of a military occupation .
That is the stated aim in Iraq , without much success so far .
Generally , such programmes emphasise funding of pro-democracy parties , groups and media .
The funds go to a small elite : perhaps for that reason , no multi-ethnic political system has yet emerged , in either Bosnia or Kosovo .
It is not likely in Iraq either .
exclusion of the undemocratic : total democracy
The democratic claim to moral superiority is partly based on the treatment of persons within democracies .
Liberal democracies also claim to be politically neutral .
Nevertheless , even model democracies exclude ( and often politically persecute ) anti-democrats .
In this respect , a democratic system is like all other regimes : it takes measures to ensure its own survival .
The western Cold War slogan " at least there is free speech here " , usually did not apply to undemocratic organisations .
That is still true in the liberal democracies .
Anti-democrats are often excluded from the use of human and political rights , and anti-democratic parties are sometimes forbidden .
The new European Charter of Fundamental Rights contains such an exclusion :
Article 54 Prohibition of abuse of rights
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as implying any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms recognised in this Charter ....
Draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
The Charter also includes the basic political rights now used to define democracy , including voting and candidacy rights .
Article 54 therefore constitutes an exclusion of anti-democrats from those rights .
The German Constitution is another example : for historical reasons , the ' defence of democracy ' plays a greater role in German political culture , than in other democracies .
Artikel 18 - Einbüssen von Grundrechten
Wer die Freiheit der Meinungsäusserung , insbesondere die Pressefreiheit ( Artikel 5 Abs. 1 ) , die Lehrfreiheit ( Artikel 5 Abs. 3 ) , die Versammlungsfreiheit ( Artikel 8 ) , die Vereinigungsfreiheit ( Artikel 9 ) , das Brief - , Post - und Fernmeldegeheimnis ( Artikel 10 ) , das Eigentum ( Artikel 14 ) oder das Asylrecht ( Artikel 16 a ) zum Kampfe gegen die freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung missbraucht , verwirkt diese Grundrechte .
Die Verwirkung und ihr Ausmass werden durch das Bundesverfassungsgericht ausgesprochen .
Bundestag : Grundgesetz Article 18 [ Forfeiture of basic rights ]
Whoever abuses freedom of expression of opinion , in particular freedom of the press ( Article 5 ( 1 ) ) , freedom of teaching ( Article 5 ( 3 ) ) , freedom of assembly ( Article 8 ) , freedom of association ( Article 9 ) , privacy of letters and secrecy of post and telecommunication ( Article 10 ) , property ( Article 14 ) , or the right to asylum ( Article 16a ) in order to combat the free democratic basic order forfeit these basic rights .
Such forfeiture and the extent thereof is determined by the Federal Constitutional Court .
Constitution of Germany
The suppression of political parties is normal practice in established liberal democracies .
In an article on party bans in Israel , Raphael Cohen - Almagor gives the typical justification for this practice :
This article argues that it is neither morally obligatory , nor morally coherent , to expect democracy to place the means for its own destruction in the hands of those who either wish to bring about the annihilation of the state , or to undermine democracy , and who take active steps to realize those ends .
Raphael Cohen - Almagor ( 1997 ) Disqualification of political parties in Israel : 1988 - 1996
It is even possible to define democracy by these characteristics - as a political system where democratic forces hold absolute political power , at least in relation to non-democrats , and where they institutionally persecute anti-democrats .
It is not a comprehensive definition , but it is descriptive of most democracies .
If democracy were truly a superior system of government , then it would ( presumably ) not need this harassment of its opponents .
All democracies also maintain a culture of democracy - a parallel to the ' national culture ' , which all nation states support .
It is the exclusive political culture : there can be no ' culture of totalitarianism ' in a democracy .
Paradoxically , in the stable democracies , this has created a ' total democracy ' , with the characteristics attributed to totalitarian culture .
In the liberal democracies , democratic attitudes pervade all aspects of life , and especially education .
At universities in liberal democracies , standard political science courses include only pro-democratic theorists .
Despite this total - democracy culture , democrats often claim that living in a democracy is equivalent to ' freedom ' - usually meaning political freedom .
The classic example is again the Freedom House annual survey , which claims to show how many countries are ' free ' .
It is often quoted in the media as factual truth , without any further analysis .
Many of the leading theorists of liberal market democracy work on Freedom House projects : that group overlaps with the US foreign policy establishment .
( The academic advisors included Larry Diamond , Jeane Kirkpatrick , Seymour Lipset , Alexander Motyl , and the neoconservative Islam - basher Daniel Pipes ) .
Their definition of freedom overlaps the definition of a liberal democracy : it is no surprise that liberal - democratic countries get the best scores for ' freedom ' .
But this is no more than circular reasoning : if political freedom is defined as ' living under a democracy ' , then democracies have political freedom .
Nevertheless people are also unfree in democracies - in ways that seem specific to liberal market democracy itself .
In general it is the market which limits social and economic freedom , rather than their political regime .
The operation of the labour market , and the conditions of employment , provide the best examples .
Some US employers in the services and retail sectors require their employees to smile permanently , at least in the presence of customers .
In a few cases , employers have required plastic surgery , as a condition of employment .
These are impositions , and restrict personal freedom .
The point is , that they are apparently culturally specific to the liberal market democracies .
Unlike , for instance , poverty or inequality , they are not reported in any historical non-democratic society .
Apparently , the market democracies have certain specific unfreedoms , which undermine their claim to be ' free ' .
the illegal immigrant and democracy
The pretensions of liberal - democratic states are undermined especially by their treatment of illegal immigrants .
Unlike many previous ' democratic deficits ' , this can not be remedied inside the political structure of these states .
For instance , until the time of the First World War , women were excluded from voting in many western democracies .
That democratic deficit was remedied by the introduction of universal adult suffrage in the 1920's .
Still , the ' demos ' in the democratic system continued to be the same nation , that formed the nation state .
Britain was no less British , when British women got the vote .
But conceding full citizenship to anyone who can cross the border ( legally or illegally ) , would ultimately change the population structure of the western nation states .
Most democratic theorists are apparently unwilling to welcome 500 million new African fellow - citizens : and so they defend a ' demos ' equivalent to existing populations of nation states .
The fifth and final criterion for the democratic process is , then , as follows :
The demos must include all adult members of the association except transients and persons proved to be mentally defective .
Admittedly the definition of adults and transients is a potential source of ambiguity .
Robert Dahl ( 1989 ) .
Democracy and its Critics .
New Haven : Yale University Press . ( p. 129 ) .
How does a typical western democracy , such as the Netherlands or Britain , appear to an illegal immigrant ?
Again the Freedom House checklist can be used - this time to check on the people who wrote it , or at least the system they defend .
First the political rights of illegal immigrants , the ' transients ' ...
Can illegal immigrants vote for the head of state and / or head of government in free and fair elections ?
No .
Can illegal immigrants vote for the legislative representatives in free and fair elections ?
No .
Have they equal campaigning opportunities ?
No , in practice , since any public activity can lead to their arrest .
Do illegal immigrants have the right to organize in different political parties or other competitive political groupings of their choice ?
No.
Formal legal registration of any association would be difficult : registration of the party for electoral purposes would be in practice impossible , since the illegals would have to disclose their address .
Such a party could operate only by using legal residents as a front .
The civil rights checklist , especially , indicates the second - class status of illegal immigrants ...
Can illegal immigrants have their own free and independent media and other forms of cultural expression ?
No .
Any offices of a newspaper , any TV studio , would be subject to possible police raids and detention of the illegals .
Their media would also have to operate through a front .
Have illegal immigrants free religious institutions , and is there free private and public religious expression ?
Yes , in private .
Police in the EU member states rarely arrest immigrants at a mosque , for instance .
But public expressions , religious or otherwise , expose the speaker to arrest and detention .
Is there freedom of assembly , demonstration , and open public discussion for illegal immigrants ?
No .
A demonstration or meeting , specifically for illegal immigrants , would be an invitation to the police to detain all the demonstrators .
In practice immigrants can only participate in demonstrations or meetings organised by legal existing groups .
They must rely on the political influence of the organisers , to prevent their arrest during the activity .
Is there freedom of political or quasi-political organization for illegal immigrants ?
No. Again , any organisation specifically for illegals could not operate from a fixed address , or with legal registration .
Illegals who participate in existing political organisations must trust that organisation to protect them from arrest .
Is the population treated equally under the law ?
No .
Illegal immigrants are excluded from participation in the legal system , as judges and lawyers , and as jurors in countries with a jury system .
Is there protection from unjustified imprisonment and exile ?
No .
In fact this is the standard fate of the illegal immigrant : detention and deportation .
( The term ' exile ' implies that native - born citizens somehow suffer more from a deportation than an immigrant - a racist distinction ) .
Is there personal autonomy for illegal immigrants ?
Does the state control travel , choice of residence , or choice of employment ?
Yes , the state controls all of these , or attempts to .
In the Netherlands you must have a valid residence permit to travel on the train , rent a house in the social sector , or get a legal job .
If these kind of controls
The upcoming G - 8 conference , scheduled for July 15 - 18 in St. Petersburg , is shaping up as the latest battleground in the developing conflict between Putin ’s Russia and the West .
This summit is " really about Russia , " says the BBC , and as far as the West is concerned , it ’s all criticism all the time .
The barrage of anti-Russian ( and , specifically , anti-Putin ) propaganda in the Western media has been relentless ever since Moscow refused to get on board the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
As punishment for such brazen defiance , Richard Perle demanded that Russia be thrown out of the G - 8 .
More recently , as the Russians decline to kowtow to the Americans ( and the Europeans ) over Iran ( and Ukraine ) , Vice President Dick Cheney has been ratcheting up the rhetoric , accusing the Russians of " blackmail "  when they quite reasonably insisted the Ukrainians had to pay the world market price for their oil  and darkly hinting that Putin harbors imperialistic designs on his neighbors .
This last accusation , coming as it does from Washington ’s most belligerent warlord , is a classic case of projection : indeed , it inverts the reality , which is that the U.S. , not content with one " war of civilizations , " is doggedly trying to provoke yet another .
Toward this end , the Americans are presently engaged in an all - out political assault on the Putin regime , an exercise in " soft power " they hope will eventually culminate in regime change .
We ’ve come a long way since Bush looked into Putin ’s eyes and espied the Russian leader ’s soul .
This time , it will be more of a head - butting than a bonding .
The Americans are after Putin ’s scalp for the same reasons they went after Milosevic and Saddam : not for their crimes , both real and imagined , but because he insistently defies them .
Instead of bowing to the wishes of the would - be hegemon and its Middle Eastern ally , the Russkis are selling missiles to Damascus and doing business with Tehran .
And now , flush with funds from rising oil prices , Putin is flexing his muscles , picking the crippled Russian bear up off its knees .
Nothing could enrage the Americans more : after all , they thought they won the Cold War , fair and square .
Do n’t the Russians know they ’re beaten ?
Russia is far from " resurgent , " in any fundamental sense : the drastically falling birth rate is an indicator of steep decline , not revival .
But Putin is putting up a fight .
In answer to the U.S. government - funded effort to " export democracy " to the former Soviet republics of the Russian " near abroad , " Putin has cut off the foreign funding of Russian " NGOs . "
A good many of these " non-governmental organizations " are anything but  they get direct ( and , often , covert ) aid from Washington , either from the National Endowment for Democracy , or out of the CIA ’s " black propaganda " budget .
The Europeans , too , are putting their own cash in the till : they see Moscow ( rightly ) as a rival power center , Putin ’s Byzantium to the Holy Roman Empire of the EU .
In any case , foreign cash , and plenty of it , tipped the struggle over Ukraine in favor of the West ’s amen corner , the " Orange " revolutionaries , and birthed similar ( albeit much less successful ) fifth columns in Belarus and Central Asia .
The Russians are slowly being encircled , and in an effort to break out of it Putin ’s foreign policy has become more , shall we say , active : i.e. , more actively opposed to the American claim to global preeminence .
In the next week or so , Russia will take center stage as the latest target of Washington ’s hectoring abuse , and the media chorus has already started .
We read here that Russia is the scene of " rising xenophobia , " with the clear implication being that Putin is somehow responsible for a growing Russian nationalism that sometimes takes the form of racism and anti-Semitism , " a phenomenon particularly visible in St. Petersburg , where skinheads have attacked and killed several foreigners the past three years . "
Yet those very same skinheads are now accorded " dissident " status by the West : they are prominently featured at the " Different Russia " conference , which convened Tuesday in St. Petersburg , right before the G - 8 meeting .
The conference is meant to set the tone for the summit , and as a showcase for anti-Putin , and implicitly pro-Western figures , such as former economic adviser Andrei Illarionov , who faults the Russians for not moving swiftly enough in the direction of a free market , and other former Kremlin officials ( who criticize Putin for not restoring the old socialist system and for cutting back on social services ) .
The conference has been endorsed by all sorts of prominent Westerners and their Russian counterparts , and at least two State Department officials are slated to attend .
One wonders if they know , or care , that 20 of the listed participants  more than any other single group  are identified as members of the National Bolshevik Party ( NBP ) , an ultra-nationalist sect that valorizes Nazism , calls for a Eurasian empire stretching from the Rhine to the Bering Sea , and espouses a form of national socialism that puts a punkish - nihilistic gloss on the familiar German and Italian versions .
BNP members have engaged in provocative " demonstrations , " taking over buildings  including a church , which they threatened to destroy  harassing Russian officials , including Putin , and generally making a spectacle of themselves .
Their membership is drawn largely from the disaffected lumpen youth  one of the founding members is a member of a Russian punk band .
Their Lider Maximo , Eduard Limonov , styles himself the Yukio Mishima of Russian literature , although Mishima would never have allowed himself to become anyone ’s instrument , least of all a front man for a foreign power .
Limonov , whose abrasively anti-American sentiments come through loud and crude in his novels and other writings , is doing just that .
It is n’t the relatively small and isolated band of Russian " liberals " who are the cutting edge of the new Russian " dissident " movement .
As the BBC reports , the goody - two - shoes faction of the anti-government youth are trying to recreate the Orange Revolution , and model their group on the successful Serbian Otpor movement .
" But the organisation with strongest support among anti-government youth  the National Bolshevik Party  has radical and anarchist tendencies .
It combines references to both Nazi and the Communist ideology in its name and symbols .
And although its leaders are less blatantly extreme as they were some years ago , they could hardly be described as liberal or pro-Western . "
With their theatrical protests , Limonov and his party have become the most outspoken and visible opponents of the Putin presidency .
Their brand of " radicalism " goes beyond the traditional periphery of the organized fascist movement in Russia and appeals to the anti-globalist color - coordinated kiddies who think they ’re " anarchists " and are merely a mob longing for a leader , any leader , as long as he ’s brazenly nihilistic enough .
Limonov certainly fits the bill .
His endless novels of navel - gazing negativity and self - hypnotic narcissism are a favorite with the coffeehouse literary set , and his increasing megalomania has made him a cult figure among young people ready to fall for any poseur who comes along , provided his act is associated with some sort of extremism  any extremism , left , right , or both at once , it does n’t matter .
Ideas , to these people , do n’t matter  everything , for them , is an act , an opportunity to exalt and otherwise call attention to themselves .
In this context , it does n’t hurt Limonov that he and a couple of accomplices were arrested and imprisoned for buying weapons .
Their plan was to start an armed uprising in Kazakhstan , of all places 
Limonov spent two years in jail , and was let out after his literary friends made a fuss .
Now he ’s back , and his NBP is making headlines , and is deeply involved in the " Different Russia " conference  the title of which , come to think of it , sounds suspiciously similar to Limonov ’s manifesto of NPB doctrine 
The Other Russia .
This rambling screed is a weird mixture of nihilism , ultra-nationalism , and unintentional humor , in which the author lays out his vision of an authoritarian state , where the Leader rules all and the nation is trained , from birth , for combat :
" Boys and girls will be taught to shoot from grenade throwers , to jump from helicopters , to besiege villages and cities , to skin sheep and pigs , to cook good hot food and to write poetry .
There will be sportive competitions , fighting , a free combat without rules , running , jumping . "
This rambunctious race of hyperactive " new men " will be hard to keep constrained .
They will naturally want to extend their horizons and build a Eurasian Empire on which the sun never sets :
" We will have to leave Russia , to build a nest on the fresh central lands , to conquer them there and to give rise to a new , unseen civilization of free warriors united in an armed community .
Roaming the steppes and the mountains , fighting in southern nations .
" Many types of people will have to disappear .
Alcoholic uncles Vasias , cops , functionaries and other defective material will die out , having lost their roots in society .
The armed community could be called ‘ Government of Eurasia . ’
Thus the dreams of the Eurasians of the ’30s will be realized .
Many people will want to join us .
Possibly we will conquer the whole world .
People will die young but it will be fun . "
In other words , fun for Limonov and his band of demented nihilists , but miserable for the rest of us .
Oh , poor Limonov , beset by the inferiority of modern living , who complains even about the quality of bigotry in his country .
The old USSR kept the Russians closed off from the outside world , and had them living in the 19th century , he contends , retarding the country intellectually :
" So why should anyone be surprised that even our anti-Semitism is not modern , by its attributes it lives in the times of ‘ The Beilis affair ’ ( matza , blood of Christian newborns and other Middle Ageisms , when an anti-Semite in the West refutes the existence of gas chambers and the extermination of six million Jews ) , that our ‘ fascism ’ copies the Hitlerism of the ’ 20s , that our ‘ democrats ’ finally are as insolent as the American liberals before the crisis of 1929 and our rich are insolent and arrogant as the American rich before the world shock therapy of 1917 . "
Whatever innovative forms of anti-Semitism have come out of the NBP fever swamp have yet to show themselves : so far , at least , we just have the all - too - familiar hooliganism of cowardly haters , such as when eight NBP members " stormed the Ulyanovsk Jewish Center screaming , ‘ do n’t pollute our land , ’ smashing windows , and tearing down Jewish symbols as Jewish women and children hid inside .
No one was injured , but police failed to respond quickly , arriving 40 minutes after they were called .
A member of the extremist National Bolshevik Party later was arrested in connection with the attack . "
While such " respectable " figures as Gary Kasparov , Russian chess champion , and former Russian officials serve as front men  and notables Stuart Eisenstadt and Carl Gershman lend an American imprimatur to the proceedings  the NBP lurks behind the scenes and gets a platform for its odious views .
And you can bet your bottom dollar that much if not all of this is being paid for by the American taxpayers  for " democracy promotion " in Russia !
If even so much as one penny is coming out of the U.S.
Treasury to finance these proceedings , one has to ask :
Why on earth are we building up a sinister cult like the NBP ?
One imagines that people said the same thing about the Afghan " resistance " during the 1980s  and nobody listened then , did they ?
However , one would think that Richard Holbrooke , Dick Morris , and Anthony Russell Brenton , Britain ’s ambassador to the Russian Federation  all of whom are listed as sponsoring attendees  would know better than to get mixed up with a bunch of neo -Nazi thugs .
" A Different Russia , " indeed  very different , from a look at some of the other members and participants of this strange conference .
There is Viktor Anpilov , leader of Working Russia , who lionizes Joseph Stalin , wants to restore the " authentic " communism practiced in the gulag , and characterizes the former regime of Boris Yeltsin as a " Jewish conspiracy . "
Another luminary in attendance will be Sergey Glazyev , formerly of the Motherland Bloc ( Rodina ) party , who has been the instrumental figure in forging a left - wing - " patriotic " ( i.e. , anti-Semitic ultra- nationalist ) coalition .
As a principal leader of this " red- brown " coalition , Glazyev , a former adviser to Putin , attacked " ’ certain forces ‘ that are appropriating natural rent and ‘ spending billions of dollars in order to have a lobby in the State Duma . ’ "
In 2005 , Glazyev addressed a congress of anti-Semitic and far - right groups gathered to re-found the infamous Black Hundred of Czarist days .
Glazyev will doubtless feel comfortable in the company of fellow conference - goer and speaker Victor Iliukhin , who , in late 1998 , declared in the State Duma that a " genocide " of the Russian people had occurred in the 1990s , and that this crime was engineered by the numerous Jews who served under Yeltsin .
Vasiliy Yakemenko , a political consultant allied with the pro-Putin Nashi youth movement , is right when he characterizes these guys as those who have " gathered under Hitler ’s banners of national - socialism . "
" We will put an end to the unnatural union of oligarchs and anti-Semites , liberals and Nazis , " he vows , and one can only hope so .
But he ’s wrong about it being an " unnatural union . "
It is perfectly natural for these political bandits to band together in a union of the bought - and - paid - for , for all of them are willing to sell their talents , such as they are , and their souls ( such as they are ) to the highest bidder .
And who could outbid the U.S. government ?
UPDATE : I note that the issue of U.S. government funding and the National Bolsheviks has already come up .
The Washington Post reports :
“ The conference was partly underwritten by the National Endowment for Democracy , a private , federally funded organization that promotes democracy world - wide .
‘ Our main hope is that it will help promote Russian civil society , ’ said Carl Gershman , the endowment ’s president .
Asked about the controversial presence of National Bolsheviks leader Eduard Limonov , Gershman said , ‘ The overwhelming majority of people here are people with long - standing democratic credentials and if they can be here , that ’s the best guideline I can follow . ' ”
The guidelines followed by Gershman and the NED have nothing to do with “ democratic credentials , ” and everything to do with who can be manipulated to serve the purposes of U.S. foreign policy .
Limonov and the National Bolsheviks join a long list of similar sock puppets , including Ahmed Chalabi ’s Iraqi National Congress and the Nicaraguan contras , who enlisted as servants of the Empire .
If Google ’s acquisition of Writely has any of you Web 2.0 folk jumping up and down thinking the heavens are about to open up and rain gold , then sit down , put away your umbrella and take another Squash reality check .
Over the past week , I ’ve read any number of blogs congratulating the Writely folk for selling out .
But every indicator points to the fact that this was a dirt cheap deal and perhaps even a salvage mission .
Firstly , has it struck no - one as surprising that there has been almost no speculation as to how much Google paid for Writely ?
That ’s the first indicator that this was a teeny - weeny deal .
When people sell - out in a big - money acquisitions , they usually can’t help but tell that trusted someone , who tells another trusted someone , who passes the word onto another trusted someone and so on until a pretty reasonable picture emerges as to roughly what was paid .
The fact that no - one ’s bragging on this one , suggests that , well , there ai n’t much to brag about .
More telling though is that I ’ve been chatting to a company who is a significant player in this whole web - office space and they swears blind they ’ve not even had a nibble from Google .
Not a single call , e-mail or overture .
Nada .
If this was a strategic acquisition from Google they would have scouted the playing field and this company would have been a part of that .
So based on this information , Google ai n’t out there looking .
First thing to take out of that fact is you should n’t expect a GoogleOffice any time soon .
If Google is doing an office , they ’re doing it in - house and that ’s going to take some time .
However , more so , this indicates that GoogleOffice is n’t a priority for the big G. Sure , the Writely buyout is an admission that they ’ve got something going on in this space , but as I ’ve speculated before I think it ’s very much tied to the GDrive / Lighthouse projects and I do n’t think anyone is expecting those to be rushed out to market anytime soon .
Salvage ?
The second assumption you might draw from the fact that Google are n’t casting a net around is that it ’s far more likely that the Writely crew approached Google , than the other way round .
I think there ’s ample secondary evidence to corroborate this theory , too .
Google wrote on their blog that Writely had “ many thousands of users ” .
Not tens of thousands of users .
Not hundreds of thousands of users .
But thousands .
Anyone who knows marketers know that if there are 10,001 users you start talking about tens of thousands .
So lets be kind and assume Writely had 9,999 beta users .
Other people in this market have told me that ’s likely being generous .
The Writely business model appeared to be trying to tempt a portion of its users to pay a “ reasonable subscription fee ” for advanced features .
“ Our hope is to always have the basic service be free , with some extra features requiring a reasonable subscription fee . ”
There was n’t too much holding Writely in beta .
According to its Beta Meter , 60 per cent of users felt it was time for Writely to rip off the beta label .
Now it ’s all well and good to pretend that there ’s a big , whopping market out there when you ’re in beta but when you take a service like this live , you need to start walking the talk .
So let ’s run some numbers .
Let ’s assume that Writely did a really , really good job of converting users to paid subscriptions and they managed to get 10 per cent of users to cough up some coin , which would be an impressive feat when you consider there are free alternatives out there in the market and there ’s not a heap of value - add you can add over and above the primary product .
Anyway , that gives us about 1,000 paying users .
How much is a “ reasonable subscription feed ” .
If you look at paid services like Trumba or BackPack we ’re probably talking about $ 50 per year .
So best case , we ’re looking at revenues around the $ 50,000 per year mark .
We ’re not even close to covering the four Writely salaries at those levels .
So if Writely was going to go it alone , it needed to raise VC dollars fast to fund a marketing campaign .
You tell me any VC , even one who ’s drunk a REAL lot of Kool Aid , who ’s going to look at those numbers and see a great investment opportunity .
Best case option then for the Writely folk was to approach a company that they wanted to work for and hope for a HR - driven buyout .
That looks to be exactly what has happened .
All this , and we should remember that as far as Web 2.0 consumer plays , Writely looked pretty good .
The product was almost perfectly executed ; it was good for generating a lot of natural buzz , such is the fascination with a possible MS Office killer ; and it was an easy to use , easy to understand product that should have been relatively well - place to break through the wall of Web 2.0 freakazoid early adopters .
Yet , in the end , it almost certainly sold for peanuts .
So go on and tell me again , how revenues models do n’t matter in the Web 2.0 economy .
Go on , please , it just gets funnier every time I hear it .
HTML and CSS , two of our favorite acronyms , are normally associated with web pages .
And deservedly so : HTML is the dominant document format on the web and CSS is used to style most HTML pages .
But , are they suitable for off - screen use ?
Can CSS be used for serious print jobs ?
To find out , we decided to take the ultimate challenge : to produce the next edition of our book directly from HTML and CSS files .
In this article we sketch our solution and quote from the style sheet used .
Towards the end we describe the book microformat ( boom ! ) we developed in the process .
Article Continues Below
The studious reader may want to fetch a sample HTML file , sample style sheet , as well as the PDF file generated by Prince .
The PDF file is similar to the one we sent to the printer .
We encourage you to base your own book on the sample file and tell us how it goes .
Print vs. pixel#section2
A printed book has many features not seen on screens .
There are page numbers , headers and footers , a table of contents , and an index .
The content must be split into pages of fixed size , and cross-references within the book ( for example , “ see definition on page 35 ” ) must be resolved .
Finally , the content must be converted to PDF , which is sent to the printer .
Web browsers are good at dealing with pixels on a screen , but not very good at printing .
To print a full book we turned to Prince , a dedicated batch processor which converts XML to PDF by way of CSS .
Prince supports the print - specific features of CSS2 , as well as functionality proposed for CSS3 .
CSS2 has a notion of paged media ( think sheets of paper ) , as opposed to continuous media ( think scrollbars ) .
Style sheets can set the size of pages and their margins .
Page templates can be given names and elements can state which named page they want to be printed on .
Also , elements in the source document can force page breaks .
Here is a snippet from the style sheet we used :
@page { size : 7in 9.25 in ; margin : 27 mm 16 mm 27 mm 16 mm ; }
Having a US - based publisher , we were given the page size in inches .
We , being Europeans , continued with metric measurements .
CSS accepts both .
After setting the up the page size and margin , we needed to make sure there are page breaks in the right places .
The following excerpt shows how page breaks are generated after chapters and appendices :
div.chapter , div.appendix { page - break - after : always ; }
Also , we used CSS2 to declare named pages :
div.titlepage { page : blank ; }
That is , the title page is to be printed on pages with the name “ blank . ” CSS2 described the concept of named pages , but their value only becomes apparent when headers and footers are available .
For this we have to turn to CSS3 .
The CSS Working Group has published a CSS3 Module for Paged Media .
It describes additional functionality required for printing .
We will start by looking at running headers and footers .

Here is an example :
@page : left { @top - left { content : " Cascading Style Sheets " ; } }
The example above puts a string ( “ Cascading Style Sheets ” ) in the top left corner of all left - hand side pages of the book .
All pages ?
Not quite .
A subsequent rule removes the header from pages named “ blank ” :
@page blank : left { @top - left { content : normal ; } }
Recall from earlier that all < div class= “ titlepage ” ></div > elements are to be printed on “ blank ” pages .
Given the style sheet above , “ blank ” left - hand side pages will be printed without a header .
Stealing strings #section6
Our book consists of many chapters and the title of each chapter is displayed in a header on right - hand side pages .
To achieve this , the title string must be copied from an element with the string - set property :
h1 { string - set : header content ( ) ; }
Just like there were named pages in the previous section , CSS3 also has named strings .
In the example above , the string named “ header ” is assigned the chapter headings .
Each time a chapter heading is encountered , the chapter title is copied into this string .
The string can be referred to in other parts of the style sheet :
@page : right { @top - right { content : string ( header , first ) ; } }
In the example above , the right - hand side header is set to be the value of the “ header ” string .
The keyword “ first ” indcates that we want the first value of “ header ” in case there are several assignments on that page .
Page numbers #section7
Like headers , page numbers are a navigational aid in books .
Setting the page numbers is easy :
@page : left { @bottom - left { content : counter ( page ) ; } }
One requirement from our publisher was to use roman numerals in the first part of the book .
This part is referred to as “ front - matter ” .
Here is the style sheet for roman page numbers in the front - matter :
@page front - matter : left { @bottom - left { content : counter ( page , lower - roman ) ; } }
The numbering systems are the same as for the list - style - type property and lower - roman is one of them .
The counter called “ page ” is predefined in CSS .
The web is a huge collection of cross-references : all hyperlinks are cross-references .
Cross -references in books are similar in nature , but presented differently .
Instead of the blue underlined text we know from our screens , books contain text such as “ see the figure on page 35 . ”
The number “ 35 ” is unknown to the authors of the book — one can only find the page number by formatting the content .
Therefore , the number “ 35 ” cannot be typed into the manuscript but must be inserted by the formatter .
To do so , the formatter needs a pointer to the figure .
In HTML , this is done with an A element :
< a class= " pageref " href= " # figure " gt ; see the figure </ a>
The corresponding style sheet looks like this :
a.pageref : : after { content : " on page " target - counter ( attr ( href ) , page ) }
The example above needs some explanation .
The selector refers to a generated pseudo - element ( :: after ) which comes after the content of the A element .
The first part of that pseudo - element is the string ” on page ” .
After that comes the most interesting part , the target - counter function which fetches the value of the “ page ” counter at the location pointed to by the “ href ” attribute .
The result is a that the string ” on page ” is concatenated with the number “ 35 ” .
Table of contents #section9
Similar magic is invoked to generate a table of contents ( TOC ) .
Given a bunch of hyperlinks pointing to chapters , sections and other TOC entries , the style sheet describes how to present the hyperlinks as TOC .
Here is a sample TOC entry :
< ul class = " toc " > < li >< a href= " #intro " > Introduction </a></li> < li >< a href= " #html " >< abbr title= " HyperText Markup Language " >HTML</ abbr ></a></li> </ul >
The style sheet for the TOC uses the same target - counter to fetch a page number :
ul.toc a:: after { content : leader ( '.') target - counter ( attr ( href ) , page ) ; }
Also , a new function , leader , is used to generate “ leaders . ”
In typography , a “ leader ” is a line that guides the eye from the textual entry to the page number .
In our example , a set of dots is added between the text and the page number :
Introduction ….................1 HTML ….........................3
Note that the this functionality is experimental ; no Working Draft for leaders has been published yet .
The book microformat — boom!#section10
As you probably have guessed by now , we succeeded in producing our book using HTML and CSS .
In doing so , we also developed a set of conventions for marking up a book in HTML .
HTML has the wonderful class attribute which lets anyone extend the semantics of HTML documents while building on HTML ’s universally known semantics .
So , in our book , we used a rich set of HTML elements and added a bunch of class names .
Since then , the concept of “ microformats ” has entered the web and we are happy to discover that we actually developed ( at least the beginnings of ) a microformat for books .
We think other authors will be able use the boom !
microformat and improve upon it in the process .
Sections of a book # section11
The chapters in the first part of the book , such as preface , foreword , and table of contents , are enclosed in a DIV with a corresponding class name .
The chapters in the main body are DIV s with a class of “ chapter ” and the appendices are DIV s with class “ appendix . ”
In the style sheet , the class names are primarily used to select the correct named page with the correct headers and footers .
Although HTML has six levels of headings ( H1 , H2 , etc. ) to distinguish chapter headings , section headings , and subsection heading , it is convenient to enclose sections in an element , if only to be able to style the end of a section .
We used a DIV with class “ section ” .
Tables and figures # section12
HTML does n’t have a dedicated element for figures with captions , but it is easy to create one by specializing a DIV :
< div class = " figure " > < p class= " caption " >...</ p> < p class = " art " >< img src= " ... " alt= " ... " /></p> </div >
The TABLE element has a CAPTION element , but support is spotty .
We , therefore , used a similar strategy for marking up tables :
< div class = " table " > < p class= " caption " >...</ p> < table class =" lined " > ... </ table > </div >
We used a variety of figure styles ( normal , wide , on the side , etc. ) and table styles ( normal , wide , lined , top - floating , etc. ) in our book .
An element can be given several class names , so that , say , a table can be both “ lined ” and “ wide . ”
We have cut down on the number of alternatives in the sample document for the sake of simplicity .
Side notes and side bars# section13
A DIV with class “ sidenote ” is used for side remarks , related to the ( following ) text in the main body but not necessarily shown in - line .
A typical way to show them is to put them in the margin .
A “ sidebar ” is longer than a “ sidenote . ”
The latter is typically only one paragraph , maybe two ; the former is several paragraphs or includes lists or other material .
In the sample document there is one sidebar that floats to the top , uses the full width of the page , and is given a gray background .
Summing up #section14
The Prince formatter has opened up the processing pipeline from HTML and CSS to PDF .
It is now possible , even feasible , to use HTML as the document format for books .
This makes it easier to cross-publish content on the web and in print .
That said , authors who attempt to use the techniques described in this article will face some technical issues along the way .
For example , we have not discussed how to generate the TOC structures and how to display wide tables .
We have also left some room for improvement in the boom !
microformat .
However , compared to the headaches of actually writing a book , formatting is now a joy !
When it comes to plants , there are often many doubts about how to choose the right ones .
Those that we not only like for their aspect or their flowering but also , and according to our hand with the gardening , they facilitate us their cultivation with 100 watt led grow light .
Because let ’s not fool ourselves : to successfully choose the plants that go with us , we will have to take into account different factors .
Some , far from being minor , contain a key : the difference between enjoying our plants and their maintenance or proper cultivation takes away our sleep ( either because we do not see it prosper or because , putting us in the worst , we see it die slowly and this makes us desist from all those wonderful reasons for having plants at home that we discussed in this other post ) .
So , to avoid that disgust felt when a plant is spoiled , today we want to raise five tips to choose your plants .
Five questions that we will have to ask ourselves whenever we want to incorporate a new vegetal member to our home .
HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT PLANTS
Although we often take hold of a particular plant or flower , it is important to be realistic before taking it home .
And when we say this , we mean to consider the choice of our plants in reverse : starting by asking ourselves these five questions before venturing into their cultivation .
How much time do I have to take care of my plants ?
Although it may seem incidental , the truth is that time is a decisive factor in choosing the right plants for us .
If you are away from home or away from home on a regular basis , it is best to choose plants that require little watering or that have lower growing requirements ( by this we mean , for example , those that need a constant temperature that you may not be able to give them if you are not at home to monitor it ) .
This is also vital when it comes to choosing what the plants themselves should be : seeds , seedlings ( when we are talking about garden crops ) , bulb plants or , better still , plants that have already been grown ?
If we have little time , there is nothing like choosing the already cultivated plants and the bulb plants ( which will demand less attention than seeds or seedlings ) .
How much light do we have for our plants ?
The orientation in which we will place our plants is fundamental when choosing the type of plants or flowers .
Each plant species has its own requirements in this respect , ( whether they are in direct sun , semi- shade or shade ) so it will be vital for them that we faithfully respect this need when choosing a plant for one place or another .
What will be the location of the plants ?
As in the previous case , it is better not to experiment with indoor plants outdoors and vice versa .
Unfortunately , due mainly to temperature and wind exposure , plants have a very specific location .
For that reason , it is necessary to consult very well which is the ideal habitat of each one of them and to differentiate which plants we will be able to enjoy inside house , in the terrace or balcony , or , even , in the garden .
What are the needs of each plant ?
Far from being something that we look at once we have the plant at home , it is essential that we pay attention to the specifications that we will find in each pot and , furthermore , that we ask to know more about what its cultivation involves .
An ideal way to know , beyond those basic indications of the pot ( sun , temperature or watering ) , what are those other cares it will demand : whether it needs a transplant or not , what is the dimension it can reach , if it is necessary to fertilize it regularly , if it will demand a pruning at a certain time of the year , etc .
To complete what we can find in the pot , there is nothing like asking our Flower and Plant colleagues .
Professionals who will help you know if that pot you have fallen in love with is the ideal one for you .
Which plants are easier to grow ?
At this point , there is no universal maxim and nothing like letting professionals advise us on choosing the most suitable plants for our level of gardening knowledge .
And , curiously enough , we will discover that even if plants are not our forte , we can find plant species to suit us ( if you have indoor plants in mind , be sure to take a look at this post on five tough proposals ) .

imenu is a very handy command i learnt not long ago .
Just type M-x imenu in a source code buffer ( an Elisp one , for instance ) and start typing the name of a variable or function ( or simply TAB for name completion ) .
There you go : instant access to definitions in the buffer .
You can also get the list of completions in a menu item calling imenu - add - menubar - index .
Or , if you want the menu to be automatically created for , say , all your C files , you can put something like
( add - hook ' c - mode - hook ' imenu-add- menubar - index )
in your initialisation files .
You can read more about imenu ( which has obsoleted speedbar in my workflow ) in the Emacs Wiki , including how to adapt it to your favorite language ( if it ’s not yet supported ) .
Oh , and the workaround : if you ’re using Emacs 22 on Mac OS X , you may need to add this dummy definition to your .emacs to make imenu work :
( defun imenu - progress - message ( a &optional c d ) )
( otherwise , you ’ll get an error about imenu - progress - message being an invalid function ) .

Mount Hitler on Google Maps
German Spiegel writes ( my translation ) :
If you use the internet mapping program Google Earth to take a virtual fly - over at the foothills of the Alps region , you ’ll hit on a strange name south of Bad Tölz .
“ Mount Hitler ” is the geographic label assigned to the 1,205 meters elevation that goes by the name of “ Hegelkopf . ” Georg Kellner , mayor of the local community Wackersberg , is outraged : “ I ’m 64 years old now but I have n’t heard the name ’ Mount Hitler ’ in all my life .
What ’s with this stupidity ? ”
Google Germany spokesperson Stefan Keuchel has a straightforward answer to this question : “ In the past , that ’s what the mountain was called , plain and simple . ”
It turns out the structure was renamed “ Mount Hitler ” ( Hitler - Berg ) by Nazi - followers for the period of 1933 - 1945 , and that the old data keeps popping up in various data sources used for Google Earth .
Stefan promised to get rid of Mount Hitler “ once and for all ” during the next update .

Update :
To always have the latest airfare strategies at your fingertips , bookmark this guide to cheap flights : Tips to Find Cheap Airfare .
Over the last year or two I ’ve done my fair share of flying and have refined my methodology of making sure that I always get the cheapest airfare available .
I wish I could tell you “ use this one service , ” but in reality it does n’t work that way .
Since there are so many variables at play , you have to run searches at a number of sites .
So how do you get the best airfare ?
There are basically three types of airfare websites : 1 . Aggregators ( ex : Kayak ) that check airfares for many different airlines .
They do not charge a fee but instead rely on affiliate hotel deals and on - site advertising like Adsense to make their money .
These are historically the best bets .
2 . Traditional booking engines ( ex : Orbitz ) that check multiple websites and take a small fee ~ $6 in addition to the price of the flight .
They process the sale on behalf of the airline and keep the fee .
3 . Airline ’s own websites ( ex : JetBlue ) .
If you find a flight on booking engines , check the airline ’s own site so see if you can get it for the same price minus the booking fee .
The important subset of this are airlines who do not play nice and do not offer their fares up to aggregators ( ex : Southwest ) .
You have to check their sites individually .
In my experience there is no ONE website that you can use to get the lowest airfare every single time .
It fluctuates quite a bit because there a LOT of variables involved .
Do n’t ask me why – it ’s just how it is .
My recommendation to get lowest airfare :
You can also dig deeper using the quick list on the right .
Try different days if you can ( one day before / after ) , nearby airports ( usually there ’s a checkbox for that ) , and also check out building the flight with one - ways instead of round trip .
This works especially if you have a 3 - way flight or find that Southwest has a great 1 - way price , but not roundtrip – then you can just use the other engines to get a cheap 1 - way flight back .
If you feel really ambitious , check the airline ’s own websites – list on the right ( sometimes they ’ll have unpublished deals ) .
When you find the cheapest flight that suits your needs , go ahead and book it .
One of the things you ’ll eventually run into is “ oops , that $ 280 flight is now $ 320 ?
messages .
It will annoy the hell out of you .
But that ’s just how it is .
You might want to check the other aggregators – sometimes you can catch what you just missed on and one and find it on the other .
Since travel is a big industry , there are a lot of shady websites / clubs / etc. that try to get your email address or try to get you subscribed to some service .
I ’ve never found those very useful for actually finding cheap flighs .
The only exception is TravelZoo .
I ’ve signed up for their weekly Top 20 Travel deals email and I can say I ’ve seen some impressive deals there .
Note :
The above is mostly for US flights .
If you ’re looking for International , check out vayama.com , skyscanner.net , momondo.com , and trabber.com ( non US ) .
I have n’t tried them myself but I hear they ’re good .
Feel free to share your flight booking strategies in the comments or give some travel tips of your own .
Palestinians celebrated and scavenged in the rubble
Enlarge Image
Tanks and armoured vehicles left under cover of darkness and the last officer shut the Kissufim border at dawn .
Thousands of jubilant Palestinians entered the former Jewish enclaves , and some set an abandoned synagogue ablaze in a settlement near Khan Younis .
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas described the withdrawal as an historic and joyful day for his people .
But he told the BBC that some issues remained to be resolved .
Mr Abbas said factors include Israel 's insistence on determining who can enter or leave Gaza , and its control of Gaza 's airspace and the waters off its coast .
' Happiest day '
Israel declared a formal end to military rule on Sunday before its remaining 3,000 troops left .
Departing troops held a flag raising ceremony outside the strip
Israel had already removed its settlers from Gaza , bulldozed their homes and demolished its military bases .
The government did not to raze the Strip 's more than 20 deconsecrated synagogues after rabbis said it was forbidden to do so .
Palestinian officials had urged Israel to pull them down , given their concerns that they could not protect the buildings from desecration .
Today is the happiest day in my life
Jawad Abu Lafi
Gaza withdrawal : Your views
As the Israelis pulled out , fireworks exploded over Neve Dekalim , one of the largest settlements .
Palestinian forces in red berets planted their flag inside the former enclave .
Plans to bar crowds of civilians and armed militants from the settlements quickly disintegrated , and people poured in and attacked the hated symbols of occupation .
Hours after the initial euphoria , hundreds remained .
Groups of gunmen have been exploring Israel 's now - disused military watchtowers .
" Today is the happiest day in my life , " Jawad Abu Lafi told Reuters , after praying at the former settlement of Ganei Tal .
Controls remain
Sun sets on Israeli tank in the final hours of the occupation
In pictures
The Israelis smashed most things before they left , he says , but Palestinians have been scavenging through the rubble - retrieving wood , metal and broken pipes .
Israel will retain control over the territory 's air and sea space and , at least temporarily , all its borders .
The Israelis say they have to prevent militant groups smuggling in weapons but the Palestinians say that as long as Israel controls all Gaza 's links with the outside world , the occupation will continue .
The Palestinian Authority says it will continue to insist on total freedom of movement between Gaza and Egypt - otherwise , they add , the Israeli occupation of Gaza will not have really ended .
Microraptor was a small , feathered dinosaur
A fresh analysis of an early feathered fossil dinosaur suggests that it dropped its hind legs below its body , adopting a bi-plane - like form .
This contrasts with earlier reconstructions showing the dinosaur maintaining its wings in a tandem pattern , a bit like a dragonfly .
Details appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal .
The ancestors of modern birds are thought to have been small , feathered , dinosaurs .
Microraptor gui , which lived 125 million years ago , was one of the earliest gliders .
It appears to have utilised four wings , as it had long and asymmetric flight feathers on both its hands and feet .
Spread 'em
An initial assessment of Microraptor fossils from China suggested the animal spread its legs out laterally and maintained its wings in a tandem pattern , in a similar manner to dragonflies .
Now , researchers Sankar Chatterjee and R Jack Templin offer an alternative hypothesis .
The evolution of bird flight may mirror aviation history
Instead , the scientists report that its hind legs were positioned below the body , in a bi-plane fashion .
Dr Chatterjee , from Texas Tech University in Lubbock , US , explained that two lines of evidence had led the team to this conclusion .
Firstly , the researchers argue , dinosaurs and birds move their legs in a vertical plane , not sideways as the tandem flight pattern requires .
Secondly , the feathers on Microraptor 's hind legs are asymmetrical ; one of the two vanes that extend either side of the shaft is narrower than the other .
Forward facing
Aerodynamically , the narrow leading edge of these feathers should face forward in flight , against the direction of airflow .
This would have given the flying reptiles lift .
In the tandem pattern , these would have faced sideways .
" We had no other choice but to go for the bi-plane configuration , " Dr Chatterjee told BBC News .
The similarities may reflect a common solution to the same problem ( Image : Jeff Martz )
The research might also shed light on a contentious debate over the evolution of bird flight .
Some researchers argue that this evolutionary development occurred from the ground up .
Others contend that small , feathered dinosaurs were already living in treetops and developed flight in order to get from one tree to another .
This " trees down " model is the one favoured by Chatterjee and Templin .
Alternatively , the bi-plane - like phase could just represent a failed evolutionary experiment .
The Wright stuff
If one accepted the evolutionary importance of the bi-plane formation , there were striking parallels between bird flight and the development of aircraft , said Dr Chatterjee .
Archaeopteryx , regarded as the earliest fossil bird , has what could be described as a monoplane design .
The shift from a bi-plane to a monoplane design could have been facilitated by a much broader wingspan which would have provided increased lift .
This mirrors historical developments in aviation .
" We see that the Wright brothers came up with a design for which there was no precedent in nature at the time , " said Dr Chatterjee .
" This shows us that if there is a problem in engineering , sometimes there are only one or two possible solutions . "
Apple ’s download store iTunes was hit hard in the groin today , as Norway declares it illegal .
Free competition is the background to this , and since Apple wo n’t open up iTunes to other MP3 players , Norway ’s consumer officer ruled it illegal .
Remove it , or go to court .
Ouch .
This means that Norway is the first country in the Nordic region to actually take steps against iTunes .
Sweden and Finland have declared the same stance in the matter , but has yet to act .
Germany and France are also backing this , and them being a lot more lucrative markets than the small population of the Nordic region , this might actually mean that there will be some sort of impact on iTunes , other than it possibly being made unavailable in some countries .
Financial Times has more .
Now could someone please kill all DRM and give us open formats that we can play any way we please ?

The soldiers in Iraq have little choice in the matter if they are sacrificing their lives in a war that is doomed to failure .
I 'm sure if those National Guardsmen who 've served three or four tours of duty in Iraq were given the choice , they would n't re-enlist for yet another tour of duty .
Those soldiers are pawns of George W. Bush who knows if he institutes a military draft the war in Iraq would be over tomorrow .
American troops in Iraq still have no idea of what constitutes a victory in Iraq or even who the enemy is .
It is a waste of life to dispatch soldiers to a foreign nation to fight a war without an objective or plan for victory .
Those troops that die in a Iraq are n't responsible for no -win policy of the Bush administration in Iraq , but like it or not , George W. Bush is wasting their lives because he dispatched them to Iraq without grounds for declaring a war and once those soldiers invaded Iraq George W. Bush had no plan to win the war .
We are entering year five of the Iraq occupation and American troops have no clearly stated mission or even a designated enemy .
American troops are fighting Shiite leaders like Mokada al Sadr who are part of the elected government in Iraq , and fighting Sunnis who are insurgents against that same elected government .
We are also fighting al Qaeda forces , which have entered the conflict largely because the United States started the conflict .
Nobody is really sure where the Kurdish loyalties lie except they want to be left alone and will fight anyone who does n't leave them alone , including the United States .
The Kurds are the Greta Garbo of the Iraq War , who " just want to be left alone . "
The role of the United States appears to be that of a referee in the center of a circular firing squad consisting of the various sects and factions in Iraq .
George Bush 's sole " accomplishment " in Iraq is deposing an ineffectual tyrant and replacing his regime with a bomb throwing state of anarchy that threatens to destabilize the entire Arabian Gulf Peninsula .
If you think that Bush 's policy is crazy , just wait until the surge is implemented and craziness evolves into full tilt insanity .
It could get worse .
If American troops stick around long enough in Iraq , all of the various ethnic groups and sects will come to the conclusion that the infidel , George W. Bush is responsible for the state of chaos in their nation and then loss of American troops will really begin .
There are more than a few Iraq observers that believe the only thing that will unite all of the disparate and dissimilar sects and factions in Iraq is a united front against the occupation of Iraq by American troops .
That would be our worst possible nightmare , but the surge tactic by the Bush administration has made American helicopters and soldiers a high value target for both Sunni and Shiite militants .
There is a perfectly good argument for a phased withdrawal from Iraq .
The alternative is for American troops to assume the role of enforcer which will earn the undying hatred of all the factions in Iraq and would probably result in as forcible eviction of American troops from Iraq .
Let 's face it ; the Shiite majority in Baghdad will tolerate American troops in Iraq , as long as the troops are useful to their objective of annihilating the Sunni minority .
Bush is in the position of drinking the poison of the ruling Shiite majority and supporting a client government of Iran which is a far greater threat to American security than Saddam ever was .
If Bush refuses to drink the poison the only alternative is to use military force to depose the pro-Iranian Shiite government and replacing it with what ?
Nobody knows !
As it currently stands George W. Bush is simply winging it without any plan and at the mercy of the daily briefing reports from the Iran front for evidence of divine intervention that will prove him right .
God the father may have led Bush into the Iraq but God the son wo n't lead him out .
It 's pretty obvious that as long as American troops are occupying Iraq there will nothing resembling a functioning democracy or even a functioning government in Iraq .
It 's impossible to establish an independent democratic republic in Iraq as long American troops are solely responsible for averting a blood bath in Iraq .
We could have saved a lot of time , energy , money and human lives if George W. Bush had been schooled on the history of empire building and use neo-colonialism as an instrument of foreign policy .
Western nations have had a long history of failure when they 've used military force to occupy underdeveloped nations to impose the stated Western ideals of freedom and democracy on less prosperous third world nations .
Saddam was a tyrant but at least he was Iraq 's favorite son tyrant who was n't a prop of a Western nation .
As George W. Bush 's own father , when asked why he did n't depose Saddam in the first Gulf War , he replied , " Depose Saddam and replace him with who ? "
Herbert Walker was commenting on the fact that any possible candidate to replace Saddam would have even more of a destabilizing effect on the Arabian Gulf region , than Saddam himself .
Herbert Walker 's service in the CIA gave him a more nuanced view of geopolitics than his son's simplistic Axis of Evil paradigm of global politics .
It 's a paradox , but Saddam 's own monumental ego and hatred of the Iranian Shiite theocracy prevented the expansion of the Islamic revolution to other nations in the Gulf region .
Look at the mess George W. Bush created by tinkering with the delicate gears that maintained complex system of nations , leaders , religions and cultures that maintain equilibrium and homeostasis in the Gulf region .
All of this musing on my part must seem I 'm reflecting on the obvious to many people .
In some ways we need to cut down the thicket of disinformation that has conceals the true nature of reality in the Gulf region and then propose something audacious enough to stop the sectarian bloodletting .
It should be a simple , enforceable and understandable ultimatum to the government of Iraq and every nation in the region .
Here 's my plan .
Announce tomorrow that we are pulling 50,000 American troops from Iraq immediately and will continue to withdrawal American forces from Iraq in large increments that will take place over the six months and invite all interested nations in the Gulf region to convene talks in Baghdad with the objectives of
1. Sustaining a ceasefire between all of the sectarian groups in Iraq ,
2. Negotiating a settlement to establish a permanent peace in Iraq
3 . Broker a form of government which is acceptable to the Shiites , the Sunnis , the Kurds and any other citizens of Iraq even if the only acceptable plan to all parties is the partitioning off of Iraq into three sovereign nation states .
4. Develop a plan for national reconciliation where all parties in war crimes , all detainees and all prisoners of war will be returned to their nation of origin .
5. Establish a national war crimes tribunal and give any self confessed war criminals the opportunity to ask forgiveness for their misdeeds in exchange for a complete judicial pardon for any crimes committed during the course of the Iraq conflict .
It follows the same model of the tribunal in South African nation following the end of apartheid .
George Bush , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld will be invited to seek pardons for any war crimes they authorized or committed during the Iraq War .
After we have set that process into motion George W. Bush makes a public apology to the citizens of Iraq for his complete lack of judgment and we turn over any appropriations in the United State 's FY 2007 - 2008 budget for the Iraq War , over to the Iraq government to set the peace process into motion and as down payment for all of the damage done to the infrastructure of Iraq during the war .
We declare the War on Terror is over .
Then we forgive ourselves for trusting president Bush and resolve to never elect another self serving demagogue to the presidency again .

Hilarious Tale of Woeful , Warlike Computing .
Who Deleted My Battleship ?
Was it you ?
This is what happens when you use Windows NT to run a battleship !
( Based on a true story : See footnote )
This is a cautionary tale for those of you who ’ve never been in the British Navy .
We have an incredibly proud tradition of warlike seamanship , much of which is traced back to the heroics of Admiral Nelson , at the Battle of Trafalgar , in 1805 .
But , I must not digress ; that ’s another story .
So you wo n’t be surprised to learn that , as a sea-captain , which as I ’m sure you know , is a responsible office , in Her Majesty ’s Navy , I , and several of my fellow seamen , was asked to travel to the United States of America to witness the transformation of one of their pre-eminent battleships , The USS Yorktown , into a fully digitalised warrior - of - waves .
So far , so good .
Lucky chap , I hear you say .
And , thus far , I find myself agreeing with you .
Our trans -Atlantic flights were pleasant enough .
Perhaps I should point out that we ’re not as lucky as some of our erstwhile friends in Politics , who habitually co-opt Her Majesty The Queen ’s Flight for such appointments .
I ’m afraid that I , and my fellow adventurers had to make do with passages as steerage aboard a US transport plane , leaving on a routine logistics mission from RAF Mildenhall .
Our transfer to The Yorktown herself was uneventful enough , and I sha n’t bore you with the details .
Suffice it to say that by noon , on the day after our airlift , I , and eleven other British Naval officers , was stowing my mess - kit in a pristine set of steel cupboards , in my berth , aboard one of the finest battleships in the world .
Well , I must say , I was delighted .
And , though not much was said , there were many broad smiles among my group as we assembled on the upper deck at the captain ’s request for an honourable tour of the vessel .
We did n’t have long to drink our toasts and engage the spirit of our new - found friends .
I ’m sure , as you can appreciate , we serving officers have much work to do at home .
So , for those reasons and others , we only joined the Yorktown on the eve before she set sail .
At dinner there was much frivolity , as is customary on a warship in times of peace .
If you ’ve not seen a naval captain ’s cabin , you must understand that it ’s a thing of beauty , let me tell you that .
Its walls are panelled .
And pictures of great seafaring men and their deeds hang all about .
Great trestle tables sport gleaming silverware .
And well - polished men , in white , gilded and braided mess - undress uniforms attend to their positions for the captain ’s inspection .
Invariably he instructs his guests to be , “ at ease , gentlemen , ” and shoulders may all slide a little once that order has been given .
But , that this is a formal dinner engagement should never be forgotten .
After an excellent dinner and a modicum of fortified port wine , I slept soundly in my bunk .
And , I must inform you , that I was a little disorientated when I awoke in the midst of our military manoeuvres .
We had an open invitation to join the captain on the bridge .
I ’m sure you ’ll understand that our task as naval observers would have been greatly hampered had this not been the case .
When fighting - the - ship , as it ’s known , it ’s customary for battle - dressed men to stand to action - stations , and for officers to maintain their watches .
We British visitors were mindful of the fact that in our case neither of these duties pertained to us .
However , we were anxious to give the impression of being serving officers , during an engagement .
And , so now that I ’ve acquainted you , both with myself and my situation , let me tell you then the cause of my astonishment .
Things began to go seriously awry when the Mark Manners , First Missile Officer , shouted out “ Ahoy there , shipmates !
I ca n’t see my ship ! ”
“ What do you mean , you ca n’t see the ship ? ” a tactical officer replied .
“ It should be apparent to all on board that you ’re standing on her deck ! ”
“ No , look ! ” cried Mark , pointing into his view - finder .
“ There ’s no ship here , look ! ”
Of course we all did look .
And Mark was right .
His gunsight , which should have displayed the USS Yorktown ’s upper missile deck , actually showed nothing at all .
“ What have you done with it ? ” the tactical officer cried .
“ Those guns were there an hour ago ! ”
At that point Mark ’s screen turned blue , and a large , white error message appeared : Microsoft Windows NT Memory Out of Range .
Please Reboot The System And Try Again .
“ How do you reboot a weapons system ? ” Mark asked .
I said , “ Control , Alt , Delete . ”
Error , the system said .
Weapons not found .
Would you like another system ?
“ This is a friggin ’ battle ! ” Mark cried .
“ How the hell can I use another system ? ”
As Mark Manners hammered on his weapons console , the entire ship came to a halt .
The captain appeared on the weapons deck .
“ Ok , ” Captain Riggins said .
“ Which one of you jokers broke the new computer ? ”
“ Warning , enemy ships approaching ! ” the radar ’s speakers cried .
“ Warning , enemy ships , two nautical miles , and closing . ”
“ What do we do now ? ” Captain Riggins said .
“ The engine wo n’t start without the computer ! ”
That ’s not good , I thought .
“ How many of your men can swim ? ” I asked .
It ’s a sorry sight to see a whole battleship ’s crew and its guests stripping down to their underpants and putting on inflatable , rubber armbands .
I held my nose .
I hate jumping into cold water , especially from the deck of a battleship .
It ’s an awfully long way down from up there .
And so , that ’s the story of how several hundred highly trained , American naval officers , and twelve of their British guests , came to be mostly naked , and swimming about aimlessly , in the Atlantic Ocean , off the coast of Cape Charles .
Moral of the tale :
There ’s just one necessary word of caution to add .
If you ever get put in charge of an American battleship , especially one called USS Yorktown , do n’t install Windows NT on its control systems .
And if you do , never , ever , ever ask them to divide by the number zero .
Because , if you do , you ’ll have to strip off to your underpants and jump into the water !
Footnote :
In September of 1997 , the USS Yorktown died in the water when its network of NT machines experienced a cascading failure due to a divide by zero .
The Navy ’s Smart Ship program was meant to reduce the number of people needed to operate a ship .

All England Club officials have taken time to explain their rationale to Hewitt , but he has made it clear that his seeding rankles and that he would have preferred to face Federer in the final .
" It 's a strange situation , " Hewitt said .
" I do n't know how many times it would have happened that the top two ranked players would be playing in a semifinal in a Slam . "
But though Roddick drew the longer straw , he will not be an overwhelming favorite in his semifinal .
Unlike the other semifinalists , Johansson , the unpretentious Swede , is no international celebrity , but he is , like the other semifinalists , a Grand Slam champion , having won the 2002 Australian Open .
A knee injury kept him from building on that breakthrough and forced him to miss the entire 2003 season .
Despite his remarkable serve , fine returns and compact strokes , he had never before made it past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon .
But he has won minor grass - court tournaments in Halle , Germany , and Nottingham , England .
" A lot of people , they say this is just once in a lifetime , " Johansson said of his surprise Australian Open victory , in which he outplayed Marat Safin in the final .
" I did not feel like that , because I 've been in the quarterfinal of the U.S.
Open twice , and I 've been a top 10 before .
I know that when I play my best tennis , I can compete with the big boys . "
Considering that Johansson is 30 and Roddick is still 22 , he is more the man among the big boys , but both generations have the same objective : a second major title .
Roddick won his at the 2003 United States Open , but has not been past the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam event since Wimbledon last year .
" I think obviously to win Wimbledon is a big thing , " Goldfine said .
" But I think also everything that has been kind of written :
What 's wrong with Andy Roddick ?
Is he just a one - Slam wonder ?
All that stuff , he wants to prove everyone wrong .
" He 's definitely lost some close matches , so I think you understand why some of the things have been written .
But that being said , I do n't think that it is the case , and he obviously does n't think that 's the case , so now it 's just a matter of proving it . "

When I got married , I was reluctant to leave my bank , which is one of Canada ’s enormous , super - profitable savings - sucking behemoths , in favour of the credit union where my wife had her account .
As you ’d expect , she won that argument , and of course , she was also right :
When was the last time your bank PAID you money instead of screwing you for every last cent you ’ve got ?

Most people have of a clear image of how atherosclerosis , popularly known as hardening of the arteries , causes a heart attack — fatty deposits called plaque build up in a coronary artery until the day the blood flow that sustains the heart is blocked .
If only they were right .
In reality , severe coronary artery blockages almost always cause chest pain known as angina and other symptoms as they form .
But among those who suffer heart attacks , half of the men and two - thirds of the women report never experiencing a warning symptom .
And autopsies of such victims frequently show blood clots jammed into arteries that have been only modestly narrowed .
Standard atherosclerosis therapies include bypass surgery to route blood around blockages , angioplasty and stenting to clear blockages from inside the artery , and drugs like statins that reduce cholesterol levels to slow the formation of plaque .
But they have not been enough to prevent 200,000 to 500,000 American deaths annually from what doctors refer to as coronary artery disease .
As a result , many researchers have turned their attention from atherosclerosis in general to the tendency of some patients to develop a form of plaque prone to inflammation and rupture , which can spill a stew of cells into the bloodstream that can incite rapid clotting .
Such plaques have been called “ vulnerable ” plaque .

HERE is the redacted version of a draft Op - Ed article we wrote for The Times , as blacked out by the Central Intelligence Agency ’s Publication Review Board after the White House intervened in the normal prepublication review process and demanded substantial deletions .
Agency officials told us that they had concluded on their own that the original draft included no classified material , but that they had to bow to the White House .
Indeed , the deleted portions of the original draft reveal no classified material .
These passages go into aspects of American - Iranian relations during the Bush administration ’s first term that have been publicly discussed by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ; former Secretary of State Colin Powell ; former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage ; a former State Department policy planning director , Richard Haass ; and a former special envoy to Afghanistan , James Dobbins .
Image
These aspects have been extensively reported in the news media , and one of us , Mr. Leverett , has written about them in The Times and other publications with the explicit permission of the review board .
We provided the following citations to the board to demonstrate that all of the material the White House objected to is already in the public domain .
Unfortunately , to make sense of much of our Op - Ed article , readers will have to read the citations for themselves .

Top Ten Reasons Why Ants Are Better Goal Setters Than You
You ’re about to learn why ants have a philosophy that makes them unstoppable !
Top Ten Reasons Why Ants Are Better Goal Setters Than You
1 . Ants follow proven instruction .
When scout ants find food , they spray a pheromone and hightail it back to the nest .
The pheromone makes a trail that leads back to the food .
Worker
Ants at the nest do n’t argue that there ’s a better way back to the food , they just follow the trail .
A human , though , will see a proven path to success and try to change it .
They ’ll think they see shortcuts and take those instead of the proven path .
I read a report recently the success rate with franchises was higher if the owner did n’t have a high IQ .
Why ?
Because the franchisees who were smart usually veer off the proven path .
They change the working formula and in doing so mess up their own success .
If you watch a scout ant , once he finds food he runs back to the nest , sometimes he gets excited and zigzags a little , he might even make a circle .
When the other ants follow the trail do they say “ hey we ’re going in a circle ?
Let ’s take this shortcut ? ”
No !
They follow the proven path back to the food .
The result ?
Everyone gets the food .
2 . Ants are determined .
If you tell an ant there is food over a hill but there are 5 trees down blocking the path , does the ant think twice ?
No , an ant will climb a house 1000 times its size if it has to make its journey .
This makes a guy feel bad for putting down a research manual because it has too many pages does n’t it ?
Just think of the number of people who quit because the path is “ too difficult , ” too hard to follow .
I face that a lot with the people I mentor on computer networking .
“ Brad , that book is 1800 pages long , you mean I have to know all of that ? ”
They ask .
What would an ant say ?
Would an ant ever say , “ You know , now that you mention it , you ’re right .
I never thought about it that way .
It is too hard .
We might as well put that big book away and work at McDonalds . ”
3 . Ants see defeat as only temporary .
Every fall , as most southern dwellers do , I go to battle with ants coming into our house from the cold .
And although I love ant attitude , Kim ’s arch enemy is the ant .
So I must exterminate .
We have a service that sprays ; I also throw out ant stop powder and use borax bait to kill off the colony .
After a week or two they are all gone .
They have been defeated .
But not so fast !
What happens the next year ?
They come back in the same numbers !
Is n’t it strange that they would come back ?
They lost .
Why would an ant set 1 foot , let alone 6 tiny ant feet in my house ?
Because they see defeat as only temporary .
They know eventually they ’ll win .
Truth is , I know it too .
One day , I ’ll be gone , but generations of ants will still be back – until one day – possibly 2000 years from now , this house will be demolished and the ants will live here freely .
4. Ants Collaborate better than Wall Street Executives .
As I touched on before , when ants search for food , they set up markers along the way , letting other ants know where the food is .
If the food happens to be an insect or grub , this trail is a call to action , they work together to conquer the bug or insect and then drag it back to the nest .
Humans have the ability to collaborate as well .
But most do n’t do it very well .
We are all out searching for our version of food , be it happiness , be it money , or health .
Yet how many people do we actively collaborate with daily ?
How many other people do you actively work on your goals with ?
One ?
Ten ?
An ant does n’t want to hear you are not collaborating with anyone .
He ’d think you are crazy .
He ’d say you are doing it the hard way .
Napoleon Hill called collaboration the Mastermind formula .
It ’s true .
Two brains are better than one , 3 brains are better than 2 .
None of us know it all .
Yet , if we sit down together and give perspectives , we can help each other get what we want .
An ant wo n’t waste any time following the path that says “ lots of food here !!! ”
Of course , he has to trust his comrades .
But that ’s what collaboration is all about .
Learning different perspectives and forming relationships that profit all parties .
It ca n’t be a 1 - 0 relationship .
It has to be a 1 to 1 or 2 - 2 or 3 to 3 relationship where everyone ’s needs are met .
5 . Ants defend what they have and expand it .
Has anyone out there had the pleasure of stepping on a fire anthill barefooted ?
If you ’ve made this mistake , you ’ve seen firsthand how an ant will defend its colony .
But not only do they defend it .
They are constantly expanding it .
Both above and below ground , they build , build , build .
If the wind or a boot knocks over their house , they build it right back and continue expanding it .
Yet , when it comes to humans , defending our homes in the form of insurance , paint and weatherproofing can feel like a major inconvenience .
And what about expanding your home ?
Making it better ?
What an inconvenience !
Who wants to build a deck or add on a sunroom ?
That ’s too much work !
Especially when a new season of 24 is getting ready to start .
An ant , however , would care nothing for 24 .
“ Nonsense ! ”
He ’d say .
I ’d rather have that sunroom !
6 . Ants never let personalities get in the way .
Now granted , Bob the ant may be a raging jerk at home , or perhaps he plays the ant equivalent to video games once the kids are in bed .
But when Bob gets to work in the morning he ’s all business .
You never see Bob the ant wasting precious time gossiping about Mary the ant or the queen who passed you over for the formica sanguinea promotion .
No , ants may well have their own personalities , but they leave that at home .
One ant does n’t purposefully stab another in the back just to get ahead .
Another ant does n’t steal food from the rest to hoard it all to himself .
Ants adopt at a primal level the old saying “ There ’s a time for work and a time for play . ”
They never get the two confused .
When they are at work , they work , non -stop till its time for rest , then they rest .
7 . Ants never spend their whole paycheck .
Ants are acutely aware that a storm is coming , winter is on the horizon or the possibility of a lawn mower in the area .
That is not to be negative , in every life a little rain must fall .
To think you ’ll never have a setback is dumb .
We all have setbacks .
Ants , know they ’ll have setbacks too .
So what do they do ?
They prepare for them .
They do n’t simply find enough food for one week and then eat it all until the next week .
No , they eat some and save some .
Yet , something like 30 % of the American population lives paycheck to paycheck !
Instead of saving a bit out of each check , people spend it all .
You can almost hear them say “ If something bad happens , I ’ll deal with it then . ”
Again , not to be negative , but setbacks will happen .
Accidents happen , winters come , floods take out houses , businesses downsize .
You do n’t have to dwell upon these facts , but you need to prepare yourself for them in case they do happen .
If they do n’t occur , then hey !
You ’ve got extra in your savings account .
Ants would never think to blow it all in a week ’s time .
They scrimp and save for the tougher times .
8 . Ants expect more from themselves than should be possible .
Have you ever seen an ant carrying a leaf or a stick 20 times its size ?
Sometimes you can catch two or three of them carrying a caterpillar and it looks like the caterpillar is floating on air .
Why would an ant ever believe that it ’s possible to carry so much ?
Well one reason is ants brains are not so big , but the other is they are born without negative limits .
Humans , as a whole , give in to mental limits all the time .
We do n’t lift 10 times our weight because we either believe we ca n’t or never made it a focus .
I read in Men ’s health last week that some bodybuilders are bench - pressing over 1000 pounds .
That ’s an incredible feat is n’t it ?
But one reason these guys can do that is they did n’t limit themselves to 100 , 200 or even 500 pounds .
We have examples all around us of people who have severe handicaps , or who come from poor or abusive backgrounds , yet are able to “ overcome ” and achieve their life dreams .
How is that possible ?
One reason is they do n’t believe the limits in their physical makeup or background and upbringing .
They expect more from themselves than should be possible .
They know they are better than to set the ceiling so low .
9 . Ants remain focused until they succeed .
Have you ever seen an ant who is building its anthill suddenly stop what he ’s doing and then buy a lottery ticket ?
No , of course not !
Why ?
Because ants stay focused on what they are doing until they succeed .
When ants are working , they do n’t take sudden detours .
They do n’t quit halfway through to play World of Warcraft .
They pick up one rock , carry it where it needs to go and place it there .
He picks up the next rock and does the same , and so on until he finishes his work .
In writing this article , I had to do something similar – so far , it ’s taken 2 hours of focused attention .
I sat down , wrote up the outline , point by point – until I was finished .
Then it was time to write the first draft .
I did n’t break off during this time and go to the driving range .
I focused until I completed it .
Finally , I went through the draft , correcting mistakes and misspellings , adding points where needed .
But I had to keep focused the entire time .
It ’s not all fun , or entertaining .
But if I want to finish and have something good to show for my time , the I have to stay focused on progress .
If you can focus like an ant on your progress , brick by brick , stone by stone , you ca n’t help but be successful .
10 .
Ants never give up .
The typical human is easily
discouraged .
For some people all it takes is one “ No ” and that ’s the
end .
If he is working on a goal and you say “ no ” that is usually the
end .
He ’ll take that as the final word and stop trying .
Is n’t that
sad ?
If you said no to an ant , he ’d simply find another way .
You can
step on them , spray poison , burn them with magnifying glasses but still
they never give up .
Never give up ..

Even by the standards of Hollywood it is an extraordinary project .
When three - year - old Pham Quang Sang explores his new home for the first time this week , he will become the latest addition to what must be one of the fastest - growing families on the planet , not to mention the most colourful .
Little Pham , from Vietnam , joins Maddox from Cambodia , Zahara from Ethiopia and Shiloh , born in Namibia last May .
Equally remarkable are the parents , Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt , a superstar couple prepared to embrace domesticity on a heroic scale .
Ms Jolie has promised to adopt babies from every corner of the globe , without limit , and this is no empty threat .
Already she has collected a family that resembles the United Nations .

• Coleen snacks in the sun ahead of 21st birthday bash
• Naomi sparkles as her community service stint comes to a glittering end
She faces constant criticism , claims that she is a publicity - seeker , and demands that she take American babies instead of looking to the developing world for children .
But the ' Brangelina ' circus rumbles on , unperturbed , which on past form is no surprise .
Since she first hit stardom , she has been defiantly unconventional , whether it is boasting about unusual sex , showing off her collection of knives , or her large , and some will feel disfiguring , collection of tattoos .
Although recognised the world over , she is a woman truly known by very few , but her brother , 33 - year - old actor and director James Haven Voight , can honestly claim to be one of them .
A reticent man who has spent much of his life in the shadow of his famous younger sister , he rarely seeks the limelight .
But with concern mounting about Angelina 's behaviour , he has used his first - ever newspaper interview to defend her reputation and shed some light on the damaged and dysfunctional upbringing which has shaped them both .
In a fascinating insight into a very private world , he blames the bullying and manipulation of their handsome movie - hero father , Jon Voight , star of Midnight Cowboy , for blighting both their lives .
And he says it is the trauma of their childhood which has driven his sister to create a huge and independent family of her own .
Already emotionally vulnerable , the death of their mother in January of this year has left 31 - year - old Angelina shattered .
She is eating little and already seems to be losing her famous curves .
Now , more than ever , says her brother , she is determined to place her faith in the lives of the children - and who knows how many more there will be - she is gathering around her .
" I have no memory at all of my mother shouting at me or at my sister , " James explains .
" But I do have horrible memories of my father and the way he behaved .
He was so tough on our mother .
" He lived in the same town .
We saw him around Christmas time or at school recitals .
He was always around but he never did his job as a father .
" I think one of the reasons Angelina and I care so much for other people is his treatment of our mother .
Angelina and I were very protective of her for that reason . "
It was their mother , Marcheline Bertrand , who provided the emotional underpinning to their lives , he says - the one point of stability amid the chaos .
Her loss to cancer , aged just 56 , has been devastating .
" Angie has become very thin because she 's grieving , " he admits .
" It 's even difficult for her to eat .
I keep saying to her , ' Do n't forget to eat ' .
" But you know she does n't pay much attention to food anyway and she 's been going through a process of grief like me .
She has not wanted to eat , nor has she been able to . "
It ought to have been a privileged childhood for James and Angelina .
Born in 1973 and 1975 respectively , they were members of Hollywood aristocracy .
As teenagers they were educated at the Beverly Hills High School , alma mater to the stars - a school made more famous still by its central role in the long - running series Beverly Hills 90210 .
Certainly , James remembers the domestic security of his mother 's routine with affection .
" There was very much that home feeling when we came back from school , " he recalls .
" Angie and I would walk in and comment on how we could smell things cooking and baking in the kitchen .
" My mum was methodical in making sure we did our homework perfectly .
She would do outlines to help us .
When we were younger , she used flash cards .
" Or she'd be in the middle of cooking and pick up a carrot and teach us about the vegetable or the fruit so that it was visual as well .
Angie is now the same with her kids . "
Marcheline , a beauty of mixed French - Canadian and Iroquois heritage , was an actress in her own right when she married Voight in 1971 .
But it was a brief partnership .
They separated in 1976 , shortly after Angelina 's birth .
James and Angelina refuse to talk about the reasons for their parents ' break - up - although there have been persistent rumours of womanising .
For all Marcheline 's efforts to create a happy home , it was impossible to escape the destructive influence of Voight .
Money was one of many battlegrounds , although there should hardly have been a shortage of cash .
By 1975 , he was a household name , handsome , blue - eyed and in demand .
Yet according to James , it was a constant battle - to the point that Angelina and her older brother were reduced to pleading with him to pay the child support he owed .
" I tried hard when I was alone with him , " recalls James .
" The alimony was always an issue .
He would claim he was taking good care of her .
" But in reality Mum was stressing out and we had to tell him he was causing the problem .
This would be when I was 13 and Angie was 11 .
" We definitely had a taste of his manipulative behaviour .
But it was when he dealt with my mother that we really saw him pulling the strings .
" And that made us very sad and angry .
Angelina and I saw my mum oppressed .
Now we 're protective of women on their own and , of course , of children . "
It was an experience which drove brother and sister closer and even today their relationship borders on intensity .
H for ' Haven ' is tattooed on Jolie 's wrist .
Notoriously , she gave him a long and passionate kiss when celebrating her Oscar success for Girl , Interrupted in 2000 .
James , who has the same striking looks as his sister , travels with Brad and Angelina on many of their foreign expeditions , and spends hours in the company of her growing brood .
Growing up , they never went hungry , but there were hardships .
No one in Hollywood walks - Los Angeles is not built for the convenience of pedestrians - yet neither Angelina nor James could afford a car .
He explains : " One of the saddest things in my life happened when I was 16 , which is when you can get your permit to drive in LA .
I did not have a car in High School and neither did Angelina .
" Try to imagine .
You go to Beverly Hills High , one of the wealthiest High Schools in the nation .
Even the cheapest car that anyone has is brand new .
All my friends are well off .
I have a movie - star father and no car .
" It was debilitating .
I did not to go to the prom [ the social highlight of an American high school career ] because I felt uncomfortable that Dad would have to drive me .
It 's an embarrassing thing .
" The significant years of dating and getting to know yourself , I did n't experience any of that .
I did n't experience what I think is one of the most important times in a person 's life , and neither did Angelina .
It affected both of us .
" When I was in college and finally dating I went to my dad and told him what it was like for me in High School .
He did n't try to understand at all .
He said he did n't have money . "
It was a lesson that neither of them forgot .
James says : " Angie has been driven to be an independently wealthy woman now because we saw what it was like to be at the mercy of someone who controls the money and pulls the strings .
" There were times when our dad was awesomely good with us , but my biggest and most abiding memory is that he would look more to our faults than to our strengths . "
It must , then , have been particularly hard to follow him in the movie industry .
Certainly for all his sensitivity and good looks , James has scored only modest success with parts in the 2001 movies Original Sin - starring his sister - and Monster 's Ball , which starred his sister 's then husband , Billy Bob Thornton .
James says : " Look at what Angelina is doing - her work with the United Nations , raising awareness of refugees .
It would just be great if Dad would commend her , or send her a message of encouragement .
But she 's never heard those words from him . "
However , it did nothing to blunt her ambitions or her determination .
In fact , the young Angelina was precocious in many ways .
This was a girl sufficiently confident to start a sexual relationship at the age of 14 and bring her lover back to live under the same roof with the tolerance , if not the approval , of her mother .
James denies that his sister is a domineering character , claiming that her famed decisiveness is , like her love of knives and her boasts about sadomasochistic sex , an attempt to be independent of other people 's control .
But he is not ashamed to admit he is under her influence , in all sorts of ways .
" She 's always been very protective of me with regards to my romantic life , which I love , " he smiles .
" She wants me to be with the right woman .
When you come from a divorced home , divorce is what you desperately want to avoid .
" Maybe I have n't found the right woman because my sister is too picky for me .
Any woman has to go through two filters , me and then my sister .
" I'm a perfectionist by nature .
Then , because I 'm so close to Angie it 's like I 've already got the perfect woman in my life and it's hard for anyone else to live up to that .
" I go to Angie for advice and wo n't do anything without her because we were so close as children . "
Her influence on him is so profound , he claims he has even been persuaded to adopt a child himself - provided he can find a partner first .
Angelina has even brought about a change of career , persuading him to spend large parts of his time campaigning for charity .
He is currently preparing to take part in a major US campaign to fight the AIDS pandemic in Uganda .
James is outraged by the claim that their relationship might in any way be inappropriate - claims prompted by ' that ' kiss after the 2000 Oscars .
" I did not give Angie a French kiss , it was something simple and lovely , " he insists .
" She was about to go off to Mexico to finish filming Original Sin with Antonio Banderas .
I congratulated her on the Oscar win and gave her a quick kiss on the lips .
It was snapped and became a big thing round the world . "
It seemed at one point the fractured relationship between Angelina and her father was on the mend .
The pair took part in the 2001 movie Lara Croft : Tomb Raider , for example , with Voight playing her on - screen father .
But Voight spoiled it by going on Access Hollywood , a prime - time US talk show , and accusing his daughter of having ' serious mental problems ' .
Jolie responded by legally erasing her surname , Voight , and banning him from seeing her children .
They have not spoken since .
Voight 's relationship with his son , meanwhile , is a little better .
But not much .
Voight has yet to talk to James in person following the death of his mother , an omission the son finds barely able to believe .
" My dad left a voicemail message that was very kind , wishing condolences to me and my sister .
That was what he did , " says James , his voice heavy with sarcasm .
Now , with the death of their mother , the wound is red raw .
" He was very tough on my mum for years and then the person he was tough on has gone .
He can't do anything now , he can't fix that and it's very painful , " James says .
" At some point I 've got to be able to let my bitterness and anger towards him go and I 'm working on that now .
I believe my mother 's in a better place .
What I have to deal with is that there 's no such thing as him making amends now - he 's lost his chance and that just makes me and Angelina even more upset .
" When I first lost my mother , I could n't stop crying .
Fortunately , I was with Angie when we heard .
It was such a big moment .
" If Angelina understood something about missing parents before , she understands completely now .
Angelina and I are orphans too , in a way .
When you see those kids in orphanages , they cling to each other .
And that 's exactly what they have - they have each other . "
In Jonathan Swift 's " Gulliver 's Travels , " Lilliput was a fictional island nation inhabited by people " somewhat under six inches high " – the Lilliputians .
Modern paleontologists have adopted the term , " the Lilliput effect , " to mean something slightly different .
Organisms that survive mass extinctions tend to be much smaller than those that came before .
A variety of presentations on the Lilliput effect at the recent annual meeting of the Geological Society of America ( GSA ) in Philadelphia explored the many reasons organisms can shrink .
They include the knockout punches of volcanic activity and an asteroid strike thought to have killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , and the peculiar evolutionary pressures exerted by islands .
( Many of the papers from the GSA meeting wo n't be published until 2007 . )
Of intense interest to all is how humans , often said to be causing Earth 's " sixth mass extinction , " will affect evolution on the planet .
As with naturally occurring global catastrophes of the past , human activity has suddenly changed the definition of evolutionary fitness .
Some evidence indicates that the human " footprint " is leading not only to the selection of smaller species over larger ones and generalists over specialists , but also the dwarfing of individuals within a species .
The ecological disturbance implied by such miniaturization has implications not only for the species themselves , which may disappear , but for humankind 's well - being .
Conventional wisdom says that as lineages move through time , they tend to get bigger , not smaller .
Small protohorses , for example , evolved in North America , crossed the Bering Strait when it was dry land and evolved into the larger modern horse in central Asia , even as they died out in the Americas .
This " bigger is better " process is known as Cope 's rule , named after 19th - century paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope .
This rule is based on what would seem to be the obvious advantages of largeness : the ability to fight off predators and take advantage of a wider variety of resources , larger and potentially more numerous offspring , and better metabolic efficiency .
But heftiness is advantageous only when the going is easy .
After a catastrophe , the opposite tendency – the Lilliput effect – prevails .
" It 's not that the things that survived became small , " says Peter Harries , professor of geology at the University of South Florida .
" It 's that the small survived . "
Smaller species often have shorter reproductive cycles , enabling them to quickly recover from population losses .
If they suffer a rapid decline , like the one implied by the huge asteroid impact that extinguished an estimated 50 percent of all species , they recover faster .
They also need less food , which is probably in short supply after a cataclysm , than big animals do .
As with many " rules , " exceptions to the Lilliput effect abound .
While the overall size of land animals shrank after the dinosaurs died off , some mollusks stayed as large as ever , says David Jablonski , a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago : " It happens except for when it does n't happen . "
When times are tough , many organisms compensate by reaching sexual maturity faster than their progenitors did , says Gerta Keller , professor of geology and paleontology at Princeton University .
But with limited resources , accelerated reproduction comes at a cost :
Reaching sexual maturity in half the time , the new generation may be half the size , too .
" It seems to be a universal way of adapting , " Professor Keller says , " getting smaller and reproducing faster . "
By having more offspring in a shorter period of time , organisms accelerate evolution and improve their lineage 's survival chances .
But overly specialized species like the California condor – or , by extension , the dinosaurs – cannot " Lilliputify " fast enough .
They become extinct , even as generalists such as rats and some of our mammalian ancestors ( the " disaster opportunists " ) thrive .
A dramatic shift in body size also occurs when species end up on islands , both literal and figurative .
The " island rule " says that when isolated from founding populations , small species tend to get large , and large species , small .
As recently as 11,000 years ago , dwarf elephants with only 2 percent the mass of their mainland cousins wandered the Mediterranean islands .
Pygmy mammoths lived on the Channel Islands off the California coast until about the same time .
At the other extreme , the extinct dodo bird of Mauritius was descended from a much smaller member of the pigeon family , while Komodo dragons ( which still live on Indonesian islands and can grow to 10 feet ) may be descended from a small monitor lizard .
" Size reduction comes along quickly , " says Larry Agenbroad , director of the Mammoth Site in Hot Springs , S.D. – maybe in as few as three generations .
As islands generally have less food than mainland areas , pressure toward smaller body size is acute .
A 2003 study published in Conservation Ecology found that human activity in Denmark over the past 175 years was having a related effect on local fauna .
Habitat fragmentation had caused 25 species , including mice , hares , and foxes , to change in size .
Larger species were getting smaller , and smaller species , larger .
Tellingly , in all places except Africa , and to a lesser extent , South Asia , the arrival of Paleolithic hunters coincides with the vanishing of large animals , especially in the Americas .
Although for different reasons ( namely , humans ' hunting prowess and their appetite for meat ) , some argue that the advent of modern humans turned largeness into a liability , as had previous catastrophes .
Others think that the removal of large terrestrial species – especially predators – has affected human health by allowing disease - carrying animals to multiply .
Since humans hunted the eastern grey wolf out of existence , the incidence of disease carried by deer - and mouse - borne ticks has risen across eastern forests .
But nowhere is human - exerted pressure toward Lilliputianism more apparent than in the seas .
Highly efficient modern fishing practices have largely removed large fish such as sharks , bluefin tuna , and swordfish .
" We have skimmed off the cream of all the large predators , " says Les Kaufman , professor of biology at the Boston University Marine Program .
Even within some fish species like cod , the average individual size has diminished .
Bigger individuals get caught in nets , while smaller ones pass through , selecting for ever - smaller fish that mature at ever - younger ages .
" That 's why there are so many little fish in the world today , " says Professor Kaufman .
While the disappearance of large species , the shrinking of others , and the proliferation of disaster opportunists worries scientists , what this means for the ecological web to which humankind still belongs worries them more .
" Our survival will depend to a large extent on how many other species we can keep alive , " Keller says .
How wolves help aspens grow
Scientists have long noted that the removal of large , " keystone " species from an ecosystem can have unexpected and often bizarre effects .
For example , wolves ' removal by human hand from Rocky Mountain ecosystems led to fewer aspen groves .
Absent their traditional predator , deer no longer feared to tread in heavily wooded areas .
They gorged themselves on the tasty trees .
Wolves ' recent reintroduction in Yellowstone has reversed the trend .
Seeking to avoid ambush , deer once again cluster in open spaces , and aspen groves have rebounded .
Dubbing it " the ecology of fear , " Les Kaufman , a professor of biology at the Boston University Marine Program , says this relationship holds true across ecosystems .
For similar reasons , the removal by overfishing of large marine predators like sharks has contributed to the demise of coral reefs worldwide .
Without the top predators , the population of mid-sized predators skyrocketed .
In what is called a " trophic cascade , " the populations of the mid-sized predators ' prey – small grazing species – plummeted .
Without the grazing species , the seaweeds these small organisms ate soon overgrew the seafloor , crowding out other species and making it much harder for already stressed coral reefs to regenerate .
In other words , " there is a relationship between making shark fin soup and the death of the world 's reefs , " Professor Kaufman says .
Is n’t it strange when you just know something to be true and then … suddenly , it is n’t ?
There are a lot of reasons that things like this could happen from something as simple as a faulty memory to ( according to some ) something as complex as the idea of alternate universes colliding .
Regardless of how you feel about this strange phenomenon , dubbed The Mandela Effect , we guarantee that you have experienced it at least once .
If you have n’t , you may be about to for the first time .
The Mandela Effect did n’t enter the world ’s collective consciousness until around 2010 and it has been driving people mad ever since .
Sometimes , it sparks a fun argument between you and your friends but other times , it leaves you staring at your ceiling instead of sleeping — because we all know it was Berenstein .
Even though the name of those bears has become one of the most iconic Mandela Effects , the name actually came from a misremembered fact about Nelson Mandela .
Back in 2010 , thousands of people flocked to their keyboards and defended the idea that Nelson Mandela died in prison sometime during the ’ 80s .
The truth is , he was released from prison in the year 1990 and went on to live to almost 100 years old .
He lost a tumultuous battle to respiratory infection in the year 2013 .
From that moment on , the internet came alive with tons of facts that ended up not being particularly true .
A lot of Mandela Effects can be chalked up to poor memory .
A lot of the things people are confused about faded from popularity , rebranding happens , and perhaps on the internet more than anywhere else , being wrong happens .
However , there are a lot of interesting ‘ explanations ’ as to why this phenomenon could be happening to so many people .
Perhaps the most unnerving thing is that we really may never know the truth .
What Causes The Mandela Effect ?
At this point , it is anyone ’s guess what exactly causes this spooky phenomenon .
It ’s like déjà vu ( or his less - popular - but - equally - unnerving cousin , jamais vu ) .
Plenty of people have taken a crack at the answer but as far as we know , no one has figured it out .
A paranormal expert named Fiona Broome was the first one to come up with the term “ Mandela Effect ” and her explanation leaves a lot to be desired for the more skeptical among us .
She claims that there are shifts in the multiverse , which is based on a theory saying that there are parallel realities that all feature slight variations in events and objects .
According to her , there are things that cause people to shift between parallel realities and you may just be from a different timeline where you ’re absolutely correct , just not anymore .
One possibility that has been proposed is that we are living in a simulation .
The Simulation Theory is a heavily - studied and well - documented existential can of worms that you ’re free to open if you ’d like to stay awake freaking out for the next few days .
For the less brave , the theory states that our reality is entirely computer generated and is therefore subject to glitches and software errors that would cause these kinds of continuity errors to occur .
Some people claim that time travelers many years from now are coming back and making minor tweaks .
The reason as to why they would do that ranges from completely arbitrary to more sinister .
Maybe they ’re just having a laugh but perhaps , there is some deep - rooted plot to undermine life as we know it .
Where the Monopoly Man ’s missing monocle comes into the picture has n’t revealed itself yet but there are a shocking number of people who have accepted this to be the most likely culprit .
If you ’re not someone who enjoys a good conspiracy once in a while , you might be just as confused as you were in the first place .
We know you ’re thinking , okay folks , really , what causes the Mandela Effect ?
Psychologists have weighed in on the issue but nothing has been set in stone yet .
As the Mandela Effect makes evident , reality is subject to change anyway .
Memory distortion and false memories are heavily - studied and they can occur for a lot of reasons .
Some people who have experienced moderate depression all the way up to severe trauma experience a shrinkage in the hippocampus that destroys synapses .
This means that there are a lot of people who can not remember large portions of their lives or , their brains leave out minor details .
This can improve with treatment but it just goes to show that memory can be a faulty thing .
That is even true of healthy brains .
There is something called the Deese - Roediger and McDermott paradigm that could be responsible .
When people have to memorize a list of words in a given category , words that are related but were not presented in the initial list can come to mind .
It is extremely easy to create false memories using psychological experiments .
It is also difficult for some people to differentiate between dreams and reality , something they may have seen on TV as a kid , and so on .
False memories can happen for a lot of reasons .
There is also a different kind of software error that could be going on .
Schemas are compartments of knowledge in our brains and they make storage easier because there is a lot going on in there .
The way that knowledge is compartmentalized can cause generalizations in our minds .
We can also absorb other people ’s generalizations .
All it takes is for one person to get a fact wrong once and this can become viral in a sense , infecting people so widely that they just accept it as fact .
For instance , “ Luke , I am your father , ” is not said in a single Star Wars film and yet it is somehow the most iconic line in the franchise .
The bottom line is that brains are complex and difficult to understand and , apparently , so is the reality that we all live in .
Regardless of what you think causes the Mandela Effect , it ’s something that is becoming more widespread and harder to explain as time goes on .
Some of them are extremely weird !
We ’re going to take a quick walk down memory lane and check out some of the weirdest and most unnerving Mandela Effects so far .
We ’re going to skirt past some of the more common ones and try to present you with something new that you may have never known .
1 “ Beam Me Up , Scotty ! ”
This is one of the most highly - remembered lines from Star Trek .
Every franchise has that one thing that hangs around for years after it is n’t as popular as it may have been in the past .
This is one of those instances that could just be a case of misremembering , especially with the way that this line was said in shows and movies all throughout the ’ 80s and ’90s .
There is an explanation for the line not being a direct quote ; however , it is a little bit strange to find out that the one thing you remember most about Star Trek … never even happened .
This line is attributed to Captain Kirk , who was played by William Shatner .
His strange cadence and stern speaking voice stand out to anyone who has ever seen just one episode of the series .
In all of the nearly - 80 episodes that he was in , he never says this line .
It is so popular that there are even tanning salons that bear this phrase as their names .
He said similar lines throughout the entire series but never this specific one .
In fact , he more frequently said , “ Scotty , beam me up . ”
Weird , is n’t it ?
2 “ It ’s A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood . ” Fred McFeely Rogers , who we all know as Mr. Rogers , was a national treasure that will be deeply missed .
His show and his activism surrounding public media changed the world in a lot of ways .
He is best known for his show Mister Rogers ’ Neighborhood , which ran from 1968 to 2001 .
Obviously , such a long - running series that tackled tough topics in a way that children could understand won the hearts of several generations .
Mr. Rogers always spoke to children as individuals , never demeaned their intelligence , and the show had substance .
It was amazing !
One of the things that people seem to remember most is the theme song of the show , which Rogers sang himself .
“ Wo n’t You Be My Neighbor ? ” was the title of the theme and it was written in 1967 when the show was in production .
The first line is … sing it with us …
“ It ’s a beautiful day in this neighborhood . ”
That does n’t feel right , does it ?
Most people remember the line as being “ It ’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood . ”
However , if you go back through and watch , this is n’t correct .
Curiously , A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is the title of the 2019 biopic about Rogers ’ life .
The lyrics are correct in the actual film so this could be a stylistic choice but , we ’re counting it as what ’s known as a residue of this effect .
3 “ Smokey The Bear ” Everyone knows that only you can prevent forest fires and we know it because Smokey The Bear has been teaching kids that key environmental safety tidbit since 1944 .
Forest fires being caused by people have always been a problem but it really started to get public attention after World War 2 and thus , this campaign was born .
The lovable fuzzy forest ranger we all know is apparently just called Smokey Bear .
This is interesting because this is one of the Mandela Effects with a lot of “ residue . ”
Residue is the term used to describe the way things purportedly “ used to be ” before the Mandela Effect changed it .
When you do some research online , you can find several instances of news sources and other media referencing Smokey the Bear ; however , he was never called that in any official media related to fire prevention .
There is a song that was released in 1952 by Ed Arnold titled “ Smokey the Bear ” and the lyrics were reportedly changed to match the melody of the song .
This could be why everyone misremembers it incorrectly ; there was also an actual bear named Smokey .
However you remember it , you can find historical references to both and it makes this a very weird Mandela Effect to think .
4 Tinkerbell ’s Disney Intro Disney has had a lot of different introductions over the years , it has become as deeply ingrained in the minds of generations young and old .
It is as easily recalled as the Pixar introduction with the lamp .
The basic introduction scene has been the same over the years even though it has been stylized in many different ways .
The castle is visible and a shooting star , a line , or whatever they used in that particular iteration bridges over the castle .
Many people remember one of these introductions featuring Tinkerbell .
In some of them , she would appear and use her wand to draw the arch and then dot the letter I in the word “ Disney . ”
In others , people recall her struggling to get her wand to work and hitting it against her hand a few times to get it to work .
What ’s strange is that there is no evidence of this ever existing .
While thousands of people distinctly remember this introduction , they have trouble placing their finger on what movie or show that it came from .
This does n’t seem like it should be an issue because there are videos that are just compilations of Disney introductions and this widely - recalled scene should be in there … but it is n’t .
Even though many of us remember this , this Mandela Effect has no residue .
5 “ Luke , I Am Your Father . ”
I know we said that we were going to stay away from some of the more widely - known Mandela Effects but this one is so strange that it just needs to be brought up .
Hundreds of shows , movies , and other pieces of media have quoted this line over the years .
Star Wars is easily one of the most iconic and enduringly relevant sci- fi franchises in popular culture today .
Even though a lot of the more niche sci- fi books and movies are “ reserved for the nerds , ” this one continues to be extremely popular .
Its popularity is on the rise once again now that Disney has taken over and Baby Yoda has taken up permanent residents in our hearts .
One thing that we believe will shock you every single time that you read it is that this line is not featured in any of the Star Wars films .
James Earl Jones himself recalls the first time he read the script in the 2004 documentary titled Empire of Dreams : The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy , and how shocking the revelation was that Darth Vader was the father of Luke Skywalker .
He says the iconic line in the documentary ( which is how he remembers it ) but , as it turns out , the line in the original film is actually “ No , I am your father . ”
6 “ Febreeze ” This one is a sensitive subject .
It could easily be just the fact that all of us are terrible at spelling but enough people have brought it up over the past decade of Mandela Madness that we wanted to talk about it .
There is residue of this one , photos of bottles of this fabric refresher and air freshener that feature the supposed original spelling of Febreeze .
There is no guarantee that these photos are not clever photoshop masterpieces designed to further the misconception .
It would make sense if it was Febreeze because it ’s an air freshener , like a breeze .
However , the product ’s correct spelling is Febreze .
This is a tough one because it is n’t something that you think about very often unless you ’re one of the lucky people who got lured into completely trashed minivans and bedrooms and were blindfolded and told to sniff .
At the same time , this stuff is everywhere and you probably have some of it in your house right now .
It seems so odd that such a ubiquitous product would fall into the trap of a Mandela Effect .
Do you remember Febreeze or Febreze ?
It ’s possible that we ’re not just noseblind but also simply blind and have been misreading it all this time .
But , there is still the chance that the universe has completely turned on its head and this sketchy misspelled product cannot be trusted .
7 “ Mirror , Mirror On The Wall ” Some movie lines live on far past the popularity of the film itself and this is another one of them .
Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs is a classic Disney film that was originally released in 1937 .
The Evil Queen is Snow White ’s stepmother and she ’s extremely full of herself and jealous of Snow White .
Due to that insecurity , she asks her Magic Mirror every day who the fairest in all the land is .
Siri would have just said “ I ca n’t answer that , ” but the Mirror came in clutch and always said that it was her , until one day it said Snow White , which sent her into the spiral that kicks off the film .
However , most people remember her saying the line , “ Mirror , Mirror on the wall . ”
The actual line in the film is “ Magic Mirror on the wall . ”
This is something that most people are baffled by because they remember it very distinctly .
It is another one of those lines that has been quoted in tons of other shows and movies ranging from The Simpsons to Shrek .
It is always quoted as being “ Mirror , mirror . ”
Further , there are a lot of older promotional materials from the 80’s and 90’s that are directly tied to Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs that also use the “ Mirror , mirror ” line even though this is apparently incorrect and was never part of the original story or film .
8 The Salem Witch Trials
This one is going to be slightly crazier than the others , perhaps , because of its historical significance .
Most Mandela Effects are just a little bit strange but , they are recent enough that there is enough information to explain them away .
Typically , of course .
This is one that comes a little bit out of left field for a lot of people .
Talking about being “ burned at the stake ” goes back to the Salem Witch Trials and it has been referenced in books , films , and even art pieces that were created back in the times of the Trials .
Burning witches is a theme that is touched on in movies , books , and even songs ( Looking at you , Rob Zombie ) .
Even your most annoying Facebook friend has probably shared the quote , “ We are the granddaughters of the witches you could n’t burn . ”
( Originally said by Tish Thawer . )
This turns out to be a very widespread misconception ( read : definitely a Mandela Effect ) .
Despite all of these references and the fact you may have even been taught this is school , there is no historical evidence of any suspected witches being burned at the stake .
Some variations on this include the belief that the accused were drowned or stoned to death .
However , all but one of the executions of those who were accused of witchcraft during this time were apparently hangings .
9 “ ET Phone Home . ”
We know that you ’re deeply shaken up by this point but you have almost made it to the end here and we ’re sorry to say that this one might traumatize you just as much as the first time you watched that creepy sentient raisin on your screen .
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is considered one of the greatest films of all time and has held its place as the greatest sci- fi film ever made on Rotten Tomatoes for a very long time .
It was an immediate hit and was one of the films of the ’ 80s that would shape a generation .
As with any movie with such unprecedented popularity , it has been quoted in other media and even ad campaigns .
The loveable alien even makes a cameo in the Roku screensaver .
The line that everyone has been quoting for almost half a century now comes from the scene where E.T. discovers the phone , and he starts trying to tell the kids that he needs to make contact with his home planet .
Nevermind the astronomical roaming charge .
While you may distinctly remember him as saying “ E.T. phone home , ” ( as you can probably guess ) , he never said that !
The actual line in the movie is “ E.T. home phone . ”
Granted , he does end up saying “ phone home ” later in the film according to some sources , the fact that the original line is n’t quite what everyone remembers remains startling .
There has been much talk about why Bush 41 cried so hard talking about Jeb .
Many believe it was because Jeb represented his hopes for what a Presidency could be , and what they got was the Black Sheep of the family .
Jeb was the hero , the next in line , the heir apparent .
Why did they ( the Pragmatista ) not worry when this happened ?
No one thought that after he went sober that W would be this bad .
They were wrong .
None of them believed that even if the second Persian Gulf war was tough , that it would be a disaster .
They all believed that W was set with the old style Reagan / Bush Republicans and advisors and they all just assumed Iraq would turn out just like the last time .
They were wrong .
I believe , as do friends of mine , that the ISG was his father trying to tell him how to win .
Yes , you have to talk to Syria and Iran , even though you say you do n’t .
W says “ no ” .
Our troops are exacerbating the situation , we need to withdraw them soon .
W says “ no ” .
Victory is not really possible anymore .
Nor is a democracy .
W says “ no ” .
So this pits W against his father .
This pits the Pragmatists , many who actually served with the Neocons that we all know are blowhard cowards that cheer on everyone else ’s death .
Keep in mind that the Neocons are not contrite at all .
They think invading Iraq was a grand idea poorly executed .
This by the way is the answer to the question that we are all asking : how can people be so wrong , about so many things and still stick by their guns ?
( There is another answer to that as well .
It is because they do not have to pay the price .
Your kids will , not these brilliant millionaires who have fought no wars , worn no uniforms beyond Cub Scouts , know no Arabic , and are truly impressed with their knowledge of history .
History is all that stuff that already happened , such that , when you recall it , it makes you sound like a scholar . )
They have their neologisms like Islamofacism and Defeatocrats .
But increasingly , anyone with a three digit IQ and a heart that works is not buying this anymore .
These folks are exactly like the anti-Communists after McCarthy .
They can not let go of their addiction to bogymen philosophies : Communism ... Atheism ... Homosexuality ... and now ... Islamism .
The ISG has created a president so isolated that only 20 % of the people in this country agree with him .
That means that one third of the one third of this country that is willfully stupid ( likes Bush , thinks the world is 6000 years old ... you get the idea ) actually has fallen off the Bush Lover ’s wagon .
From James Baker III to five cabinet level advisors from Colin Powell to Richard Clarke to wingnut George Will have already jumped ship .
Thomas Friedman has stopped calling for more Freidman’s .
Combat veterans have jumped ship .
All our allies save the Seychelles Islands have jumped ship .
The Brits have even decided that they will no longer use the terminology “ War On Terror ” .
Senator John Cornyn , Senator Gordon Smith , Senator John Sununu , and Senator John Coleman have all jumped ship .
Today we find out that the Russians are now testing the Topol - 22 , a high - speed nuclear weapon that will fly to targets at speeds it will be difficult to intercept .
Why did the Russians create a new nuke ?
Because Bush unilaterally pulled us out of a nuclear non proliferation accord .
Does anyone think the Pragmatista are going to sit by while a nuke race starts ?
The ocean trade routes that we have negotiated all over the Mideast are threatened .
The oil and the oil revenues that we sought to extricate from Iraq is not forthcoming .
All this adds up to problems for James Baker and Brent Scowcroft who worked so hard to build something .
And while we ’re making the point that W is isolated , imagine the bunker mentality at Faux News and CNN and MSGOP in the corners where they cheerlead this war .
Imagine the pain of being Victor Davis Hanson or Tony Snow or Rush Limbaugh or George Bush or the editors at TNR that have said repeatedly “ We ’re winning ” .
Imagine the ever - deepening denial of the angry desperate little keyboard cowards who are seeing their visions of a muscular America dominating the world evaporate into a smelly and pathetic lie .
These are the same delusional fascists who to this day complain that the good news in Iraq is not being reported .
They will believe this like Hiro Onoda the last Japanese soldier holding on in the Phillipines .
These are vermin that James Baker will have to extinguish .
Back to W .
So here is a man that commands the most powerful military in world history , almost virtually alone in his public delusion , who like a petulant , uneducated teenager , simply will not listen .
No matter how many kids die .
No matter how many allies bitch .
No matter how many of his mentors openly oppose this .
No matter the pressure he puts on the military .
No matter the obvious failure happening in front of his own eyes , and when he hears about it from his own advisors .
This is an emperor who has not negotiated for peace for one day during his tenure as President .
This is an emperor with no clothes who is now trying to convince us that he wearing a mink stole .
Here is a man with his finger on the button of massive nuclear power , who prior to his tenure at the top had never been beyond Mexico or Canada , and had to be briefed on the difference between the Shiites and the Sunnis , who kicked a Hornet ’s nest and now stands with almost no support among the public , the military and now even his own deadly family .
W is taking a long dip into Lake Hallucination .
This is a guy who had the power to stop drinking , but cannot admit the simple awful truth that everyone else in the world can say and most all of us realize .
Wayne Slater of the Dallas Morning News put it perfectly on MSNBC so far : Bush wants a legacy , and in his mind he simply cannot accept the fact that his biggest action is now so obviously the biggest bloody disaster we have participated in .
So W ’s deafness forces this constant word parsing that makes Blair squirm and makes Tony Snow look like he just licked the scum off the underside of a public toilet every time he speaks .
Fact is , W probably has n’t even stopped drinking .
But Iraq is not the only reason why the Pragmatista have darkened W’s door , although you would think that this is it .
Iraq is only one of the things sticking in America ’s craw .
This is where Baker and Cheney and the rest of the war hawks are completely wrong .
I do not believe Iraq was the main reason the Rethugs got trounced .
It was overall miserable governance on issues that matter to people .
Medicine and healthcare suck .
FEMA is underfunded and cannot protect us thanks to the Bushies .
The FDA has been compromised thanks to the Bushies .
Forget Osama , they ca n’t stop e coli .
Corporations have more rights than people do and that rubs us all the wrong way .
Almost every important government post is manned by a Republican operative with no degree and no experience beyond campaigning .
Americans want competent managers managing the government .
We are tired of seeing the Gulf Coast sit in shit while all our heavy lift helicopters are in Iraq .
We are tired of being told that science is n’t correct by people who have no science education .
I mean this paragraph could go on indefinitely just covering the perfidy we have seen .
So it ’s not just Iraq .
It ’s everything .
Either way you slice it , the Pragmatista read the tea - leaves and realize people do not want to be governed by Republicans anymore .
Americans have had it .
And if the Rethugs do n’t listen , America will go to the polls again and throw the rest of the worthless asshats out two years from now .
So , I believe little will happen in the short term , but if the Rethuglicans think they will lose the Whitehouse or lose more Senate and Congressional seats , you will see a real backlash , not just from the public , but from the last generation of Mideast policy advisors who got it right most of the time .
Perhaps even the Pragmatists will support a chimpeachment .
But if you think this war inside the government will subside you are wrong .
The Pragmatistas realize that any productive long - term Mideast policy is not sustainable under W. ( Think about how fast this would happen if corporate profits really started sagging because of W ’s reign of terror . )
That means the Pragmatista may feel they have to remove W from power and they could easily do this by allowing others to impeach him or cast him as a war criminal .
This is what I believe is likely to happen if things get worse in then next two years .
And when and if this intervention happens only two entities will be staring around , babbling aimlessly and wondering what happened : Bush , and cable news .
Wathc for Round 2 .
The rest of us would be happier than a herpes at a YMCA if Bush were gone .
I mean he is in trouble .
He might not know it .
But he is .
China 's controversial Three Gorges Dam project hits a significant milestone on Saturday , when it is expected to reach its final height of 185 m ( 607 feet ) .
But it will not be fully operational until 2009 .
Over the last few months , I ’ve been trying to get a better understanding of what is happening with the concept of virtual worlds .
Let me go into more details as to why I think this phenomenon has some real potentials .
In this first entry in a series , I will explore the economic activity surrounding this phenomenon .
Size of the market
When talking about virtual worlds , I am focusing on the new space created by the gaming industry that allows to create online avatars and interact with other players in a fully immersive environment .
From an economic standpoint , estimates range from around 100 millions to a high of US $ 1.5 billion a year .
These are not insignificant numbers and they point to an emerging phenomenon and potentially the rise a new industry , with its own set of marketplaces , gathers , owners , creators , and marketers .
Marketplaces
To understand virtual worlds marketplace , one must first understand what si going on in those virtual worlds .
When a player sets up an account , he ’s given a basic set of skills .
As he or she progresses and interacts with the virtual world and its denizens , the player gains more and more skills and goods .
However , this type of interaction requires time .
Some people have figured that , because time is money , the amount of time spend in a virtual world could be converted into real hard currency .
Thus was born the concept of Real Money Trading ( aka RMT ) , whereas players go to specialized sites and buy virtual goods with real financial currency .
The action initially started on auction sites like Ebay , where characters or other virtual goods range in price from a few cents to several thousands of dollars .
Because the trades were largely unregulated , some companies , like Sony , decided to set up their own exchange while others ( Internet Game Exchange , Massive Online Gaming Sales , Tek Gaming Supplies , Swag Vault , and Gamers ’ Loot ) have created specialized marketplaces to cater to this new phenomenon .
This , in turns has led to the rise of two new classes of activities : informational ones that provide analysis on the financial going ons in those worlds and arbitration , whereas companies use people in the developing world to build up assets they resell to people in the developed world .
Let ’s go deeper in those areas .
Information Sites
There is now a nascent information industry surrounding the costs of goods in virtual worlds .
For example , Eyes on Mogs is a shopping search engine for virtual goods .
All the attributes of other search engines are part of it , including comparison shopping , comparisons of the different vendors , pricing , delivery date , and buy it now info .
GameUSD tracks the financial value of virtual currencies over time , providing price trends across not only the provider but also the alternative marketplaces .
MMOfx claims to track “ over 18,000 price quotes daily ” and provide information on the fluctuation of virtual currencies .
Arbitration
Another type of economic activity to have arisen out of the marketplace phenomenon is the arbitration of virtual work .
As the primary pursuit in these worlds is the acquisition of wealth , status or levels , an emerging market has arisen to give people with real money a chance to bypass the time investment required to acquire those things .
For example , Chinese workers get paid between $ 75 and $ 250 a month to work in World Of Warcraft , in 12 hours shifts , “ killing onscreen monsters and winning battles , harvesting artificial gold coins and other virtual goods .
Affluent online gamers who lack the time and patience to work their way up to the higher levels of gamedom are willing to pay the young Chinese to play the early rounds for them . ”
Similarly , Romanian players can make a living wage ( the ABC News story I linked to says that $ 200 is a good wage for Romania ) on the same kind of activity .
Edward Castranova , the leading economist on the subject of money in virtual worlds has been quoted as saying that “ They ’re exploiting the wage difference between the U.S. and China for unskilled labor . ”
What is basically happening here is that these companies have found a niche on the global marketplace to accumulate goods at a low cost and resell them at a premium .
This type of arbitrage has been the way a lot of developing markets have revolutionized industries , from the export of manufacturing capabilities in the 20th century to the export of some service jobs nowadays .
It ’s a natural phenomenon and shows that those marketplaces are starting to develop a high level of maturity , which should be noticed by a lot more people .
Virtual Goods Ownership
Beyond the buying and selling of virtual goods in virtual marketplaces , there is also an emerging trend in the real estate business , which can be broken down into three main groups : real - estate owners , creators and integrators , and marketers .
Second Life is a virtual world more focused on the social aspect of virtual environments than on the goal oriented aspect of missions and war - craft .
Fortune Magazine reported last year about the interesting case of Anshe Chung , a character created by a German woman who has accumulated more than US $ 200,000 in virtual land holdings in Second Life .
She rents the property out to other people , after having developed the property .
Similarly , the BBC reports that a 23 - year - old spent Â£ 13,770 in Project Entropia and recouped his investment in under a year .
In fact , the land rush has been so strong that Second Life has build a model around land use fees , generating a nice chunk of income in the process .
While visiting this world , I ’ve talked to people who had few problems paying $ 75 per month to Linden Labs for those fees .
This is pretty incredible when you think that all they are buying is portion of disk space on a server .
In a way , the real estate market presented by those virtual worlds can be seen as a hosting fee in a 3D environment and could represent a high growth market ( in a future entry , I will look at the opportunities in the Virtual Spaces in more details ) .
The Integration Model
Another nascent portion of this new industry is the integration game .
As with any new technology , developing and managing something in a virtual world is an endeavor that requires specialized skills .
New companies like
The electric sheep company and Space Think Dream have emerged as developers / integrators , offering their services to other companies .
Their main business is to use the skills they ’ve acquired to help existing companies experiment in these new worlds .
This is , in a way , similar to the type of work that was done by early web design agencies , treating virtual worlds as a new interface either to existing systems or to create a new value proposition .
Other companies have emerged with the sole purpose of selling digital goods in those worlds .
SLexchange is a virtual market where people can buy and sell such goods .
Similarly , the Electric Sheep company has created SLBoutique as a competitor to SLexchange .
What is interesting here is that there is a whole ecosystem building around Second Life , allowing other companies to prosper based on this new platform .
This is similar to what has happened with Ebay and allows us to better understand SecondLife as a platform for e-commerce rather than just a game , a fact that Philip Rosedale , CEO of LindenLab and the power behind Second Life , likes to emphasize .
This explains why the company has received investments from people like amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos , Lotus founder Mitch Kapor , Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar , and Microsoft CTO Ray Ozzie .
Those people understand that this a new emerging platform and could see potentially high return on their investment .
Bridging the gap
The development of virtual worlds as a new platform is starting to take shape .
Companies and organizations like American Apparel , the BBC , Major League Baseball , NASA , The American Cancer Society , Amazon.com and Wells Fargo are starting to experiment in that space .
Increasingly , virtual worlds are becoming not only a new way to market but also a new integration point for e-commerce .
Some of the virtual worlds ( Project Entropia , for example ) have even gone as far as issuing ATM cards that allow denizens of those worlds to take virtual money and trade it for real money that they can use for regular economic activity .
Conclusion
With large amounts of real currency already moving through virtual worlds , we are looking at a major new economic phenomenon that parallels the initial development of the commercial web and the rise of software as platform in the last few years .
With a new ecosystem forming around some of the virtual worlds , there is a fair amount of incentive for a lot of people to see this phenomenon succeed .
SecondLife will probably be an early winner in this race , largely due to how quickly it has managed to get other companies to rely on it .
A few more established companies are also early in staking ground in this new space and will probably reap rich rewards for their efforts , expanding their brand into those virtual spaces .
While it may appear that this is largely a subculture of gaming , the phenomenon is much more widespread .
In my next entry , I will go through the demographic profile of denizens of those virtual spaces , showcasing a rich and varied texture to this phenomenon .

IS THE NEW
LeisureArts
The project documents every instance of the phrase " is the new " encountered from various sources in 2005 .
It is intended to map the iterations of a peculiarly common marketing and literary device .
In what can only be considered a tidal wave of public opinion , a new Yale research survey reveals a significant shift in public attitudes toward the environment and global warming .
Fully 83 percent of Americans now say global warming is a â€œseriousâ€  problem , up from 70 percent in 2004 .
More Americans than ever say they have serious concerns about environmental threats , such as toxic soil and water ( 92 percent , up from 85 percent in 2004 ) , deforestation ( 89 percent , up from 78 percent ) , air pollution ( 93 percent , up from 87 percent ) and the extinction of wildlife ( 83 percent , up from 72 percent in 2005 ) .
Most dramatically , the survey of 1,000 adults nationwide shows that 63 percent of Americans agree that the United States â€œis in as much danger from environmental hazards , such as air pollution and global warming , as it is from terrorists .â€ 
It reveals growing concern about dependence on Middle Eastern oil , with 96 percent of the public saying this is a serious problem .
As a result , the public overwhelmingly supports increasing the use of alternative energy , including solar and wind power , as well as investing more in energy efficiency .
The survey indicates that while 70 percent of Americans believe that President Bush doesnâ€™t do enough for the environment and should do more , many citizens are ready to act on their own .
Seventy - five percent recognize that their own behavior can help to reduce global warming , and 81 percent believe it is their responsibility to do so .
The results further suggest that many Americans want greener products and are ready to spend money to try new technologies that will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Seventy percent of the public indicates a willingness to buy solar panels , and 67 percent would consider buying a hybrid car .
These numbers suggest that the growing number of companies that see market opportunities in providing climate - change solutionsâ€ ” alternative energy , â€œcleantechâ€ products and energy efficiencyâ€ ” may be on the right track .
Dan Esty , director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy , which commissioned the survey , says the United States is in the midst of a â€œrevolution , â€ in which the business community is embracing the profit potential of a burgeoning green consumer movement .
And frustrated with the limits of government action , the public increasingly wants business to solve environmental problems .
â€ œThereâ€™s been a dramatic shift in the business communityâ€™s attitude toward the environment , â€ notes Esty .
â€ œRather than seeing environmental issues as a set of costs to bear , regulation to follow and risks to manage , companies have begun to focus on the â€˜upside , â€™ recognizing that societyâ€™s desire for action on climate change , in particular , will create a huge demand for reducing carbon - content products .
â€ œItâ€™s clear that the public is not waiting for the government to take the lead .
Americans no longer think itâ€™s entirely the domain of government to solve environmental problems .
They expect companies to step up and address climate change and other concerns.â€ 
The survey also suggests that the publicâ€™s reasons for wanting investments in alternative energy and action on climate change vary widely .
For some , concern stems from the rising cost of gasoline ( Forty - nine percent of the public sees this as a very serious issue . ) .
Others want the nation to be free of imported oil ( 93 percent ) .
Forty - three percent believe that preventing global warming is a religious duty .
â€ œThe coalition supporting action on climate change has broadened considerably , â€ said Gus Speth , dean of Yaleâ€™s environment school .
â€ œWith the public ready for carbon controls and business stepping up to the climate change challenge , it is disappointing that our political leadership is lagging so badly on this issue.â€ 
The survey was conducted on behalf of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies by Global Strategy Group from February 5 to 11 , 2007 .
The survey was conducted using professional phone interviewers .
The nationwide sample was drawn from a random digit dial ( RDD ) process .
Respondents were screened on the basis of age , i.e. , to be over the age of 18 .
The survey has an overall margin of error of Â±3.1 % at the 95 % confidence level .
The survey questions and full results can be found at the website of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy .
David Parnas : I have been hearing the term " software crisis " for more than 40 years .
Clearly , it is not a crisis ; it is a chronic problem .
Each time someone uses the term " crisis , " it is a preface to the announcement of a new miracle cure for the problem .
Examinations of the cure usually reveal new words for ideas the have been tried before without much effect .
This decade 's crisis is global software development ( GSD ) ; this decade 's miracle cure ( for all the ills of the industry ) seems to be a collection of methods known as " agile . "
It is fashionable to speak of " grand challenges . "
The real grand challenge is not to find ways to to avoid producing documentation , but to find ways to produce useful documents — documents that take time but save more time .
We will find that real agility comes from good design that is well documented in precise , lean documentation .
Barry Boehm :
There are no one - size - fits - all solutions .
The best way I have been able to find is to use risk as a way to determine where to go agile and where to go document - driven .
Thus , for example , if you are developing a graphic user interface ( GUI ) for an unprecedented decision support system and want to document its requirements , the most frequent answer you will get from users is , " I can't tell you in advance , but I 'll know it when I see it ( IKIWISI ) . "
In such a case , it is a high risk to try to document the GUI in advance , and with a GUI builder tool , it is a low risk not to document it .
On the other hand , when you are outsourcing a relatively stable piece of business logic to a contractor 10 time zones away , it is a high risk not to invest in a significant amount of thorough documentation of the interfaces and protocols connecting the outsourced sofware to the rest of your software .
Giancarlo Succi :
No one thinks that analysis and design are useless .
But consider a system to dispatch tracing messages and other information to a group of trucks .
This domain is likely to be alien to most software developers .
In such a case , would it be better to first spend a lot of time doing the upfront design , and eventually writing the code , or to work incrementally , involving the end customer , interleaving some analysis , design , and even coding , so that the developers grow their knowledge of the system domain ?
Matthew Simons :
While the idea of story cards appeals to those with no desire for reading or writing technical documentation , the reality of the situation is that such scanty artifacts are rarely sufficient for development of anything beyond simple systems for highly accessible individuals or small groups of users .
This scenario rarely applies to GSD .
As the picture becomes more complex , we have found the story card - only approach quickly becomes inadequate .
While writing effective documentation is a good place to start , we have found it takes a lot more than that to deliver complex systems with distributed teams .
Without the discipline that comes from the remaining agile practices ( such as Test - Driven Development , Continuous Integration , Pair Programming , among others ) good documents are nothing more than a step on the long and perilous path toward successful delivery .
I got my October 2006 issue of the Communications of the ACM in the post today .
The featured topic of this issue is " Flexible and Distributed software processes " , and a lot of articles feature agile software development , especially in the context of distributed software development .
If you have ACM digital library access , you can read the articles online at the above link .
The leading article , Flexible and Distributed Software Processes : Old Petunias in New Bowls ? " ( ACM Digital Library membership required ) has some interesting commentaries by well known experts .
Although about global software development and distributed teams , much of it is also applicable to co-located teams .
Here are some snippetsLike I said , the quotes above are only snippets .
The actual commentaries include a lot more context and information than I have provided here .
Read the whole article if you can , it is well worth it .

SYDNEY – Volkswagen Australia is checking with its German head office to see if its cars sold Down Under have the same emissions - cheating software that have been uncovered in the USA .
In the US , Volkswagen has halted all sales of its
diesel vehicles , following an ongoing investigation into software that has
reportedly enabled thousands of cars to cheat emissions tests .
Australia ’s federal Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development ,
which regulates vehicle emissions standards Down Under , told AAP that it is
awaiting clarification from Volkswagen Australia about whether its cars here
have the same software .
A spokesman for Volkswagen Australia said the company is seeking more
information from head office .
“ We will be providing further information
once we have more details , ” he said .
Volkswagen is the world ’s largest carmaker by sales .
It already faces fines of
more than US $ 18 billion ( A$ 25 billion ) , and US authorities have reportedly
launched a further criminal investigation into the company .
The company has admitted it equipped about 482,000 cars in the US with software
that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven , and
turns them on only when it detects that the car is undergoing an emissions
test .
Vehicles affected – at least in the USA – are four - cylinder VW and Audi diesel
models built since 2008 .

Too many sizes and shapes of packages put a burden on producers and consumers — greater costs of manufacturing and carrying in stock a large number of different kinds of containers ; handling odd - size containers in transportation , storage , and the distributive system ; and merchandising confusing amounts of a product , with the result that sales are made at a disadvantage for lack of a definite basis of sale and of accurate market information .
By Olly Lambert
Director , The Tea Boy of Gaza
Twelve - year - old Mahmoud has a unique position from which to view the fighting between Palestinian factions .
He spends his day selling tea to the patients and staff at Al Shifa , the biggest hospital in the Gaza Strip .
Mahmoud is an expert at ducking and weaving between the crowds of doctors , nurses , staff and patients , all the while holding a kettle of hot , sweet tea , and hustling for a sale before it all goes cold .
But it is not just doctors and nurses that Mahmoud sells to .
Al Shifa is also full of armed militants from Gaza 's myriad rival factions and groups .
Since the withdrawal of Israeli settlers and forces last year , violence between the political factions of Fatah and Hamas - as well as between powerful rival families - has sharply escalated .
The injured fighters and their comrades inevitably find themselves face - to - face in the hospital corridors , and gun fights between them are an almost daily occurrence .
" When fighting breaks out , it 's usually over nothing , " says Mahmoud .
" They 're not really allowed to enter the building with guns , but when they 're told they can't take their weapons in , they all start shooting .
But I love all the chaos . "
Supplementary income
Mahmoud 's favourite area to sell in is the maternity ward , where he can often sell out in one visit .
After that , he has to head to the busier areas like the orthopaedic wards or the surgeries , but there he will have to contend with the heavily armed Hamas security forces , the latest addition to Shifa 's staff .
Ahmed al Mohgrbe is forced to look elsewhere to supplement his income , and spends his time off driving a taxi
Everything changed after the elections January 2006 , when Hamas won its shock election victory and took control of Al Shifa .
The international community reacted angrily to the election of a militant organisation .
Israel sealed its border with Gaza allowing no Palestinians out and no supplies in , and began withholding $ 50 m ( £ 28 m ) per month of tax revenues that would normally flow in via its banks .
The international community blocked the $ 1bn ( £ 584 m ) of aid per annum , that had been keeping Gaza alive .
As a result , no government workers have been paid for five months .
The price of basic food supplies has gone up and even fewer people have spare change to buy Mahmoud 's tea .
Like many staff at Al Shifa , staff nurse Ahmed al Mohgrbe is forced to look elsewhere to supplement his income , and spends his time off driving a taxi around Gaza city .
" We have to survive somehow , " he says .
" I have 23 years ' experience as a nurse , but I have not been paid for five months .
This is the price we pay for democracy . "
New strategies
Hamas gave weapons and uniforms to some of their supporters and declared them a new security force
After a spate of shoot - outs at Shifa , Hamas introduced a 200 - strong , heavily - armed " New Security Force " to take control of the hospital .
Under the control of one Hamas military leader , Abu Abdullah , teams of six armed men now stand guard at nearly every door , and patrols make regular tours of the grounds and car parks .
" Things have got far tougher , " says Mahmoud , sitting on the balcony of the house he shares with this six brothers and sisters , the gates of Shifa hospital just a few feet away .
" I used to get through two stacks of cups a day , now it 's more like one .
Sometimes , it 's not even half a stack . "
" I 've gradually worked out how to sneak in without them noticing us .
" If there 's a guy guarding the door , I can usually get in by slipping him a free cup of tea , but things are definitely harder . "
Expert salesman
Over the years , Mahmoud has refined a number of tricks to help him bring in sales .
Mahmoud and two of his brothers support the whole family
" Let 's say there are three guys sitting down , and some kid is trying to sell them tea .
I 'll push in and offer them all tea for nothing .
So they take it from me , but then they 'll feel bad and give me some money .
It always works . "
Mahmoud 's father , Wahel , is less pleased that his young son is becoming an expert salesman .
Three years ago his metal workshop was bombed by the Israeli Air Force on suspicion that it was manufacturing weapons for Palestinian militants .
Wahel 's livelihood was destroyed overnight .
" I want my son to have a better life than me , and instead I have to wake him up and make him work for a living .
I hate it .
But this is how we have to live .
It 's out of my hands , he has to work .
" He goes out selling to support his brothers .
I 'm telling you , life is tough . "

Find that accessory and more in this strange list .
Which one is your favorite ?
World ’s Heaviest USB Drive
Chris Spurge decided to permanentley “ embed ” his USB drive to a 16 - pound Galaxie 3000 bowling ball in fears of losing it .
One caveat : connecting it to a computer .
I can see the new trend now – flash drives stuck into Foreman grills , Karate trophies and old Pintos .
The future is a beautiful place .
While attaching this device to laptops and PCs within cramped confines probably is n’t desirable , it should definitely keep that precious data out of the washing machine , but we doubt this bad boy lands a strike anytime soon with such an extrusion

“ Humping Dog ” USB Drive
This could quite possibly be the strangest USB drive we ’ve ever come across — called the “ Humping Dog ” .
Hand - Crank LEGO USB Charger
This DIY hand - crank charger basically uses a “ LEGO motor to generate current , which is then passed through a voltage regulator , and lastly , to the usb port . ”
Instruction page .
It would make a great stocking stuffer for anyone who uses devices that charge via usb .
If you are getting it for a person who likes to build their own things , just collect all the parts put them in a ziplock , and put that in the stocking

[ edited ] ,
Dean here from DeanHunt.com
I just received your e-mail .
My first question would have to be …
Are you serious ?
I had to re-read your e-mail three times to make sure my eyes were not playing tricks on me !
Here is some more info that may help you understand my stance on this :
a ) I have never attempted to rank for the search term [ edited ] , I seem to rank fairly well for [ edited ] , which I suppose is fairly similar .
But if Google prefers my site to yours then perhaps you should be asking yourself why that is .
b ) There is nothing I can do about removing myself for that search term , nor am I going to attempt to do anything .
I have no information on my site related to [ edited ] , so I am sure that the searchers will generally visit your site instead .
c ) You can contact Google if you wish !
I doubt you will get a serious reply though .
Perhaps instead of wasting your time with e-mails like this you could work on improving your web site instead ?
Anyway , good luck with contacting google , if you do get a reply , I would love a copy of their e-mail .
I have prepared a nice little place on my wall to hang it from .
Take care ,
Dean
UPDATE : I have been getting a LOT of e-mails from people asking if they can blog about this story .
So if you want to write about this in your blog / site then feel free .
An interesting sudo feature is the ability to insult you when you type a wrong password .
It has really funny phrases , see some of them :
I ’ve seen penguins that can type better than that .
Maybe if you used more than just two fingers …
On Ubuntu , this feature comes disabled by default .
To enable it , edit /etc / sudoers file and put “ insults ” word in the end of line “ Defaults … ” .
That line will look like this :
Defaults ! lecture , tty_tickets , !fqdn , insults
That ’s it !
Just run the sudo command and type a wrong password .
A car that could save the planet �fast
Silicon Valley 's big brains think they can beat Detroit and Tokyo and save the planet - all while doing 0 to 60 faster than almost anything on the road .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Business 2.0 Magazine ) - Ian Wright has a car that blows away a Ferrari 360 Spider and a Porsche Carrera GT in drag races , and whose 0 - to - 60 acceleration time ranks it among the fastest production autos in the world .
In fact , it 's second only to the French - made Bugatti Veyron , a 1,000 - horsepower , 16 - cylinder beast that hits 60 mph half a second faster and goes for $ 1.25 million .
The key difference ?
The Bugatti gets eight miles per gallon .
Wright 's car ?
It runs off an electric battery .
Wright , a 50 - year - old entrepreneur from New Zealand , thinks his electric car , the X1 , can soon be made into a small - production roadster that car fanatics and weekend warriors will happily take home for about $ 100,000 - a quarter ton of batteries included .
He has even launched a startup , called Wrightspeed , to custom - make and sell the cars .
( For a photo gallery of what 's under the X1's hood , click here . )
But Wright is n't some quixotic loner .
He 's part of a growing cluster of engineers , startups , and investors , most of them based in Silicon Valley , that believe they can do what major automakers have failed at for decades :
Think beyond the golf cart and deliver an electric vehicle ( EV ) to the mass market .
Indeed , the race for the new consumer EV has already begun :
Just a year ago , Wright was working for his Woodside neighbor Martin Eberhard , co-founder of Tesla Motors , a startup that has 70 employees and a major investment from PayPal founder Elon Musk , which is building a mass - market rival to the X1 .
Wright left , believing he had an even better idea .
Beyond that , startups are forming to equip new " plug - in " hybrids that run almost entirely on their electric motors .
And around the country , a handful of other exotic EVs are showing up on the road -- including George Clooney 's new ride , a $ 108,000 commuter coupe that 's just 3 feet wide .
The more that cars become technology platforms , the more the future plays into the hands of people like Wright and Eberhard .
" Automakers can't do this , " Eberhard says .
" If you drill into the complexity of an electric car , it 's not the motor , it 's the electronics and battery system , which car companies are n't good at . "
Adds Musk , " The time is right for a new American car company , and the time is right for electric vehicles , because of advances in batteries and electronics .
Where 's the skill set for that ?
In the Valley , not Detroit . "
Wright 's garage - born heroics are , in many respects , long overdue .
After all , electric cars predated the gasoline combustion engine .
But they soon headed for museums , replaced by gas engines .
A mid-1990s wave of all - electric cars was short - lived -- GM ( Research ) spent more than $ 1 billion to introduce a short - lived electric vehicle -- and were soon replaced by Toyota 's hot - selling hybrid gas-electric Prius .
So how do you build the EV of the future on a six - figure budget when GM could n't do it with more than $ 1 billion ?
For starters , you get all the basic parts off the shelf , starting with a chassis .
Wright found one he liked in the Ariel Atom , a blazing - fast custom British roadster .
By itself , all the hardware in the X1 is nothing new .
The X1's real secret is how Wright engineers it all to keep the car in optimum race mode whenever you hit the accelerator .
Proving grounds
Last November , Wright towed the X1 to a racetrack near Sacramento to see how his prototype would do against a Ferrari and a Porsche .
On paper , a win seemed guaranteed .
But he had n't yet run the car full out .
In the first matchup , the X1 crushed the Ferrari in an eighth - mile sprint and then in the quarter - mile , winning by two car lengths .
In the second race , against the $ 440,000 Porsche , the two cars were even after an eighth of a mile .
But as the Porsche driver let out the clutch in a final upshift , his tires briefly lost traction .
The X1 , blazing along in its software - controlled performance mode , beat the Porsche by half a car length .
It never occurred to me that I would lose , " says Kim Stuart , the Porsche 's driver .
" It was like a light switch .
He hit the pedal and was gone . "
So what now ?
Wright is n't sure himself .
Only 50 or so people have driven the car , and Wright has just begun to hold his hat out for potential investors .
With $ 8 million in funding , he says , he is convinced he can put a consumer version of the X1 into production that meets federal safety standards , has a 100 - mile range , and recharges in 4.5 hours .
To bring any EV to the masses , of course , will require much improved battery technology .
But a handful of startups backed by Valley VCs are claiming that big advances are just around the corner .
Menlo Park - based Li-on Cells claims that its technology will double the performance of lithium - ion batteries for about half the cost .
Thus , the X1 and the Tesla could be just the things to throw the EV race into high gear .
As battery prices drop and performance improves , the cars could come within reach of a wider audience .
And if oil prices keep climbing , more and more consumers will demand alternatives that are punchier than a Prius .

Thousands of bank workers have been warned they face disciplinary action if they fail to take an account with their employer .
The warning has gone out from bosses at the Royal Bank of Scotland , which covers NatWest , Direct Line and Churchill , to some 14,000 employees .
The move by the UK 's second largest banking group has angered the Amicus union , which said it was currently seeking legal advice on the matter .
The bank claims the requirement is standard industry procedure and was clearly explained to staff during interviews .
However , this has been denied by other leading banks .
A draft copy of the letter written by Gordon Pell , chief executive of retail markets at the bank , asked employees who had not already done so to open an RBS Group bank account .
It warned : " Failure to do so will represent a breach of group policy and I will be obliged to write directly to your line manager asking them to progress this matter to the group 's disciplinary policy . "
It told employees they should contact the group 's internal staff bank YourBank to open an account .
An Amicus spokesman , Alison Maclean , said : " We believe that the employer 's approach in this has been heavy - handed and certainly not conducive to good employee relations .
" Our helpline has been jammed with calls from angry staff .
If you work for Tesco you wo n't be disciplined for buying your groceries from Sainsbury . "
The union said most of the staff facing disciplinary action came under the RBS banner following the takeovers of Direct Line and Churchill .
They were not on contracts that required them to open RBS accounts .
Miss Maclean said : " RBS 's disproportionate and heavy - handed approach is counter - productive and bad for morale .
We are calling on the bank to reconsider its position . "
The bank insisted that staff benefit from opening a current account within the firm .
They get access to beneficial rates on mortgages and savings .
It explained that while staff who did not comply the terms of employment would face disciplinary procedures , this did not mean they would lose their jobs .
" Our staff are completely at liberty to run other accounts with other providers if they wish , once the money is theirs they can do what they like with it , " a spokesman said .
Lloyds TSB confirmed that it paid employees ' salaries into a Lloyds TSB current account .
It said it encouraged all members of staff to get to know their products and be visible advocates of the brand when they open their wallets , however , it added that it did not force staff to open an account with the company .
However , Halifax - Bank of Scotland said it did not require employees to have an account with the bank , although staff accounts are available .
A spokesman said : " We do not force anybody to have an HBOS or Halifax account , they just need a current account .
We do have specific accounts for colleagues which may have slightly better rates .
" But the option is entirely theirs , there is no pressure at all . "
For every Apple product we see on the shelves , there are dozens that never make it to production .
Sometimes , these rare gems surface on the web for us to take a look at , and ponder what might have been .
Scouring through the interweb , I ’ve compiled this list of 5 Apple products that only the most hardcore of hardcore MacAddicts have ever stumbled across .
Surprisingly , some of these products , over 10 years old , are still being speculated about in one form or another to this day .
Will we see new products based on these old prototypes ?
It ’s far more likely that anything resembling the devices listed below have been rebuilt from the ground up , but still , it ’s fun to look back on the products that did n’t make it to the mass market …
5. Apple PowerBop
PowerBop was Apple ’s first Powerbook with wireless Internet Access .
The device was tested briefly in 1993 , but the GMS based service was extremely buggy , and moving from service area to service area caused an almost constant loss of signal .
The device was ahead of its time .
4. Apple Paladin
The Apple Paladin was an attempt at an All - In - One device that was a computer , fax machine , scanner , and phone all in one .
Essentially this one device would have been the only thing a small business needed to get off the ground .
The primary display on the machine was a monotone LCD , but it also included a port to hook up a full color monitor .
Occationally these devices show up on Ebay , or even at Swapmeets , but I was unable to find out how many of these actually made it out into the market ( if anyone knows , please let me know , and I ’ll update here with the info )
3. W.A.L.T. ( Wizzy Active Lifestyle Telephone )
It is unclear why W.A.L.T. never made it into production .
The device , which admittedly , has a terrible name , was a portable screen - based Telephone right out of the Jetsons .
The device was developed with Bell South in the very early 90s , and , in addition the making phone calls , also held an address book , and could send and receive faxes ( very much like email ) .
W.A.L.T. also had some PDA functions , and featured buttons across the top of the system for accessing important features – and a stylus for navigation .
2. Apple Videophone PDA
John Sculley really wanted a videophone / PDA hybrid device , and the designers at Apple gave him one in the Apple Videophone / PDA prototype .
This device was shown at MacWorld ’ 95 , and would probably have cost $ 700,000 had it ever come out ( I kid ) .
The device was a moble Videophone that could also sync PDA functionality with the user on the other end , allowing for an exchange of data , or the ability to work interactively .
Had this thing ever seen the light of day ( and worked ) it would have been cool as hell , but alas … it was not to be .
1. Apple PenLite
The Macintosh PowerBook Duo Tablet computer was code named “ PenLite ” , and was a combination of a PowerBook Duo and … um …a Tablet PC .
The device was developed at the same time as the Newton , and Apple chose to cease development of this device to avoid market confusion by having too many Tablet - styled devices out at the same time .
Unlike the Newton Messagepad 100 , which was a PDA , the PenLite was a full blown Mac with all the bells and whistles .
The tablet also connected with all of the Powerbook Duo accessories and docks .
For further exploration of Apple Prototypes and Design Concepts , visit The Apple Museum and The Apple Collection , both sites are great resources with more prototypes and concept designs than you can shake a stick at .

Achieve OFAC Compliance .
Welcome to Instant OFAC , a project dedicated to making a FREE advanced search algorithm available to everyone , not just large corporations .
Now you can search the OFAC SDN list without the need of expensive compliance software .
What is OFAC ?
OFAC is the Office of Foreign Asset Control , part of the U.S. Department of Treasury .
OFAC is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against certain nations , entities and individuals .
OFAC maintains a listing of these restricted counter parties in a document called the " Specially Designated Nationals List " ( SDN ) .
They make this list available on their website .
Who needs to be OFAC compliant ?
Everyone .
All businesses large and small need to make an effort to ensure that they are not doing business with restricted individuals or entities .
If you are making payments , you need to have a compliance program .
Why can't I just search the list available on their website ?
You can .
The only problem is that with most text searches , like those provided in Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Word , only accommodate for exact matches .
So , if you do a search for " John Smith " , but it is listed in the SDN list as " Jon Smith " , you will not get a match .
This can be dangerous , and you could be held liable for any matches that you fail to catch .
Using Instant OFAC provides a more robust search tool .
Earlier this month , I wrote about statements by Nebraska Republican Senator Chuck Hagel that seemed to suggest that he thought President could be impeached because of his Iraq policy .
Yesterday , he appeared on ABC’s This Week and made the speculation even more explicit :
WASHINGTON â€ ” Some lawmakers who complain that President Bush is flouting Congress and the public with his Iraq policies are considering impeachment an option , a Republican senator said Sunday .
Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent critic of the war , stopped short of calling for Bush ’s impeachment .
But he made clear that some lawmakers viewed that as an option should Bush choose to push ahead despite public sentiment against the war .
“ Any president who says ‘ I do n’t care ’ or ‘ I will not respond to what the people of this country are saying about Iraq or anything else ’ or ‘ I do n’t care what the Congress does , I am going to proceed ’ â€ ” if a president really believes that , then there are â€¦ ways to deal with that , ” Hagel said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
Yes , Senator , there are ways to deal with it , but impeachment is n’t one of them .
Let ’s go over this again , the impeachment power , set forth in Article II , Section 4 is pretty clear
The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors .
Hagel , however , is not talking about impeaching Bush for high crimes , misdemenaors , treason , or bribery , he is asserting the idea that the Congress has the right to seek to remove the President from office over a policy disagreement .
Part of the reason for this is fairly clear .
Even if the Democrats Iraq
War plan , which Hagel apparently supports , is able to garner enough votes to stop a filibuster and make it through the Senate , it is clear that the President will veto it .
There is not enough support for the plan in either the House or the Senate to override the veto .
Therefore , we ’ll have stalemate and the President will be free to pursue his current Iraq policy unless Congress takes the step of cutting off funding for the war , which I submit they do not have the political courage to even try to do .
Like it or not , George Bush is President through January 20 , 2009 and the Constitution gives him the authority as Commander in Chief to carry out the Iraq War as he sees fit .
Hagel ’s comments also make it clear why the Founders limited the impeachment power the way that they did .
If Congress had the authority to attempt to remove the President , Vice - President , or Justice of the Supreme Court at will , then separation of powers would become a meaningless concept , and the President would become a mere minister serving at the pleasure of whichever party has majority control of the Legislative Branch .
That is what the Parlimentary system , which existed in England at the time the Constitution was written , is all about .
Had the Founders wanted to mimic it , they very could have .
The fact that they did n’t leads to the conclusion that they wanted co-equal branches of government for a reason .
Now , I am not a supporter of the President ’s policy in Iraq .
But he is the President and has the authority to carry it out .
If Congress wishes to change that policy , then they can use the power of the purse to do so .
If they do n’t have the political courage to do that , they need to just be quiet until the Bush Administration is over .
H/T : Captain ’s Quarters
Fighting broke out as protesters gathered in Paris , and missiles were hurled at police as they moved into the crowds to try to remove troublemakers .
Tear gas and water cannon were used to disperse the protesters , and by late evening just a small group remained .
A nationwide strike has also caused travel chaos throughout the country .
Arrest orders
The BBC's Jon Sopel in Paris said the protest had been initially mainly peaceful , but the mood had then deteriorated .
As the trouble erupted in the Place de la Republique in north - east Paris , our correspondent said his BBC crew had also come under attack , although he added the violence had remained " low - level " .
VIEWS ON THE STREETS Opponents and supporters of the CPE air their views
In pictures
The BBC's Emma Jane Kirby , also in the French capital , said that despite the trouble , the majority of protesters had been marching peacefully .
Extra riot police were deployed before the march , after a rally in Paris last week led to running battles .
French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy told them to only get tough with those he called delinquents .
" My first instruction is that you protect the demonstrators , especially the youngest ones , " he said .
" The second instruction is to arrest as many thugs , that means delinquents , as you can . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
It is very chaotic here and it's really pretty scary

Send us your comments
Mr Sarkozy himself appeared in the Place de la Republique on Tuesday evening , where he congratulated police for their work during hours of sporadic violence .
Correspondents reported a greater sense of calm there , albeit with hundreds of riot police in attendance .
And by 2130 GMT , the majority of protesters had left the square , with only a small hard core of demonstrators reported to be remaining .
Earlier the police used tear gas and water cannon to try to disperse the troublemakers .
Meanwhile workers and students in more than 100 other towns and cities were calling for the government to scrap the controversial employment contracts .
Police estimated that just over one million people had taken to the streets across the country .
They made almost 800 arrests around the country - nearly 500 of them in Paris , the National Police Chief Michel Gaudin told The Associated Press .
Unions said up to 250,000 people turned out for a march in Marseille - many more than at the previous worker - student demonstrations on 18 March - although the police put the figure at 28,000 .
In the western city of Nantes , police put the figure at 42,000 , more than double the 18 March turnout .
Le Mans , Rouen and Tours also reported increased crowds .
" We are here for our children .
We are very worried about what will happen to them , " said Philippe Decrulle , a demonstrator in Paris .
" My son is 23 , and he has no job .
That is normal in France , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Strike bites
Meanwhile a nationwide strike closed large parts of France 's transport networks .
As transport workers joined the strike , commuters were left battling with widespread disruption as large parts of the country 's rail , bus and air networks came to a halt .
Airport authorities warned of delays and cancellations and urged passengers to check with their airlines .
Protesters came out in force on the streets of Marseille
Enlarge Image
Schools , post - offices , banks , government offices and unemployment bureaux are also experiencing serious disruption .
Protesters are bitterly opposed to the First Employment Contract ( CPE ) , which allows employers to end job contracts for under - 26 s at any time during a two - year trial period without having to offer an explanation .
The government says it will encourage employers to hire young people but students fear it will erode job stability in a country where more than 20 % of 18 - to - 25 - year - olds are unemployed - more than twice the national average .
The BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Paris says these latest demonstrations are a real test of the Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin 's resolve , and it is hard to see how he can break the stalemate .
To find a solution without losing face - or ground to his main rival for the presidency , Mr Sarkozy - is proving the biggest challenge of Mr de Villepin 's political career , our correspondent adds .
Mr Sarkozy 's ruling UMP parliamentary group on Tuesday backed his proposal that the government not rush to enforce the labour laws , instead leaving the door open for further negotiations .
Earlier on Tuesday
Mr de Villepin told parliament he was open to talks on employment and possible changes to the contracts , but he did not say he would withdraw them .
The Opportunity rover was pictured at the edge of the crater
More details
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter arrived at the Red Planet in March and has only recently moved into a prime position to begin science investigations .
Its view of Victoria Crater will help US space agency researchers decide where to send Opportunity to make ground observations .
Imaged from a height of 275 km , the 2.3 m - wide rover appears as a tiny dot .
" This is a tremendous example of how our Mars missions in orbit and on the surface are designed to reinforce each other and expand our ability to explore and discover , " said Doug McCuistion , the director of Nasa 's Mars exploration programme in Washington .
Opportunity has been making its way to Victoria Crater for the past 21 Earth months - about half the length of time the robot has spent on the Red Planet .
The crater has high walls with layers of exposed rock that should reveal significant new information about the planet 's geological past .
Geologists are keen to get close to the crater 's walls
Opportunity has already found strong evidence that the rocks in its region of Mars - Meridiani Planum - were in contact with liquid water many millions of years ago .
The investigation of rocks at Victoria is expected to fill out the story still further .
The principal investigator on the rover programme , Steve Squyres , said Opportunity would spend a short time conducting a recce of the rim before any decision was made to go inside the crater .
" We are trying to find a safe place to go in and to come out .
I 'm not interested in making a suicide dive into this crater , " said Professor Squyres , who is based at Cornell University .
" With this enormous hole in the ground , we have the capability to see what lies beneath - to see down into the sub - surface of Mars , to look at a thicker stack of rocks than we are ever going to see anywhere else ; and from that see a bigger slice of Martian geologic time . "
And he added : " We have a suite of instruments on the end of the rover 's arm and I hope to take that arm and put it right up to some of those layered rocks . "
Opportunity arrived on Mars in January 2004 .
Its " twin " , the Spirit rover , continues to explore Gusev Crater on the other side of the Red Planet .
Japan ’s extreme sensitivity over its royal family was laid bare yesterday when it reacted furiously to an unauthorised biography of its most famous – and controversial – princess , entitled “ Princess Masako : Prisoner of the Chrysanthemum Throne ; the Tragic True Story of Japan ’s Crown Princess ” ( Click title to see the book on Amazon. co.jp ) .
Japan ’s Imperial Family , the oldest royal dynasty with a 2600 year history has been somewhat in danger due to the fact that even after 13 years of marriage , Princess Masako , and Crown Prince Naruhito could not bear a boy to succeed the throne .
They are both now well into their 40s , and after suffering a miscarriage in 1999 they have given birth to only one child , Aiko – a daughter ( with the help of IVF treatment ) .
Even the birth this year of a new son and heir to her sister - in - law Princess Kiko has done little to relieve Masako ’s stress – and has only postponed for a generation the vexed issue of changing the law to allow a woman to inherit the throne .
Royal protocol has denied the princess , who was educated at Oxford and Harvard , the kind of high profile role that she and her husband clearly intended .
Instead , she has been allowed on only a few official visits overseas and has endured intense pressure to produce a son to secure the line of succession .
Let ’s recap some background about the marriage of Masako and her husband , before focusing on the book .
The Crown Prince of Japan Naruhito , and Masako Owada married in 1993 in a Shinto ritual deep in the woods of the Imperial Palace , igniting fanfare similar to that of the Prince Charles and Lady Diana wedding of July 1981 .
The wedding in Tokyo , making Masako a June bride , was undoubtedly the most talked - about royal event in decades .
In earlier times Japanese royal brides came from the nobility , but Naruhito followed in the footsteps of his father , Emperor Akihito , by marrying a commoner .
Unlike the 2 step ( engagement and marriage ) process of common people , marriages in the Japanese Imperial Family follow three distinct rituals with the first being prior approval of the Imperial House Council .
Naruhito and Masako were locked in matrimony on the following schedule ( in which the bride and groom had literally no say ) :
19 January 1993 – Imperial House Council ( 皇室会議 , koshitsu kaigi ) Approval 12 April 1993 – Engagement Ceremony ( 納采の儀 , nosai no gi ) 9 June 1993 – Marriage ( first child , Aiko born in 2001 )
Now , 13 years after this somewhat speedy 4 month marriage procedure , a new book has been released by the Australian author Ben Hills .
The book , “ Princess Masako – Prisoner of the Chrysanthemum Throne ” , is an unofficial ( and unapproved ) biography of Princess Masako , and it ’s content has sparked outrage from the Japanese Kunaicho ( Imperial Household Agency ) and the Japanese Foreign Ministry , with diplomatic waves of strong dissent rolling as far as Canberra .
The Author describes the book as follows :
… a look behind the ‘ Chrysanthemum Curtain ’ to the arcane world of the Japanese royal family , where vestal virgins still preside at Shinto rites and the position of royal stool inspector was only recently abolished .
Through Masako ’s and Naruhito ’s love affair , it opens a window on Japanese attitudes towards parenting , mental illness , the role of women , and the place of the monarchy .
Princess Masako asks and answers many questions which can never be raised in Japan because of the reverence in which the Emperor and his family are held .
What is the real reason Masako had to abandon her studies at Oxford ?
Why did the Kunaicho , the powerful bureaucrats of the Imperial Household Agency , oppose the marriage ?
Who are the shadowy figures that persuaded Masako to give up her career and marry the prince ?
Why is there such secrecy over the couple ’s use of IVF , and Masako ’s mental illness ?
What does the future hold for the star - crossed couple – and for the survival of the monarchy .
But above all it is the story of a romance gone wrong , which neither will survive undamaged , but from which neither seems capable of escaping …
One must draw a comparison here with the Prince Charles and Lady Diana saga .
You may recall that in 1992 , 11 years after their marriage , they faced a very similar situation when a book by Andrew Morton titled “ Diana : Her True Story in Her Own Words ” was published .
The controversial book about the Princess of Wales portrays her as a deeply depressed and unstable character with suicidal tendencies .
Buckingham Palace would not comment on any specific claims , and said Princess Diana did not co-operate with the biography in any way whatsoever .
The author Andrew Morton however , maintained the book ’s accuracy , and when promoting the book just one week after an event where Diana was filmed breaking down in tears in Liverpool , he claimed that “ The tears that she has shed in public in Liverpool are nothing compared to the tears she has shed over the last year .
I ca n’t emphasise strongly enough the volatility of the situation inside Kensington Palace ” .
The unofficial biography alleges that Princess Diana tried to kill herself on as many as five occasions during the 1980s .
Well , I am not sure about the suicide attempts , but it seems that the social pressure and stress of being a royal princess knows no borders .
One can not help but think that we are seeing the Oriental version of Lady Diana in Princess Masako ’s unfolding story , especially in light of Ben Hills ’ new book .
Inevitably , the strain of it all has had a terrible impact on Masako , who has not been able to perform any of her royal duties for since December 2003 .
According to the book , she has been afflicted with painful shingles , and is suffering from deep depression – although the palace will not admit it .
There has also apparently been talk of divorce , though no royal has ever divorced in Japan ’s history .
Also , although highly unlikely , some even say the Crown Prince is considering renouncing his claim to the throne for his wife , Masako – leaving the crown to his brother .
With the Emperor himself ailing with cancer , the imperial system in Japan seems to be in deep crisis .
The book is not in stores in Japan yet .
In November , the Japanese publisher Kodansha announced that it would publish the book ( in Japanese ) in Japan .
However , after the bullying from the government they announced last Friday ( Feb 16 ) that they would not be going ahead with publication .
Last Tuesday , ( Feb 13 ) the Japanese Foreign Ministry called a press conference in Tokyo to denounce the book as “ unfounded and highly contemptuous descriptions ” of the imperial family .
They made no specific claims of factual inaccuracy , and contented themselves with deeply inscrutable statements such as saying that the book contains “.. disrespectful descriptions , distortions of facts , and judgmental assertions with audacious conjectures and coarse logic ” .
In protest letters sent to the author and the publisher in Australia , Random House , the ministry demanded an apology and “ prompt measures to remedy the situation . ”
“ Under the Japanese Constitution , the emperor is a symbol of the state and of the unity of the people , ” the letter said .
“ The government of Japan can by no means ignore contempt for his majesty the emperor who holds this constitutional status , nor contempt for other members of the imperial family as well as the people of Japan ” , it went on to say .
The rare intervention by the Japanese government was also delivered from their embassy in Canberra , directly aimed at the author , publisher , and calling for the Australian Government to take immediate action .
Ben Hills , the Australian author and a former Tokyo based journalist , refused to apologise yesterday and accused Japan of attempting to censor his book .
The Kunaicho ( Imperial Household Agency ) itself has also written a letter ( dated Feb 2007 ) to the author of the book , publishing it ( HERE ) on the Internet – not such a traditional form of communication for the Kunaicho I must say .
The letter clearly expresses dissent and distaste for the book , but surprisingly does not seem to deny any of the facts presented about Masako or the Crown Prince at all , focusing rather on allegedly erroneous content surrounding the current Emperor and Empress :
I would like to focus on a passage in the book which is directly related to them and totally wrong from a factual point of view .
In Chapter seven of this book , you write that , “ The Emperor is said to have more than 1000 engagements a year , though all are undemanding formal appearances at uncontroversial events . ”
The letter goes on to outline all the important engagements that the Emperor and Empress of Japan have been involved in , completely missing the chance to rebut and dismiss the main point of Hills ’ book , i.e .
Masako , and how she has been severely mistreated by the Agency , driving her into a recluse life of sickness , depression and it seems , infertility .
If there were untruths in what Hills has written , surely the Kunaicho ’s arguments could have been stronger , and more to the point than the waffling b/s they have presented to the world in this letter .
Japan has long covered its Imperial family in a protective veil , misconstruing it as the perfect family , a role model for all Japanese subjects , while hiding their personal problems and concerns under the carpet .
Japanese journalists traditionally report the imperial family in a reverential way .
Honorifics and especially polite terms are used whenever writing about them .
Stippy.com however , is not Japanese journalism .
The fact that our tax money is used to support the bureaucracy surrounding such a ancient form of keeping the country united bothers me greatly , and I certainly am uncomfortable with the unearned and blind respect that the Japanese media and people pay the pudgy Emperor and his family ( the same goes for royals in any other country for that matter ! ) .
In this perspective at least , Ben Hills ’ book is doing well to shake the foundations of the Kunaicho , asking what value ( apart from an empty warm and fuzzy feeling ) the Japanese Royals really are giving back to the people of Japan .
Leave your thoughts and comments on the book itself in the section below , or tell us what you think of the Japanese Imperial Family in general , including corrections to anything facts that I have wrong .
( My opinion of the Royal Family as a bottomless hole for our tax money will not change though , so rather than slandering me for it , just let us know yours ! )

Flood victims were left virtually to their own devices for days
The only difference between the chaos of New Orleans and a Third World disaster operation , he said , was that a foreign dictator would have responded better .
It has been a profoundly shocking experience for many across this vast country who , for the large part , believe the home - spun myth about the invulnerability of the American Dream .
The party in power in Washington is always happy to convey the impression of 50 states moving forward together in social and economic harmony towards a bigger and better America .
That is what presidential campaigning is all about .
But what the devastating consequences of Katrina have shown - along with the response to it - is that for too long now , the fabric of this complex and overstretched country , especially in states like Louisiana and Mississippi , has been neglected and ignored .
Borrowed time
The fitting metaphors relating to the New Orleans debacle are almost too numerous to mention .
First there was an extraordinary complacency , mixed together with what seemed like over - reaction , before the storm .
The city 's hurricane shelters grew increasingly filthy and crime - ridden
A genuinely heroic mayor orders a total evacuation of the city the day before Katrina arrives , knowing that for decades now , New Orleans has been living on borrowed time .
The National Guard and federal emergency personnel stay tucked up at home .
The havoc of Katrina had been predicted countless times on a local and federal level - even to the point where it was acknowledged that tens of thousands of the poorest residents would not be able to leave the city in advance .
No official plan was ever put in place for them .
Abandoned to the elements
The famous levees that were breached could have been strengthened and raised at what now seems like a trifling cost of a few million dollars .
The Bush administration , together with Congress , cut the budgets for flood protection and army engineers , while local politicians failed to generate any enthusiasm for local tax increases .
Too often in the so - called " New South " , they still look positively 19th Century
New Orleans partied - on just hoping for the best , abandoned by anyone in national authority who could have put the money into really protecting the city .
Meanwhile , the poorest were similarly abandoned , as the horrifying images and stories from the Superdome and Convention Center prove .
The truth was simple and apparent to all .
If journalists were there with cameras beaming the suffering live across America , where were the officers and troops ?
The neglect that meant it took five days to get water , food , and medical care to thousands of mainly orderly African - American citizens desperately sheltering in huge downtown buildings of their native city , has been going on historically , for as long as the inadequate levees have been there .
Divided city
I should make a confession at this point : I have been to New Orleans on assignment three times in as many years , and I was smitten by the Big Easy , with its unique charms and temperament .
But behind the elegant intoxicants of the French Quarter , it was clearly a city grotesquely divided on several levels .
It has twice the national average poverty rate .
The government approach to such deprivation looked more like thoughtless containment than anything else .
It will be many weeks before the flood waters are cleared
The nightly shootings and drugs - related homicides of recent years pointed to a small but vicious culture of largely black - on - black crime that everyone knew existed , but no - one seemed to have any real answers for .
Again , no - one wanted to pick up the bill or deal with the realities of race relations in the 21st Century .
Too often in the so - called " New South " , they still look positively 19th Century .
" Shoot the looters " is good rhetoric , but no lasting solution .
Uneasy paradox
It is astonishing to me that so many Americans seem shocked by the existence of such concentrated poverty and social neglect in their own country .
In the workout room of the condo where I am currently staying in the affluent LA neighbourhood of Santa Monica , an executive and his personal trainer ignored the anguished television reports blaring above their heads on Friday evening .
Either they did not care , or it was somehow too painful to discuss .
When President Bush told " Good Morning America " on Thursday morning that nobody could have " anticipated " the breach of the New Orleans levees , it pointed to not only a remote leader in denial , but a whole political class .
The uneasy paradox which so many live with in this country - of being first - and - foremost rugged individuals , out to plunder what they can and paying as little tax as they can get away with , while at the same time believing that America is a robust , model society - has reached a crisis point this week .
Will there be real investment , or just more buck - passing between federal agencies and states ?
The country has to choose whether it wants to rebuild the levees and destroyed communities , with no expense spared for the future - or once again brush off that responsibility , and blame the other guy .
Do you agree or disagree , send your comments on the story using the form below .
It disgusts me to think that my ' brother and sisters ' in New Orleans have been ignored and discarded by the US government like so much trash that no line the streets of this once beautiful city .
I am embarrassed it took so long to get help to people only eight hours away .
Lara Tosh , Nashville , Tennessee
I do n't blame anyone for the tragedies of nature
David Augustine , Mendham , NJ
I completely agree with the article .
What has been going through my mind this past week is that the crisis did seem political , racial , and I am disgusted .
It 's unconscionable that after an entire coastline was just destroyed , while New Orleans began to drown , the President was making fundraising speeches in California on Tuesday .
As president , elected to serve the people of this country , why did n't he stop everything and call out the help those people needed immediately ?
Lori Thoma , Reno , Nevada
My sympathy to fellow Americans sufferings from this natural disaster .
The most advanced nation on earth and unable to response soon .
A political disaster too .
Mr Bush : time to wake up and cut red tape .
More action and less talk .
D Sharma , Antwerp , Belgium
Shame on anyone that makes this tragedy political , socio-economic or racial .
The US Government , both Federal and local ; and individuals , failed both before and after the storm to react in a timely organised manner .
We need to fix it and we need to help the survivors , but we are not going to build a wall around coastal US to prevent a category five storm surge from causing damage .
And in the land of opportunity and personal responsibility the individual is ultimately accountable .
Robert Buckley , Decatur , USA
This disaster did not have to happen
Howard Goldsmith , New York
I agree the article , but what most people from other countries do n't realise about America is that for all the great things we do we do some really horrendous ones too .
Most Americans do n't realize that we have a lower class , despite it being so blatantly obvious .
The tragedy of this Gulf State disaster is that it is has exposed just how poor those states are and how much they 've needed help for decades .
Riley Gelwicks , Gainesville ( Florida ) , USA
As a proud southern American your article is so far from the truth I do n't even now where to begin .
What I read is a liberal , European , elitist view of this absolute tragedy .
Americans will help each other regardless of colour or social level .
As for aid from other nations , I for one say leave it .
We can and will rebuild the ravaged areas ourselves .
Tracie Dixon , Sand Springs , Oklahoma
The people of New Orleans deserve much better - but the responsibility begins with who they choose as their local representatives .
Representatives that can get things done - not just blame others for a lack of progress .
Local emergency planning is the responsibility of local authorities .
Their job does not end with making sure the bars are open for the tourists .
Kendall Walsh , Port Washington , NY
I agree with all the comments made in the above article .
I wonder what the response would have been if a similar problem had happened in " Miami Beach " America should ashamed
Enid Jewell , Ontario .
Canada
I think one should not only blame G W Bush for having neglected so dramatically some States of the South , but also all former Presidents of the US .
But as was said many years ago by a famous American economist : it 's hard to try to produce at the same time guns and butter .
Robert Deossart , Wervicq Sud , France
I fully agree with this article .
For the self proclaimed " most advanced nation on earth " to build a city below sea level , in an area subject to hurricane activity , and not make absolutely certain that the levees would not fail is massively irresponsible .
Roger Gamwell , Dubai , UAE
I think now America and Americans in general will learn to appreciate the problems of the ' developing world ' they so easily dismiss disparagingly .
Even so - called weak nations like Sri Lanka and India manage to routinely respond to natural calamities of similar and greater intensity .
It is time America shook off its complacency and check how strong are its credentials as a free , equitable and prosperous country .

BBCode Python Module
In the last few weeks I have been tinkering with a dynamic website created with Turbogears , but that 's not what this blog entry is about .
The website I have in mind is similar to a forum in that most of the content come from the users ( ca n't tell you exactly what it is just yet ) .
I wanted a way for users to post comments with simple formatting , but I did n't want to let them enter straight html - for all the problems that would cause .
No doubt , some wise - guy would figure out that he could enter the < blink > tag !
So I decided to implement something like BBCode , which I dubbed ' Post Markup ' .
But once I came close to finishing Post Markup , I realised it was so much like BBCode , it was BBCode ( which does n't seem to have any strict definition anyway ) .
My BBCode parser is deliberately quite relaxed , it will try to make sense of the BBCode rather than throwing errors .
It will close open tags as well as handle overlapping tags so that it always produces valid XHTML snippets .
You can download postmarkup .py here .
This code is ' politeware ' , you may use it for any purpose you want as long as you say ' thank you ' and you promise not to sue me if it breaks !
Let me know if you have any suggestions or bug - fixes .
Here 's a quick example of basic use .
import postmarkup markup = postmarkup .
PostMarkup ( ) . default_tags ( ) bbcode = " [ b]
Hello , World ! [ / b ] " print markup .
render_to_html ( bbcode )
There are comments in the module .
If you have any questions , please email or ( better ) post a comment here so I can build up documentation .
The following is a cut and paste of the test output .
It shows the basic tags ( bold , italic etc ) and more advanced tags .

This story is the dream of every science writer .
It features some of the most dramatic and rapid climate shifts in Earth ’s history , as well as tenacious scientists braving the hostile ice and snows of Greenland and Antarctica for years on end to bring home that most precious material : kilometre - long cores of ancient ice , dating back over a hundred thousand years .
Back in their labs , these women and men spend many months of seclusion on high - precision measurements , finding ingenious ways to unravel the secrets of abrupt climate change .
Quite a bit has already been written on the ice core feat ( including Richard Alley ’s commendable inside story “ The Two Mile Time Machine ” ) , and no doubt much more will be .
It was the early , pioneering ice coring efforts in Greenland in the 1980s and 90s that first revealed the abrupt climate shifts called “ Dansgaard - Oeschger events ” ( or simply DO events ) , which have fascinated and vexed climatologists ever since .
Temperatures in Greenland jumped up by more than 10 ºC within a few decades at the beginning of DO events , typically remaining warm for several centuries after .
This happened over twenty times during the last great Ice Age , between about 100,000 and 10,000 years before present .
The latest results of the EPICA team ( the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica ) are published in Nature today ( see also the News & Views by RealClimate member Eric Steig ) .
Their data from the other pole , from the Antarctic ice sheet , bring us an important step closer to nailing down the mechanism of the mysterious abrupt climate jumps in Greenland and their reverberations around the world , which can be identified in places as diverse as Chinese caves , Caribbean seafloor sediments and many others .
So what are the new data telling us ?
These data connect the Antarctic ups and downs of climate to the much greater ones of Greenland .
This is hard , as dating an ice core is a difficult art ( no pun intended ) .
If one makes an error of only 5 % in determining the age of an ice layer , for 40,000 - year - old ice that ’s an error of 2,000 years .
But to understand the mechanisms of climatic changes , one needs to know the sequence of events – for example , one needs to know whether a particular warming in Antarctica happens before , after , or at the same time as a warming in Greenland .
To get around this problem , Thomas Blunier and colleagues nearly ten years ago pioneered an ingenious method to synchronise the ice cores of Greenland and Antarctica by analysing changes in the amount of methane in air bubbles in the ice .
Changes in methane are recorded at both poles , and they should occur almost exactly in step as gases are quickly mixed through the whole atmosphere .
After the ice cores are synchronised by aligning the methane variations , the relative timing of Greenland and Antarctic temperature changes can be seen .
While Blunier and colleagues were originally able to connect only a handful of large climate events , the results published today take this method to a new level by applying it to the new , high - resolution Dronning Maud Land ice core .
The new data confirm with unprecedented precision what Blunier found : Antarctica gradually warms while Greenland is cold .
But as soon as Greenland temperatures jump up in a DO event , Antarctic temperatures start to fall ( see graph ) .
This happens for every DO event , and it is a peculiar and tell - tale pattern that is also found in model simulations of these events ( see graph ) .
Figure :
The top two panels show idealised model DO events on an arbitrary time axis ( in years ) , highlighting the phase relationship between Greenland and Antarctic temperatures : when a DO event hits Greenland , Antarctica switches from warming trend to cooling trend .
The bottom panels show the “ real thing ” , the noisy data from ice cores .
Note the expanded scale for Antarctica in both cases .
Time here runs from left to right – normal for regular folks , but somewhat unusual for the ice core experts ( my apologies to these ) .
It is ( at least in the model ) a result of a big change in northward heat transport in the Atlantic .
If the heat transport by the Atlantic thermohaline circulation suddenly increases for some reason ( we ’ll come to that ) , Greenland suddenly gets warm ( an effect amplified by receding sea ice cover of the seas near Greenland ) and Antarctica starts to cool .
Changes in Antarctica are much smaller and more gradual , as it is far from the centre of action and the vast reservoir of ocean around it acts as a heat store .
The basic physics is illustrated very nicely in a simple “ toy model ” developed by Thomas Stocker and Sigfus Johnsen .
There is still debate over what kind of ocean circulation change causes the change in heat transport .
Some argue that the Atlantic thermohaline circulation switches on and off over the cycle of DO events , or that it oscillates in strength .
Personally , I am rather fond of another idea : a latitude shift of oceanic convection .
This is what happens in our model events pictured above : during cold phases in Greenland , oceanic convection only occurs in latitudes well south of Greenland , but during a DO event convection shifts into the Greenland - Norwegian seas and warm and saline Atlantic waters push northward .
But I am biased , of course : my very first Nature paper ( 1994 ) as a young postdoc demonstrated in an idealised model the latitude - shift mechanism .
Other oceanic mechanisms may also agree with the phasing found in the data .
In any case , these data provide a good and hard constraint to test models of abrupt climate events .
But irrespective of the details : the new data from Antarctica clearly point to ocean heat transport changes as the explanation for the abrupt climate changes found in Greenland .
We are thus not talking about changes primarily in global mean temperature ( these are small in the model results shown above ) .
We are talking about what I call a climate change of the second kind : a change in how heat is moved around the climate system .
As an analogy , think of your bath tub and the types of change to the water level you can get there .
A change of the first kind would be a change in mean level , e.g. if you add water .
A change of the second kind would be the changes you get by sloshing around the water in the tub .
There are very few possibilities to change the global mean temperature , a climate change of the first kind : you have to change the global heat budget , i.e. either the incoming solar radiation , the portion that is reflected ( the Earth ’s albedo ) , or the outgoing long - wave radiation ( through the greenhouse effect ) .
Temporarily , you can also store heat in the ocean or release it , but the scope for changes in global mean temperature through this mechanism is quite limited .
Changes of the second kind are due to changes in heat transport in the atmosphere or ocean , and these can occur very fast and cause large regional change .
Think of your tub : if you want 10 cm higher water level at one end , you can achieve this by turning on the tap – but you can get there much faster by pushing some water over there with your hand , albeit temporarily and at the expense of the water level at the other end .
That kind of “ see- saw ” ( but with heat , not water ) apparently happens during DO events , as the new data confirm .
The two kinds of climate change are sometimes confounded by non-experts – e.g. , when it is claimed that DO events represent a much larger and more rapid climate change than anthropogenic global warming .
This forgets that our best understanding of DO events suggests they are changes of the second kind .
The same error is made by those who claim that the 1470 - year cycle associated with the DO events could lead to an “ unstoppable global warming ” .
A global warming of 3 or 5 ºC within a century , as we are likely causing in this century unless we change our ways , has so far not been documented in climate history .
One crucial point has been left unanswered thus far .
If DO events are due to ocean circulation changes , what triggers these ocean circulation changes ?
Some have argued the ocean circulation may oscillate internally , needing no trigger to change .
I am not convinced – the regularity of the underlying 1470 - year cycle speaks against this , and especially the fact that sometimes no events occur for several cycles , but then the sequence is resumed with the same phase as if nothing happened .
I ’d put my money on some regularly varying external factor ( perhaps the weak solar cycles , which by themselves cause only minor climate variations ) , which causes a critical oceanic threshold to be crossed and triggers events .
Sometimes it does n’t quite make the threshold ( the system is noisy , after all ) , and that ’s why some events are “ missed ” and it takes not 1,500 , but 3,000 or 4,500 years for the next one to strike .
But the field is wide open for other ideas – the cause of the 1470 - year regularity is one mystery waiting to be solved .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A new study , certain to be controversial , maintains that chimpanzees and humans split from a common ancestor just 4 million years ago -- a much shorter time than current estimates of 5 million to 7 million years ago .

The researchers compared the DNA of chimpanzees , humans and our next - closest ancestor , the gorilla , as well as orangutans .
They used a well - known type of calculation that had not been previously applied to genetics to come up with their own “ molecular clock ” estimate of when humans became uniquely human .
" Assuming orangutan divergence 18 million years ago , speciation time of human and chimpanzee is consistently around 4 million years ago , " they wrote in their study , published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Genetics , available onlinehere&doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030007#toclink4 .
“ Primate evolution is a central topic in biology and much information can be obtained from DNA sequence data , ” Dr. Asger Hobolth of North Carolina State University said in a statement .
The theory of a molecular clock is based on the premise that all DNA mutates at a certain rate .
It is not always a steady rate but it evens out over the millennia and can be used to track evolution .
Experts agree that humans split off from a common ancestor with chimpanzees several million years ago and that gorillas and orangutans split off much earlier .
But it is difficult to date precisely when , although most recent studies have put the date at somewhere around 5 million to 7 million years ago .
Hobolth and colleagues from the University of Aarhus in Denmark and the University of Oxford in Britain looked at four regions of the human , chimpanzee , and gorilla genomes .
They used a statistical technique called the hidden Markov model , developed in the 1960s and originally applied to speech recognition .
What they found directly contradicts some other recent research .
They found evidence that it took only 400,000 years for humans to become a separate species from the common chimp - human ancestor .
Just last May , David Reich of the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School ’s Department of Genetics found evidence that the split probably took 4 million years to occur , although his team put the final divergence at just 5.4 million years ago .
Reich ’s study of chimpanzee and human DNA suggested that the early ancestors of humans and the ancestors of chimpanzees may have interbred for a long time before they separated .
Experts have long known that humans and chimpanzees share much DNA , and are in fact 96 percent identical on the genetic level .
And one year ago , Soojin Yi and colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology said they found genetic evidence that chimpanzees may be more closely related to humans than to gorillas and orangutans .
Their look at the molecular clock showed humans evolved one unique trait just a million years ago -- our longer life span and our long childhood that means humans reach sexual maturity very late in life compared to other animals .
Other experts in genetics were not immediately available to comment on Hobolth ’s report .

There is no " Stefan . "
No fossil of a hominid being eaten by an allosaurus was found .
Not in New Mexico in February of 1999 .
And not anywhere else , for as long as humans have found fossils .
There is no " Professor Heinschvagel . "
We developed his name to mimic " hornswaggle . "
If you thought this story was true ...
I regret that I have to inform you that you 've been HEINSCHVAGELED !
David E. Thomas , with sons Matt and Ben , holding " Dead Pan " and various allosaur bone casts .
There is no " Pilar Pendeja . "
She was originally called " Pilar Lofo , " but some clever lads at alt .
atheism soon figured out that " Pilar Lofo " was an anagram for " April Fool . "
So , we changed her name to Pendeja , which resulted in statements of shocked outrage by some .
For example , creationist Russell Humphreys remarked " The last name of the girl ' Stefan ' mentions , ' Pilar Pendeha , ' is a Spanish obscenity .
No New Mexican family would have that last name , and there is nothing close to that last name in the Albuquerque phone book with which ' Stefan ' could have confused it . "
Humphreys correctly assumed Stefan 's story was fictitious , although he made this assessment " without seeing the pictures . "
However , " pendeja , " is only mildly " obscene , " being used by many a devout Christian with a wink when among friends .
It is a colloquialism for " jerk " or " asshole " in Spanish .
There is no " Billy the Guard . "
We wanted something that sounded like " Billy the Kid . "
There is no " New Mexico State Resources , Paleo Division . "
And there is no " Paul Hochs " as its director .
( Hochs rhymes with cloaks ... or hoax . )
However , the pranksters who developed this " cite " happen to be members of a different " NMSR , " namely the New Mexicans for Science and Reason .
Sadly , there is no " Onyate Man . "
Russ Humphreys described this nickname with these apt words : " The name ' Onyate Man , ' connected with the alleged missing feet , is just too neat a joke , at least for New Mexicans .
Four centuries ago a Spanish explorer named Onate ( pronounced as if there were a ' y ' after the ' n ' ) cut off the right ( I think ) foot of every warrior in a rebellious Pueblo tribe .
A few years ago somebody cut off the right foot of a statue of Onate .
Most Anglo and Indian New Mexicans think that was pretty funny , and there has been a steady stream of jokes and public controversy about the incident . "
Preparing Dead Pan for the role of a lifetime ...
Onyate Man !
WHY DID WE DO IT ?
Earlier this year , I debated Paul Gammill at our January 13th NMSR meeting .
Gammill presented the case for " Intelligent Design , " and I presented the case for " Evolution . "
Both of us had agreed to present hypothetical findings which could , in principle , falsify the theory each of us was defending .
One of the arguments I presented as something which would certainly call evolution into question , if it were ever discovered , would be to find the bones of a human and a dinosaur inextricably linked , as shown below .
" Onyate Man " began life as a cartoon by David E. Thomas .
Kim Johnson had the idea of making this illustration the basis of our annual April Fool 's prank .
Mark Boslough added the final touch : the name " Onyate Man . "
Let 's face it .
The typical creationist arguments against evolution are ineffectual and weak .
As German colleagues Hanz and Franz would say , the typical " Too much dust on the moon " or " Evolution violates the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics " creationist arguments are wimpy , pathetic " Girly - man " evidence .
If creationists want to impress real scientists , they must start supplying " manly - man " evidence - like Onyate Man would have been , if only he had been Real .
Pegasus , with its bizarre mix of mammalian and avian features , would also be Big Trouble for evolution .
To date , none have ever been found .
Evolution 's prediction : " None will be found .
Ever . "
Intelligent Design 's prediction : " Er ... What was the question ? "
Why are these examples of items that could disprove evolution ?
For one , both are uttterly impossible according to our current understanding of the theory .
Additionally , in " Intelligent Design , " the Designer is alleged to have the ability to create life forms by fiat .
Any one who could fill the Earth with teeming life should n't have any trouble creating allosaurs at the same time as humans , or creating a horse with huge birds ' wings .
If these situations existed , it would indeed spell trouble for evolution .
But these finds , and any others that would clearly violate our concept of evolution , are curiously missing from the world .
Apparently the Designer saw no need to include in his creation hard clues that would lead scientific thinkers to the realization that there is , in fact , an omnipotent , intelligent , and imaginative Designer out there .
CAST OF CHARACTERS
The role of ' Onyate Man ' was played by ' Dead Pan ' , a fiberglass cast of a sculpture by the late paleontologist / artist Bob Slaughter .
Stefan 's story was penned by me , David E. Thomas , with assistance from Kim Johnson and Mark Boslough .
I used the pen name " Denise Tilton " for e-mail correspondence .
I also appear as a flannel - shirted paleontologist .
Professor Heinschvagel is not really a paleontologist at the University of Heidelberg .
He was played by world - famous dinosaur sculptor ( and personal ancestor ) David A. Thomas .
Thomas had a lot of source material ( Dead Pan , allosaur bone casts , etc. ) sitting around the studio .
A 90 - minute drive to the boonies near San Ysidro , and .... voila !
Onyate Man !
Co-conspirator Kim Johnson appears in one image ( frumpy shirt , suspenders ) .
Kim 's son Jesse got the macho role of Billy the Guard , but not until after he had been filmed helping clean the " fossils . "
So we threw in the bit about him helping out .
Of course , that was lame .
The whole thing was lame .
That was the point !
The lead actress was Kim 's daughter Catie Johnson , who played several roles ( Pilar Lofo , Pilar Lopes , Pilar Folos , and Pilar Pendeja ) .
Ben and Matt Thomas took the roles of grad students .
The " cite " where the dig was staged is absolutely genuine , 100 % New Mexican Morrison formation , of Jurassic age .
It 's not far from the " seismosaurus site " mentioned on the original web " cite . "
WHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING ABOUT " ONYATE MAN "
It only took an afternoon to deploy the props and take the photographs .
Kim Johnson spent a part of a day preparing the web page .
When all was ready , on April 1 , 1999 , the " Cheshire Cat " posted a message about the new web site to the Art Bell newsgroup ( alt.fan.art - bell ) .
A search for " Darwin Disproved " brought up an article on the Glen Rose " Man- tracks " in alt.religion.christian , so I posted there as well .
Soon , it was picked up in alt .
atheism , where the anagram for " Pilar Lofo " was quickly deduced .
After its April 1 release , the response leveled off at 500 hits , until the weekend of April 24th , when the number of creationists discussing it increased dramatically .
The data provide excellent examples of sigmoidal growth curves , similar to those of bacteria placed into a rich , but bounded growth medium .
The initial growth is rapid , then levels off as niches are filled .
Stephen Jay Gould has a marvelous essay in " Ever Since Darwin " on the hypothesis that the Cambrian " Explosion " was simply the log phase of a sigmoidal growth curve of the first multi-celled organisms in a rich medium of bacteria and algae .
Several scientists and reporters tracked down ownership of the web " cite " to Kim Johnson ; several found Kim 's address , work phone number , and etc .
Sorry - no creationists managed to crack the web - site info .
Some of the initial reactions to Stefan 's tale were hilarious .
An alt . atheism correspondent wrote " It 's amazing what you can do with computer graphics nowadays ... "
( We used ordinary plastic props ! )
Another alt .atheism poster declared that the sage brush and juniper trees looked suspicious .
He wrote " I wo n't make an absolute declaration that even the location is a phony , but I 'm going to say it looks amazingly similar to Eastern Oregon / Washington and Idaho . "
To his credit , this writer also realized that the government would n't have used a Toyota .
Yet another alt .
atheism writer declared that the allosaurus bones looked too small .
( They were casts of real allosaurus bones . )
Another correspondent criticized Onyate Man's pose , saying " It looked like the ' victim ' was arching his back and holding himself up by his outstretched arms , like a playboy shot from the 60's . "
Many , many people questioned the black color and overly - shiny appearance of the bones .
Fact is , many Morrison formation dinosaur bones are quite dark and / or black .
But they 're not quite that shiny , although they could be with enough burnishing .
Next time , we 'll be sure to use flat paint , and not latex .
One apparently confused reader said it was a fake because " he refers to archelogy [ sic ] as gelogy [ sic ] . "
Perhaps he missed the whole point - it 's logical for geologists ( paleontologists ) to dig around in dinosaur strata , but it 's unusual for them to find a hominid .
Physical anthropologists study paleo hominids , but archaeologists typically study physically more modern hominids and their artifacts to try and understand how they lived ( culture ) .
Why would an archeologist be officially involved with a dinosaur - bone hunt ?
Most scientists who viewed the site deduced that it was a prank , but not always for the right reasons .
One critic perceived our intent : " It 's not even intended as a hoax , but as a spoof .
No serious hoaxer would be this obvious about it . "
But not all conclusions about prank details were correct .
One writer thought that " Pendeja " might stand for Pen ( Name ) Deja ( news ) .
Not even close !
( It really is a Spanish word . )
There were several serious creationists ' inquiries and comments .
Among them were : Karl Crawford , Professor Keith H. Wanser of the Department of Physics , California State University Fullerton , Rick Lanser of the Associates for Biblical Research , and Dr. Walt Brown , director of the Center for Scientific Creation .
Around April 24th , serious inquiries from several creationists started to trickle in .
Many were highly suspicious , but were intrigued enough to ask Denise Tilton ( the website contact ) for supporting information .
An " infamous " creationist was quoted as saying " I guess it could be faked , yet if it were true I could see the evo's trying to hush it up . "
Another told us that he has never believed the " BYM ( billion year myth ) .
The Bible indicates that man and dinosaurs were contemporaneous ( Job chapter 40 and 41 ) . "
He asked for actual photos , but mentioned his worry that " This story is so wild . "
Yet another creationist wrote to say " Thanks for bringing this intriguing matter to my attention , I do hope it will prove to be the ' real thing ' and not a fake . "
One person warned us that the general consensus over on Compuserve 's Religion forum was that Onyate Man was a complete hoax and fraud .
He even located a " Stefan Zeeh " in the paleontology department at Heidelberg , but that person was n't a grad student .
Perhaps the biggest fish we got a bite from sent " Denise " a letter expressing his interest , and also his concerns that " several things do n't make sense . "
Denise replied with a detailed letter answering his concerns , and pointed him to a website that showed a real German paleontologist named Hartmut Haubold working in New Mexico .
He thanked her , but has gotten quiet recently .
Several other creationists got the joke , and asked us not to be too hard on them in our explanation .
We only got a few letters from writers who bought the yarn completely ; several others wanted to believe it , but had reservations ( and for good reason ! )
We hope you got a good belly laugh from the " cite . "
We do hope creationists realize the " point " of Stefan 's tale .
Their moondust and 2nd Law arguments may play well in the pews , but they 're not convincing to serious earth scientists .
We want Manly - Man evidence !
We want .... Onyate Man !

The White House put extra time in to developing the strategy for rolling out the " evidence " against Iran .
From today 's NY Times report , it 's pretty clear that they worked extra hard trying to figure out who would say what , when and where .
But , does n't matter .
At the core , it 's a Bush team production -- and that automatically raises doubts :
Three weeks after promising it would show proof of Iranian meddling in Iraq , the Bush administration has laid out its evidence — and received in return a healthy dose of skepticism .
The response from Congressional and other critics speaks volumes about the current state of American credibility , four years after the intelligence controversy leading up to the Iraq war .
To pre-empt accusations that the charges against Iran were politically motivated , the administration rejected the idea of a high - level presentation , relying instead on military and intelligence officers to make its case in a background briefing in Baghdad .
Even so , critics have been quick to voice doubts .
Representative Silvestre Reyes of Texas , the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , suggested that the White House was more interested in sending a message to Tehran than in backing up serious allegations with proof .
And David Kay , who once led the hunt for illicit weapons in Iraq , said the grave situation in Iraq should have taught the Bush administration to put more of a premium on transparency when it comes to intelligence .
“ If you want to avoid the perception that you ’ve cooked the books , you come out and make the charges publicly , ” Mr. Kay said .
The Bush Administration has no credibility .
None .
No one believes them .
Bush can mock those who say he wants war with Iran , which , in fact , he literally did yesterday on CNN .
See it for yourself at Think Progress .
He can mock his critics , but they 're on to him .
No one trusts Bush anymore .
Brilliantly Bioluminescent Fish
( Image credit : wollwerth | dreamstime )
Bioluminescence , or when light is produced by an organism using a chemical reaction , most commonly occurs in sea creatures .
This dazzling glow - in - the - dark display can be used for communication , to attract prey , distract predators or even as a defense tactic .
Red -Glowing Highcrest Triplefin Fish
( Image credit : Nico Michiels et al . )
The red fluorescence of the highcrest triplefin fish , or Enneapterygius pusillus , can be seen when looking through a red filter ( right ) .
The fish appears a dull grey color under natural light .
Fluorescence occurs when light is absorbed at one wavelength and then re-emitted at another nearly immediately .
In the case of red fluorescence , highcrest triplefin fish absorb light at blue - green wavelengths and re-emit it at red .
Scientists from the University of Tübingen , Germany , discovered the glowing - red fish by chance during dives in Mangrove Bay in the Red Sea ( the salt water inlet between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula ) .
Eight - Armed Glowing Squid
( Image credit : Royal Society )
The deep - sea eight - armed squid Taningia danae is the world 's largest bioluminescent , or light - emitting , creature .
The largest known specimen of the squid can grow up to 7.5 feet long and 130 pounds , with eyes the size of large grapefruits .
The T. danae squid emits short , bright light flashes from large glowing organs at the tips of its tentacles .
Researchers from Japan's National Science Museum in Tokyo speculate that these flashes might be used to blind prey or help the squids measure the distance to their targets in the dark depths of the sea .
Clever Cookiecutter Shark
( Image credit : NOAA )
The cookie - cutter shark ( Isistius brasiliensis ) uses bioluminescence to deceitfully attract its prey .
The belly of the shark is covered with thousands of light - emitting photophores , which disguise it by making it blend in with the sunlight shining through the water 's surface when the shark is viewed from below .
However , the shark does have one unlit patch on its underside , near its throat .
To the fish below it , the patch makes the cookie - cutter shark look like a much smaller , dark fish .
When confused predators swim up to eat the small fish , the shark takes a quick bite out of them instead , using its saw - like lower teeth to leave an almost perfectly round bite mark .
Having attained a snack , the cookie - cutter shark then flees and waits for the next sucker to swim along .
The Blackdragon Fish
( Image credit : Dr. Julian Finn , Museum Victoria )
This blackdragon fish 's ( Melanostomias bartonbeani ) bioluminescence serves many useful purposes .
It has light - emitting organs arranged all along its belly that fool predators by changing the fish 's silhouette .
The luminous organs , which are also embedded in its gelatinous dermis and between its fins , light up when the fish is sending out signals to other blackdragon fish .
The fish also has bioluminescencant " flashlights " next to each eye that it can flash on while on the look - out for prey or to signal potential mates .
A glow - in - the - dark chin barbel serves to attract and lure in prey .
The blackdragon fish sure knows how to get the most out of its bioluminescence !
Mesmerizing Jellyfish
( Image credit : Edith A. Widder | Operation Deep Scope 2005 Exploration | NOAA - OE | NOAA )
A deep - sea jellyfish , the Atolla wyvillei sends out a rotating pinwheel of blue light that illuminates around the circumference of its body as a " burglar alarm . "
That is , when a predator has the jellyfish in its clutches , the Atolla wyvillei emits the bright , flashing circular light patterns in hopes of attracting an even bigger predator to attack the original predator .
If the jellyfish 's burglar alarm plan works , their original predator will let go and swim away out of fear .
Or the attacked predator may loosen their grip on the jellyfish , providing it a chance to escape .
The Anglerfish
( Image credit : Mike Luisi | Maryland Department of Natural Resources )
The anglerfish grows its own special bioluminescent bacteria to attract prey .
The scary - looking fish uses a luminescent lure packed with glowing bacteria that hangs just above and in front of its toothy face .
But it 's only the females that have this " fishing pole , " which is actually a piece of dorsal spine containing millions of glow - in - the - dark bacteria .
Yes , the anglerfish is the very same deep - sea fish that terrorized Nemo and Dory in Pixar 's " Finding Nemo . "
There are more than 200 species of anglerfish , many of which live at the bottom of the Atlantic and Antarctic oceans .
Above is one of the species , the ferocious - looking monkfish .
Lanternfish
( Image credit : Steven Haddock | lifesci.ucsb.edu/~biolum )
There are more than 240 species of Myctophids , which are also known as lanternfish or lampfish .
There are so many of them that they are thought to be some the most common deep - sea creatures .
Lanternfish mostly feed on plankton , and follow the tiny organisms ' daily migration by spending the day at the bottom of the sea and coming close to the water 's surface at night .
The lanternfish 's luminescent organs , called photophores , are pale green or blue and are located on the fish 's head , underside , and tail .
The distribution of their light organs follow a design that is species - specific , with each species lighting up in a different pattern .
This variation could be helpful for when lanternfish are attempting to attract and recognize potential mates .
DEEP THOUGHTS ….
My favorite new blogger is Mario Loyola over at The Corner .
He popped up out of nowhere a few weeks ago , and ever since then he ’s been posting tirades so aggressive and extreme that he makes guys like Michael Ledeen and Mark Levin look like a quivering clique of weak - kneed wafflers .
K- Lo must have thought the gang was going soft and needed some bucking up .
Here ’s his latest .
Today , after Jonah Goldberg wisely suggested that the Kerry flap had probably been milked for just about all it was worth , Loyola charged into the fray .
Feast on this :
Jonah , I do not agree .
Kerry drew the Dems into a blind alley by making respect for the troops the central issue of the Iraq war , and I remain convinced that we should open up with both barrels .
Every Democratic candidate should now be asked whether they think the troops are in Iraq because ( a ) they are committed to the mission and want to win or ( b ) because of their lack of economic and social opportunity back home .
The latter is plainly Kerry ’s position ?
and that of the Democratic left ?
and it has now been revealed as a position for which one has to apologize .
Therefore , most Democrats now will contradict Kerry , and answer ( a ) the troops are devoted to their mission .
Then the upper-cut .
“ Well do you still want them to win , or do you want them to withdraw in defeat ? ”
Then , they either have to take their GOP opponent ’s position on the war , or advocate surrender .
“ Respect for the troops ” is now the central issue of the Iraq war !
Democrats should be asked whether they respect the sacrifice of our troops !
That ’ll stonker ’em !
And then the coup de gr?ce : “ Do you want them to withdraw in defeat ? ”
Well , do you ?
Huh ?
Do you ?
You may be wondering where The Corner gets deep strategic thinkers like this .
Answer : from the Bush - era Pentagon , where Loyola recently served as a “ consultant for communications and policy planning …. assisted in the final preparation and roll - out of the 2005 National Defense Strategy , and worked on global energy and China issues with the policy planning staff . ”
What a surprise , eh ?
The officials said Mr. Gates and Ms. Rice expressed their concerns about Guantánamo in conversations with Mr. Bush and others , including Mr. Gonzales , beginning in January and onward .
One widely discussed alternative would move the prisoners to military brigs in the United States , where they would remain in the custody of the Pentagon and would be subject to trial under military proceedings .
There is widespread agreement , however , that moving any detainees or legal proceedings to American territory could bring significant complications .
Some administration lawyers are deeply reluctant to move terrorism suspects to American soil because it could increase their constitutional and statutory rights — and invite an explosion of civil litigation .
Guantánamo was chosen because it was an American military facility but not on American soil .
Placing the detainees in military brigs on United States territory might fend off some of those challenges .
The solution may eventually require a new act of Congress establishing legal standing for the detainees and new rules for their trial and incarceration if brought to the United States .
Mr. Gates ’s criticism of Guantánamo marks a sharply different approach than the one taken by his predecessor , Donald H. Rumsfeld .
It also demonstrated a new dynamic in the administration , in which Mr. Gates was teaming up with Ms. Rice , who often was at loggerheads with Mr. Rumsfeld .
The State Department has long been concerned about the adverse foreign - policy impact of housing prisoners at Guantánamo .
In the end , Mr. Gates did succeed in killing plans to build a $ 100 million courthouse and detention complex at Guantánamo , after he argued that the large and expensive project would leave the impression of a long - lasting American detainee operation there and that the money could be more effectively spent elsewhere by the Pentagon .
Mr. Gates approved a far more modest facility at one - tenth of the cost .

The setback in his effort to close Guantánamo was described by senior Pentagon officials as Mr. Gates ’s only significant failure during an effort in his first three months in office to shift course from policies pursued by Mr. Rumsfeld .
The outcome suggests that Mr. Bush , Mr. Cheney and Mr. Gonzales remain committed to a detention plan that has become one of the most controversial elements of the administration ’s counterterrorism program .
Fort Worth , TX – Biometric security systems like fingerprint and retinal scanning have been on the forefront of security , but a new biometric procedure promises to go even deeper .
Proberect Corporation 's new rectal scanner promises to be the end all in security .
" As has been shown in countless movies , fingerprint and retinal scans can be easily duplicated by using wax molds or by cutting off the head of an employee , but rectal scanning is almost impossible to fake , " said Alan Cummings , CEO of Proberect .
" The inside of everyone 's rectum has a unique pattern which is more complex than fingerprints and a rectum is harder to pop out than an eye so it is more secure , " said Cummings .
" After an initial ten - minute scan to map out the person 's rectum , it 's just sit and go . "
The probe vibrates and expands if it detects an invalid rectal signature .
The first adopters of the Proberect system are companies working on top secret military contracts for the US government which require the highest of security .

One of these companies , Lockheed Martin , has the Proberect system in place at its Fort Worth , Texas facility .
" It 's a simple process .
The employee lubes up the probe to increase electric conductivity then just sits down on it , " said Beverly Carlton of Lockheed Martin .
" A few employees complained , but most are used to taking it up the ass from management around here , so it was n't a big adjustment . "
Some employees complained that the process is " quite painful " while others had to be forced to get off the probe .
Managers at Lockheed have suggested employees wear miniskirts or kilts to speed up the process .

A full CO2 tank at comfortable room temp ( 70ish ) is around 900 psi , but as soon as it gets warm that pressure rises quickly .
on a 100deg day a tank left out can blow the burst disk ( 1800psi ) .
Check out the old PMI Piranah longbarrel or shortbarrel CA guns .
No internal regulator , whatever pressure went into the valve , came out of the valve .
They were the same internal design as the WGP sniper ( the original cocker before it auto - cocked ) , still the same base internal design , right down to the squash nut that holds the valve in .
My apologies about the age of the shocker , the years all run together at this point .
As for the shocker - The arena I owned and PVi had a great relationship .
We were in the same city , about 30 min from eachother .
One of my refs worked for PVi at the time .
There was a " falling out " between them and SP .
SP did not buy the patent at the time ( they may have by now ) , they split off , left Hough and company in the dust and made their own gun .
The " warrior " later renamed to the Cyber9000 was the joint venture gun.
50 prototypes were made , including a pink one for one of the owners of PVi .
Last I heard from them , the patent and parts for 100 guns was up for sale , but that was years ago .
The c9k was pretty slick .
It had all the functionality of a shocker except that it had a screen on the back with a few buttons to time it and such .
Originally it was supposed to come with a J&J stainless 18 " barrel .
It shot extremely well , as good as the shockers of the day .
I had one for a long time , but eventually parts became impossible to find .
Mt C9k is sitting in some guy 's personal paintball museum supposedly .
For what the guy paid for a non-working and non-repairable gun , I do n't care if he ran it over with his car .
My source is my memory .
Granted it may not be the best source , but being right in the thick of it with PVi and SP - the info I have came first hand .
There was a time when SP was trying to patent any electro - pneumatic device .
I do n't know how that all worked out , but we were trying to find the PVi team to contest it .
SP did not own the C9k patent at that time , we wanted to find PVi to prove SP did not come up with the idea first .
I 've been out of the industry for a number of years now , I have no idea how any of that ended .

So we were asked to sell the business .
Like all good tales , it starts with a line to catch your interest .
It contains a journey of sorts .
And as all tales must , ends in a revelation of self discovery .
Now lets begin …
About a month ago , I had my first meeting with a new client .
A sizable , well known business , which I can not name for obvious reasons .
They were very nicely directed to Spoiltchild by way of a very good recommendation from a previous client .
When they came it was not quite the meeting I was expecting .
After the usual introductions I “ Pitch ” Spoiltchild .
Who we are , how we work , previous samples etc .
They in turn explain who they are , the direction they are going and the immediate work needed .
So far so normal .
Then they begin to expand on their plans for the future , possibly expanding on their design and development end of things and asked would I lead it .
They wanted to buy Spoiltchild Design .
A bit out of the blue as you can see .
I will step in here and inject a bit of honesty about the situation .
In reality I believe they were only interested in me and not the business .
Though I am sure the award nominations would look good on their books .
They were not aware of the many irons we currently have in the fire so starting out they were probably looking for something that I and Spoiltchild are no longer .
However , they were still open to the idea and the new possibilities it would mean for them .
We were very open to the idea of a nice lump sum , a steady income , access to a sales force of almost 40 and an established back office support .
You can see why we might be interested .
( With a baby almost due there is a little extra pressure . )
They were in a rush to get something set up , but after 3 years building the business I was not about to rush into anything that I was not 100 % sure of .
The tricky bit was when it came to deciding a price .
And this is where we got the most value out of the proceedings .
I was reluctant to give a price until I had thought fully about it .
Originally I had a price in mind and I thought it sounded pretty good .
It would make nice inroads to finally buying a house .
But I thought about it and realised , hang on , if you add that , and this , we are worth more then that .
Each and every time I though about what the business was worth to me , it went up .
It was time for some serious financial advice .
This is not as easy to find as you might think .
Many accountants do not have experience in this area .
I did eventually find a good one by the name of Gail McEvoy of the Drogheda Tax Clinic through a mutual business contact .
The offer of being bought made me sit down and take stock of everything .
Where we are , where we have been and very important when selling , where we think we will go .
It was great but there was a problem .
Great in that I had for the first time in ages , a full handle of the business , where we are now and a good solid plan for the future .
I developed a detailed spreadsheet covering the next 18 months .
Every little incoming and outgoing we have now and a really conservative estimate of what we hope to earn .
The future looked Orange .
The NOW however does not look so good .
Donât get me wrong , we are currently covering all costs but we are operating at a reduced capacity in bootstrapping mode .
Which basically means that all money coming in now is going out to fund the development of Weddings By Adam , Toddle , Sheepstealer Clothing and a few other things .
So according to our current books we are not worth much .
However according to the passion I have for what we are building and my belief in what we can achieve we will be worth A LOT !
So back to the experts .
Gail brought in a brilliant woman , another business advisor with specific experience in this area and a history working with Enterprise Ireland .
She had some interesting things to say about Enterprise Ireland and Banks approach to business but that is for another post .
What was interesting was , this woman did not want to meet with me originally .
Her response was along the lines of â Not another feckinâ web design company .
They donât make money !â .
After seeing what we are working on though she became a lot more interested and agreed to meet .
To price a business you can look at the current books , past growth , current plans and projection for the next 3 - 5 years .
A buy out might consist of 50 % up front , 50 % in two years if projections are met and perhaps a % of all future earnings .
There are a million other details but they come after these numbers .
Or you can simplify it .
You are worth what someone is willing to pay !
Looking at the books and future plans actually written down in paper invigorated me .
I had been feeling a little worn out lately .
There has been a fair amount of struggle and hardship .
A baby coming along forces you to evaluate things in a different way .
However seeing everything that we achieved and all that could be achieved in black and white spurred me on ..
I couldnât sell for what we are , according to the bookâs worth .
I had to sell for what I believed we are worth .
Otherwise I am sure that in 2 - 3 years time I would be kicking myself .
I knew it was going to be more money then the company were willing to pay .
I gave them a price of â ¬1.5 million .
They said no .
I feel great !
We are going places and we are steering .
The big discovery was seeing the business through anothers eyes .
It seems that Spoiltchild is not a Web Design company .
Which surprised me !
But you know what , she is right .
And it makes us a whole lot more valuable .
At first , Ted Breaux dismissed the urgent warnings on TV and radio .
He even ignored the sirens that started blaring Saturday afternoon .
" The last two times they evacuated the city , I stayed , " says Breaux , 39 , a chemist and environmental microbiologist .
But when he woke up on Sunday , August 28 , the hurricane had become a Category 5 and was still bearing down on New Orleans .
He decided it was time to get out of his house on the floodplain just south of Lake Pontchartrain .
He packed his Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution with all the essentials : clothes , toiletries , a laptop , some World War II rifles , ammo , and $ 15,000 worth of absinthe .
It took Breaux six hours to go 20 miles , and a full day to reach refuge in Huntsville , Alabama .
He spent the next week watching Fox News , looking at aerial photos of New Orleans on his laptop , wondering if his friends had made it out , and cursing himself for not remembering to grab his original 1908 copy of Aux Pays d'Absinthe .
Raised in New Orleans , a city once dubbed the Absinthe Capital of the World , Breaux has long been fascinated with the drink .
Absinthe is a 140 - proof green liqueur made from herbs like fennel , anise , and the exceptionally bitter leaves of Artemisia absinthium .
That last ingredient , also known as wormwood , gives the drink its name - and its sinister reputation .
For a century , absinthe has been demonized and outlawed , based on the belief that it leads to absinthism - far worse than mere alcoholism .
Drinking it supposedly causes epilepsy and " criminal dementia . "
Breaux has made understanding the drink his life 's work .
He has pored over hundred - year - old texts , few of them in English .
He has corresponded with other amateur liquor historians .
The more he 's learned , the more he 's felt compelled to use his knowledge of chemistry to crack the absinthe code , figure out exactly what 's in it , puncture the myths surrounding it - and maybe even drink a glass or two .
Dressed in a black muscle T - shirt , blue jeans , and a Dolce & Gabbana belt , Breaux looks as if he'd be more at home on Bourbon Street than in a research lab .
It 's a humid summer morning in July , about a month before Hurricane Katrina will strike , and he 's showing me around Environmental Analytical Solutions Inc. , a chemical testing facility among the warehouses and body shops near Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport .
On the outside , EASI is classic New Orleans : red brick , white pillars .
But inside it 's more like a set from War Games : dot matrix printers , ancient PCs , and nine Hewlett - Packard gas chromatography - mass spectrometer machines attached to large blue tanks of helium and hydrogen .
This is where Breaux does his lab work , testing water samples for pollution and pesticides .
In his downtime , he studies absinthe here .
Using the GCMS apparatus , he 's able to break the liqueur down into its component molecules .
" It 's like forensics , " Breaux says , gesturing toward the machines .
" Give me one microliter of absinthe and I know exactly what it 's going to taste like . "
Breaux explains how the testing works .
He takes a bottle of the liqueur , inserts a syringe through the cork ( absinthe oxidizes like wine once the bottle is open ) , and extracts a few milliliters .
He transfers the sample into a vial , which is lifted by a robotic arm into the gas chromatography tower .
There it is separated into its components .
Then the mass spectrometer identifies them and measures their relative quantities .
One of the ingredients is thujone , a compound in wormwood that is toxic if it 's ingested , capable of causing violent seizures and kidney failure .
Breaux hands me a bottle of pure liquid thujone .
" Take a whiff , " he says with an evil grin .
I recoil at the odor - it 's like menthol laced with napalm .
This is the noxious chemical compound responsible for absinthe 's bad reputation .
The question that 's been debated for years is , Just how much thujone is there in absinthe ?
Absinthe was first distilled in 1792 in Switzerland , where it was marketed as a medicinal elixir , a cure for stomach ailments .
High concentrations of chlorophyll gave it a rich olive color .
In the 19th century , people began turning to the minty drink less for pains of the stomach than for pains of the soul .
Absinthe came to be associated with artists and Moulin Rouge bohemians .
Baudelaire , Rimbaud , Van Gogh , and Picasso were devotees .
Toulouse - Lautrec carried some in a hollowed - out cane .
Oscar Wilde wrote , " What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset ? "
Soon absinthe was the social lubricant of choice for a broad swath of Europeans - artists and otherwise .
In 1874 , the French sipped 700,000 liters of the stuff ; by the turn of the century , consumption had shot up to 36 million liters , driven in part by a phylloxera infestation that had devastated the wine - grape harvest .
By the early 20th century , absinthe was becoming popular in America .
It found a natural reception in New Orleans , where the bon temps were already rolling .
Breaux 's own great - grandparents were known to enjoy an occasional glass .
But the drink was drawing fire for its thujone content .
" It is truly madness in a bottle , and no habitual drinker can claim that he will not become a criminal , " declared one politician .
The anti-absinthe fervor climaxed in 1905 , when Swiss farmer Jean Lanfray shot his pregnant wife and two daughters after downing two glasses .
( Overlooked was what else Lanfray consumed that day : créme de menthe , cognac , seven glasses of wine , coffee with brandy , and another liter of wine . )
By the end of World War I , the " green menace " was made illegal everywhere in western Europe except Spain .
No reputable distillery still made it .
The son of a NASA engineer , Breaux was always interested in how things work .
At 13 , he snuck out at night and rode his bike to the University of Louisiana campus to hack into its mainframe .
" I 'd snoop in people 's records and steal the source code for videogames , " he says .
When he was 14 , he figured out how to hot - wire bulldozers left overnight at construction sites ; he and his friends would stage races .
Later , while majoring in microbiology in Lafayette , Breaux tended bar and developed an interest in the chemistry of liquor .
" Why is this tequila better than that one ?
Because it 's aged a certain length of time or made with a higher concentration of a certain plant , " he says .
" I could see the science in it . "
Breaux became a connoisseur at a young age .
He was shelling out a hundred bucks for cognac and mystifying his college buddies by bringing Martell Cordon Bleu to parties .
So it 's no wonder that , a decade later , immersed in the history and makeup of absinthe , he was eager to taste the stuff .
But it was nearly impossible to find .
He had to content himself with its paraphernalia .
While walking through the French Quarter one Saturday morning a decade ago , he spotted an absinthe spoon in the window of an antique shop .
The slotted , sieve - like device was an essential part of the ritual of preparing the drink :
You placed a sugar cube on the spoon and slowly poured cold water through it to dilute the strong liqueur .
Breaux started stockpiling absinthe accessories , but this proved to be a frustrating tease .
" It was like having a pipe but nothing to smoke . "
So Breaux decided to make some himself .
He found a French - language history book with " pre-ban protocols , " a vague description of how absinthe was made back before it was outlawed .
Armed with the protocols , he prepared a batch in the lab .
The result ?
" Not very good , " he concedes .
" I could n't imagine that being the most popular liqueur in France . "
He got his chance to taste the real thing in 1996 , when a friend spotted a bottle marked " old French liquor " at an estate sale .
They were asking $ 300 , and Breaux , seeing it was a vintage Spanish Pernod Tarragona absinthe , immediately wrote a check .
When he got it to his lab , he plunged a syringe through the cork , extracted one precious sip , and downed it .
" It had a honeyed texture , distinct herbal and floral notes , and a gentle roundness uncharacteristic of such a strong liquor , " he says .
" Those protocols were crap . "
Breaux was n't the only one rediscovering the long - banned beverage .
In Europe , food regulations adopted by the EU in 1988 had neglected to mention absinthe , and when they superseded national laws , the drink was effectively re-legalized .
New distilleries were popping up all over Europe , selling what Breaux dismisses as " mouthwash and vodka in a bottle , with some aromatherapy oil . "
Absinthe had disappeared so completely for so long that no one knew how to make it anymore .
Including Breaux , who continued trying to reverse engineer it in his lab .
The new absinthes became popular among hipsters , just as the drink had been 125 years before .
But now the presence of thujone was a selling point .
Marilyn Manson boasted of recording an album while " on " absinthe .
Johnny Depp compared its effects to marijuana .
" Drink too much , " he said , " and you suddenly realize why Van Gogh cut off his ear . "
This was n't just idle celebrity conjecture .
In a 1989 Scientific American article , an American biochemist named Wilfred Arnold hypothesized that Van Gogh 's insanity ( acute intermittent porphyria , he speculated ) was caused by the thujone in absinthe .
Based on the description of raw materials used to make the liqueur , Arnold calculated that the thujone content was a dangerous 250 parts per million .
" I would advise not drinking it , " he says .
Breaux rejects Arnold 's methodology .
" He did n't take the effects of the distillation process into account , " Breaux says .
" He made a WAG - a wild - assed guess . "
Breaux wanted to settle the thujone question once and for all .
And he was uniquely positioned to do so .
" Back when the original was around , they did n't have any decent analytical chemistry .
And when Arnold performed his research , he did n't have any samples of the original liqueur .
I have both , " he says .
At the EASI lab , Breaux ran tests on the pre-ban absinthe samples , as well as on samples spiked with thujone ( from the very bottle I had sniffed ) .
This allowed him to isolate the toxic compound .
He spent his free time studying the test results , and late one night in June 2000 he had his answer .
" I was stunned .
Everything that I had been told was complete nonsense . "
In the antique absinthes he had collected , the thujone content was an order of magnitude smaller than Arnold 's predictions .
In many instances , it was a homeopathically minuscule 5 parts per million .
Breaux went public with his findings , but not in a peer - reviewed scholarly journal .
" Here I am with just a bachelor 's in microbiology .
I knew I could be tarred and feathered . "
Instead , he posted his test results in the discussion threads at La Fee Verte , an online gathering place for absinthe geeks .
Flame wars erupted , and Breaux cited his research to buttress his point about thujone concentrations .
The site 's moderator eventually dubbed him " elite absinthe enforcer . "
Breaux 's conclusions were vindicated in early 2005 , when a food - safety group working for the German government tested pre-ban absinthe .
Dirk Lachenmeier , who ran the study ( called " Thujone - Cause of Absinthism ? " ) concluded that absinthe is not any more harmful than other spirit drinks .
But the biggest vindication came at the Absinth des Jahres contest in 2004 , for which expert judges sampled newly distilled absinthes from all over the world .
A little - known candidate , Nouvelle - Orléans , garnered perfect scores and won a gold medal .
" Without doubt , the release of Nouvelle - Orléans was a milestone in the history of modern absinthe , " says Arthur Frayn , one of the judges .
The distiller ?
Ted Breaux .
" You can read a paragraph or two on how to make wine , but that does n't mean you 're going to make Chateau Latour , " says Breaux .
" What I 've done is , I 've made a Chateau Latour . "
In the process of proving that absinthe was n't insanity - inducing poison , he had cracked its code .
He 'd sourced the concentrations of all the herbs it contained and even traced them to their original regions of cultivation .
He knew precisely which classes of wine spirits those herbs were combined with .
Making and marketing his own brand was the next logical step .
" Nouvelle - Orléans is part vintage absinthe , part Ted Breaux , and part New Orleans flair , " he says .
Nouvelle - Orléans is just one absinthe formulation Breaux has mastered .
He also makes re-creations of pre-ban bottles .
He shows me one that he just distilled , based on an Edouard Pernod absinthe , and I 'm dying to taste it .
Breaux begins to prepare it in the traditional French manner , a process as intricate as a tea ceremony .
First he decants a couple of ounces into two widemouthed glasses specially made for the drink .
A strong licorice aroma wafts across the table .
Then he adds 5 or 6 ounces of ice - cold water , letting it trickle through a silver dripper into the glass .
" Pour it slowly , " he says .
" That 's the secret to making it taste good .
If the water 's too warm , it will taste like donkey piss . "
The drink turns milky , and a condensate floats to the top .
This is called the louche , a word that 's come to mean " disreputable . "
Breaux hands it to me and tells me there 's no need to stir away the louche or add sugar to an absinthe this fine .
I take a sip .
The flavor is subtle , dry , complex .
It makes my tongue feel a little numb .
" It 's like an herbal speedball , " he says .
" Some of the compounds are excitatory , some are sedative .
That 's the real reason artists liked it .
Drink two or three glasses and you can feel the effects of the alcohol , but your mind stays clear - you can still work . "
Breaux is on his second glass , and I 'm still finishing my first as he brings me up to speed on the latest developments in his ongoing absinthe detective story - if most of the thujone is n't present in the drink , where has it gone ?
" My initial estimation was that it 's left behind in the distillation process .
But now , I think it probably evaporates out of the Artemisia absinthium when it dries , " he says .
I take a few swallows from my second glass of the 140 - proof liquor with increasingly unsteady hands .
" Americans drink to get drunk , " observes Breaux .
" Whereas in France , getting drunk is just a consequence of sampling too much wine you really like . "
I 'm starting to feel very , very French .
In between hurricanes Katrina and Rita , Ted Breaux went back to New Orleans .
He snuck past two police checkpoints and into the Gentilly Terrace neighborhood to survey the damage to his home .
Its contents were destroyed , and it reeked of sewage and rot .
The house will need to be bulldozed .
Breaux says he wo n't rebuild on that spot , which is 8 feet below sea level .
But neither will he flee the city where his family has lived for 200 years .
" I just do n't know what 's going to happen next . "
One thing Breaux knows is that his work with absinthe will go on .
Nouvelle - Orléans is distilled in France and sold only in Europe .
Absinthe is still illegal in the US under FDA regulations .
( " But American connoisseurs are able to find it , " he says cryptically . )
Breaux supervises its production in the small Loire Valley town of Saumur , at a beautiful old distillery with ironwork by Gustave Eiffel and 125 - year - old absinthe - making equipment .
He struck a deal with the Combier family , which owns the factory .
" I said , let me distill here , and I 'll help you create new liqueurs , " Breaux says .
Later this year , the partners will release their latest innovation - a liqueur made from tobacco .
Specifically , a strong , spicy strain of tobacco called Perique , which Breaux claims is the world 's rarest commercial crop .
" It 's grown on one 15 - acre plot in south Louisiana , near Convent . "
Tobacco beverages are tricky to prepare - and even more scarce than absinthe .
After all , as Breaux explains , " nicotine is toxic if it 's ingested . "

Before Ted Breaux could re-create the original absinthe recipe , he set out to prove that it wasnét poisonous .

Breaux now makes his own absinthe using 19th - century equipment at a distillery in France .

One in three has bought a book just to look intelligent
Books are the new snobbery , according to a survey today .
Social competitiveness about which titles we read has become one of the new mass forces of the era and only middle - aged people are relatively free of it .
Driven partly by pressure from incessant literary prize shortlists , more than one in three consumers in London and the south - east admit having bought a book " solely to look intelligent " , the YouGov survey says .
It finds one in every eight young people confessing to choosing a book " simply to be seen with the latest shortlisted title " .
This herd instinct dwindles to affect only one in 20 over - 50 year - olds .
The British Airports Authority and the travel website Expedia , which jointly commissioned the poll of 2,100 people as a prelude to their own travel books prize ceremony on Tuesday , say it suggests snobbery is no longer just a matter of keeping up with the Joneses .
" The latest literary pressure is keeping up with the rest of your fellow travellers and commuters .
Bookshelf contents are fast becoming as studied and planned as outfits as a way to impress others .
Books shortlisted for prestigious literary panel awards are becoming ' de rigueur ' reading for many . "
Yet the results indicate that " reading " is a relative term .
When asked about specific titles , only one in 25 people turn out to have read the novel chosen as the best in the Booker prize 's 25 - year history , Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children - and half these had failed to finish it .
Only one in 100 had read Andrew Levy 's Small Island , picked earlier this month as the best of all Orange prize winners .
Not a single reader had yet opened this month 's Booker winner , John Banville 's The Sea .
Other strongly publicised titles endorsed by literary panels fare only slightly better .
One in 20 members of the public has read Zadie Smith 's White Teeth and only one in 25 Yann Martel 's Life of Pi or Paulo Coelho 's The Alchemist .
Some consumers hedge their bets by keeping two titles on the go - one an impressive book to show other people , the other an escapist work to enjoy .
The biggest group , more than two in every five people , follows the traditional method of choosing their reading ; relying on recommendations from close family and friends .
The sample 's own top 10 titles , a mixture of classic and popular , is : the Bible , Lord of the Rings , one or other of the Harry Potter stories , Catch - 22 , Animal Farm , The Hobbit , Pride and Prejudice , To Kill a Mockingbird , The Da Vinci Code , Wuthering Heights .
Elyas Choudhury , an Expedia director , said yesterday : " We seem to have lost sight of the fact that reading a book should be a personal , enjoyable and relaxing experience , not one dictated by social pressure . "

The message to donors :
Do n't play the field 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
As she watched a stream of A - list Hollywood actors and movie moguls crowd into the elegant ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel to mingle with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama this week , powerhouse blogger and author Arianna Huffington noted that many in the room were uneasy about being there .
" It 's like being married , and suddenly you fall in love .
You 're a good person , and a loyal person ... you have a history with the Clintons , " she said .
" And you feel like you 're cheating . "
If some Democrats have cheating on their minds , it coincides with the rise of Obama , the junior senator from Illinois , who has attracted big crowds and evidenced that elusive quality of political charisma , " something you cannot manufacture , " Huffington said .
" It is priceless -- and we have n't seen it for a long time . "
And that has posed trouble for the old love : Hillary Rodham Clinton , the New York senator , front - runner for the Democratic nomination in 2008 and the wife of former President Bill Clinton .
Hillary Clinton , who is scheduled to attend a lunch fundraiser in San Francisco today , expected in her presidential campaign to tap the same liberal Democratic sources of money in Hollywood and elsewhere that backed her husband 's successful bids for the White House .
And , Huffington and others say , the Clintons tend to play a style of politics that is all or nothing -- you 're my friend or my enemy .
Therein lies the conflict , said Huffington , looking at the crowd that wrote $ 1.3 million in checks to Obama 's campaign at an event organized by Hollywood producers David Geffen , Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks SKG -- all of whom had donated generously to Clinton 's Senate campaign as well as to Democratic Party causes .
" A lot of people here tonight have long relationships with the Clintons , " Huffington said .
" They 've been good to you .
They 've given you Kennedy Center honors .
They 've helped your kids ... but you 're suddenly in love .
What do you do ? "
Clinton attended a reception Thursday set up by her longtime supporter Ron Burkle , followed by another organized by Haim Saban , a big Democratic moneyman and Clinton donor .
In San Francisco today , she is scheduled to be the star attraction at a sold out " Make History With Hillary " $ 250 - a- head lunch at the Sheraton Palace Hotel .
The event is hosted by longtime supporter Susie Tompkins Buell and her husband , Mark Buell , developer Walter Shorenstein , the group EMILY 's List and major Democratic donors Tom Steyer and Kat Taylor .
Even as she meets with supporters , Clinton 's campaign has wrestled with a potentially damaging story that centers on her competition with Obama for attention and money .
Geffen , a former Clinton fundraiser who now backs Obama , said in an interview with columnist Maureen Dowd of the New York Times that Clinton is a divisive figure and that she and her husband lie with impunity .
Geffen , whose harsh words drew immediate condemnation from Clinton 's aides , who called on Obama to apologize , seemed to be thumbing his nose at a widely accepted premise among Democrats that messing with the powerful Clintons is unwise .
Huffington , an observer of the Hollywood and political scenes , agreed that insiders have felt uncertain about changing loyalties .
" The Clintons have made it very clear that , in the political world , no dalliances are allowed .
There is zero tolerance for that , " Huffington laughed .
" It 's sheer loyalty versus sheer fear . "
And it 's reinforced , she said by the " constant e-mails being sent out about the senator 's poll numbers , along with the implication that ' if you give any money to anybody else , you 're on the outs . '
And that when she is the nominee , and when she 's the president , she will remember . "
A veteran California Democratic campaign strategist -- speaking only on condition of anonymity because of clients he represents -- agreed .
The message from the Clinton campaign , particularly its chairman , Terry McAuliffe , has been blunt , the strategist said , " that you 're with us or against us .
This is n't one of those races that you can max out ( in contributions ) to all the candidates .
The message from Team Hillary is :
We 're ahead , we 're going to be the nominee -- and we will remember who our friends are . "
But Chris Lehane , the White House spokesman for Bill Clinton , said remembering who your true - blue friends are is a must for a political winner .
" I think history is pretty clear that those folks who are loyal to the Clintons find the loyalty is really reciprocated -- and that is one of the reasons why so many people have stuck with them for so long , " he said .
" They really do respect and appreciate it when someone is loyal , and that manifests itself in many ways ... that is what good politicians do . "
Lehane also strongly challenged the implication that the Clintons can be punitive and unforgiving -- behavior that he said does n't work for the long view in politics .
" At the end of the day , politics is about putting one vote after another ; you always want to be growing and expanding , " he said .
" People who get to this level of politics tend to have concentric circles around them . "
Nevertheless , many in the nation 's entertainment capital -- notably the politically aware on the liberal side -- love the current political drama , especially when it revolves around themes like new loves and old ties .
Singer Natalie Maines , Grammy Award - winning lead singer of the Dixie Chicks , who was at the Beverly Hilton this week , acknowledged there are elements of curiosity and political attraction in her decision to see Obama and to write him a check .
" Everyone was just getting a feel for the first time , " she said .
" You know , it 's early on .
And everyone here is obviously supporting him financially by coming to this event ... and sort of hoping he lives up to the expectations . "
Lehane advised taking such ruminations with a grain of salt .
" If Hollywood was responsible for anointing the next president , " he noted this week , " we would have had Bob Kerrey in 1992 , Bill Bradley in 2000 and Howard Dean in 2004 . "
WASHINGTON --
A smorgasbord of Washington insider details emerged during the perjury trial of I . Lewis Libby , the vice president 's former chief of staff .
No one served up spicier morsels than Cathie Martin , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former top press assistant .
Martin described the craft of media manipulation -- under oath and in blunter terms than politicians like to hear in public .
Most of the techniques were candidly described : the uses of leaks and exclusives , when to hide in anonymity , which news medium was seen as more susceptible to control , and what timing was most propitious .
Even the rating of certain journalists as friends to favor and critics to shun -- a faint echo of the enemies list drawn up in Richard Nixon 's White House more than 30 years ago .
Libby 's trial owes its very existence to a news leak , the public disclosure four summers ago of CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson 's identity .
A private brainstorm of Plame Wilson 's in 2002 brought a rain of public attacks on Cheney the next year .
Cheney was accused of suppressing intelligence and allowing President Bush to present false information about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Plame 's husband , ex-ambassador Joseph Wilson , started the attack .
Her unit at the CIA had sent him to Niger in 2002 to check a report that Iraq was buying uranium for nuclear weapons .
Cheney and the departments of State and Defense wanted to verify that .
Wilson thought he had debunked the report , but Bush mentioned it anyway in his State of the Union address in 2003 .
The story helped justify war with Iraq .
Wilson said Cheney 's questions prompted his trip and Cheney should have received his report long before Bush spoke .
Wilson 's charges first surfaced , attributed to an unnamed ex-ambassador , in Nicholas Kristof 's New York Times column .
But Martin testified she felt no urgency to set him straight because Kristof " attacked us , our administration fairly regularly . "
But by July 6 , 2003 , Wilson wrote his own account in the Times and appeared on " Meet the Press " on NBC .
After that much exposure , Cheney , Libby , and Martin spent the next week trying get out word that Cheney did not know Wilson , did not ask for the mission to Niger , never got Wilson 's report , and only learned about the trip from news stories in 2003 .
Cheney personally dictated these points to Martin .
She e-mailed them to the White House press secretary for relay to reporters .
When the story did not die , Martin found herself in a bind because Cheney 's office was known for disclosing so little .
" Often the press stopped calling our office , " Martin testified .
" At this point , they were n't calling me asking me for comment . "
So she had to call National Security Council and CIA press officers to learn which reporters were still working on stories .
Once Martin got names , Cheney ordered his right - hand man , Libby , rather than lowly press officers , to call -- a signal of the topic 's importance .
Top levels of the Bush administration decided CIA Director George Tenet would issue a statement taking the blame for Bush mentioning the Niger story .
Cheney and Libby worried Tenet would not go far enough to distance the vice president from the affair .
Libby asked Martin to map a strategy in case Tenet fell short .
A Harvard law school graduate , Martin had succeeded Mary Matalin as Cheney 's public affairs assistant .
Matalin had brought Martin to Cheney 's office as her deputy and trained her .
Martin offered these options :
Put Cheney on " Meet the Press . "
Leak an exclusive version to a selected reporter or the weekly news magazines .
Have National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice or Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld hold a news conference .
Persuade a third party or columnist to write an opinion piece that would appear in newspapers on the op - ed page .
Not only did Tenet leave unanswered questions about Cheney , his remarks came out late on a Friday , the government 's favorite time to deliver bad news because fewer people are paying attention .
As Martin rated their options , they considered giving an exclusive or leak to one reporter .
Because reporters are competitive , " if you give it to one reporter , they 're more likely to write the story , " Martin testified .
Plus an official can demand anonymity in return for the favor , she said .
Ultimately , Cheney crafted an on - the - record statement to be attributed to Libby by name .
Libby called Matt Cooper of Time , who had e-mailed questions to Martin earlier .

Almost everything that happens before you fly on a plane is not as it seems .
In order to deal with anxiety , the airlines put on a show .
They ’ve been doing it for a long , long time , and it ’s starting to show signs of wear and tear .
The show is getting old and the lies are starting to show .
Here ’s some snips from an Economist article ( hat tip to the Freaknomics blog ) :
“ GOOD morning , ladies and
gentlemen .
We are delighted to welcome you aboard Veritas Airways , the
airline that tells it like it is .
Please ensure that your seat belt is
fastened , your seat back is upright and your tray - table is stowed .
At
Veritas Airways , your safety is our first priority .
Actually , that is
not quite true : if it were , our seats would be rear - facing , like those
in military aircraft , since they are safer in the event of an emergency
landing .
But then hardly anybody would buy our tickets and we would go
bust . …
Your life - jacket can be found under your seat , but please do not
remove it now .
In fact , do not bother to look for it at all .
In the
event of a landing on water , an unprecedented miracle will have
occurred , because in the history of aviation the number of wide - bodied
aircraft that have made successful landings on water is zero .
This
aircraft is equipped with inflatable slides that detach to form life
rafts , not that it makes any difference .
Please remove high - heeled
shoes before using the slides .
We might as well add that space helmets
and anti-gravity belts should also be removed , since even to mention
the use of the slides as rafts is to enter the realm of science fiction .
Please switch off all mobile phones , since they can interfere with
the aircraft ’s navigation systems .
At least , that ’s what you ’ve always
been told .
The real reason to switch them off is because they interfere
with mobile networks on the ground , but somehow that does n’t sound
quite so good .
On most flights a few mobile phones are left on by
mistake , so if they were really dangerous we would not allow them on
board at all , if you think about it … "
The list is endless ( plastic forks , etc. ) but the lesson is subtle : every business does this .
From the standardized layout of a doctor ’s waiting room to the forms you fill out at the bank , we subject our clients and prospects to a little show that is not directly related to what we ’re doing for them .
We ’re all doing theatre .
We want our waiter to be better dressed than us , and the stockbroker ’s office to be as far away from an off track betting facility ( or a laundromat ) as possible .
Of course , the show is related to what we ’re selling .
It ’s related for the same reason that the price of a cup of coffee varies by a factor of 120 depending on who made it and where you consume it .
You do n’t have to like the fact that a show is going on , but you ’re part of it .
The most successful organizations understand this and work hard to put on a show that works .
One that does n’t get in the way of what we set out to purchase in the first place .

BRUSSELS —
The 25 - nation European Union has agreed to open groundbreaking accession talks with Turkey next year .
But the bloc insisted that talks can only begin 3 October , 2005 , if Turkey ends its long - standing diplomatic dispute with Cyprus , which it invaded three decades ago .
Final terms were agreed Friday afternoon after tough negotiations .
Cyprus , whose northern half is controlled by Turkey , joined the EU on May 1 along with nine other countries .
“ Cyprus will be sitting at the negotiating table when the EU membership talks begin , ” Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said at a press conference Thursday before the summit .
“ So the question for Turkey is , what kind of message does it send , when you do not recognise all the members sitting at the table of the club you want to join ? ” he added .
France and Austria have raised Turkish ire over the past few weeks by attempting to dilute the language on accession talks to suggest alternatives to full Turkish membership .
Both governments are faced with significant hostile public opinion towards Turkey ’s membership bid .
Speaking to journalists , Barroso said that imposing additional conditions on Turkey ’s membership was not an option .
“ We are not looking for some kind of half way house , or mid-way deal , ” he said .
“ If we start negotiations it should be with full EU membership in mind . ”
Turkey is not expected to join the EU until 2015 at the earliest .
Its path toward eventually joining the Union has already been a long one , beginning with Turkey ’s signing of an association agreement back in 1963 .
Biographer : Astronomer Carl Sagan Smoked Marijuana By Scott Andrews  21 Aug 1999 Associated Press
A second article follows , below , reflections by Keay Davidson , Sagan 's biographer , Billions and Billions of ' 60s Flashbacks

Carl Sagan , 1934 - 1996
SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -
The late astronomer and author , Carl Sagan was a secret but avid marijuana smoker , crediting it with inspiring essays and scientific insight , according to Sagan 's biographer .
Using the pseudonym " Mr. X '' , Sagan wrote about his pot smoking in an essay published in the 1971 book " Reconsidering Marijuana . ''
The book 's editor , Lester Grinspoon , recently disclosed the secret to Sagan 's biographer , Keay Davidson .
Davidson , a writer for the San Francisco Examiner , revealed the marijuana use in an article published in the newspaper 's magazine Sunday .
" Carl Sagan : A Life ' ' is due out in October .
" I find that today a single joint is enough to get me high ... in one movie theater recently I found I could get high just by inhaling the cannabis smoke which permeated the theater , '' wrote Sagan , who authored popular science books such as " Cosmos , '' " Contact , '' and " The Dragons of Eden . ' '
In the essay , Sagan said marijuana inspired some of his intellectual work .
" I can remember one occasion , taking a shower with my wife while high , in which I had an idea on the origins and invalidities of racism in terms of gaussian distribution curves , '' wrote the former Cornell University professor .
" I wrote the curves in soap on the shower wall , and went to write the idea down .
Sagan also wrote that pot enhanced his experience of food , particularly potatoes , music and sex .
Grinspoon , Sagan 's closest friend for 30 years , said Sagan 's marijuana use is evidence against the notion that marijuana makes people less ambitious .
" He was certainly highly motivated to work , to contribute , '' said Grinspoon , a psychiatry professor at Harvard University .
Grinspoon is an advocate of decriminalizing marijuana .
Ann Druyan , Sagan 's former wife , is a director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
The nonprofit group promotes legalization of marijuana .
Sagan died of pneumonia in 1996 .
He was 62 . [ TOP ] US : Billions and Billions of ' 60s Flashbacks By Keay Davidson  22 Aug 1999 , San Francisco Examiner
[ Davidson is Carl Sagan 's Biographer ]
For young people of the '60s and ' 70s , marijuana use was a rite of passage .
To the very youngest , smoking the illegal drug was the boldest way to rebel against parental and governmental authority .
But many young adults used " weed " too .
The term " groves of academe " took on a new meaning in universities , where the spiky - leaved plants grew vigorously and covertly under ultraviolet lamps in dormitory closets .
Carl > Sagan had been a regular marijuana user from the early ' 60s on .
He believed the drug enhanced his creativity and insights .
His closest friend of three decades , Harvard psychiatry professor Dr. Lester Grinspoon , a leading advocate of the decriminalization of marijuana , recalls an incident in the ' 80s when one of his California admirers mailed him , unsolicited , some unusually high - quality pot .
Grinspoon shared the joints with > Sagan and his last wife , Ann Druyan .
Afterward > Sagan said , " Lester , I know you 've only got one left , but could I have it ?
I 've got serious work to do tomorrow and I could really use it . "
Grinspoon 's 1971 book " Marihuana Reconsidered " included a long essay by an unidentified " Mr. X , " who described his happy experiences with the drug .
The essay identified Mr. X as " a professor at one of the top - ranking American universities " but disguised his identity by saying he was " in his early forties . "
In my interview with Grinspoon , he revealed that Mr. X was > Sagan ( who turned 37 the year the book was published by Harvard University Press ) .
To Grinspoon , > Sagan 's use of the drug is dramatic disproof of the popular wisdom that pot diminishes motivation : " He was certainly highly motivated to work , to contribute . "
Mr. X's essay is of interest not merely because it reveals > Sagan 's use of an illegal drug but also because it offers a glimpse of feelings he rarely shared .
Portions of the account follow , beginning with > Sagan 's drug - induced version of Plato 's myth of the cave .
It all began about ten years ago .
I had reached a considerably more relaxed period in my life - a time when I had come to feel that there was more to living than science , a time of awakening of my social consciousness and amiability , a time when I was open to new experiences .
I had become friendly with a group of people who occasionally smoked cannabis , irregularly , but with evident pleasure .
Initially I was unwilling to partake , but the apparent euphoria that cannabis produced and the fact that there was no physiological addiction to the plant eventually persuaded me to try .
My initial experiences were entirely disappointing ; there was no effect at all , and I began to entertain a variety of hypotheses about cannabis being a placebo which worked by expectation and hyperventilation rather than by chemistry .
After about five or six unsuccessful attempts , however , it happened .
I was lying on my back in a friend 's living room idly examining the pattern of shadows on the ceiling cast by a potted plant ( not cannabis ! ) .
I suddenly realized that I was examining an intricately detailed miniature Volkswagen , distinctly outlined by the shadows .
I was very skeptical at this perception , and tried to find inconsistencies between Volkswagens and what I viewed on the ceiling .
But it was all there , down to hubcaps , license plate , chrome , and even the small handle used for opening the trunk .
When I closed my eyes , I was stunned to find that there was a movie going on on the inside of my eyelids .
Flash ... a simple country scene with red farmhouse , blue sky , white clouds , yellow path meandering over green hills to the horizon .
Flash ... same scene , orange house , brown sky , red clouds , yellow path , violet fields ...
Flash ... Flash ... Flash .
The flashes came about once a heartbeat .
Each flash brought the same simple scene into view , but each time with a different set of colors ... exquisitely deep hues , and astonishingly harmonious in their juxtaposition .
Since then I have smoked occasionally and enjoyed it thoroughly ...
I smile , or sometimes even laugh out loud at the pictures on the insides of my eyelids , " Mr. X /> Sagan wrote .
Even so , he remained the astute scientific observer :
While my early perceptions were all visual , and curiously lacking in images of human beings , both of these items have changed over the intervening years ....
I test whether I 'm high by closing my eyes and looking for the flashes .
They come long before there are any alterations in my visual or other perceptions .
I would guess this is a signal - to - noise problem , the visual noise level being very low with my eyes closed ....
[ Flashed images resemble ] cartoons : just the outlines of figures , caricatures , not photographs .
I think this is simply a matter of information compression : it would be impossible to grasp the total content of an image with the information content of an ordinary photograph , say 108 [ 100 million ] bits , in the fraction of a second which a flash occupies .
" I find that today a single joint is enough to get me high .... in one movie theater recently I found I could get high just by inhaling the cannabis smoke which permeated the theater . "
Pot enhanced his pleasure in music and food .
( " A potato will have a texture , body , and taste like that of other potatoes , but much more so . " )
In sex , too : marijuana " gives an exquisite sensitivity , but on the other hand it postpones orgasm : in part by distracting me with the profusion of images passing before my eyes . "
" I find that most of the insights I achieve when high are into social issues , " he added .
" I can remember one occasion , taking a shower with my wife while high , in which I had an idea on the origins and invalidities of racism in terms of gaussian distribution curves .
It was a point obvious in a way , but rarely talked about .
I drew the curves in soap on the shower wall , and went to write the idea down .
One idea led to another , and at the end of about an hour of extremely hard work I found I had written 11 short essays on a wide range of social , political , philosophical , and human biological topics ... I have used them in university commencement addresses , public lectures , and in my books ....
" ... If I find in the morning a message from myself the night before informing me that there is a world around us which we barely sense , or that we can become one with the universe , or even that certain politicians are desperately frightened men , I may tend to disbelieve ; but when I 'm high I know about this disbelief .
And so I have a tape in which I exhort myself to take such remarks seriously .
I say " Listen closely , you sonofabitch of the morning !
This stuff is real ! "
Sagan added : " I have on a few occasions been forced to drive in heavy traffic when high .
I 've negotiated it with no difficulty at all , although I did have some thoughts about the marvelous cherry - red color of traffic lights . "

Lanier singled out Wikipedia 's anonymous contributors for criticism
Jaron Lanier , who popularised the virtual reality concept in the early 1980s , said that in rush to forge a new age of collectivism , we risk losing individual identities and dumbing down our understanding of the world .
He told BBC World Service 's Culture Shock that his main problem is that in places like the blogosphere or the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia , people no longer treat or respect each other as individuals .
" We have these designs on the internet where a whole bunch of people work together anonymously - a mob , in my opinion - in order to do something , " he said .
" They actually take on the emotional quality of a mob - they become mean , they tend to insult each other a lot more than they would if they knew who each other were .
In my opinion , this is an example of a design that is n't so great . "
Mass opinions
Lanier is among a small group leading a backlash against web 2.0 - the term coined to describe the latest internet era , in which collective ideas and participation take over from individual authorship .
Lanier led the introduction of the " virtual reality " idea in the 1980s
" Essentially they lose themselves ; they become a mob , " he added .
He coined the term " digital Maoism " in a recent article , and explained that it was not meant entirely as an insult , but a reference to the notion that individual variations between people are negative and that " somehow , the masses of people will always be right " .
And he said that there is currently an " avalanche " of new companies being funded by investors in Silicon Valley that are designed to harvest the wisdom of the collective .
He criticised in particular news aggregator sites , in which millions anonymously review a newspaper article , and a newspaper is created on the basis of the mass opinions of these people .
" The problem with that is that if you look at the result , you end up with trivial but amusing news stories as the headlines , " he said .
" For instance , a college student winning an ice cream - eating contest and getting a horrible headache and having to go to the hospital .
" But some of the more important headlines , about politics or science , are either missing or obscure .
This is a natural reaction , because of course people want to be amused , but I think the more valuable source of news brings them news that is n't always the best . "
Web 3.0
But trend expert Lauren Parijs , director of the Flanders District of Creativity in Brussels , said that while Lanier 's view an " anti- movement gaining momentum , " it remains very small .
" It 's natural - every new medium has its opposition , " he added .
And he countered that while there is a sense of individuality being lost in some areas , other sites are attempting to counter this .
" You also see a lot of initiatives springing up on the web that actually combine the two things , letting people contribute but also meet up , " he said .
" There is a networking initiative called E - Academy , and what they do is let people connect projects on the net that do the same thing , but also arrange for people to meet face to face within their community .
" So you see this blend taking place - and I think that 's where web 3.0 will head towards . "
Let ’s talk about JavaScript libraries
JavaScript ’s got a bad rap ; it ’s the language everybody loves to hate , and the one language which , more than any other in the modern web developer ’s toolbox , people will go to insane lengths to avoid writing directly ( witness Google Web Toolkit , JavaScript “ helpers ” in server - side frameworks , etc. ) .
Which is n’t fair , really , because ( as I ’ve said many a time ) most people do n’t actually hate JavaScript the language ; they hate the buggy and inconsistent implementations of JavaScript in major web browsers and , to a larger extent , the buggy and inconsistent implementations of the DOM in major browsers .
Now , for about as long as there ’s been JavaScript there have been reusable libararies for it floating around ; in the old days they were called “ DHTML libraries ” , now they ’re usually called “ JavaScript libraries ” or ( shudder ) “ AJAX libraries ” .
In general , they make writing JavaScript a whole lot easier .
No longer do you have to remember the fourteen different ways to add or remove an event listener .
No longer do you have to know where each browser stores its XMLHttpRequest object and which order you have to use to compatibly look for them .
No longer do you have to hack around Safari ’s chipmunks - on - crack animation speed .
Someone else has already run into that , figured it out and made the code available ; hallelujah !
But … there ’s always been this sense that use of a library is to be frowned upon ; that if you use a library you ’re somehow not a “ real JavaScript programmer ” .
And some fairly big names in the JavaScript world have gone on record actively discouraging the use of libraries .
Apparently you should only use a library if you know enough about JavaScript and its various implementations to write the library yourself , in which case you do n’t need the library .
Anyone who does n’t have that level of knowledge is like a child playing with a gun , they tell us ( though Stuart Langridge has retreated somewhat from that extreme position , and seems to be ever - so - slowly dragging Peter - Paul Koch along with him ) .
So let ’s look at the problem ( or lack thereof ) of modern JavaScript libraries , and see if we ca n’t come to some useful conclusions .
Like my previous entries on server - side web frameworks , this will be a series ; in this installment we ’ll look at common objections to library use in JavaScript , and some responses to those objections .
The field of battle
A number of objections to the various popular JS libraries kicking around today are rooted in a lack of good documentation , a problem which afflicts far more things in the software world than JavaScript libraries .
I ’m going to hold off on that one for now , because it ’s really an objection to specific libraries , not to the concept of libraries in general .
Setting that one aside , three primary concerns seem to surface over and over again :
Some programmers are control freaks and would rather have their Internet connections amputated than use a line of code they did n’t write themselves .
Using a library will unnecessarily “ bloat ” your code , either by increasing the amount of JS users have to download , or by slowing down your code with the overhead of using the library .
users have to download , or by slowing down your code with the overhead of using the library .
If you do n’t have a thorough understanding of how the library works ( and , therefore , a thorough understanding of JavaScript and browser quirks ) , you wo n’t be able to use it effectively and may end up shooting yourself in the foot .
Let ’s look at each one of these in turn .
NCBM ( Not Coded By Me )
The control - freak problem is tough for me to understand , because I do n’t suffer from it .
I ’m a self - taught programmer , and I learned very early on that good libraries are a programmer ’s best friend ; they save you having to solve a problem that ’s already solved , and reading the code can often be a useful learning experience for non-experts .
The control - freak viewpoint of “ I do n’t trust anyone else ’s code ” runs directly counter to that , and makes me feel a bit uneasy .
Pretty much every programmer has to trust somebody else ’s code at some point :
C and C++ programmers have to trust the people who provide their compiler and their libc and / or STL .
. Java programmers have to trust the people who provide their JVM and class library , and C# programmers have to trust the people who provide their CLR and .
NET libraries .
and class library , and C# programmers have to trust the people who provide their and .
libraries .
Programmers who write Python , Ruby , Perl , PHP or other interpreted languages have to trust the people who provide the inerpreter .
or other interpreted languages have to trust the people who provide the inerpreter .
Everybody listed above has to trust an operating system vendor .
And web developers have to — at least to some extent — trust whoever wrote the web browsers .
No matter who you are and what type of programming you do , unless you wrote the full stack — OS kernel , libraries , compilers , runtimes and interpreters — at some point you ’re trusting somebody else ’s code .
So if you ’re having control issues , get over them right this minute and stop thinking “ eww , other people ’s code ” , because that ’s not productive .
The right thing to think when you see a library is not “ I do n’t want to use third - party code ” , it ’s “ how good is this third - party code and how well does it solve my problems ? ”
Sometime in the next couple of days I ’ll try to tackle the answer to that question for JavaScript libraries .
The library that ate Chicago
Library “ bloat ” is a tricky criticism to deal with , because it ’s really about two separate issues : one is the amount of code your users end up downloading , and the other is the amount of time it will take for that code to execute in a web browser .
When it comes to the number of bytes sent down the wire , using a library does introduce some measure of “ bloat ” ; you ’re probably not using everything the library defines , so no matter what you ’re including more code than you would have otherwise .
But most of the good JavaScript libraries help you work around this : some do their best to stay tiny , confining themselves to a smaller set of functionality in order to reduce the amount of code , and others are large when considered in total , but are logically broken down into modules so you can have finer - grained control over how much of the library you ’ll actually use .
Combined with size - reduction tricks — there are JS - specific compressors which can strip comments and unneeded whitespace ( and some advanced ones which can do even niftier tricks ) , and you can zip the file (s ) server - side before you put any bits on the wire — these approaches let you keep your code to a manageable size .
“ Bloat ” in the sense of code that ’s slow because of overhead introduced by the library is another matter , and is usually more of a tradeoff than anything else .
For example , lots of libraries provide methods for using CSS selectors or XPath queries to specify a set of elements to retrieve from a document , and these methods have , historically , been relatively slow ( though they ’ve improved a bit with time ) .
Whether to use these methods , then , comes down to weighing two options against each other :
If you do n’t use them , you ’re stuck with the DOM API , which is cumbersome and ugly to use ; you end up with code that looks like a train wreck , mashing together repeated calls to getElementById , getElements ByTagName , iterations over childNodes and endless regular - expression tests against className .
It ’s not uncommon to need a way to fetch , say , all the li elements with a given class name inside a ul which is the third child of the fourth div inside a container with a particular id , and the DOM API is horrifically bad at expressing that sort of thing , so you end up writing lots of one - off slabs of code which fetch elements according to specific parameters .
If you do use them , you get the benefits of clean , concise syntax — CSS selectors and XPath queries are designed from the ground up for quickly expressing conditions which describe an element or set of elements — and of generality : when the HTML changes , you just change the selector or query , instead of rewriting a huge mishmash of DOM method calls .
But now you ’re incurring the overhead of a system which can parse CSS selectors or XPath queries , and which ca n’t optimize the eventual lookups as much as a specific , one - off hack .
Given that computers are continually growing faster and that there are reliable ways to make expensive bits of code execute immediately while a user is still scanning the page ( before they can interact with it , they have to see what options they have for interaction ) , it ’s not hard to see why a lot of people choose to use the fancy methods with the clean syntax .
But at the same time , nobody ’s forcing anyone to use them , and performance - critical bits of code can always be rewritten using specific one - off collections of DOM methods .
The knowledge gap
This is probably the hardest objection to deal with , for a couple of reasons .
First of all , it comes off as an awfully snobbish thing to say : “ oh , do n’t try to play with the grown - ups ’ toys , you ’re not ready for them yet . ”
And , in a way , it is an awfully snobbish thing to say ; it ’s as if the experienced JavaScript programmers are all turning their noses up and sneering at the poor peasants who ca n’t recite IE ’s proprietary event - handling system from memory .
This is a serious issue not because it scares people away from JavaScript libraries , but because it scares them away from learning about JavaScript ; if they see too much condescension from the “ experts ” , new programmers wo n’t have much incentive to learn more than the bare minimum they need to deal with the task of the day .
But there is some practicality in the snobbishness ; if you do n’t have a certain familiarity with JavaScript and with browser quirks , you could be in for a lot of trouble :
You might not be able to figure out how to use a particular library .
If you can figure out how to use a library , you still might not be getting the most out of it because you do n’t know what options it really gives you .
The library you end up using might have bugs which you do n’t understand and ca n’t fix .
You might inadvertently use it in an unsafe way and end up with cross - site scripting bugs or other security problems .
None of this , however , points to a problem with the idea of libraries ; every programming language which allows the use of libraries or modules potentially has these problems , and they all go back to a lack of knowledge .
The solution , then , is not for knowledgeable JavaScript programmers to issue edicts of doom and try to frighten novices ; the solution — as Stuart and PPK have pointed out — is for those knowledgeable programmers to help people learn enough to make good choices about library use , and to use libraries and the language safely and effectively .
But that makes this the toughest problem to deal with , because closing the knowledge gap an uphill battle .
Worse , it ’s uphill from both sides : expert JavaScript programmers are n’t all that common , so the few who are out there have a lot of demands on their time which can keep them from being as helpful as they ’d like .
And JavaScript is such a universally loathed language that people who do n’t know it will go to unbelievable lengths to avoid ever learning it .
The sort of friendly , well - informed evangelism JavaScript needs is in short supply , and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future , though I ’ve got some thoughts on that which I ’ll get to a little later on in this series .
Let ’s break for the day
I think that ’s probably enough for a first foray into discussing JavaScript libraries ; we ’ve only scratched the surface , but already there ’s a lot to think about , so I ’ll stop here and let it all digest for a while .
Check back in a few days for the next entry in the series , which will cover some ideas on how to evaluate a JavaScript library and decide which one , if any , you want to use .
It sounds so reasonable , does n't it ?
Such a modest proposal .
Why not teach " both sides " and let the children decide for themselves ?
As President Bush said , " You 're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas , the answer is yes . "
At first hearing , everything about the phrase " both sides " warms the hearts of educators like ourselves .
One of us spent years as an Oxford tutor and it was his habit to choose controversial topics for the students ' weekly essays .
They were required to go to the library , read about both sides of an argument , give a fair account of both , and then come to a balanced judgment in their essay .
The call for balance , by the way , was always tempered by the maxim , " When two opposite points of view are expressed with equal intensity , the truth does not necessarily lie exactly half way between .
It is possible for one side simply to be wrong . "
As teachers , both of us have found that asking our students to analyse controversies is of enormous value to their education .
What is wrong , then , with teaching both sides of the alleged controversy between evolution and creationism or " intelligent design " ( ID ) ?
And , by the way , do n't be fooled by the disingenuous euphemism .
There is nothing new about ID .
It is simply creationism camouflaged with a new name to slip ( with some success , thanks to loads of tax - free money and slick public - relations professionals ) under the radar of the US Constitution 's mandate for separation between church and state .
Why , then , would two lifelong educators and passionate advocates of the " both sides " style of teaching join with essentially all biologists in making an exception of the alleged controversy between creation and evolution ?
What is wrong with the apparently sweet reasonableness of " it is only fair to teach both sides " ?
The answer is simple .
This is not a scientific controversy at all .
And it is a time - wasting distraction because evolutionary science , perhaps more than any other major science , is bountifully endowed with genuine controversy .
Among the controversies that students of evolution commonly face , these are genuinely challenging and of great educational value : neutralism versus selectionism in molecular evolution ; adaptationism ; group selection ; punctuated equilibrium ; cladism ; " evo-devo " ; the " Cambrian Explosion " ; mass extinctions ; interspecies competition ; sympatric speciation ; sexual selection ; the evolution of sex itself ; evolutionary psychology ; Darwinian medicine and so on .
The point is that all these controversies , and many more , provide fodder for fascinating and lively argument , not just in essays but for student discussions late at night .
Intelligent design is not an argument of the same character as these controversies .
It is not a scientific argument at all , but a religious one .
It might be worth discussing in a class on the history of ideas , in a philosophy class on popular logical fallacies , or in a comparative religion class on origin myths from around the world .
But it no more belongs in a biology class than alchemy belongs in a chemistry class , phlogiston in a physics class or the stork theory in a sex education class .
In those cases , the demand for equal time for " both theories " would be ludicrous .
Similarly , in a class on 20th - century European history , who would demand equal time for the theory that the Holocaust never happened ?
So , why are we so sure that intelligent design is not a real scientific theory , worthy of " both sides " treatment ?
Is n't that just our personal opinion ?
It is an opinion shared by the vast majority of professional biologists , but of course science does not proceed by majority vote among scientists .
Why is n't creationism ( or its incarnation as intelligent design ) just another scientific controversy , as worthy of scientific debate as the dozen essay topics we listed above ?
Here 's why .
If ID really were a scientific theory , positive evidence for it , gathered through research , would fill peer - reviewed scientific journals .
This does n't happen .
It is n't that editors refuse to publish ID research .
There simply is n't any ID research to publish .
Its advocates bypass normal scientific due process by appealing directly to the non-scientific public and - with great shrewdness - to the government officials they elect .
The argument the ID advocates put , such as it is , is always of the same character .
Never do they offer positive evidence in favour of intelligent design .
All we ever get is a list of alleged deficiencies in evolution .
We are told of " gaps " in the fossil record .
Or organs are stated , by fiat and without supporting evidence , to be " irreducibly complex " : too complex to have evolved by natural selection .
In all cases there is a hidden ( actually they scarcely even bother to hide it ) " default " assumption that if Theory A has some difficulty in explaining Phenomenon X , we must automatically prefer Theory B without even asking whether Theory B ( creationism in this case ) is any better at explaining it .
Note how unbalanced this is , and how it gives the lie to the apparent reasonableness of " let 's teach both sides " .
One side is required to produce evidence , every step of the way .
The other side is never required to produce one iota of evidence , but is deemed to have won automatically , the moment the first side encounters a difficulty - the sort of difficulty that all sciences encounter every day , and go to work to solve , with relish .
What , after all , is a gap in the fossil record ?
It is simply the absence of a fossil which would otherwise have documented a particular evolutionary transition .
The gap means that we lack a complete cinematic record of every step in the evolutionary process .
But how incredibly presumptuous to demand a complete record , given that only a minuscule proportion of deaths result in a fossil anyway .
The equivalent evidential demand of creationism would be a complete cinematic record of God 's behaviour on the day that he went to work on , say , the mammalian ear bones or the bacterial flagellum - the small , hair - like organ that propels mobile bacteria .
Not even the most ardent advocate of intelligent design claims that any such divine videotape will ever become available .
Biologists , on the other hand , can confidently claim the equivalent " cinematic " sequence of fossils for a very large number of evolutionary transitions .
Not all , but very many , including our own descent from the bipedal ape Australopithecus .
And - far more telling - not a single authentic fossil has ever been found in the " wrong " place in the evolutionary sequence .
Such an anachronistic fossil , if one were ever unearthed , would blow evolution out of the water .
As the great biologist J B S Haldane growled , when asked what might disprove evolution : " Fossil rabbits in the pre-Cambrian . "
Evolution , like all good theories , makes itself vulnerable to disproof .
Needless to say , it has always come through with flying colours .
Similarly , the claim that something - say the bacterial flagellum - is too complex to have evolved by natural selection is alleged , by a lamentably common but false syllogism , to support the " rival " intelligent design theory by default .
This kind of default reasoning leaves completely open the possibility that , if the bacterial flagellum is too complex to have evolved , it might also be too complex to have been created .
And indeed , a moment 's thought shows that any God capable of creating a bacterial flagellum ( to say nothing of a universe ) would have to be a far more complex , and therefore statistically improbable , entity than the bacterial flagellum ( or universe ) itself - even more in need of an explanation than the object he is alleged to have created .
If complex organisms demand an explanation , so does a complex designer .
And it's no solution to raise the theologian 's plea that God ( or the Intelligent Designer ) is simply immune to the normal demands of scientific explanation .
To do so would be to shoot yourself in the foot .
You can not have it both ways .
Either ID belongs in the science classroom , in which case it must submit to the discipline required of a scientific hypothesis .
Or it does not , in which case get it out of the science classroom and send it back into the church , where it belongs .
In fact , the bacterial flagellum is certainly not too complex to have evolved , nor is any other living structure that has ever been carefully studied .
Biologists have located plausible series of intermediates , using ingredients to be found elsewhere in living systems .
But even if some particular case were found for which biologists could offer no ready explanation , the important point is that the " default " logic of the creationists remains thoroughly rotten .
There is no evidence in favour of intelligent design : only alleged gaps in the completeness of the evolutionary account , coupled with the " default " fallacy we have identified .
And , while it is inevitably true that there are incompletenesses in evolutionary science , the positive evidence for the fact of evolution is truly massive , made up of hundreds of thousands of mutually corroborating observations .
These come from areas such as geology , paleontology , comparative anatomy , physiology , biochemistry , ethology , biogeography , embryology and - increasingly nowadays - molecular genetics .
The weight of the evidence has become so heavy that opposition to the fact of evolution is laughable to all who are acquainted with even a fraction of the published data .
Evolution is a fact : as much a fact as plate tectonics or the heliocentric solar system .
Why , finally , does it matter whether these issues are discussed in science classes ?
There is a case for saying that it does n't - that biologists should n't get so hot under the collar .
Perhaps we should just accept the popular demand that we teach ID as well as evolution in science classes .
It would , after all , take only about 10 minutes to exhaust the case for ID , then we could get back to teaching real science and genuine controversy .
Tempting as this is , a serious worry remains .
The seductive " let 's teach the controversy " language still conveys the false , and highly pernicious , idea that there really are two sides .
This would distract students from the genuinely important and interesting controversies that enliven evolutionary discourse .
Worse , it would hand creationism the only victory it realistically aspires to .
Without needing to make a single good point in any argument , it would have won the right for a form of supernaturalism to be recognised as an authentic part of science .
And that would be the end of science education in America .
Arguments worth having ...
The " Cambrian Explosion "
Although the fossil record shows that the first multicellular animals lived about 640 m years ago , the diversity of species was low until about 530 m years ago .
At that time there was a sudden explosion of many diverse marine species , including the first appearance of molluscs , arthropods , echinoderms and vertebrates .
" Sudden " here is used in the geological sense ; the " explosion " occurred over a period of 10 m to 30 m years , which is , after all , comparable to the time taken to evolve most of the great radiations of mammals .
This rapid diversification raises fascinating questions ; explanations include the evolution of organisms with hard parts ( which aid fossilisation ) , the evolutionary " discovery " of eyes , and the development of new genes that allowed parts of organisms to evolve independently .
The evolutionary basis of human behaviour
The field of evolutionary psychology ( once called " sociobiology " ) maintains that many universal traits of human behaviour ( especially sexual behaviour ) , as well as differences between individuals and between ethnic groups , have a genetic basis .
These traits and differences are said to have evolved in our ancestors via natural selection .
There is much controversy about these claims , largely because it is hard to reconstruct the evolutionary forces that acted on our ancestors , and it is unethical to do genetic experiments on modern humans .
Sexual versus natural selection
Although evolutionists agree that adaptations invariably result from natural selection , there are many traits , such as the elaborate plumage of male birds and size differences between the sexes in many species , that are better explained by " sexual selection " : selection based on members of one sex ( usually females ) preferring to mate with members of the other sex that show certain desirable traits .
Evolutionists debate how many features of animals have resulted from sexual as opposed to natural selection ; some , like Darwin himself , feel that many physical features differentiating human " races " resulted from sexual selection .
The target of natural selection
Evolutionists agree that natural selection usually acts on genes in organisms - individuals carrying genes that give them a reproductive or survival advantage over others will leave more descendants , gradually changing the genetic composition of a species .
This is called " individual selection " .
But some evolutionists have proposed that selection can act at higher levels as well : on populations ( group selection ) , or even on species themselves ( species selection ) .
The relative importance of individual versus these higher order forms of selection is a topic of lively debate .
Natural selection versus genetic drift
Natural selection is a process that leads to the replacement of one gene by another in a predictable way .
But there is also a " random " evolutionary process called genetic drift , which is the genetic equivalent of coin -tossing .
Genetic drift leads to unpredictable changes in the frequencies of genes that do n't make much difference to the adaptation of their carriers , and can cause evolution by changing the genetic composition of populations .
Many features of DNA are said to have evolved by genetic drift .
Evolutionary geneticists disagree about the importance of selection versus drift in explaining features of organisms and their DNA .
All evolutionists agree that genetic drift can't explain adaptive evolution .
But not all evolution is adaptive .

Critique of Intelligent Design movement , published in New Republic
Climbing Mount Improbable
Richard Dawkins ( illustrations by Lalla Ward ) , Penguin 1997
Creationism 's Trojan Horse : The Wedge of Intelligent Design
Barbara C Forrest and Paul R Gross , Oxford University Press , 2003
· Richard Dawkins is Charles Simonyi professor of the public understanding of science at Oxford University , and Jerry Coyne is a professor in the department of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago
Richard Dawkins ' book ' The Ancestor 's Tale : A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life ' is published by Phoenix in paperback today priced £ 9.99 .
In a recent op - ed piece for the Los Angeles Times , Andrew J. Bacevich , West Point graduate and professor of international relations at Boston University , takes up the question that will haunt us for some time to come :
Who lost Iraq ?
As he goes through the likely suspects , his implicit answer is clear enough , but it ’s the getting there that is quite interesting and even illuminating .
Bacevich categorizes the various answers to his question according to who is doing the talking :
First of all , we have the " dead - enders , " who defend the war to this day and maintain  against all the evidence  that it ’s the media that is distorting the true situation on the ground in Iraq , where everything , while not exactly hunky - dory , is generally moving in our direction .
Defeat is not an option , say the dead - enders , and victory is being withheld not by objective circumstances but by a domestic fifth column :
" Although dwindling in number , President Bush ’s defenders will ascribe failure in Iraq to a loss of nerve , blaming media bias and liberal defeatists for sowing the erroneous impression that the war has become unwinnable .
Bush loyalists will portray opposition to the war as tantamount to betraying the troops .
Count on them to appropriate Ronald Reagan ’s description of Vietnam as ‘ an honorable cause . ’
Updating the ‘ stab in the back ’ thesis , they will claim that a collapse of will on the home front snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in Baghdad as surely as it did in Saigon . "
The media did n’t create the fact that , three years after U.S. troops entered Baghdad , we have lost control of Iraq ’s capital city  and the situation in the rest of the country is rapidly approaching meltdown .
They are merely reporting it .
We had plenty of warning about this from military commanders and war critics before the launching of the invasion .
The generals told the civilian leadership that the occupation would be risky , and probably untenable in the mid- to long - term .
They were ignored .
The neocons could argue that the war would be a " cakewalk , " as Kenneth Adelman infamously proclaimed in the run-up to the invasion , as long as our principal enemies were the Sunnis who still supported Saddam and fought to restore the Ba’athist dictatorship .
However , the tide  never favoring the Americans  turned completely when the Shi’ites awakened from their long sleep and rose up to demand real elections , rejecting the " caucus " system the Americans initially sought to impose , which would have installed neocon sock - puppet Ahmed Chalabi and his gang as the rulers of " liberated " Iraq .
The Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , spiritual leader of Iraq ’s majority Shi’ite population , called his followers into the streets and Washington beat a hasty retreat .
The elections were held ; the Shi’ite parties swept into power , and their party militias began visiting a reign of terror on their former Sunni masters .
The results : civil war , Iraq ’s slide into warlordism , and American troops increasingly caught in the crossfire .
As predicted in this space , the Americans are turning to their old enemies , Saddam ’s former supporters , the Sunnis , to ward off the pro-Iranian Shi’ite majority .
The battle against the Sunnis never went all that well , but the U.S. occupiers managed to keep a lid on the chaos with the help of their Shi’ite allies .
Now that the terms of the conflict have shifted , however , with the Shia increasingly at odds with the Americans , the war is simply unwinnable .
And it is fast shifting gears , from a condition of stalemate to an outright defeat of U.S. forces .
Remember the militarily inconclusive battles against the militia of Moqtada al - Sadr ?
The U.S. declared Sadr an outlaw and vowed to get him in much the same terms as they went after Saddam .
Today , the latter is awaiting execution , while the former , whose Mahdi Army strikes terror in the hearts of Sunnis , is a prominent figure in the Iraqi government .
The balance of power is shifting .
Sadr , a radical Shi’ite cleric with a pronouncedly anti-American , super - nationalist stance , is the future of Iraq .
This is thanks in large part to his earlier battles with American troops : in a classic example of how the principle of " blowback " works , we made him into a nationalist hero .
In any case , we were stabbed in the back , all right  by our former fellow regime - changers .
Naturally , they will say that the U.S. stabbed them in the back , perhaps not without justification , but that is neither here nor there : the reality is that we face defeat at the hands of an aroused Shi’ite majority .
The U.S. establishment has slowly come to the realization that the war , as it is presently being fought , cannot be won , and this has given rise to " the buck - stops - at - the - top camp , " as Bacevich puts it , currently in the ascendant , which ascribes " the troubles roiling Iraq to massive incompetence in the Bush administration . "
" In a war notable for an absence of accountability , demands for fixing accountability are becoming increasingly insistent .
Parties eager to divert attention from their own culpability are pointing fingers .
Senior military officers target Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
Congressional Democrats who voted for the war and neoconservatives direct their fire against Rumsfeld and Bush .
The theme common to all of these finger - pointers :
Do n’t blame us ; the Bush team ’s stupidity , stubbornness and internal dysfunction doomed the American effort . "
Far be it from me to dispute the Bush administration ’s inability to carry out its announced intentions , but these were always pipe dreams that could n’t have been implemented even by the most competent regime imaginable .
The U.S. occupation is being defeated by objective circumstances , i.e. , the near - complete absence of support from the Iraqi people , and not by the exigencies of American politics .
While this may strike a blow at the conceit that U.S. troops are invincible and only need to muster an act of will in order to achieve victory , this mindset is itself typical of the hubris that tempted us to invade in the first place .
I contend that these results were eminently foreseeable , that in fact they were foreseen by the very policymakers who urged us on to war .
Anyone with even a passing familiarity with Iraqi demographics and the history of the country since the fall of the Ottomans could have confidently predicted the disaster we are seeing .
The dynamics of the conflict in Iraq lead , ineluctably , to war with Iran : that is the likely culmination of events , if we stay on the present course .
And it is one that the Bush administration apparently has no appetite for , at least at the present time  although some would disagree .
In any event , what Bacevich calls " the conspiracy theorists , " the third group of protagonists in the " who lost Iraq " debate , would no doubt argue that the idea is to push the Bush team into taking on Iran .
As Bacevich describes them :
" Even before the United States invaded Iraq , critics on the far left and far right charged that powerful groups operating behind the scenes were promoting war for their own nefarious purposes .
Big Oil , Halliburton , the military - industrial complex and Protestant evangelicals said to be keen on defending Israel all came in for criticism and even grassy - knoll - style paranoia .
" None of these putative masterminds , however , attracted anything like the attention devoted to the neoconservatives .
It ’s true that throughout the 1990s neocons clamored for a showdown with Saddam Hussein .
In the eyes of their critics , neoconservatives in power , such as Paul Wolfowitz , the former deputy secretary of defense , and those inhabiting the fringes of power , such as political journalist William Kristol , conspired to hijack 9/11 in pursuit of their own obsessions .
And , voila , the country landed in a quagmire . "
I doubt whether it was only the " far left " and the " far right " that identified " powerful forces " as being behind the rush to war .
It has been clear , to all and sundry , that the neoconservatives were the main driving force pushing the Bushies into a historic blunder .
After all , their war advocacy was hardly a secret .
If this was a " conspiracy , " then it was an unusually open one : as the war debate progressed , there they were  Richard Perle , Bill Kristol , Ken " Cakewalk " Adelman , David Frum , Frank Gaffney , etc. , ad nauseam  on every major news program , demanding that the bombing start yesterday .
The litany of pro-war talking points was repeated endlessly : " weapons of mass destruction , " links to al - Qaeda , and visions of " liberated " Iraqis showering us with rose petals .
The War Party spent the better part of a decade propagandizing for invading Iraq , and when the conflict finally came they were its loudest cheerleaders  until the sweet taste of victory and " mission accomplished " turned sour in our mouths , and the neocons turned on their former leader and commander in chief .
" As the endgame in Iraq approaches , " avers Bacevich , " the score - settling promises to get downright ugly .
Those who observe this spectacle will need a strong stomach . "
But that ’s only if popcorn upsets your digestive tract .
Because , at least here at Antiwar.com , we ’ll be breaking out the party snacks , the chips and dip , and the drinks , as we watch this vastly entertaining spectacle  the Iraq blame game .
There are so many possible scapegoats , all of them contemptible in their own unique ways : not only the neocons , but the pro-war Democrats who claimed to have been " duped " into voting for the war ; the American news media , which donned flag lapel buttons shortly after 9/11 and did n’t wake up until the war started going seriously wrong ; and , last but not least , the American people themselves , who initially supported the war , and only turned against it when the allied death toll began to rise and it turned out that the critics they refused to listen to had been right all along .
Oh , I know " the blame game " is supposed to be something bad : in America , no one is ever to blame for anything .
No one takes responsibility .
It ’s all because of our childhood traumas and a lack of " self - esteem . "
A visit to Dr. Phil will put matters right : I ’m okay , you ’re okay .
Is n’t it time to just " move on " ?
That ’s malarkey , pure and simple .
In the name of justice , the perpetrators of this massive fraud  we went to war , after all , on fraudulent " evidence " of Iraqi WMD  need to be exposed and brought to trial .
It is n’t nice to lie to the American Congress and the American people , on a matter so grave  and it ’s illegal , too .
It ’s wrong  and a violation of the law  to submit false " intelligence " to U.S. government agencies and then try to cover the tracks of your lies .
You can go to the slammer for exposing a CIA agent and stealing government secrets [ . pdf ] , and that ’s what is likely to happen to Scooter Libby and the AIPAC defendants barring divine or presidential intervention .
Ugly ?
Beauty is quite subjective , and never more so than in this case .
As for me , the sight of the War Party getting its just deserts could n’t be lovelier .
Good Books Want to be Re-read
Good books are good people : Books are people speaking with signs .
Meeting cool people several times is nice .
Choose books like you choose your friends .
Talk to many , stick with the best .
A good book can make you happy , get you through hard times , teach you amazing stuff .
It can do that every time you read it .
Meeting good friends again and again is where the fun starts :
Good books are a pleasure to read .
Repetition of pleasure is fun .
Good friends are never boring :
Do you think that if you read Kant ’s “ Critique of the Pure Reason ” you ’d get it all in one go ?
Kant would not .
Good stories are never fully understood :
Do you think that if you read “ A Midsummer Night ’s Dream ” you ’d get it all in one go ?
Shakespeare would not .
Good stories gain through repetition :
You learn more reading “ The postman always rings twice ” for the 3rd time than losing the pleasure of reading over some boring “ must read ” classic that does n’t talk to you .
Repetition is sweet : Imagine a guy that eats his favorite meal just one time , because he is “ afraid to get bored ” ; or he “ does n’t have the time to eat the same thing twice ” .
Kids love repetition .
Why do you think that is ?
This does n’t only apply to books .
It applies to all content .
Try and read a blog entry you really liked — again .
If you enjoy it as much or even more than the first time , it ’s a good piece of work .
If you ’re bored — it ’s not .
All you have to do to find out if this theory works is to overcome your initial resistance .
NEW DELHI : The HRD ministry has rejected the idea of ' one - laptop - per- child ' ( OLPC ) being aggressively marketed by Nicholas Negroponte of MIT Media Laboratory .
" India must not allow itself to be used for experimentation with children in this area , " the ministry has said .
The ministry 's detailed objection based on technical , social and financial grounds was sent to the Planning Commission two weeks ago .
Negroponte had made a presentation on OLPC at Yojna Bhavan on April 7 seeking to sell one million laptops at the rate of $ 100 per unit for children , the cost to be borne by the government .
The idea has enough takers in the Plan panel .
And despite HRD 's strong disapproval , Negroponte is coming to Delhi again on July 3 to hardsell his version of digital empowerment .
HRD contends that spending Rs 450 crore on digital empowerment can be better spent on primary and secondary education .
" It is quite obvious that the financial expenditure to be made on the scheme will be out of public funds .
It would be impossible to justify an expenditure of this scale on a debatable scheme when public funds continue to be in inadequate supply for well - established needs listed in different policy documents , " the ministry said .
It also finds it intriguing as to " why no developed country has been chosen " for MIT 's OLPC experiment " given the fact that most of the developed world is far from universalising the possession and use of laptops among children of 6 - 12 age group " .
The ministry says 6 - 12 is a highly " vulnerable age group to cover in an area of human technology interface which is so new and heavily debated " .
" Both physical and psychological effects of children 's intensive exposure to the computer implicit in OLPC are worrisome , to say the least .
Health problems of our rural children are well - known ; personalised intensity of computer use could easily exacerbate some of these problems especially those related to eyesight and the back , " the ministry said .
HRD also thinks there is a " conceptual vacuum in which the scheme is being propagated " .
Arguing that the " implications of computer - based pedagogy for childhood have remained a grey zone of research " , the ministry gives the example of the US where " the debate between those who believe computers to be good for children and those who have the opposite view has been quite polarised and shrill " .

Dancing With The Gods
An autobiographical account of my `religious ' beliefs and how they got that way .
If you start this , please read it through .
Stopping partway would probably leave you with some very silly misconceptions .
I was raised Catholic by a Catholic father and a relaxed Protestant mother .
I had my first mystical experience in 1967 at the age of 10 , at an old - style Latin Tridentine mass in the hills outside Rome , as the priests were censing the aisle of the church during the Offertory .
It presented itself as a sudden , intense sense of being in a moment outside time , an eternal instant co-existing with every other eternal instants of history , with the illusion of time and change stripped away .
" As it was in the Beginning , is now , and ever shall be , World without End , amen " conveys the flavor exactly .
I was aware even at the time that this experience was inside my head , induced by the Mass but not specifically Christian in content .
From an early age I was exposed to , and very interested in , skeptical / scientific accounts of the world .
Reichenbach 's " The Rise of Scientific Philosophy " and Korzybski's General Semantics taught me to value evidence , logic , and rationality .
On Thanksgiving Night of my twelfth year , as I was being offered the sip of sherry my family hauled out for the kids at holiday meals , I made the first major spiritual commitment of my life .
I realized that the religion I 'd grown up in was like the wine -- attractive but cumulatively toxic , promising exaltation but delivering the death of reason .
I quietly refused the wine .
I am a teetotaler to this day , refusing not only wine but psychoactive drugs of all sorts ( I do drink tea , which affects me very little ) .
With it , I renounced -- and swore enmity to -- not only my birth religion but any other form of belief founded on faith and soi-disant `revelation ' , as opposed to evidence and reason .
For years after that I was militantly and indiscriminately anti-religious .
Spending ninth through twelfth grade at a Catholic school hardly discouraged this :-) .
I read the Bible and the Koran and the Upanishads and the Egyptian and Tibetan Books of the Dead and found them wanting .
I developed all the attitudes , knowledges , and ignorances of an Enlightenment philosophe .
I read Voltaire and Russell .
And drank no wine .
Sometime early this period I was first exposed to Hindu and Buddhist mysticism .
It was immediately apparent to me that ( ignoring the religious stuff ) there was interesting content there .
I consciously experimented with meditative techniques , treating them as a sort of mental calisthenics in an effort to alter and broaden my perceptions .
( This was the early Seventies ; people were still wearing bellbottoms and peace symbols , and the hippie " doors of perception " thing was still very much part of the Zeitgeist . )
My second major mystical experience was a successful though unexpected result of one of one of these experiments .
It happened on a school bus at about 3:30 on a fall afternoon , I think in 1972 .
I had been attempting to visualize a larger and larger range of distance scales in the cosmos , from angstroms to megaparsecs .
I was holding in my mind vibrating hydrogen atoms and galactic clusters , and I tried to push further in both directions .
And something happened -- something that was a bit like seeing the point of a joke , a bit like an orgasm , and a bit like being pinned by powerful headlights .
I believe it was a classic satori , ego - death , consciousness of All ( though I did not understand those terms or their implications until years later ) .
By the time I entered college in 1976 , I felt I had learned most of what I could from such mind - games .
Lest you get the wrong impression , they had never been a major interest for me .
For every minute I spent thinking or reading about religion or mysticism , I undoubtedly spent thirty devouring huge amounts of science , history , philosophy , and mathematics .
( No , I did n't have much of a life !
I was a skinny , runty kid with cerebral palsy and few social skills , fanatically devoted to improving my mind because it was the only part of me that seemed to work right .
I was all hungry intellect and raging hormones :-) )
I had filed the whole topic away as interesting but not worth a lot of my time -- not likely to produce scientifically replicable results and too close to what I saw as the huge , nasty mind - mangling traps for the stupid and credulous otherwise known as `conventional religions ' .
I had grown -- I readily admit it -- rather smug in my enlightenment , quick to dismiss religiosity and mysticism in general as a sort of childhood neurosis of the species , to be abandoned by any rational individual and eventually by everybody as we march forward into the light of secular scientific understanding .
Anyone who can't predict from the above that my complacency was soon to be shattered has no ear for irony ...
When I was in my junior year in high school , I had started learning how to play guitar .
Unfortunately , it was my sister 's guitar .
My interest rekindled hers , and she reclaimed it just about the time I entered college , during that itchy period you get while learning when you have to play , every day .
Desperate for something to feed my jones , I snaffled my other sister 's abandoned flute .
And wow !
I was a natural ... immediately better with it than with the guitar I 'd been hacking at for months .
I was commuting to college at the time , and took it with me .
I 'd play as I walked between classes .
Six weeks from a cold standing start I sat in with a professional jazz band for the first time ... and they liked it .
This was delightful but mystifying .
All I 'd had to do was learn to play a scale , and this amazing river of music poured forth with barely an effort on my part .
It seemed almost as though my hands and lips had always known what to do , had been waiting for me to pick up the flute .
Something happened to me when I played that instrument .
The angry , anxious , frustrated adolescent kid I was then just disappeared .
I was powerful , competent , passionate .
And I got these stunning rushes of pure timeless joy , when my consciousness seemed to expand outwards from the limits of my skin to fill the universe and I could no longer tell whether I was playing the music or the music was playing me .
Nor were these effects just going on inside my own head .
At the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology there 's a large , circular domed chamber in the Oriental wing with a skylight at its apex .
Directly underneath that skylight they display the second largest natural - crystal globe in the world , a flawless five - inch sphere on a silver stand in the form of a dragon .
I found it there one day with the sun shining full on it .
Feeling utterly compelled , I ran ten blocks and back to get my flute , gazed into it , and started playing .
I do n't know how long I played .
When I was aware of the world again , echoes were dying away in the high dome , and a dozen or so people were lined up at the four entrances , keeping absolutely still .
Rather stupidly , I said " Why are you all standing there ? " thinking that if they 'd wanted to listen they certainly could have entered the room .
And a man said " We did n't want to interrupt you ... " in a hushed , totally awed tone of voice that embarrassed me no end .
We all looked at each other like we'd been caught in some weird intimacy in public .
I mumbled something and fled .
And this kind of thing kept happening .
Without my intention .
Without my understanding it .
Until the girl on the landing .
I was climbing the stair to the fourth floor in one of the quad houses one day , to visit some friends .
A girl stepped onto the landing , saw me , and turned white as a sheet .
I said something obvious along the lines of " Why are you looking at me like that ? "
She started to babble something about last week when she was studying , looking outside at the quad and seeing me walk by " ... and the leaves were following you ! "
And it was like I was the Spring and the life in the grass .
And a whole bunch of other stuff that made me wonder what drugs she 'd been doing ( this was 1976 or early ' 77 ; every second dorm room had a bong and blotter acid was easier to score than good music ) .
So I shook my head dubiously and rolled on upstairs and visited my buddies .
I was walking home , idly puzzling over this peculiar incident , and damn near fell over when I finally got it .
That girl had been trying to cope with a theophany ; she had looked at me and seen a god .
A particular god .
And I knew , suddenly , with utter shattering certainty , which one it was .
And that it probably was not the first time I had inadvertently triggered such an experience , and would almost certainly not be the last .
You have to understand that I was not happy about this at the time .
I 'd known the score since my early teens ; religion was an instrument of oppression , deities a delusion , mysticism a bag of sterile mind - games and somatic circus tricks .
I did n't need any of it .
I was proud of not needing any of it .
But I still had an omnivorous curiousity , and one of my friends was " into the occult " .
Had a chin beard , read Crowley , wore black turtlenecks .
He loved to talk endlessly about Eastern mysticism and archetypal psychology , shamanism , the organizing role of ritual , magic as mind - change , metaprogramming ( I sat for him once while he did LSD ) .
A minister 's son ; turned into a Fundamentalist with an alcohol problem years later .
But he was very educational at the time .
Thanks to him , I had started months before the girl on the landing to see clearly what I 'd only dimly grasped in my first pass at the subject ; that there is a kind of live internal logic to mysticism and religion , something entwined with psychology that sends runners and shoots all through culture and art .
Not that I took any of it seriously as a description of the real world .
It was an intellectual chew - toy , perhaps at best a way of understanding the pathologies that prevented human beings from living the infinitely more desirable life of reason and science .
Until I realized , finally , belatedly , what had been happening to me .
Until the Great God Pan reached out of my hindbrain and thundered " YOU ! "
And his gift is music and his chosen instruments the pipes and flutes .
And his , too the power of joy ; magic so strong that when it flowed out of me , even before I knew what I was doing , it amazed people into awe and incoherence and poetry .
That day I was reborn ; from a skinny lame kid with a flute into a shaman and a vessel of the Goat - Foot God , the Piper at the Gates of Dawn , the Horned Lord .
And the music was my first power , but not my last .
( And , oh , yes .
The first time I handled a set of pan -pipes I could play them .
Fluently .
Effortlessly .
And knew I could before I touched them . )
During the next several months I went through a wrenching re-adjustment of my world - view as I assimilated what I have just related here .
There was simply no way it would fit in either the religious categories I 'd grown up with or the comfortable , naive materialism I had constructed for myself .
I clung to the conviction that I live in a rational , explicable universe -- but the Gods had spoken and after that transforming moment of realization I could no more go back than a butterfly could crawl back into its cocoon .
I knew I was n't crazy , even by my own rather strict definition of sanity .
I was coping pretty well -- in fact , I was becoming a whole human being for the first time in my life .
Opening up emotionally .
Playing beautiful music .
And ... um ... getting laid .
( Well , what do you think happens when you start channelling the freaking God of Sex Himself ? :-) )
So I coped .
I read Jung and Crowley myself .
I gradually learned how to evoke Pan in myself nearly at will .
I constructed a world - view in which the forces I experienced fit within the natural order of science , as what Jung called " archetypes of the collective unconscious " .
I rejected supernatural explanations , but learned to believe in magic -- the magic of the human mind and hand and heart .
Here is what I learned :
All the Gods are alive .
They are not supernatural ; rather , they are our inmost natures .
They power our dreams and our art and our personalities .
Theurgy and ritual can make them stronger , more accessible to the shaman .
They can be evoked in a human being to teach , heal , inspire , or harm .
Occasionally they manifest in spontaneous theophanies ; the result may be religious conversion , creative inspiration , charisma , or madness .
Magic is loose in the world .
It is not the magic of fantasy -- no would - be violators of the laws of physics need apply .
Real magic acts in and through human agents .
The two forms of practical magic are healing and divination .
Healing works because human minds have more control over their bodies than we normally think ; divination works because humans know and perceive more than they are consciously aware of .
The mode of the religious is faith .
The mode of the mystic is experience .
We do not enact rituals and promulgate dogmas to express our `faith ' that the sun rises in the east , because it is a fact of experience .
No more does a true shaman or mystic invest faith in the god(s ) he or she invokes ; they too are facts of experience .
The elevation of `faith ' is , in fact , a sign that a religious tradition is losing its ability to induce theophany , or has already lost it .
More generally , allegiance to fixed religious forms reliably murders true religious experience .
Descriptive theology ( " Oh , yeah , Hermes and Thoth are basically equivalent ... " ) is worth doing ; prescriptive theology is at best a waste of time and at worst an invitation to holocaust .
The Gods personify everything humans have ever imagined as sacred .
Good things , bad things , and occasionally jokes that got out of control .
They 're all in there , all waiting to be tapped .
The Gods taught me these things while I was being some of them .
Usually I 've been the Horned Lord ( Pan / Cernunnos / Freyr / Krishna ) .
Occasionally I 've been the Trickster ( Coyote / Mercury / Loki / Eris ) or the Sage ( Thoth / Merlin ) .
Just once , by accident in a martial - arts class , I have been the Warrior ( Thor / Indra / Cuchulain ) .
But I 'm getting ahead of my narrative .
It was n't till the early ' 80s that I learned how to invoke gods other than the Horned One .
In late 1977 a woman I was involved with , who 'd seen some of my odd gifts in action and shared something of my developing understanding of them , invited me to go up to New York City with her to meet some friends .
She was singularly mysterious about them , and kept smiling as though she knew something I did n't .
She did .
They were a Wiccan coven called Blue Star .
And they knew what I was .
They 'd seen it before .
And they had a whole technology for raising the God Pan and his triune Goddess and exploiting those altered states , that I had n't known existed .
Now , understand , I had n't thought of myself as a witch up to then .
To the extent I labeled myself at all , I thought of myself as a shaman or experimental mystic .
I did n't use ritual induction ( no need ) .
I did n't work with other people .
I knew very little about Wicca .
They showed me that the imagery and energy I 'd stumbled into using on my own was part of a larger picture ; that it fit the mythology of Wicca and animated its ritual forms .
They showed me that I was a natural witch , albeit of a kind uncommon in this century .
Most spontaneous Wiccan theophanies happen to women .
For a man to spontaneously channel the Goat - foot God before training is unusual , though not unheard - of .
So I decided I was a witch -- or , at least , that I was willing to play with the Wiccans .
Nothing else resembling a live religious tradition seemed to have any room in its categories for my experience .
And they were completely comfortable with my scientific skepticism .
" Do what works , " was the attitude , " worry about explanations after you leave the ritual circle . "
Subsequently , I made numerous friends in the neo-pagan movement .
( The Wiccans are the largest single group in that movement . )
I went to many festivals , and founded and ran a coven of my own for six years in the 1980s .
I became a respected priest , elder , and bard .
I developed something of a reputation as a ritual designer and theoretician .
And out of me flowed poetry and healing and inspiration , and by these signs I knew and others knew that the Gods moved and lived within me .
I helped and trained and initiated many people myself , teaching them by design skills I had discovered by accident .
There is a living Wiccan lineage today ( Tradition of the Rainbow Wheel ) that calls me its founder and still uses portions of the Book of Shadows I wrote .
The original coven I founded broke up in 1986 under circumstances that are n't relevant here , but which turned me off of group work for a while .
By the time I was ready to become active again , my life had become filled with other challenges .
While I still use the gifts of the Horned God , and identify with neopagans , and do the odd bit of practical magic now and then , these days most of my spiritual life is wound up in my martial arts training .
I 've once again become very interested in Zen Buddhism , enough to read primary sources and seriously consider doing dokusan and the whole monastic - retreat thing at someplace like the Mountain Zen Center in Vermont .
I may do it yet .
Zen represents a return to my earliest , non-theurgic mystical experiences as a child .
Zen is very ... clean .
It does n't have the practical utility or drama or sexiness of the neopagan path .
But there is one thing it does better ; it strips away illusions .
To experience things as they are , just as they are , without the drunken monkey of the mind perpetually layering them over with expectations and interpetations and preconceptions and yammering till you can't hear yourself be -- that is the Great Way of Zen .
There 's my experience .
Now some theory for you skeptical types out there .
If my language is too " religious " for you , feel free to transpose it all into the key of psychology .
Speak of archetypes and semi-independent complexes .
Feel free to hypothesize that I 've merely learned how to enter some non-ordinary mental states that change my body language , disable a few mental censors , and have me putting out signals that other people interpret in terms of certain material in their own unconscious minds .
Fine .
You 've explained it .
Correctly , even .
But you can't do it !
And as long as you stick with the sterile denotative language of psychology , and the logical mode of the waking mind , you wo n't be able to --- because you can't reach and program the unconscious mind that way .
It takes music , symbolism , sex , hypnosis , wine and strange drugs , firelight and chanting , ritual and magic .
Super - stimuli that reach past the conscious mind and neocortex , in and back to the primate and mammal and reptile brains curled up inside .
Rituals are programs written in the symbolic language of the unconscious mind .
Religions are program libraries that share critical subroutines .
And the Gods represent subystems in the wetware being programmed .
All humans have potential access to pretty much the same major gods because our wetware design is 99 % shared .
Only ... that cold and mechanistic a way of thinking about the Gods simply will not work when you want to evoke one .
For full understanding , the Apollonian / scientific mode is essential ; for direct experience , the Dionysian / ecstatic mode is the only way to go .
One great virtue of this dual explanation is that it removes the need for what William James , in his remarkable " The Varieties of Religious Experience " , called the " objective correlative " .
By identifying the Gods with shared features of our psychological and inter-subjective experience , but being willing to dance with them on their own terms in the ritual circle , we can explain religious experience in respectful and non-reductive ways without making any anti-rational commitments about history or cosmology .
Scientific method cannot ultimately be reconciled with religious faith , but it can get along with experiential mysticism just fine .
This much I figured out early , by 1979 or so .
Later , I learned some more things :
Primary mystical experiences like mine are common .
A study by two British sociologists I read once seems to have shown that they are widespread in the general population , though perhaps more common in children and adolescents .
Our culture provides very little context or language for such experiences , however ; they are not generally categorized or recognized by the subjects as `spiritual ' , and are commonly undervalued and forgotten .
Religions are , mostly , the rotting corpses of dead mystical schools .
They 're founded by people who have primary mystical experiences or theophanies and ( for whatever reason ) do not interpret the content of those experiences into the terms of the religious traditions available around them .
These primary mystics recruit disciples and attempt to teach them how to replicate their theophany .
Usually these founders ( having neither training for nor interest in science or analytic rigor ) mistake the incidentals of the experience for its cause , and teach induction methods which are only accidentally effective .
As time goes by the induction methods accrete layers of ritual and dogma that crowd out the theophanic aspect , and are adapted for other purposes .
Very occasionally a charismatic mystic will arise within a religion and strip away the dogmatic accretions , re-creating a living mystical tradition .
Meister Eckhardt and George Fox did this in a Christian context ; the semi-mythical Sixth Patriarch of what was then the Dhyana school seems to have done it in an early Mahayana Buddhist one .
The movements they founded ( the Pietists , Quakers and Zen ) became exemplary , but they were the exceptions .
Most late - stage religions distrust mystics and lock them up in monasteries or hermitages ; they rightly fear the renewing but disruptive effect of theophany .
Eventually , for most of the religion 's followers , even the theoretical possibility of unmediated experience of the God(s ) is lost , or thought of as the preserve of specialists and madmen .
And this decay impoverishes our spiritual lives .
It cheats most of us of our birthright to the sacred lightning ...
And this is why I am implacably hostile to Christianity in particular and the other Zoroastrian - offshoot religions in general .
Never mind the fact that they have a long history of torturing pagans and mystics like me to death , and I fear they will begin doing it again the second they have the power .
No ... their crime in present time is that they are such tragic , monstrous cheats .
They create huge chasms of disconnection between us and our Gods , and then tell us that is inevitable because we are `sinful ' .
They associate the spiritual domain with so much dogma , cant and irrational garbage that anyone with a functioning brain has to either live in hypocrisy or reject the whole package -- and then wonder why life is so empty .
They warp the language of spiritual discourse ; they exert a sinister gravity on living mysticisms , tending to remake them in their own diseased images .
In the name of God , they strangle mystical experience ; in the name of love , they murder ; in the name of truth , they tell lies .
It does n't have to be that way .
I have seen .
I have been .
I have known .
The mysterium tremendum is within reach of everyone , " closer to you " ( as the Koran puts it ) " than the vein in your neck " .
To find it , it is only necessary that you abandon both the dogmatic materialist prejudice that it's not there , and the dogmatic religious preconception that you know what it is .
As the Buddha said from his deathbed to his favorite disciple Ananda , " Have no fixed beliefs , and find your own light . "

Thanks to reader Millie for pointing out that Nicole Kidman has been looking a lot like Barbie lately .
She looks ultra-plastic with a pale peach sequin dress at the Rome premiere of “ Fur . ”
Who looks more natural ?
Barbie : open palms , flouncy dress , and loose hair with side clip .
Nicole Kidman : clenched fists , form - fitting dressing and loose hair with up clip and bangs .
It seems like it ’s a tie between Barbie and Kidman , as the similarities are striking .
It took me too long to find the perfect Barbie and make this dumb image .
email me and I ’ll send you an untagged version if you want it for your blog .
Here are more pictures of Nicole at the Fur premiere . [ via ]
People in western countries are more promiscuous , the study says
Monogamy is dominant across the world , but multiple partners are more common in rich countries , according to the study published in the Lancet .
This was despite developing countries having higher rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV .
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers gathered data from 59 countries for the study .
They said factors such as poverty and mobility had more of a role in sexually transmitted infections than promiscuity had .
But the team added that the findings showed teenagers were not having sex earlier , contrary to popular beliefs .
The study said there had been no universal trend towards earlier sexual intercourse over the past three decades .
Almost everywhere , sexual activity began for most men and women between 15 and 19 years of age , with men tending to start earlier .
In the UK the average age for men was 16.5 and for women 17.5 .
Researchers said most people reported only having one sexual partner in the last year .
However , those reporting multiple partners were much higher in developed countries - up to a third of under 25s in some areas - whereas only a small percentage in Africa reported the same .
And among singletons , westerners were more sexually active as well .
Two thirds of men and women without a partner in African countries reported they had had sex recently , compared to three quarters of those in developed countries .
Surprising
The researchers said these findings were surprising , as higher rates of STIs were reported in developing countries .
But the report 's author , Professor Kaye Wellings , said : " This suggests social factors such as poverty , mobility and gender equality may be a stronger factor in sexual ill - health than promiscuity . "
And she added that the results showed flexible approaches to tackling public health had to be adopted .
" Men and women have sex for different reasons and in different ways in different settings , " she said .
" This diversity needs to be respected in a range of approaches tailored to whole societies , and to particular groups and individuals within them .
" The selection of public - health messages needs to be guided by epidemiological evidence rather than by myths and moral stances . "
A spokeswoman for Brook , the sexual health charity for young people , added : " There is still much to be done to improve sexual health in this country .
" But the situation here does not compare to that of many developing countries where it can be very difficult to get condoms and to insist on their use , for a range of economic and cultural reasons . "
Here ’s a quick look on what ’s going on in the world of rapid game development .
First of all my friend Juuso , ( the author of the excellent GameProducer.net ) has published his first rapidly developed game : Highpiled .
It ’s a physics game where your object is to build a very high tower from a bunch of boxes .
Juuso cranked the game in 21 hours , which is pretty amazing .
I ’m glad that he has decided to publish the game .
And while we are on the topic of GameProducer .
net I also recommend you check out Juuso ’s post about How To Create Games Incredibly Fast .
As an interesting side note , the game ’s setup has the following phrase in it :
Highpiled is “ blogware ” which means in this context that if you like the game , it would be nice if you could write a few lines about it in your blog and link to www.highpiled.com from there .
This is optional , but I ’d appreciate your effort .
This was the first time I ’ve bumped into the term “ blogware ” ( used in this context ) , but I have to say that I think it ’s a great idea .
Up to this point I have just used the term “ freeware ” for my games , but maybe from now on I should use the term “ blogware ” 🙂
Another friend of mine Martin ( of Grapefrukt.com ) has released a new ( flash ) game called Flashpiper .
It ’s an addictive pipe twisting puzzle game , with an online high score .
I hope to see more games from him during the spring .
The mother of rapid game development ExperimentalGameplay.com has a new competition coming up .
It ’s due to start at 5th of February and is guaranteed to bring a horde of cool new games .
Who knows maybe I ’ll take a stab at the competition ( if I come up with a decent idea for a game that fits the theme ) .
Another cool experiment was conducted by the good folks of the Finnish game forum SuomiPelit.com .
They created a game ( in a day ) for every day of November .
The result was 30 small innovative done - in - a - day games .
The almost complete result of their work can be viewed here .
Unfortunately it ’s in Finnish , but luckily the combination of screen shots and download urls is a universal language that every gamer understands .
I ’d also keep an eye out for these blogs : Bonsai , Skooma Games and the 2bears.com .
Because the authors of these blogs have promised us rapid game development and I intend to make sure that they keep their promise .
Even if it means that I have to personally track down where they live and start harassing them until they give up and create some more games 🙂
Silicon implants can be problematical
The technique uses fat from the stomach or thigh which is then enriched with stem cells before being injected .
It is hoped the method could prove a more natural - looking alternative to artificial implants filled with salt water or silicone .
But plastic surgeons working in Britain have greeted news of the technique with " extreme caution . "
Kotaro Yoshimura , a surgeon at the Tokyo University medical school , said more than 40 patients had been treated .
The enhanced breasts are soft and natural , so they are the patient 's " real " breasts
Cellport Clinic Yokohama
Mr Yoshimura said he believed the stem cell and fat combination , which can increase a woman 's cupsize by two sizes , was a success .
" There have been no serious complications , " he said .
During the operation , surgeons suck fat cells from the stomach or thigh , and this " slurry " is enriched so that there are higher numbers than usual of stem cells .
These are " master " cells which are capable of making new fat cells .
When the enriched stem cell mixture is combined with normal fat tissue , it can then be injected into the breast area .
More natural look
The treatment aims to offer a softer more natural look than traditional silicone implants .
Mr Yoshimura said the he believed combining stem cells with fat gave an improved result .
He said breast enlargement using fat and stem cells did not create a lumpy effect .
Lots of small particles were added rather than " one big lump " .
Cellport Clinic Yokohama in Japan are currently the only ones to provide the treatment .
The clinic website claims : " The enhanced breasts are soft and natural , so they are the patient 's " real " breasts . "
Consultant Norman Waterhouse said he had concerns about such a procedure .
He said : " It would be incorrect to suggest that a breast implant equivalent could grow from stem cells alone , and fat transfer , which is not a new procedure , can still lead to complications and give a lumpy effect . "
" This appears to be a rather optimistic view of what is yet a theoretical approach . "
Consultant Rajiv Grover added : " We greet this news with extreme caution . "
However , Adam Searle , past president of British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said the development should not be dismissed .
" There is exciting potential but no reality in practical terms at the moment .
" The stem cell ' soup ' is too non-specific to really focus on what you want . "
' Woo - hoo . "
" Whoever just joined , you 're breaking things up .
It might help if you muted your phone . "
" We got a lot of good stuff done last week . "
" Fish got that working ; that 's pretty cool . "
" We need to get serious . "
" Whoever is talking right now has great ideas . "
" Please send blankets . "
Welcome to the weekly meeting at Mozilla Corp .
It 's a bit hard to say who 's in attendance because it 's open to everyone .
That 's " everyone , " as in the human race .
The phone number and online chat coordinates are publicly posted , as is the date , time , and agenda , for anyone who might feel like having a hand in Mozilla 's strategies and operations .
The comments fly , seemingly at random or at cross-purposes .
Mentioned almost in passing is word of the completion of the software program that has been released to the public as Firefox 2 .
Firefox , of course , is the Web browser that has established itself as the one serious competitor to Microsoft 's ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) utterly dominant Internet Explorer .
It has been downloaded more than 200 million times , making it one of the hottest high - tech products in history .
It is so hot , in fact , that Microsoft has been forced to play catch - up and release its first significantly retooled version of Internet Explorer in five years , which offers some of the features that Firefox has long boasted .
One can only imagine how difficult it would have been to get a ticket to the meeting at which Microsoft managers reported its completion .
The Mozilla meeting quickly moves from software progress reports , which do n't seem to ignite much interest , to a discussion of what Mozilla can do to create closer ties to the thousands of volunteer programmers around the world who are largely responsible for developing Firefox and Mozilla 's other , lesser - known products .
This subject generates a lively discussion , and draws several comments , offered in a distinctive verbal style that manages to be laconic , forceful , and a bit playful all at once , from a heretofore mostly silent participant .
When someone wonders whether Mozilla should offer an organized program to help train volunteer developers , this voice quickly chimes in : " Maybe we can find a way to have smaller groups that self - organize and then get together . "
And then , after a moment , the voice suggests essentially the opposite .
" Maybe we should hire somebody here to be the focal point . "
The voice belongs to Mitchell Baker , who leads Mozilla under the official title of Chief Lizard Wrangler .
That Baker is fond of tossing out what seem like contradictory ideas in quick succession is entirely in keeping with a background that includes being a California Caucasian who speaks Mandarin , a political lefty who ended up at a corporate law firm before taking over a fiercely anticorporate organization , and a devoted parent with a passion for performing on the trapeze .
Baker even seems to have two different haircuts that face off on opposite sides of her head , unified only partially by a dose of red dye .
Finally , in spite of the first name , Baker is a woman , one of the few who have risen to prominence in one of the most male - dominated segments of the high - tech industry .
As a mass of apparent contradictions , Baker , 48 , is a good fit for Mozilla - - which is , after all , the profit - making arm of a nonprofit organization , a community - run company whose executives cut secret deals with big businesses , a 70 - employee start - up that has threatened the ambitions of one of the world 's corporate titans , and a well - funded company that depends mostly on unpaid enthusiasts to develop its software and to handle its marketing , customer support , even strategic planning .
As whimsical as the title Lizard Wrangler may be , it 's probably closer to the mark than " CEO " or any other term the conventional business world has to offer .
" Baker and Mozilla are wrestling with new questions about the boundaries between communities and the corporation , " says Siobhan O'Mahony , an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who studies new forms of organization .
" She 's creating a new management model based on engaging a business ecosystem . "
Baker , and the organization she leads , clearly are not much like what has come before them .
But they may be a lot like what entrepreneurs and companies will become in the years ahead .
That Mozilla and Mitchell Baker have been heralded as the vanguard seems highly unlikely , especially considering that both came to prominence amid the excesses and bumbles of the dot - com boom and bust -- specifically the browser wars .
By 1998 , Netscape Communications had seen its Navigator browser , the software that opened up the Web to most of the world , yield its dominance to Microsoft 's newer , faster Internet Explorer .
In an effort to broaden its impact , Netscape had embedded Navigator in a small suite of e-mail and other programs called Communicator , but the result was bloated and clunky .
In a drive to compete against Microsoft and salvage its fading reputation among the tech - savvy , Netscape made Communicator an " open- source " product -- that is , it publicly released the programming code so that anyone could tinker with it .
In 1999 , the company spun off and funded a small project called Mozilla ( the name supposedly was derived from " Mosaic killer , " Mosaic having been the first browser ) to coordinate the tinkering so that there would be an official product , albeit one that was n't controlled by Netscape .
Baker , then a Netscape lawyer , was assigned the tricky job of writing a software license for Mozilla that would permit people to alter the program without allowing them to convert the results into a proprietary product .
She proved so adept at finding common ground in the often intensely conflicting needs and styles of her corporate employer , the tech - obsessed and sometimes militant open - source community , and the world of users , that Netscape asked her to run the Mozilla project .
She might reasonably have passed on that opportunity , given that almost everyone expected Mozilla to fail .
But Baker found the offer irresistible .
She recognized at once that Mozilla was a chance to help shape a new kind of organization that existed outside the bounds of corporate governance and of many of the ordinary rules of work .
Most of the contributors would be volunteers , and the coin of the realm would be not salary or title , but respect , accomplishment , camaraderie , and challenge .
It would not be an uncoordinated free - for - all ; the community , for the most part , would need to agree on the direction the project would take and on who would be given responsibility for a task .
Mozilla would be a meritocracy .
If you proved talented and diligent , you 'd get more important tasks and ultimately acquire some level of project leadership , sidestepping much of the politics and bias of traditional corporations .
It would be easy to assume that leadership is less important in this sort of community - driven organization .
In fact , the opposite is true , says Sandeep Krishnamurthy , who is an associate professor in the business administration program at the University of Washington , Bothell , and has studied Mozilla .
" Someone has to take the lead and reach out to this large group of people to provide feedback and motivate them , " he says .
In some ways , he adds , the bar at an open - source organization is higher for a manager , not lower .
Unlike employees , volunteers generally wo n't put up with inept , bullying , or unfair managers .
They 'll just walk away .
Edicts wo n't work when it comes to getting this sort of a community moving in a common direction .
Rather , it takes a combination of inspiration and persuasion to build consensus .
If Baker proved an effective leader , it would be in spite of her not having the two most common characteristics of open - source movers and shakers : being a man and being a programming whiz .
It 's estimated that less than 2 percent of the open - source community is female .
Meanwhile , the percentage of respected open - source leaders who did n't get to their positions via daring feats of coding is probably just as small .
" Just because it 's open source does n't mean it 's open door , " says Krishnamurthy .
" To get anywhere , you have to win the respect of an elite group of people who develop code . "
To do that entirely through nontechnical management skills would be nearly unprecedented , to do it as a woman all the more so .
But that was not the first challenge Baker faced .
Soon after she took the helm of Mozilla , AOL ( NYSE : TWX ) agreed to buy Netscape for $ 4.2 billion , a deal completed in 1999 .
The work on Mozilla continued .
But lacking a clear prospect of a fast return on its investment in Netscape , AOL started to clamp down on the project 's costs , laying off Baker in 2001 .
But while AOL could cut off Baker 's salary , Mozilla was an independent entity , and Baker , who had become a popular and respected figure in the open - source world , remained as an unpaid volunteer for about a year , until a nonprofit called the Open Source Applications Foundation offered to restore a portion of her former salary to support her Mozilla work .
In 2002 , the Mozilla project released its first official product , Mozilla 1.0 .
It was a suite of Internet applications that integrated a Web browser with programs for e-mail , online chat , bulletin boards , and building websites .
The program worked well , but by this time the world had largely accepted Internet Explorer , and there were other simple programs for e-mail and other tasks .
Few computer users wanted to start all over with a new , relatively complex piece of software .
Mozilla 1.0 was the solution to a problem that no one seemed to have .
That might have been the end of the story , but it turned out there was a small side project taking place within Mozilla that until then had received relatively little attention .
Two young programmers , Blake Ross and David Hyatt , had been working on the browser portion of Mozilla 1.0 , breaking it down and reassembling it in leaner form .
They were like two guys in a minivan factory dragging parts off the assembly line to a dark corner of the building to assemble a dune buggy .
The result was a simple , speedy browser .
Now , in 2002 , with Mozilla 1.0 failing to cause a stir , a question presented itself :
Was it possible that while most of the team had been toiling away on a doomed Internet suite , Ross and Hyatt had quietly thrown together the basis of an IE killer ?
It was the right question , and the right time to ask it .
By 2002 Internet Explorer 's real shortcoming was starting to show itself : security .
In order to make the program work with a wide range of Web technologies , Microsoft had made it easy for website developers to get access to the guts of the program while it ran on a user 's machine -- which meant the IE user 's software could also be exploited by hackers , spammers , and other unscrupulous Web bottom feeders .
The public , and corporate networks , became plagued with viruses , endless pop -up windows , and spyware .
Baker understood that Mozilla suddenly had a new mission : Make browsing safer .
The new browser was released as Phoenix in late 2002 .
In an effort to keep the browser simple and secure , the core program provided only the basics in viewing a website .
But it also made it easy for programmers to write " extensions " that would add other features -- anything from built - in dictionaries to at - your - fingertips weather reports , which could be added to the browser with a few clicks , enabling users to make their own decisions about how to balance simplicity and strength .
By early 2003 , Phoenix was starting to attract attention among the tech - savvy Web avant - garde .
Nevertheless , AOL signed a seven - year agreement with Microsoft to make IE its default browser .
It also laid off all the Netscape programmers working on Mozilla .
Baker started firing off e-mails to her growing fan base of computer - industry leaders , many of whom were concerned about Microsoft 's de facto hegemony in Web browsing .
If everyone used Explorer , Microsoft would be in a position to dictate technical standards for websites and could then in theory integrate the resulting proprietary approach to Web browsing with its Windows and Office products -- a strategy toward which Microsoft appeared to be edging , and that threatened to close off much of the Web to users of Linux , Apple , and other non-Microsoft software .
Creating a popular alternative to Explorer would , in effect , short - circuit any such Microsoft effort .
Lotus founder Mitch Kapor chipped in $ 300,000 , and IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) , Sun Microsystems ( NASDAQ : SUNW ) , and Red Hat ( NYSE : RHT ) offered the services of dozens of programmers .
Baker , ever the persuasive diplomat , was careful not to burn any bridges with AOL ; the company even agreed to donate $ 2 million to the cause .
Baker spearheaded the formation of a formal nonprofit corporation called the Mozilla Foundation to be the official overseer of the code and funding .
In 2004 , Mozilla was ready to release a preview of the latest version of its browser , now called Firefox .
The timing seemed propitious .
The entire PC universe was up in arms about the exploding problem of Web - based malware .
IE was considered so vulnerable to hackers that the computer security arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recommended dumping the application , and some private computer security firms echoed that advice .
Firefox , by contrast , was simpler and designed specifically to resist hackers and viruses .
( Microsoft declined to respond to questions for this article .
" We certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers , " the company said in a written statement . )
Finally , Mozilla had a product that could compete with Microsoft .
The question now was how to publicize it .
Open - source management seemed to work well when it came to developing software .
But open - source marketing was an unexplored concept .
Would people be willing to volunteer to get the word out on Firefox ?
Baker thought they might , and one reason was Asa Dotzler .
Back in the late 1990s , Dotzler had been a young college dropout working in a market research firm in Austin when he joined Mozilla 's community of " bug reporters " -- people who volunteered to download the latest prototype of the product and submit technical reports of what needed fixing .
Dotzler , who does not have a technical background , took it upon himself to act as a liaison between nontechies willing to serve as bug reporters and the programmers -- helping to get the former up to speed and the latter to be more forgiving , and thus bringing thousands of new people into the project .
Baker was so impressed that in 2000 she offered him a job .
" I said , ' You want to pay me for something I 'm spending 30 hours a week on as a volunteer ?
Are you kidding ? "
Now Dotzler wanted to see if the nontechnical community would be willing to help promote Firefox .
The company created a Spread Firefox website , and Dotzler helped make it the focal point of a launch campaign .
The goal seemed absurdly ambitious : Generate a million downloads of Firefox within 10 days of its release .
Dotzler and a crew of Mozilla faithful asked users to identify blogs that might be receptive to the initiative .
Soon , thousands of blogs and other webpages were sporting " Download Firefox " buttons .
Released in November of 2004 , Firefox Version 1.0 hit the million - download mark in four days and the 10 million mark in 30 days .
A few thousand volunteer marketers had joined the campaign .
Two months later , about 30,000 people were helping .
Then a volunteer made a suggestion :
What if the community could get , say , 10,000 people to each throw in $ 30 to buy a New York Times ad for Firefox that would list the names of all the contributors ?
Within 10 days of opening up the offer , the list was close to 10,000 , and in December the Times carried a two - page ad .
Over the next year , the number of marketing volunteers climbed to more than 100,000 and Firefox was being downloaded at an average rate of 250,000 times per day .
Mozilla 's headquarters are next to Google 's ( NASDAQ : GOOG ) in Mountain View , California .
But where the latter company 's imposing office complexes twist through acre after acre like a 21st - century industrial version of a topiary maze , Mozilla 's digs are buried in a corner of a small village of modest wood - sided structures vaguely reminiscent of ski lodges or barracks .
The parking lot is full of aging Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas .
At the front office , there 's no receptionist .
A piece of paper suggests you come on up and knock .
Computer workstations abound , but so do toys and stuffed animals , and a cozy canteen offers a neatly arranged cornucopia of berries , nuts , and cereals , as well as an electric massage chair and a cappuccino machine .
There 's a lot of energy coursing through these offices , and a chunk of it comes from the nine student interns currently in residence .
One of them is John Carey , who was a Missouri State University student when Mozilla plucked him out of the Midwest and set him up with a free apartment nearby , along with the assignment to make a video of the behind - the - scenes work to prepare the next major version of Firefox .
He readily agreed , but also professed an interest in arranging for a crop circle in the shape of the Firefox logo .
" We thought he was kidding , " says Dotzler .
In August , the 40,000 - square - foot logo was pressed into an oat field near Salem , Oregon , with the help of a crew of college students , making it one of the largest , not to mention more offbeat , advertisements ever created .
The offices are also home to Mozilla 's management .
But many of the company 's 70 full - time employees are based in Toronto , Tokyo , and Paris .
It 's not unusual for a firm to have to wrestle with problems presented by a geographically scattered work force , but in Mozilla 's case the challenge is extreme .
That 's because what drives Mozilla is n't the 70 employees but the nearly 200,000 volunteers who do most of the product development and marketing .
Open - source software organizations such as those that developed the Linux PC operating system and the Apache Web server program have long wrestled with ways to keep lines of communication open and to distribute decision making among vast communities of mostly software - developer volunteers .
But Mozilla can't fall back on these precedents , either .
Unlike other open - source ventures , which tend to be niche products embraced by techies who become fiercely loyal to and dependent on the software , Firefox is a mass - market , consumer - oriented product that can easily be replaced should it fail to offer distinct advantages over the competition .
That means Mozilla has to move faster and be more innovative and marketing - oriented than its open - source cousins .
But the way Mozilla really strains the conventional open - source model is that it makes money -- pretty good money .
Baker wo n't reveal the details , but the company is said to have pulled in revenue of around $ 70 million last year , most of it from a deal with Google in which the search engine giant kicks back a commission on ad revenue obtained when a Firefox user enlists the browser 's Google search bar and ends up clicking on a sponsored link .
Mozilla has struck a similar deal with Yahoo ( NASDAQ : YHOO ) .
In spite of some grumbling about how money would " contaminate " Mozilla 's noble mission , the Firefox community has seemed to approve of the opportunity to bring in revenue .
But the community was not intimately involved in the decision - making process .
How could it have been ?
Negotiating a big deal with a large commercial partner requires speed , decisiveness , and , most ticklishly , confidentiality .
Managers at high - tech giants these days wo n't even discuss sports until a nondisclosure agreement has been signed .
And then there 's the question of how a not - for - profit foundation like Mozilla can even consider these kinds of commercial deals , given the higher public disclosure requirements for nonprofits , not to mention the restrictions on money - making activities that accompany the favorable tax status .
To get around these barriers , the Mozilla Foundation in August of 2005 spun off most of its Firefox - related operations , including Baker and most of her management team , into a wholly owned for - profit subsidiary , Mozilla Corp .
As a private , for - profit firm , Mozilla Corp. can cut deals and keep secrets .
But because it 's owned by the foundation , any profits go to furthering the foundation 's mission of preserving choice and innovation on the Internet .
Plenty of companies , of course , can and do claim to be driven by mission .
Google still beats its chest over its " Do n't be evil " credo , and Microsoft will talk endlessly about its dedication to the user experience .
But executives at these and all other publicly held companies are obligated to use whatever legal means they can to generate the most profit possible ; if they do n't , shareholders will replace them with managers who will .
Mozilla Corp. managers , in theory , do n't face these pressures .
That 's one reason they can continue to distribute decision making to the community , open - source style .
Indeed , Baker seems convinced not only that Firefox devotees deserve to be involved in everything Mozilla does , but that they will do a better job than can a small group of clever managers .
" I have a very optimistic view of the social fabric , " she says .
This , of course , poses some tricky management questions -- issues that go beyond the obvious ones of long time frames and a lack of confidentiality .
Baker points out two such problems : " stop energy " and " loners . "
Stop energy , as she describes it , is a sort of gravity that permeates group decision making , the inertia that sends good ideas crashing down to earth , stifling innovation in the process .
Loners , by contrast , are like unguided missiles -- they simply take it on themselves to push ahead , without regard for what others think .
Loners may get a lot done , but unchecked , they can take a toll on the community by creating resentment and divisiveness that ultimately slow progress .
To counter these problems , Baker has championed an approach she calls " layers of the onion . "
New decisions start off in small , relatively specialized groups that spring up informally within the community as needed .
These groups can filter out weaker ideas and improve promising ones and gather information that can inform decision making .
Since the groups are self - selecting and likely to contain highly motivated members , they 're resistant to stop energy or loner behavior .
The best ideas from these smaller groups are then passed on to a somewhat larger group that can further refine them .
Only then are the most promising ideas and most important questions put before the entire community .
The result is a hybrid organization , one that relies heavily on open - source models of distributed decision making and transparency but that is also , when necessary , capable of keeping secrets and of making quick and potentially controversial decisions .
Baker acknowledges that the model is far from perfect .
" Mozilla is inventing a new sort of entity , one that 's different from organizations we know , " she says .
At one point in 2005 , criticism from the community that Mozilla managers were being too secretive led Baker to hold a moratorium on all corporate - only meetings for several months ; it only ended when managers needed to discuss a human resources question too personal to share with everyone .
" One of the biggest management challenges is to not let this core of Mozilla employees take over , " Baker says .
In other words , Baker is struggling to limit the influence of her own management team -- not the typical goal of corporate executives .
So far , however , the model seems to be working .
One way to gauge its success has been Mozilla 's continuing ability to draw more and more marketing volunteers .
A contest to come up with promotional videos drew 300 entries , some of which have garnered millions of views on YouTube .
The Firefox logo has been etched into the lawns in college quads , spray - painted on highway overpasses , baked into pancakes , sent up 100,000 feet on a weather balloon , and crayoned onto countless human faces .
Seventy thousand websites have put up a " Download Firefox " button .
Some 180,000 people have offered to help develop , test , or promote the software .
Dotzler notes that up to 10,000 volunteers help spot bugs , and he hopes to build a network of volunteers willing to provide technical support via telephone , IM , and e-mail .
Firefox now commands about 15 percent market share for browsers ; it has been downloaded more than 200 million times .
But it 's facing a renewed challenge from Microsoft , which has brought out Internet Explorer 7 to match many of Firefox 's features .
Mozilla managers like to suggest that Firefox will continue to thrive because users still distrust Microsoft because of its long neglect of the browser and the resulting security fiasco .
Ross Rubin , director of industry analysis at high - tech market research firm NPD Group , questions that assumption .
" Most consumers are n't religious , " he says .
" They 'll use whatever tools are most convenient for them and that work the best for them . "
But he adds that IE7 does n't seem to introduce any significant new features that would cause Firefox users to jump ship .
" If Firefox is serving their needs , they probably would n't switch back , " he says .
Still , few observers think Mozilla can continue to win converts at the astounding rate of the past two years .
But for Baker and much of the Mozilla team , it has always been about more than building a better browser .
It 's the future of work and competition that 's at issue .
More leaders , Baker contends , are recognizing the ways in which communities can drive organizations .
The question is not whether this approach can work , but how best to implement it .
" I think the answers will apply outside the software industry , " she says .
And many observers agree .
" Companies tend to treat consumers as having to be manipulated to make money off them , " says the University of Washington 's Krishnamurthy .
" Mozilla 's message is that if we all work on this together , and we allow people to express their frustration with the status quo creatively , we can take back control .
Any underdog company can feed into that . "
Harvard 's O'Mahony believes that some companies are already borrowing from Mozilla 's playbook by trying to get consumers not merely to swallow marketing pitches and buy products but also to help design products and shape and disseminate pitches .
Topps ' ( NASDAQ : TOPP ) Bazooka bubble gum brand , sneaker maker Converse , and MasterCard ( NYSE : MA ) all have asked the public to come up with videos and other marketing - related efforts ; Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) and Kraft Foods ( NYSE : KFT ) have looked to consumers for help with product development .
" Mozilla has shown that organizational boundaries can be more permeable and transparent and that you can develop a relationship with a community that takes an interest in how you organize and manage , " says O'Mahony .
By the same token , she adds , Mozilla also is blazing a trail for not - for - profit organizations that could benefit from behaving more like for - profit businesses .
O'Mahony notes that many entrepreneurs might have trouble following Baker 's lead when it comes to openness .
" She listens , she debates , she changes her mind , she adapts , she allows herself to be convinced by outsiders , " she says .
Do n't take O'Mahony 's word for it .
Anyone can have a window into Baker 's inner debates via her expansive blog , which is unusually thoughtful and candid .
In one entry from last year , Baker mused on how an entrepreneur typically has a broad vision -- she calls it a " sense of possibilities " -- for a company that prompts a leader to try to exert control over everything that goes on .
" My case is very much the opposite , " she writes .
However , she adds , " there is of course a piece of the Mozilla project where I have a very strong sense of the possibilities and a determination to see things proceed in a way that makes sense to me .
That area is the organizational structure of the project .
How do we integrate the various constituencies ?
How do we organize ourselves ?
How do we provide enough structure to build top quality products and still provide room for individual initiative and serendipity ? "
Becoming frustrated with source code not aligning in my favorite source editor I decided to hunt for the best font .
In particular , I began to hunt down the available fixed - width or monospaced fonts .
What are monospaced fonts you ask ?
From Xerox : Monospace fonts ( Such as Courier or LetterGothic ) , or " fixed pitch " fonts , contain characters that all have the same character width , producing text that can be used to create forms , tabular material or documents that require exact text line lengths .
An example of a fixed pitch font is Courier 12 pitch , which is a 10 point font that will print at exactly 12 characters per inch .
Why use monospaced fonts ?
Primarily because the text will align more readily .
Especially is areas like the comment block header .

For those that have the agile religion , it is routine to express to others why they are not " agile " because they 're not doing precisely 72.799 hour iterations , or because they have code coverage of less than 83.002 % or other arbitrary measures .
That is counter productive .
Instead we should be encouraging good behaviour as a general practice , not enforcing it through religion and the humiliation of non-conformists that most religions - including agile - engender .
Sensible software engineers do the things that make projects successful and we should maintain that , but without the dogma .
A lively debate is underway among the folks at ThoughtWorks .
Starting with Dr. Jim Webber , noted author and ThoughtWorks ' top SOA consultant , complaining of religiosity among unnamed colleagues .
Does the rise of " Agile religion " signal that the moment has arrived to retire the " Agile " label ?
The discussion began when Dr. Webber described himself as an Agile atheist
Fellow ThoughtWorker Jeff Santini called Jim out in the comments , disputing the existence of an " Agile religion " :
I hear alot of talk about the Agile Religion , but I have yet to hear from anyone who actually subscribes to it .
...
You said you are not Agile because you do n't believe in it 's religion and you do n't accept its dogma .
Yet I AM Agile and I also do n't believe in its religion nor do I accept its dogma .
As a matter of fact I do n't have any idea what its religion or dogma are .
In light of the above statement either we have different understandings of what it means to be Agile , or there is something besides these two issues that determines Agility .
But seriously , the Agile Manifesto mentions some pretty good guidelines in my opinion to keep teams focused on delivering software rather than adhering to a ( potentially dogmatic ) methodology .
To which Jim responded :
I do n't think I can call myself agile because others who are agile would find my practices different .
For example , I subscribe to ( enough ) architecture and design ; I am also wary of YAGNI as a way to shelve important design decisions under the belief they can be magically retrofitted later .
I also like quiet focussed areas in whcih to work , and I 'm sure there are other ways I 'm sure that I disagree with the orthodoxy .
I do n't mean to convey any disrepect for agile practices .
As I said in my blog post I like ( most of ) the engineering and planning practices that agile teams use .
But I do n't fully subscribe to ADD working environments or full time pairing etc .
That is why I am an agile atheist .
Jeff Patton , another top ThoughtWorks ' consultant and reknown product designer , shortly thereafter authored there Is No Spoon , why the best software design and development process is all in your head .
Using the spoon bending scene from the Matrix as a backdrop , he presented a compelling argument that the highest performing teams do not follow a consistent process .
Much of the blog entry is drawn from suspicions confirmed at a UserInterface11 conference presentation by Christine Perfetti . :
The UIE folks expected to find that the highest performing design teams had the best processes ; but in fact they found that high performing design teams might not follow a consistent process at all .
What they did have was a big toolbox full of techniques and tricks , and a history of adaptation and improvisation .
She went on to say that in organizations that had a documented methodology , they could almost predict poor performance .
Colleagues say that Patton is a big fan of Shu Ha Ri , a concept drawn from the martial art of Aikido , whose three levels of learning progressing to mastery roughly translate as :
Shu : traditional wisdom - learning fundamentals , techniques , heuristics , proverbs
Ha : breaking with tradition - finding exceptions to traditional wisdom , reflecting on their truth , finding new ways , techniques , and proverbs
Ri : transcendence - there are no techniques or proverbs , all moves are natural
For those that believe that Shu Ha Ri applies to the discipline of software development , rigid adherence to Agile practices is ' Shu ' , the first and furthest stage from mastery .
Patton wrote :
Deep down in my heart , I know that there 's really no process .
That I 'll really have control over my process when I let it bend and sway like a blade of grass .
When I focus on the objectives of my software I try to transcend the process .
Early Mars Had Underground Water System
According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology expert Jeffrey Andrews - Hanna and colleagues , the answer to the puzzle behind the geographic features of the Meridiani Planum on Mars is buried in the Red Planet 's past -- and beneath its surface .
They theorise that the water has bubbled up from underground .
by Marlowe Hood
Paris ( AFP ) March 07 , 2007
Scientists on Thursday said they had found evidence that Mars was once latticed by an underground water system , proving that the Red Planet has had a long and complex relationship with one of the potential ingredients for life .
Writing in the British journal Nature , researchers focussed on questions thrown up by NASA 's Martian rover , Opportunity , in its exploration of a vast sloping plain called Meridiani Planum .
Opportunity found sulphate - rich sediments that some experts claimed were the remains of seas that once washed over the planet .
Others , though , pointed out that the site at Meridiani Planum was not a basin , and thus could not enclose such a huge amount of water .
According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology expert Jeffrey Andrews - Hanna and colleagues , the answer is buried in the Red Planet 's past -- and beneath its surface .
They theorise that the water has bubbled up from underground .
The geological site in question " is in fact exactly where a global groundwater simulation model for early Mars predicts upwelling of water on the ancient planet 's surface , " says Victor Baker , an expert in geomorphology , in a commentary also published by Nature .
The computer model devised by Andrews - Hanna and his colleagues extends far beyond the spot where Opportunity found the hydrated sulphate salt minerals .
Drawing on other evidence of subsurface water flows -- especially photos from the Mars Orbiter showing that rocks that were once below the surface have been altered by water flow -- the scientists postulate what Baker calls a " globally connected groundwater system " throughout the planet .
Today Mars is bone dry , its thin atmosphere almost entirely bereft of water .
But most experts now agree that the planet was once covered with seas and a balmy , Earth - like atmosphere , fueling speculation that it could have harboured some form of life , even bacterial .
Even more tantalizing , in the light of the Nature study , is recent evidence presented by NASA scientists that some water is still flowing along the surface of Mars , presumably from underground sources .
Pictures taken by the US Mars Global Surveyor orbiter in 2005 detected two gullies that the scientists said could only have been created by a flow of liquid .
The gullies had not existed when the region was photographed earlier .
Water is one of three essential ingredients for life as we know it , along with energy , such as sunlight , and elements like carbon and oxygen .

A critical meltdown of ice sheets and severe sea level rise could be inevitable because of global warming , the world 's scientists are preparing to warn their governments .
New studies of Greenland and Antarctica have forced a UN expert panel to conclude there is a 50 % chance that widespread ice sheet loss " may no longer be avoided " because of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
Such melting would raise sea levels by four to six metres , the scientists say .
It would cause " major changes in coastline and inundation of low - lying areas " and require " costly and challenging " efforts to move millions of people and infrastructure from vulnerable areas .
The previous official line , issued in 2001 , was that the chance of such an event was " not well known , but probably very low " .
The melting process could take centuries , but increased warming caused by a failure to cut emissions would accelerate the ice sheets ' demise , and give nations less time to adapt to the consequences .
Areas such as the Maldives would be swamped and low - lying countries such as the Netherlands and Bangladesh , as well as coastal cities including London , New York and Tokyo , would face critical flooding .
The warning appears in a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which assesses the likely impacts of global warming and will be published in April .
A final draft of the report 's summary - for - policymakers chapter , obtained by the Guardian , says : " Very large sea level rises that would result from widespread deglaciation of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets imply major changes in coastlines and inundation of low - lying areas , with greatest effects in river deltas .
" Relocating populations , economic activity and infrastructure would be costly and challenging .
There is medium confidence that both ice sheets would be committed to partial deglaciation for a global average temperature increase greater than 1 - 2C , causing sea level rise of 4 - 6 m over centuries to millennia . "
Medium confidence means about a five in 10 chance .
The revelation comes as a new report points out that greenhouse gas emissions running into hundreds of millions of tonnes have not been disclosed by Britain 's biggest businesses , masking the full extent of the UK 's contribution to global warming .
According to a report by Christian Aid , only 16 of Britain 's top 100 listed companies are meeting the government 's most elementary reporting guidelines on greenhouse gas emissions .
As a result , almost 200 m tonnes of damaging CO2 is estimated to be missing from the annual reports of FTSE 100 companies .
The figure is more than the annual reported emissions of Pakistan and Greece combined .
This month the IPCC published a separate study on the science of climate change , which concluded that humans are " very likely " to be responsible for most of the recent warming , and that average temperatures would probably increase by 4C this century if emissions continue to rise .
Even under its most optimistic scenario , based on a declining world population and a rapid switch to clean technology , temperatures are still likely to rise by 1.8C .
The new report is expected to say this means there is " a significant probability that some large - scale events ( eg deglaciation of major ice sheets ) may no longer be avoided due to historical greenhouse gas emissions and the inertia of the climate system " .
Scientists involved with the IPCC process cannot talk publicly about its contents before publication .
But a senior author on the report said : " It 's not rocket science to realise that with the numbers coming out from the IPCC [ science report ] , the warming by the end of the century is enough to do that . "
The report 's conclusion poses a conundrum for governments of how to address a problem that is inevitable but may not occur for hundreds or thousands of years .
" That 's for the policy makers to decide but it really is a very difficult question , " the source said .
" Those are moral questions and the answer you give will depend very much on which part of the world you live in . "
Jonathan Overpeck , a climate scientist at the University of Arizona , said the key question was not whether the ice sheets would break up , but how quickly .
Some models suggest rapid melting that would bring sea level rises of more than a metre per century .
" That would be much harder for us to cope with , " he says .
The IPCC science report predicted sea level rises of up to 0.59 m by the end of the century .
But that does not include the possible contribution from ice sheets , because the experts judged it too unpredictable to forecast over short timescales .

Like it or not , our work lives involve meetings - status meetings , planning conference calls , brainstorming sessions , meetings for the sake of meetings .
But a meeting is only as valuable as the action taken after everyone 's left the conference room .

Whether you 're headed off to a business meeting , a university lecture , or a conference session , taking effective notes is a necessary skill to move your projects , your career and your education forward .
Today I 'll go over a couple of my favorite note - taking methods , as well as how to make your own custom notepaper to fit your needs .
The first two methods are especially useful for business meetings and professional conferences , where it 's most important to separate different types of information .
Advertisement
Method 1 : Symbolize the next action
Using notepaper or a simple text file on your laptop or tablet , indent the pages of your notes in from the left margin .
Then , use a simple system of symbols to mark off 4 different information types in the column space left in the margin .
[ ]
A square checkbox denotes a to do item
denotes a ( )
A circle indicates a task to be assigned to someone else
indicates a task *
An asterisk is an important fact
is an ?
A question mark goes next to items to research or ask about
After the meeting , a quick vertical scan of the margin area makes it easy to add tasks to your to do list and calendar , send out requests to others , and further research questions .
( This method is the brainchild of Michael Hyatt , someone who clearly has mastered the art of attending meetings . )

Method 2 : Split your page into quadrants
Another way to visually separate information types is to split your note - taking page into quadrants and record different kinds of information - like questions , reference and todo's - into the separate areas on the page .
Rumor has it this is how Bill Gates - someone known for taking amazingly detailed meeting notes - gets it done .

Method 3 : Record and summarize - The Cornell Note- taking Method
A system more targeted towards students digesting large amounts of information on a daily basis , the Cornell note - taking method also separates the page into different areas , as pictured :

The provision , signed into law in October , weakens two obscure but important bulwarks of liberty .
One is the doctrine that bars military forces , including a federalized National Guard , from engaging in law enforcement .
Called posse comitatus , it was enshrined in law after the Civil War to preserve the line between civil government and the military .
The other is the Insurrection Act of 1807 , which provides the major exemptions to posse comitatus .
It essentially limits a president ’s use of the military in law enforcement to putting down lawlessness , insurrection and rebellion , where a state is violating federal law or depriving people of constitutional rights .
The newly enacted provisions upset this careful balance .
They shift the focus from making sure that federal laws are enforced to restoring public order .
Beyond cases of actual insurrection , the president may now use military troops as a domestic police force in response to a natural disaster , a disease outbreak , terrorist attack or to any " other condition . "
This editorial rings the alarm bells and praises GOP Representative Tom Davis who , like Senators Patrick Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , and Christopher Bond , Republican of Missouri , are pushing bills that would repeal these over - reaching provisions .
Although America is technically involved in an undeclared " war on terrorism , " American citizens stand to suffer more from another undeclared war : one that threatens their civil rights with burgeoning , uncontrolled and unaccountable federal government involvement at every level of American life ...
Governors know best what is best for the residents of their states , not the president , whose power is growing more dictatorial with each signing statement .
We support Davis and his committee 's efforts to repeal the law allowing over - broad federalization of military troops .
The Hill had more on this earlier this month :
Backed by the National Governors Association ( NGA ) and the National Guard community , Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and Kit Bond ( R - Mo. ) , co-chairmen of the National Guard Caucus , introduced a bill this week to revive the previous authority on the domestic use of the military .
The legislation has been referred to the Armed Services Committee , where it will probably face some opposition from Warner and Levin , who said that the provision clarifies existing law and does not give the president powers at the expense of the governors .
Leahy disagrees .
" Expanding the president ’s powers under the Insurrection Act was a sweeping , ill - considered and little - noticed grant of authority to the executive branch , at the expense of the National Guard and the governors , " he said .
" That change in longstanding law treads heavily across basic constitutional issues relating to the rights of the people , the separation of powers , and state and local sovereignty . "
Disappointingly , my own Senator Carl Levin helped write this ill - advised provision .
And though this story has I 'm sure been diaried here before , it merits ongoing attention as the MSM picks up the lead and ( hopefully ) runs with it further .
1. BECOME A NUN
If you ’re willing to take a vow of poverty , chastity , and obedience , your prayers may be answered in a convent .
Some sisters live full time at a convent like the Corpus Christi Monastery in the Bronx , where the eighteen cloistered nuns spend all day praying in “ perpetual adoration of the most blessed sacrament . ”
Brooklyn ’s Sisters of Mercy get out more , if only to work in schools , hospitals , women ’s shelters , and soup kitchens .
Still more adventurous are the Sisters of Saint Francis in Syracuse , who get to go all the way to Hawaii , East Africa , and Peru .
You have to be Catholic ( though there are Buddhist and Orthodox Christian nuns ) and neither married nor divorced ( God frowns upon that , though being widowed is okay by Him ) .

2. RUN FOR OFFICE
If your friends are tired of hearing you say , “ I should run for office , ” the New York City Council may be the place for you .
There are 51 seats in the city , it pays at least $ 90,000 a year , and owing to term limits the council has to turn over completely every eight years .
Plus , a City Council run requires 900 valid , legible petition signatures , compared with the 7,500 needed to run for mayor .
“ The best way to do it is through the issue that you ’re most concerned about , ” says City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , who started out as a council aide and got elected to office in 1999 .
For your cause , consider helping children in some way .
Surely there are libraries that need renovating , playgrounds that need building , orphans who need feeding .
What can your opponent say ?
“ Do n’t feed them ” ?
Consider doing a stint as a district leader — rung one on the city political ladder — and make sure you ’re physically fit .
Campaigning requires standing for hours at the subway , which can be hell on the back .
“ If you ’re planning a year in advance , start doing sit-ups now to strengthen your stomach and back , ” says Quinn .
“ If there ’s ever a step or a curb , put one foot up on it .
That ’s a good trick . ”
Another trick is knocking your opponents off the ballot by catching them on petition technicalities ( illegible handwriting , invalid addresses ) and sending them to court to defend themselves , which , at the very least , sucks their spirit dry and , at best , leaves you with one less challenger .
3. TEACH THE DOWNWARD DOG
Although yoga - teaching programs can last six months , Manhattan makeup artist Elisa Flowers became a certified core - strengthening Vinyasa instructor in six weeks , thanks to an intensive twelve - hour - a - week course with Sadie Nardini , an instructor at Essential Therapy on East 25th Street .
It helped that Flowers had been practicing for five years ; generally , those teachers who are qualified to certify others invite only their top students to pursue it .
Flowers ’s next step is teaching for free or half - price at a yoga studio as practice and to draw students .
“ It ’s like I ’m a band trying to get picked up by a record label , ” she says .
“ I need to develop a following . ”

4. GROW ORGANIC TOMATOES UPSTATEAissa O’Neil was a fashion designer in the city ( she started a sportswear line called Hybrid ) and a Boerum Hill loft - dweller before she sold the business ; moved to her weekend house in Delhi , New York ; and created Betty Acres Farm , a 90 - acre organic farm that sells vegetables , eggs , and organically raised meat to farmer ’s markets , stores , and restaurants .
To get the place up and running , it cost her $ 75,000 , which bought a new barn roof , a 1965 Massey Ferguson tractor , five sheep , one pig , and a goat .
( Neighbors gave her chickens . )
O’Neil was able to break even in her first year , but it took her three to draw a salary .
“ If you ’re a farmer making $ 29,000 to $ 30,000 a year , you ’re doing very well , ” she says .
On the other hand , it only took her two years to find a husband , who works for the post office when he ’s not baling hay .
Having a family member in a nonfarm job is a good idea .
“ It gives us both health - insurance benefits year - round , ” O’Neil says .
There are hundreds of certified organic farms in New York State , and the number is growing .
To start your own , look for land with expansion possibilities in Orange County ; the Catskills are too mountainous .
To make money , design your farm around an upscale restaurant menu , with items like Angus beef , baby lettuce , and artisanal cheese .
Avoid eggs .
“ In the summer , we sell about 50 dozen eggs a month , but the more we sell , the more we lose , ” says O’Neil .
“ No farmers make money on eggs . ”
5. HIT THE ROAD (1 ) Locate an RV rental ( getrv.com found a 24 - foot Winnebago that sleeps five for $ 3,870 a month out of Peekskill ) .
( 2 ) Rent it .
( 3 ) Discover that it ’s impossible to park .
Gasp at how the hike in gas prices will affect your ten - miles - to - the - gallon supertanker .
Confirm that RVing requires personally evacuating the waste - holding tanks into the campsite sewer .
Thank the RV - rental folks and ask your travel agent to investigate camping in Costa Rica .

6. TAKE TO THE SKIES “ I do n’t mean to sound arrogant , ” says Chris Richards , owner of the Academy of Aviation at Republic Airport in Farmingdale , Long Island , “ but once you learn to fly , you ’re not like everybody else anymore .
You ’ve experienced freedom and exhilaration that not many other people have .
It changes you as a person . ”
Angelina Jolie has been flying high since she bought her $ 400,000 single - engine Cirrus SR22 .
Other celebrity pilots include Harrison Ford , Patrick Swayze , and John Travolta , who owns a 147 - passenger Qantas Boeing 707 jet , which he lands at a runway outside his home in Ocala , Florida .
At Richards ’s school , it takes 50 to 70 hours and about $ 17,000 to learn to fly a two - seater Cessna 150 , a standard starter plane that goes 300 to 400 miles , at twice the speed of a car , before you need to refuel .
Once you ’re licensed , renting one runs about $ 94 an hour , and upgrading to a four - seater Cessna is $ 150 an hour .
Or buy your own Cessna 150 for $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 .
The parking space is extra .
7. GET CAST ON A REALITY SHOW
To land a spot on a reality show — and you can find out who ’s hiring at realitytvcastingcall.com — you need a video as gripping as the Jacko baby dangle .
“ You must make the first twenty seconds really count because some casting directors only watch that much , ” says Ken Duphiney , a freelance casting director who has worked for shows for CBS and ABC and competed on The Amazing Race 3 .
( He and younger brother Gerard came in third . )
“ Never say , ‘ I plan to fly under the radar . ’
That ’s so uninteresting , ” he advises .
Instead , pick a personality trait and magnify it .
If you ’re stubborn , sell yourself as Mr. My - Way - or - the - Highway .
If you have a hot body , show it off .
And if you have a brain , show that off , too , says Duphiney : “ Viewers love to watch smart people fail . ”
8. GET HIRED AT A HEDGE FUNDIf you ’re not already doing money management at Fidelity or Putnam , try mowing the lawn — the right lawn .
“ This business is all relatives and friends of friends and networking , ” says an analyst at a $ 1.5 billion hedge fund .
“ In fact , we just got rid of a kid who used to do odd jobs for our boss .
Literally , he would do landscaping .
The kid was smart , he went to college , so the boss threw him a bone ” — a six - figure bone , mind you — “ because he thought he could do it .
It took a year for them to decide it was n’t working out . ”
Given that amount of time to prove yourself , though , you might do better .
9. BECOME A BOLDFACE NAME “ Most celebs got famous by sleeping with other famous folk , ” says New York Post “ Page Six ” contributor Jared Paul Stern .
“ And if you ca n’t fuck ’em , sue ’em . ”
Lawsuits , like the one about Paris Hilton ’s sex tape , have the added bonus of a built - in profit margin — some stars will pay you just to go away .
Or hire a publicist who will donate dish on true boldfacers in exchange for sneaking you into the column .
“ When you read in a column that Nicole Kidman and Jude Law were seen partying alongside celebrity dentist Bob Smith , ” explains Daily News “ Gatecrasher ” columnist Ben Widdicombe , “ that means Bob Smith ’s publicist gave the columnist some other great dirt in exchange for the mention . ”
If you ca n’t afford a publicist , try writing your own press releases and sending them to gossip columnists .
Cory Bernstein did that , professing to be a Versace model and alerting “ Gatecrasher ” and others that he had been seen in Chicago hot spots with celebrities like Justin Timberlake .
You can now Google “ Cory the Model ” and find numerous citations , including this one .
10 . GO TO AN INDIAN SPIRITUAL RETREAT TO HAVE SEX ALL THE TIMEMost such places are austere affairs with buckets for showers , but the Osho International Meditation Resort in Pune , India , has a pool , tennis lessons , a nightclub , a sauna , a cybercafé , discos , and , during high season , 3,000 to 5,000 horny Westerners trying to sleep their way to enlightenment .
“ It ’s like Sex and the City , but barefoot , ” explains Zeynep Askoy , a former Manhattan ad exec who enjoyed a brief stay there .
The man behind Osho is the late Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh , the famed “ sex guru ” who founded a 65,000 - acre free - love commune in Antelope , Oregon , in 1981 .
The Bhagwan , who changed his name to Osho , was deported for violating immigration laws in 1987 and died in 1990 , but his libido lives on at this wanton hideaway , which requires visitors to have an HIV test upon entry .
“ Osho ’s overall concept is Zorba the Buddha , which combines Zorba the Greek , that guy who loves alcohol , dens , and women , with the silence and meditativeness of Buddha , ” explains president Klaus Steeg .
Every guest wears a maroon robe in public areas ( acquire one at Osho , or buy your own and have it tailored ) .
“ Everyone happens to look gorgeous in them , ” says Askoy , “ especially men .
Men look gorgeous wearing a dress . ”
11 . SAVE A KIDBecome a schoolteacher .
The fastest way is through private schools ( which pay on average about 15 percent less than public schools ’ starting salaries of around $ 47,000 ) or charter schools , as neither require the same labor - intensive coursework and testing of the state certification process ( though you ’ll still need appropriate training and experience ) .
The New York City Charter School job fair on March 18 and 19 ( check nyccharterjobs.com ) is the American Idol of the teacher talent search .
Those with exceptional career experience in everything from business to dance to the visual arts should bring evidence of their skills and express a willingness to work longer than the usual school day ( sometimes until 4 or 5 p.m. ) .
For private schools , there are recruiting firms like Manhattan Placements , which found Anna Oropeza - Parra a job teaching kindergarten at the private Scuola d’Italia on the Upper East Side .
Oropeza - Parra advises some mental preparation : “ The biggest misconception is that teaching is a breeze because you work eight to three , ” she says .
“ As you enter those school doors , you ’re on .
It ’s rewarding , but people get burned out really quickly . ”
12 . DISAPPEAR COMPLETELYAs long as the police are n’t on your tail , vanishing from society is n’t all that difficult .
“ The key , in a nutshell , is cash , ” says Steven Tavlin , licensed P.I. and president of the Holmes Detective Bureau in Manhattan .
Do n’t put your name on anything .
Use calling cards for landlines , buy prepaid cell phones and change them every few months , travel by bus and train , and find a single - room - occupancy hotel that accepts cash — or a roommate who will put his or her name on the lease and the utilities .
Or apply for an Ecaid credit card ( ecaid.com ) , a nameless card stamped solely with an account number .
It stashes your funds in an untraceable account in Panama and , when swiped , deducts from your account like a debit card .
Do n’t make up a new Social Security number — you never know whose number you ’re stealing , says Manhattan P.I. Skipp Porteous , president of Sherlock Investigations .
“ We were looking for one of the FBI ’s most wanted , ran the Social , and found a guy out in the Midwest who was trying to start a new identity . ”
A better idea : Find someone around your age who died and write to his hometown vital - records office for a birth certificate , then use that to get a Social Security card , driver ’s license , etc .
“ When someone dies , people do n’t contact the hospital they were born in to report it , Social Security does n’t know about it unless a death benefit is filed , and funeral directors are n’t required to notify the government that someone has died , ” explains Porteous .
“ It ’s a flaw in the system . ”
Living under the radar is tough , but there are plenty of deadbeat dads and fugitives proving it can be done .
“ The city , ” says Tavlin , “ just swallows them up . ”

I live in Michigan , where we have a city called Hell .
It 's rather an odd thing when someone asks you where you live , and you simply reply ...

The oasis that is Las Vegas could soon run dry , environmentalists fear
It appears a green oasis of refrigerated plenty , set in a blazing desert .
But environmentalists warn water supplies could run dry within the next 50 years ; while urban sprawl is out of control and development is encroaching on protected areas .
No matter how you arrive in Las Vegas , by car or plane , you are immediately struck by the stark contrast of a lush city against a barren desert that stretches in all directions .
Yet , this is a region in the grip of one of the worst droughts on record .
Water myths
Las Vegas consumes around 870 litres ( 190 gallons ) of water per person per day , according to the Western Resource Advocates group .
And each day countless tourists wander up and down the Strip , in awe of dancing fountains , sinking pirate ships , tropical landscaping , pools and many more water features .
But this is one of " Sin City 's " greatest myths .
Local hotels account for just 7 % of the area 's total water usage , according to the Southern Nevada Water Authority .
It seems there are too few of us that are willing to stand up and say we need to protect our environment
Jeff van Ee , Southern Nevada Planning Authority
" The hotel casinos use only 30 % of their water allocation on outdoor use , while 70 % is used indoors in rooms and kitchens and that water is reclaimed and used again , " says Cruz .
" Even though the Bellagio has the largest water feature on the Strip , it benefits from ground water .
We are consuming less water than when it was functioning as a golf course when it was the old Dunes ( hotel ) . "
But when you look at the residential statistics , the figures are reversed .
Water authorities estimate around 70 % of residential water is used outdoors , washing the car and irrigating the lawns , and only 30 % is used indoors .
Although Nevada has been banking excess water from the Colorado River in Arizona , environmentalists fear this is a short - term solution .
In Las Vegas you are struck by the stark contrast of lush city against barren desert
The SNWA hopes a $ 5 billion 555 km pipeline from central Nevada could be the answer to the future water needs of Las Vegas .
But farmers and residents in rural parts of the state are unwilling to share the precious resource and it is becoming a battle known as " craps versus crops " .
" A lot of people [ in central Nevada ] are seeing the impact this could have on their way of life and on the springs and natural habitat , and they 're saying that as fabulous as Las Vegas may be - this plan to tap ground water is not the best alternative for rural Nevada , " Mr van Ee explains .
Explosive growth
Rural farmers have now pressed the Bureau of Land Management to expend the public consultation period for the planned pipeline until the beginning of August .
Nevada State senate majority leader Dina Titus says this a problem that is been compounded by explosive growth in the region .
" Right now , 6,000 people a month are moving to this valley because the weather is good , the taxes are low and there are plenty of jobs , " she said .
In 2003 , Senator Titus was responsible for a controversial bill that ensured the conservation of Red Rock Canyon , a national conservation area just on the outskirts of the city .
And like many a fellow environmentalist , she is concerned that urban sprawl is now encroaching on surrounding conservation areas like Lake Mead , Spring Mountain and Red Rock Canyon .
" If you can't build enough schools - and it takes one school a month to keep up with the growth - then you lose quality of life .
We need to get a handle on the growth and start planning for the future , " Senator Titus told the BBC .
Mr Van
Ee laments that the town he arrived in some 20 years ago is now the fastest growing urban area in the country .
" It seems there are too few of us that are willing to stand up and say we need to protect our environment . "
Doing the Martin Shuffle ( with your iPod ) I 've got an iPod shuffle .
A lot of people do .
So you probably know they 're great , but they do n't have a display .
If a song is playing and you want to know what it is , you 're out of luck .
I can think of two ways that could be fixed : A button sequence could mark the current song ; when you later connect your iPod to a computer , iTunes could display the marked songs .
You do n't get immediate gratification , but you do eventually find out the name of the song .
iTunes could be modified to use the Apple text - to - speech module to speak the song 's metadata ( e.g. title and artist ) and store it as an MP3 or AAC on the iPod .
You press some other button sequence to hear the metadata .
If you want , you can set an option in iTunes to speak the metadata before every song .
Of course you can choose the voice you want to use , etc .
I believe that both could be implemented with just a software update , without altering the iPod hardware .
You do n't need a new button , you can use a sequence of existing ones , such as double - click on the ' play ' button .
Or the rarely - used battery check button .
Note if you use these button sequences on an iPod that has n't been updated , there are no ill effects .
So go ahead , Steve ; I grant you rights to these ideas , free of charge .
Ipod Shuffle
The Martin Shuffle
The two ideas above are good if you want to identify a song , but not if you want to find a song .
But for that my friend Charles Martin came up with an idea that works with no hardware or software changes needed .
I call it the Martin Shuffle , and it works like this :
In iTunes , sort your playlist by song title or artist , whichever you think you will want to search for .
Now on your iPod , suppose you want to find something .
To make it concrete , suppose you want to find Something .
First you listen to the current song long enough to identify it .
If it is alphabeticly close ( say , Someone to Watch Over Me or Summertime ) you press the ' next ' or ' previous ' song button in sequential ( non- shuffle ) mode until you arrive at your target .
If the current song is far away ( say , Funkytown ) you go into shuffle mode and hit the ' next ' button ( thereby randomly jumping to another song ) until you do get close ; then switch to non-shuffle mode .
Note this is a randomized algorithm ; you use randomness to solve a deterministic problem faster than you could without randomness .
So now there are two questions : how close do you have to get before you switch to non-shuffle mode , and how long will it take , on average , to find a song with this approach ?
Charles Martin
Randomized Algorithms
Markov Decision Processes to the Rescue
What we need is a policy for when to hit the shuffle button and when to switch to the sequential button .
The tricky part is that shuffling is random -- can we determine the optimal policy when we do n't know where we 'll end up ?
It turns out that we can if we treat this as a Markov Decision Process , or MDP .
In an MDP you need to define the following : States .
For the iPod , the state is just the current song , so if there are N songs , there are N states .
For a 1GB iPod Shuffle , assume N = 250 .
.
For the iPod , the state is just the current song , so if there are songs , there are states .
For a 1GB iPod Shuffle , assume = 250 .
Actions .
We define two actions : Shuffle and Sequential .
We define the sequential action as moving all the way to the target ( rather than moving just one position towards the target ) ; it is a single action consisting of multiple button presses .
.
We define two actions : and .
We define the sequential action as moving all the way to the target ( rather than moving just one position towards the target ) ; it is a single action consisting of multiple button presses .
Transitions .
For each ( action , state ) pair , we enumerate the possible states that the model might transition to , each with a probability .
For Sequential we always transition to the target .
For Shuffle we transition to each of the other states with equal probability .
.
For each ( action , state ) pair , we enumerate the possible states that the model might transition to , each with a probability .
For we always transition to the target .
For we transition to each of the other states with equal probability .
Costs .
For each transition there is an assoicated cost .
We 'll measure the cost in seconds , and assume that Sequential costs 1 second per button press .
Shuffle takes somewhat longer , because you have to stop to identify the song and remember where it is in alphabetical order .
Let 's call it T seconds , and consider values of T from 1 to 10 .
Now the basic idea for finding the optimal policy in an MDP is simple :
For each state of the problem , choose the action that minimizes the sum of the cost of the action and the expected cost of getting from the resulting state to the target .
We will follow tradition and use the notation V[s ] , where V stands for value , to denote the cost of a state , but these really are costs : low numbers are better .
Once we solve an equation for V[s ] we can easily determine the optimal policy .
First assume that the target song is number N/2 .
( We can do this without loss of generality because the songs are actually arranged in a circle , not a line segment : from the last song you can go forward to the first .
So the numbering is arbitrary because every point on a circle is isomorphic . )
Then the cost of a state is the minimum of the cost of sequentially moving to the target ( which is the absolute value of the distance to the target , |s - t| ) and the cost of shuffling and then finding the way to the target ( which is T plus the average cost of wherever we end up by shuffling ) : V[s ] = min( |s - t| , T + ( 1/N ) Σ r V[r ]
The Value Iteration Algorithm
We can't directly solve this equation because V appears on both left and right hand sides : the value of a state is defined in terms of the values of other states .
So how do we break the loop ?
It turns out the equation can be solved by an algorithm called value iteration that starts with an initial guess for all V[s ] and then updates the guesses repeatedly , until there are no more changes ( or until all changes are smaller than epsilon ) .
This iterative algorithm is guaranteed to converge .
To initialize the estimates of V for each state let 's just assume you always use the Sequential strategy and thus each V[s ] is the absolute value of s - t .
To update the value for a state , we check to see if we could do better by switching to the Shuffle strategy .
The expected value of Shuffle is the cost T of shuffling and identifying the resulting song , plus the average value of the V[r ] for each possible resulting state r ( which I originally thought was every state except the current state , but an interesting article by Brian E. Hansen convinced me that it is possible to randomly skip from a song to the same song ) .
A.A. Markov
Coding a Solution
We can now show some code for valueiteration on the iPod problem .
( You can also see code for a general MDP solver . ) def valueiteration ( N , T , epsilon=0.001 ) : t = N/2 states = range ( N ) V1 = [ abs ( s - t ) for s in states ] V2 = [ 0.0 for s in states ] while max ( [ abs ( V2[s ] - V1[s ] ) for s in states ] ) > epsilon : shufflecost = T + avg ( [ V1 [r ] for r in states ] ) for s in states : V2 [s ] = min( abs ( s - t ) , shufflecost ) V1 , V2 = V2 , V1 return V2 This is Python code ; if you 're not familiar with Python you should know that [ abs ( s - t ) for s in states ] iterates s over each element of states and collects the values of abs ( s - t ) into a list .
Also , range ( N ) returns a list of the numbers from 0 to N - 1 , inclusive , and V1 , V2 = V2 , V1 swaps V2 and V1 .
All assignment in Python is done by moving pointers , not by creating copies of objects .
The rest you should be able to figure out .
Besides valueiteration , all we need is a trivial function to compute the average ( mean ) of a sequence of numbers , and a main function that calls valueiteration and prints out some statistics on the results : def avg ( nums ) : return float ( sum ( nums ) ) / len( nums ) def main ( N=250 , Ts= [ 1,5,10 ] ) : global V t = N / 2 for T in Ts : V = valueiteration ( N , T ) print ' T=%d ( N= %d ) == > shuffle when %d or more away ' % ( T , N , (t - min ( [s for s in range ( N ) if V[s ] == t- s ] ) ) ) print ' Mean : %.1f , Median : %.1 f ; Max : %.1f ' % ( avg ( V ) , sorted ( V ) [ N/2 ] , max ( V ) ) print

What is it ?
del.icio.us direc.tor is a prototype for an alternative web - based rich UI for del.icio.us .
It leverages the XML and XSL services of modern browsers to deliver a responsive interface for managing user accounts with a large number of records .
The main features are :
In - browser handling of del.icio.us bookmarks ( tested up to 12,000 records )
Find - as - you - type searching of all your bookmarks , with basic search operators
Sort by description , tags , or timestamp
Ad -hoc tag browser
Coverage of this feature around the web :
How do I use it ?
Because of the restrictions on the browser , you 'll need to load this using a Javascript bookmarklet .
Follow these four steps to get started :
Create a bookmarklet by bookmarking the following link : del.icio.us direc.tor Go to api.del.icio.us
Launch the bookmark you just created while you are still on the del.icio.us page Login to del.icio.us , if prompted
( Try the static demo if you do n't have a del.icio.us account . )
Type in a search term or click a tag in the browser ; click the column headings to sort
NOTE : This only works on Firefox and Internet Explorer .
Safari wo n't work because it does n't support XSLT via Javascript .
Supported operators
direc.tor supports the following operators :
t :< search_term >
Search only in tag field
Ex : t:humor d:< search_term >
Search only in description field
Ex : d:politics -< search_term >
Exclude results containing search term
Ex : - microsoft
Combining operators , like - t : nonsense , is currently not supported .
How does it work ?
The idea behind a client - side web service broker ( or intermediary , as Jon Udell calls it ) is simple : assist a client in interpreting or processing information from a service , but letting the client do all the work ( just like what " strategic management consultants " do ) .
Unlike other web services like Amazon Light or Googlism that execute all of the program logic on the server side , a client - side broker sends all of the logic over as Javascript and has the browser do the work .
Other brokering services like the Google Maps hack are not entirely self - contained and require the broker host to proxy information between the main server and the client , thus doubling the amount of network traffic and degrading the overall performance .
direc.tor eliminates the need for the broker host to proxy requests by instructing the client to directly communicate with the main server .
This approach is very similar to the way Greasemonkey scripts are loaded , except that it is largely platform independent and does not require additional client - side extensions like Greasemonkey .
However , the major pitfall to this approach is that users are required to manually create the bookmarklet .
In a standard service , the Client Browser makes a request to the Service Broker ( 1 ) , which in turn makes a request to the Web Service ( 2 ) .
The response from the Web Service is then transformed by the Service Broker , and presented to the Client Browser ( 3 ) .
In a client - side service , the Client Browser gets the entire service logic from the Service Broker ( 1 ) , and then communicates directly with the Web Service ( 2 ) .
Loading the service
This project uses the only reliable loophole for executing foreign Javascript code : the bookmarklet bootloader .
It works by inserting a < script > element directly into the DOM , which is then immediately executed by the browser .
The injected Javascript wipes the existing del.icio.us page and replaces the entire body with the direc.tor UI .
At the same time , direc.tor makes an XmlHTTPRequest to http://del.icio.us/api/posts/all to get the XML listing of the user 's bookmarks , which is persisted through the lifetime of the direc.tor page .
Because del.icio.us uses the standard HTTP basic authentication , the browser will automatically ask for credentials if it has not been established yet .
Since the client is communicating directly with del.icio.us , those credentials never pass through this site .
For more information about this , and cross - site scripting concerns , see Creating a client - side web service broker .
Filtering and sorting the bookmarks
Performance is the primary concern — and often a severely limiting factor — when developing an in - browser application that handles large amounts of data .
Filtering and sorting recordsets over 10,000 records though traditional Javascript objects is so sluggish that it simply is not a viable solution .
del.icio.us direc.tor bypasses that limitation by leveraging the speed of the XML and XSL processors accessible via Javascript in modern browsers .
Because these components are compiled binaries , their methods are orders of magnitude faster than an equivalent implementation in intepreted Javascript .
del.icio.us direc.tor offloads all of the heavy lifting and a majority of the HTML generation to the XSLT processor to provide a responsive user interface .
Since this is a rather lengthy discussion in and of itself , I have moved it to its own article : Using XSLT to filter and sort records in the browser .
Implementing the tag browser
Although it seems that the tag browser does n't display a great deal of information , it too cannot be implemented with efficiency using straight Javascript .
The main reason is that the tags and their relationship to the bookmarks can't be indexed in a way that allows fast retrieval .
Brute force approaches work fine when the record count is around 1000 or so , but at 10,000 records the processing time becomes prohibitive .
Again , I use the compiled XML resources to tackle the heavy lifting and allow direc.tor to handle large record sets .
Another structure that is essential is an adjacency list , which allows for the fast , indexed retrieval of a tag and its related tags .
The major hurdle is not doing the initial retrieval of tags , but finding tags that have more than one other tag in common , i.e .
" Show me all the tags that appear with the tag ' blog ' and ' photo ' . "
The brute force approach would cycle through all of the records , return those that contain the tag ' blog ' , cycle through that subset in search of ' photo ' , and then finally list and count all of the remaining tags that are n't ' blog ' or ' photo ' .
Instead , direc.tor uses a single XPath query to pull out the subset of tags :
//posts/post[contains( string( @tag ) , ' blog ' ) and contains ( string ( @tag ) , ' photo ' ) ]
Once that subset of nodes is returned by the XML engine , the tags from each node are inserted into a modified adjacency list , represented as a hashtable of hashtables in Javascript .
The subset of nodes returned is almost always signifcantly smaller than the entire record set , making subsequent Javascript operations responsive enough for a decent user experience .
The outer hashtable is keyed by tag name , such that every tag that exists in the current node set is represented .
The inner hashtables store the related tags and the number of occurences .
Example :
This diagram represents a bookmark collection that has a total of 6 unique tags : blog , design , css , photo , cool , politics .
The outer hashtable ( left ) uses each of those tags as its keys , while its values are hashtables that contain the key tag and any tag that is related .
The values of those inner hashtables represent the total count of each tag and its occurence with the outer tag .
The hashtable 's fast key - based retrieval makes it an ideal indexer for storing the tag counts , and fulfilling the tag requests from the user .
Getting a list of tags is accomplished by enumerating over the hashtable keys , and getting the tag counts involves retrieving the values from the inner hashtables .
Highlighting the search terms
The search term highlighting is currently implemented using Javascript , by way of a generic search and replace method that wraps search terms with a < span > tag .
The method then assigns one of the 6 CSS colors that are defined in the stylesheet .
I 'm sure that it could also be done in XSL , but I was unable to create out a template that would highlight multiple query terms that occur in a random order ( if you have one , I 'd love to see it ) .
Because of Javascript performance limitations , single letter query terms are not highlighted .
The highlighting takes place in the pipeline after the XSL transformation , but before the DOM node is actually brought online and painted in the browser ( this is good general practice , as editing live DOM objects is horrifically slow . )
What else could this do ?
There are probably hundreds of other features that would be cool to implement , so here are some that I would implement if I had more time :
Bulk tag editing : Enable tag addition and removal from multiple bookmarks ( which would then give me an excuse to implement the fancy fade anything technique ) .
Enable tag addition and removal from multiple bookmarks ( which would then give me an excuse to implement the fancy fade anything technique ) .
Labeling : Designate a tag as a special UI flag that mimics Gmail 's " starred " functionality .
Designate a tag as a special UI flag that mimics Gmail 's " starred " functionality .
Other operators : Add OR , since : , related : , and inurl : operators .
Add , , , and operators .
Media detection : Expose media player controls for registered types , like MPG , MOV , WMV , etc .
Expose media player controls for registered types , like MPG , MOV , WMV , etc. RSS import : Expand the input processor to parse RSS feeds , i.e. other people 's tags .
Expand the input processor to parse RSS feeds , i.e. other people 's tags .
XML export : Allow download of an XML version of a current search , or all bookmarks .
Allow download of an XML version of a current search , or all bookmarks .
Link autopreview : Enable an Outlook - style bookmark preview pane .
Enable an Outlook - style bookmark preview pane .
OS X Dashboard integration : Port direc.tor to a Dashboard widget .
The ultimate feature , though , would be to integrate some of this project directly into del.icio.us in order to eliminate the bootloading process altogether .
I 'm sure all you cats on delicious - discuss can come up with a collective feature list .
I did this project to research different interface possibilities on other projects , so by all means , let me know if you 're interested in helping make this a more mature service .
Thanks go to the DHTML grandmaster , Nick Mealy , and VMWare guru , John Zedlewski , for their help with this project .
The US copyright office will permit mobile phone subscribers to unlock their phones , allowing them to be used by rival network providers .
It 's a right that 's taken for granted in most of the GSM world , where there 's little operators can do to stop it .
But US carriers , being the enlightened souls that they are ( lowest form of wit - ed. ) used fear created by the 1998 Digital Millenium Copyright
Act to prevent unlocking .
The DMCA outlawed the circumvention of technological protection measures on copyright works - with few exemptions .
It promised to permit the US Congress ' copyright office to review these exemptions from time to time .
Now , in its third review of permissible DMCA exemptions , the US Congress ' copyright librarian has lifted the fear of prosecution from unlockers :
" Computer programs in the form of firmware that enable wireless telephone handsets to connect to a wireless telephone communication network , when circumvention is accomplished for the sole purpose of lawfully connecting to a wireless telephone communication network . "
Another new exemption has been introduced for security researchers investigating DRM on sound recordings , or videos with sound recordings , that are distributed on CD .
You can thank hapless Sony , who distributed the notorious " rootkit " - style DRM last year , for raising the profile of that issue .
The measure permits researchers to circumvent copyright protection measures - " ... when circumvention is accomplished solely for the purpose of good faith testing , investigating , or correcting such security flaws or vulnerabilities . "
That 's the end of the good news .
When the last review of DMCA exemptions took place in 2003 , researcher Seth Finkelstein won an exemption for similar researchers , and academics , investigating censorware blacklists .
( This is a subject close to our hearts : in 2001 a censorware company blocked access to The Register for millions of readers because it did n't like a story we 'd written about one of their products . )
Until Finkelstein's exemption , it was illegal to figure out what sites the censorware companies were blocking - and they did n't have to tell you .
The " filter " vendor was cop , jury and hanging judge .
( You can read the new exemptions here , and compare them to the 2003 list ) .
Seth decided not to pursue the issue this time round , citing the stress of facing legal threats and personal harassment in his lonely crusade - as he explained here .
Amazingly , no one amongst the law schools , think tanks and " activist " community - who rarely miss the opportunity to talk about free speech - stepped in to take his place and challenge the blacklist companies .
As a result , the exemption has been lost .
Seems like it 's easier to talk about freedom , than actually fight for it . ®
Science told : hands off gay sheep .
It 's hard to think of a headline more joyous than this classic from the Sunday Times .
Apparently Professor Charles Roselli is conducting gruesome experiments on sheep in the name of eradicating homosexuality .
Unfortunately this story , co-written by Isabelle Oakeshott - deputy political editor no less - is little more than dystopian fantasy , conjured up by a pressure group to drive an agenda .
We 'll open with its big hitter .
" The animals ' skulls are cut open and electronic sensors are attached to their brains . "
It sounds gruesome .
But it 's simply not true .
There 's no neurophysiology in these experiments at Oregon State University .
They measure mate preference by watching the sheep choose a mate .
Cilla Black does not open up Blind Date contestants ' skulls to attach sensors to their brains ( disappointingly in some respects ) and they do n't do it in these experiments either .
From this point the ST goes rapidly downhill .
" By varying the hormone levels , " it continues , " mainly by injecting hormones into the brain , they have had ' considerable success ' in altering the rams ' sexuality , with some previously gay animals becoming attracted to ewes . "
This is not just completely untrue , it is , in fact , the opposite of what the researchers did .
The only similar work completed and published by them was about trying to make " straight " animals " gay " ( they avoid those terms ) and in any case , that experiment was negative : it failed to achieve this aim .
I could go on : even the details are wrong .
" Initially , the publicly funded project aimed to improve the productivity of herds ... "
Wrong .
" The research is being peer - reviewed by a panel of scientists in America ... "
Wrong .
But most bizarre is the suggestion that the research was somehow ultimately about making gay people straight .
The assertion is at the top of the article : " Scientists are conducting experiments to change the sexuality of ' gay ' sheep in a programme that critics fear could pave the way for breeding out homosexuality in humans . "
Here 's a news flash : we cleared up the question of Lamarckian inheritance of acquired traits 100 years ago .
Even if you could intervene to make a gay human straight , you might reasonably expect this to make any inherited tendency towards homosexuality more prevalent , not less .
Almost all the misinformation and misunderstandings in this ST piece appeared first in a Peta ( People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ) campaign .
The blogosphere has already run ( six months ago ) - and then subsequently retracted - Peta 's Roselli story .
There are interesting discussions to have about theoretical research into sexual behaviour , but I 'm not even going to start here because these are matters for us all , not just scientists or medics like me .
It was a funny headline .
But the biggest barrier to a sensible discussion is inaccurate prejudice , slander , and disinformation .

THE REAL AIPAC SPY RING STORY --IT WAS ALL ABOUT IRAN
Here 's what the stories in today 's Washington Post and New York Times on the new indictments of the two AIPAC spies are n't telling you : their espionage was principally about helping to prepare an attack by Israel on Iran .
And one of the Israeli embassy officials who knows all about AIPAC 's role in helping plan the attack on Iran has been whisked out of the country and out of the reach of U.S. prosecutors , the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reports this morning .
The neo-cons in the Pentagon had long been arguing for an attack on Iran to take out its nuclear facilities that had the potential to be converted for development of nuclear weapons .
Wolfie 's man Doug Feith ( below left ) had been particularly assiduous in pressing the case for a " forward strategy " against Iran .
Feith 's views are madly extremist , and Jim Zogby collected them in an April profile of Feith that should scare the pants off of anyone rational .
( Feith 's been a major activist for years with the viciously anti-Arab crazies of the ZOA , the Zionist Organization of America ) .
When , for purely electoral reasons with the Iraq occupation going so disastrously , the White House decided against a direct attack by the U.S. on Iran , the neo-cons went to Plan B -- an attack on Iran by proxy , from Israel .
The principal classified documents leaked to Israel through AIPAC -- the leaks that that began the investigation of the AIPAC spy ring , which has been going on now for over a year -- concerned Iran .
They were leaked by Feith 's deputy , Larry Franklin , also now under a five - count indictment for spying .
( At right , Feith and Franklin )
The plan for an Israeli attack on Iran has been long envisioned -- both in Washington and by Sharon 's government -- but this attack is now in a highy advanced state of planning and could come as quickly as Sharon snaps his fingers to order it .
Back on March 13 , the London Times -- in a report that was largely ignored in the U.S. -- reported that : " The inner cabinet of Ariel Sharon , the Israeli prime minister , gave ' initial authorisation ' for an attack at a private meeting last month on his ranch in the Negev desert , "
The London Times went on to describe how "
Israeli forces have used a mock - up of Iran ’s Natanz uranium enrichment plant in the desert to practise destroying it .
Their tactics include raids by Israel ’s elite Shaldag ( Kingfisher ) commando unit and airstrikes by F - 15 jets from 69 Squadron , using bunker - busting bombs to penetrate underground facilities .
if all international efforts to halt Iranian nuclear projects failed .
And , the Times added , " US officials warned last week that a military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities by Israeli or American forces had not been ruled out should the issue become deadlocked at the United Nations . "
Just a few weeks before that revelation of the concretization of Israeli plans for the Iran attack , Bush let the cat out of the bag in an off - the - cuff remark captured by London 's Daily Telegraph , in a February 18 article headlined , " AMERICA WOULD BACK ISRAEL ATTACK ON IRAN . "
The Telegraph reported that Bush said : " Clearly , if I was the leader of Israel and I 'd listened to some of the statements by the Iranian ayatollahs that regarded the security of my country , I 'd be concerned about Iran having a nuclear weapon as well .
And in that Israel is our ally , and in that we 've made a very strong commitment to support Israel , we will support Israel if her security is threatened . "
( Above right , Bush at AIPAC 's Convention ) .
Noting that Bush had gone off the reservations and failed to follow his handlers ' brefing to stick to the agreed - on script , the Telegraph dryly noted : " His comments appeared to be a departure from the administration 's line that there are no plans to attack at present and that Washington backs European diplomatic efforts .
The remarks may have reflected Mr Bush 's personal thinking on an issue causing deep concern in Washington .... "
Bush 's slip - of - the - tongue that revealed his real intentions was front - page news in Le Monde and other European dailies -- but got no attention in the Stateside major media .
At the time Feith 's deputy Franklin ( and , today 's indictments say , two other as yet unidentified Pentagon officials ) were passing the classified documents on Iran to AIPAC for transmission to Israel , the White House had not yet given the green light to Sharon -- indeed , the Iran attack was in a holding pattern pending the outcome of negotiations over Teheran 's nuke capacity being led by the European powers which , unlike the U.S. , have diplomatic relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Even so , U.S. fingerprints were all over the Israelis ' Iran attack , which had long been envisioned by U.S. policy - makers .
The respected Israeli daily Ha'aretz spelled it out last September 13 , reporting : " The Clinton administration laid the foundation for that option [ of attacking Iran ] by giving the Rabin government the okay to purchase , with coupons , the F - 15I ( dubbed " Thunder " in Israel ) .
The Bush administration will complete the task by agreeing to give Israel air - to - surface munitions that will breach the mysteries of the nuclear network in the depths of Isfahan and other sites , far more concealed than the reactor that is on worldwide display at Bushehr .
What the Americans are unable to do , because of European , United Nations and Congressional pressure , Israel will do . "
The indictment of the two senior AIPAC staffers follows the indictment in may of Feith 's footpad Larry Franklin .
Franklin worked in the Office of Special Plans , run by then - Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , who reported to then - Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz .
The OSP functioned as a " shadow " intelligence service on Iraq , and provided much of the information to the White House that was used to justify the American invasion of Iraq .
Some wags have called it " Feith - based intelligence " , since much of that intelligence and information has now been proven to be utterly false .
At the beginning of May , Franklin was arrested by the FBI for the passing of classified documents to two AIPAC staffers , who were then to pass them to Israel .
The documents in question concerned Iran .
One of the two newly - indicted AIPACers is n't just anybody .
Steve Rosen , 63 , is the man who built AIPAC into the $ 40 million dollar Capitol Hill powerhouse it is today .
( At right , AIPAC 's 2005 banquet -- featured speaker , Hillary Clinton ) .
Buried in a Washington Post profile of AIPAC from May 19 is the skinny on Rosen as the power behind the scenes at AIPAC .
Said the Post :
" For more than two decades , Rosen has been a mainstay of AIPAC and the architect of the group 's ever - increasing clout .
Though Rosen was listed below Executive Director Howard Kohr on AIPAC 's organizational chart , people familiar with AIPAC 's history say that Kohr is a protege of Rosen 's and got that job with his help .
Kohr declined to be interviewed about Rosen .
' He [ Rosen ] is a quiet guy , ' said M.J. Rosenberg , director of policy analysis for the Israel Policy Forum , another pro-Israel group , and a former AIPAC employee .
' But everyone knows he's the brains behind the outfit . ' "
Now , just what is AIPAC , you may well ask ?
AIPAC is the enforcer of the knee - jerk support for the Israeli government which characterizes the political and governing classes in this country , -- Israel is the real third rail of American politics : touch it with criticism , no matter how carefully couched , and you die .
Both the Democratic and Republican parties fall all over themselves to kiss AIPAC 's boots -- because AIPAC and its well - filled war - chest helps make sure they toe the line on Israel , and has been responsible for the defeat of a significant number of politicians over the years who dared to criticize Israeli policies .
Earlier this year , AIPAC played a major role in destroying the candidacy of Tim Roemer for chairman of the DNC .
There 's an in - depth , critical profile of AIPAC by RightWeb 's Michael Flynn that gives a detailed look at AIPAC 's arm - and - leg - breaking political style .
And the newly indicted Rosen is The Man Behind the Curtain .
Even though he formally resigned from AIPAC , the organization is paying his legal bills , and Rosen is still pulling the strings .
( Above left , cartoon representing Ariel Sharon , in drag , being chased in a race between the Republicans and Democrats -- with AIPAC wielding the starters ' gun . ) .
The reason for putting some daylight between Rosen and AIPAC is that the puissant political arm - twister is deathly afraid it will be forced to register as a foreign lobby , as the Jewish weekly The Forward reported earlier this year .
Americans do n't like the sight of their elected officials pocketing campaign cash from foreign governments , and AIPAC fears being forced to register formally as a lobbyist for Israel would thus diminish their clout on Capitol Hill .
Bush wo n't make AIPAC register , and the spineless Democratic Congressional leadership wo n't lead the charge to make them do so either .
But today 's indictments of string - puller Rosen and his AIPAC colleague for spying on the U.S. gives progressives who want to see a peaceful , two - state , land - for - peace solution between Israel and Palestine a strategic opening to press loudly for AIPAC 's formal registration as a shil for the government that built the Israeli Wall of Shame .
It 's a measure long past due .
One of the Israeli diplomats the feds want to question about the activities of the AIPAC spy ring has been quietly spirited out of the country , Ha'aretz reports this morning .
" The Israeli diplomat in Washington who met several times with Franklin has been identified as Naor Gilon , head of the political department at the Israeli Embassy in Washington and a specialist on proliferation issues .
Gilon returned to Israel a few days ago as ' part of a long - scheduled rotation ' according to an Israeli official in Washington .
U.S. investigators want to question Gilon and other Israeli diplomats about their contacts with Franklin , officials said , " according to the Israeli daily .

In April 2005 , AIPAC policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior Iran analyst Keith Weissman were fired by AIPAC amid an FBI investigation into whether they passed classified U.S. information received from Franklin on to the government of Israel .
They were later indicted for illegally conspiring to gather and disclose classified national security information to Israel , AIPAC agreed to pay the legal fees for Weissman 's defense through appeal if necessary , but charges were subsequently droppedIn May 2005 , the Justice Department announced that Lawrence Anthony Franklin , a U.S. Air Force Reserves colonel working as a Department of Defense analyst at the Pentagon in the office of Douglas Feith , had been arrested and charged by the FBI with providing classified national defense information to Israel .
The six - count criminal complaint identified AIPAC by name and described a luncheon meeting in which , allegedly , Franklin disclosed top - secret information to two AIPAC officials .

Selling a new home is getting harder and harder : just ask the builders who are being forced these days to entice potential buyers with expensive inducements like free swimming pools and fancy kitchen cabinets .
At the same time , the torrid pace in the existing - home market is slackening , as prices are leveling off and properties are staying on the market a lot longer than they used to .
Adding it all together , a variety of experts now say , the housing industry appears to be moving from a boom to something that is starting to look a lot like a bust .
“ Housing has had a great five - year run , ” said Edward Yardeni , chief investment strategist for Oak Associates , a money management firm in Akron , Ohio , and a longtime bull on the economy .
While he still does not expect a housing downturn to damage the overall economy severely , he predicts that the housing industry itself is entering a longer decline .
Thanks to the commenters on the previous RX piece who recommended ruby - prof ( there ’s a gem install ) , which is a much faster and thus better profiler than the built - in one .
I learned a few more things .
The commenter who hit closest to the mark was Aristotle Pagaltzis , who references Perl lore : “ The fastest way to do something in Perl is frequently the one that implements the most costly step in the fewest ops . ”
The reasons will be obvious on a little thought , but the PerlMonks piece is worth reading .
Looping Blues ·
When I run the parser over 2,477,645 bytes of XML , because of the buffer - skipping trick it only actually has to look at 484,021 characters individually , and that loop still burns 25 % of the 13 seconds it takes on my PowerBook .
I ’ve looked at it pretty hard , sliced and diced the loop two or three different ways with the profiler , and squeezed a few improvements out , but at the end of the day , it ’s pretty simple sensible code .
For now , my conclusion is that the current Ruby implementation is just not gonna be fast enough in any algorithm that requires looking individually at a nontrivial proportion of the characters .
Packing Blues ·
The other problem is that RX internally processes XML text as an array of numeric values identifying Unicode characters ; but APIs are going to want to deal with Ruby strings , so the arrays have to be run through pack before handing data to whatever API is in use .
This hurts ; Array # pack was burning 11 % of my time .
What puzzled me was that Integer #to_int ( a no - op ) was getting called 2,354,147 times and burning another 6.59 % .
So I poked around and it turns out that any_array .
pack ( ' U* ' ) calls to_int on each element ; duck - typing culture at work .
If there were such a notion as an array known to contain only Fixnums , or a pack - type operation that was allowed to throw an exception if its arguments were n’t Fixnums , things might be better .
Now , in the case where the input is already UTF - 8 , there ’s a chance for a special - purpose hack to avoid the String -> Array -> String round - trip , but that feels both brutal and discriminatory .
Conclusion ·
The notion of picking one of the libxml or expat based Ruby libraries and maintaining it properly and blessing that as the “ right ” way to do XML in Ruby is looking better and better .
Etch is the codename for the upcoming release of Debian , which will also be known as Debian GNU / Linux 4.0 .

DIGG THIS
This talk was given at the LRC Health and Wealth Conference in Foster City , California , December 2 , 2006 .
With the Democrats taking charge in Congress , we will surely hear talk of mandatory national health insurance , more spending for health care for the poor and elderly , and more taxes on individuals and business to pay for the whole scheme .
This is admittedly not that different from what Republicans have been doing since taking over .
In some ways , Republicans are even worse , driving us to socialism in the name of market reform and other sloganeering .
Either way , we are stuck with a system that is moving the health sector ever more into the hands of the state .
There are two popular images of socialized medicine .
I do n’t think either captures what the reality is in our prosperous and largely capitalistic country .
The first image is that held by the delusional left .
They imagine that if most health care were publicly provided and administered by the state , people of all social classes , age groups , and races and sexes , would have equal access .
Enlightened public bureaucrats would make the essential decisions about health priorities .
Leftists imagine that this will save money in the long run because people will be prevented from doing things that cause them to get sick and die prematurely , such as smoke , eat fast foods , and fail to go on long nature walks .
Mostly the left - wing view is of the negative sort .
It makes them crazy , and offends their moral sense , that the rich can afford better health care than the poor .
They believe that it violates a sense of fairness that the rich have the means to live longer , healthier lives , than the poor , who are left to the mercy of life ’s exigencies .
But let ’s say that we can show that under a capitalist health market , the poor will be better off in absolute terms .
I doubt very seriously that this will satisfy the true socialist .
What bothers him is not so much bad health as the unequal access to good health .
For the same reason , the socialist is not persuaded by the argument that the poor will be richer under capitalism because they are aware that inequality will continue to exist under capitalism .
It is more important to them to reduce the well - being of the rich than it is to improve the lot of the poor , so long as the poor still constitute an identifiable class within the population .
It is because of these normative assumptions that left - socialists can rightly be called the party of envy , for their desire to destroy and expropriate is more intense than their desire to uplift .
That is to say , they are more interested in equality than general prosperity .
What Mises called the destructivism of socialist theory is merely the next step in socialist logic .
The second view of socialized medicine sees the problems with socialism , that it leads to building up a state apparatus that has life - and - death control over the population .
Because bureaucrats have no strong incentive to see to the wellbeing of people , they make decisions based on politics .
And because entrepreneurs are cut out of the picture , innovations cease to be brought to the health - care market in a way that makes them accessible .
We end up with a bureaucratically controlled nightmare in which no class in society receives the level of medical attention it would receive in a marketplace .
So far as stated , this critique is a good one .
But the opponents of health - care socialism also have in their minds a vision of what life would be like under socialism .
Mostly these visions are drawn from experiences under socialist countries that have been driven into poverty by state ownership of the means of production .
The state in these cases does not have much money .
There is no private store of wealth to speak of , and no private business that has the motivation or the means to provide customer service .
What happened in these countries is entirely predictable .
There was an undersupply of medical services just as there was an undersupply of everything else .
Yuri Maltsev tells harrowing stories of how people would suffer relentlessly in the USSR .
When the death rate per hospital would grow so as to embarrass the state , the state would simply order the rate to be lowered , just as they ordered grain production to be higher .
The hospitals would respond in perverse ways .
Instead of providing better care , they started rolling people out the door if the personnel suspected that the patient was near death .
The result was a decline in per-hospital death rates , but an overall increase in deaths .
One thing that the state has not been able to lie about is vital statistics .
The Soviet state did its best to keep them from being revealed .
But once the data were collected , the truth came out .
Between 1971 and 1986 , the Soviet state faced a calamity .
Life expectancy decreased .
Infant mortality increased .
In fact , the Soviet state stopped collecting data again .
But later , once the truth was revealed again , it turned out that infant mortality was on the increase , in some cases as much as 58 percent between 1971 and 1986 .
A similar experience was repeated in every socialized state .
Health declined .
Vital statistics did not keep up with capitalistic standards .
It is a great irony that Marx had thought socialism would be the next stage of history , following capitalism just as capitalism followed feudalism .
And yet socialism itself had been systematically driving these countries back to feudal - era forms of health care that were increasingly deprived of modern technology .
Not that these countries did n’t invest in scientific medical research .
People from the old Soviet Union said that sometimes it seemed like every fifth person had a medical degree .
Indeed , no societies in human history ever invested more in science than socialist countries did .
But they kept sinking further into the abyss .
Why ?
The problem was economic rather than technical .
You can put 10,000 government medical scientists in a gigantic cushy building , pay them all a million dollars a month , give them access to every journal and all the equipment they need , and let them invent whatever they want .
But the population will still be without .
Inventions and scientists might be a necessary condition for popular access to medical goods and services .
But they are not sufficient .
We need an economic system that can calculate the best use of resources .
It requires the division of labor and a complex capital structure for products to reach a general market .
What ’s more , not every innovation needs to go to market .
There must be a way for consumers to transmit information about their most urgent needs to producers , and there needs to be a means for producers to decide among alternative uses of resources .
In other words , there must be a system of profit and loss , which in turn must be based on private property exchange .
In short , without capitalism , medical services cannot reach the multitudes .
The experience of socialism reinforces what the theory would suggest .
We might raise the question about why it is necessary that consumers themselves be in a position to pay economically rational prices for the medical services they consume .
Would n’t it be better if everyone could just consume all the services and drugs and surgeries that they needed ?
Mises addressed this point brilliantly in 1922 .
He pointed out that that there is no clean division between sickness and health .
We ourselves are capable of making misjudgments on this matter , believing ourselves to be sick and even making ourselves sick if we so will it .
The will to health , Mises wrote , is an important determinant of our well - being .
But socialism , by pricing all services at zero , destroys the will to health and thereby generates sickness .
Here is Mises from 1922 , in a passage that was criticized for decades as being completely outlandish :
“ By weakening or completely destroying the will to be well and able to work , social insurance creates illness and inability to work ; it produces the habit of complaining ….
It is an institution which tends to encourage diseases , not to say accidents , and to intensify considerably the physical and psychic results of accidents and illnesses .
As a social institution it makes a people sick bodily and mentally or at least helps to multiply , lengthen , and intensify diseases … .
We cannot weaken or destroy the will to health without producing illness . ”
Note that he said this 42 years before the US created just such a situation .
We can observe this to some extent in the way disability law has been misused in this country .
After the Americans With Disability
Act was passed , millions of Americans found that they were themselves disabled .
So too with poverty .
The welfare state actually succeeded in driving people to adapt their life conditions to the make themselves eligible .
I ’m quite sure that if the government were to institute a Good Samaritan Office , we would find the streets strewn with people who had been beaten and robbed .
It is the nature of a government program to multiply the problem rather than solve anything .
I find it striking that after the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , virtually no effort was made to privatize health services .
To be sure , there are now private health services in these countries , but the official systems of socialized medicine still exist .
This fact is a testament to the reigning orthodoxy .
The world seems to understand that it is a mistake to nationalize agriculture and factory production .
No one advocates a Department of Software Development , even if there are far more interventions in this sector than there should be .
And yet health care , all over the world , is assumed to be a normal function of government .
In this area , as in many others , the former socialist countries — under US advice , bribes , and pressure — took social democratic economies as their models .
So they not only created a panoply of new regulatory departments , and imposed a series of destructive taxes , they also did not question the assumption that health - care provision cannot be left to the market alone .
This is despite the vast number of stories we hear about English and Canadian health care socialism , mostly having to do with a lack of innovation and a grim shortage of medical , surgical , and emergency services .
In these countries , there is much that mirrors the former Soviet experience , except in one area : their governments are not as poor .
This changes the incentive structure .
The government has incentives to spend money .
Indeed , governments win from passing money around , and that can mean making more money available rather than less , unlike in the Soviet system .
To understand this point is to add an additional factor to the way we understand socialist medical care .
It ’s time that we change our expectations concerning what socialism will look like in our future , though we have it partially now .
The key problem with socialism is that it misallocates resources , and when applied to the U.S. medical sector , this means a vast overconsumption of medical services as well as artificially high prices .
The system is carefully structured in a mercantilist way to socialize losses and privatize profits .
In this way , the largest players in the market benefit and a small group of semi-private cartels are insured against financial failure .
Let ’s take a closer look .
First , there are severe limits on the number of service providers , as there have been for a century .
We brag about the specialization we have among doctors , but what we do not have is a range of choices among levels of training .
When we want our car fixed , we can go to the dealer or we can go to another 40 places with a range of mechanics , some of whom have had extensive training and some of whom have not — a fact which may or may not reflect on the quality of their work .
In medical economics , however , we are supposed to believe that physicians are a class set apart like ordained priests with special powers .
You are either ordained to practice medicine or you are not .
The limits on the numbers — which are built into the cartel of medical schools as well as the licensure system — are nothing but a mercantilist effort to increase prices and incomes .
Of course every profession has its licensure system , but the medical one has been uniquely successful in making the barriers to practice incredibly high .
This sad situation began in the states in the 19th century , and nationally in 1910 .
Originally , our medical sector was nearly 100 % free .
It would have been inconceivable that the federal government should have ever intervened in this critical area of life .
Then came the Progressive Era , with its fashion for central planning .
The medical sector came under mercantilist control during the same period in which we got the income tax , the Federal Reserve , the direct election of Senators , the Federal Trade Commission , and US entry into World War I .
An important part of this medical cartelization was the suppression of homeopathy and other non-allopathic schools of treatment .
As an offshoot of this monopoly , we still live under the absurd system whereby doctors must give prescriptions for the drugs we want to buy .
The pharmacy industry and the doctors cling to this system for life support .
But it is an insult to consumers and a ripoff of the sick .
In a free market , you should be able to consume whatever medications you want , official or alternative , purchased in ways that accord with market demands , not government dictates .
Second , we have a third - party payment system whereby insurance companies , contracted by businesses working within government mandates , are paying the bills for services .
So the insurance company , not the patient , is the customer , with the doctor responsible to those paying him .
The mandatory aspect of the program led to a cartelization of the medical insurers , who stopped behaving like insurers and began acting like a cartelized payment system .
Hospitals were paid on a cost - plus basis .
Thus the vast artificial boom in this sector .
The insurers paid for routine and not unexpected services .
The risk pool was cobbled together in a way that had nothing to do with the actual risks .
These features all led to a vast overuse of the system that benefited the medical industry .
These features all became part of the 1960s welfarization of medicine with Medicare and Medicaid .
And the inevitable huge increases in costs have led to ever more government price caps , and patch - work interventions to keep the system afloat and its customers from engaging in political revolt .
It has also caused a general overmedicalization of the population , especially older people under institutionalized care .
Everyone has horror stories to tell of how aging people are treated by our medical system .
What strikes me as strange is how the financial incentives of hospitals and insurers are rarely considered to be a factor in the medical decisions made on their behalf .
We are all supposed to believe that our medical establishment is purely interested in human welfare .
But if we understand the financial incentives at work , we have a new window into why it is that so vast a percentage of medical resources are used to treat people in the last months of their lives .
Think of the entire field of medical ethics that has become particularly important when technology has permitted an ever greater control over the time and circumstances of death .
Everyone speaks as if the resources that are required to sustain life beyond its natural term belong to all of us to spend how we as a society have decided .
Think of the debate over Terry Schiavo , for example .
Not once in the public clamor over this tragic case was the issue of who was paying brought up .
This is a very dangerous trend .
There is no getting around the fact that the institution that is the source of funding will ultimately make the decisions on how resources are used .
The more that programs like Medicare and Medicaid pay for life extension , the more the government will be in a position to decide when a person ’s life must be sustained and when it must end .
Now , many people have written about the coming meltdown of these programs .
But not many are willing to speak about the true origins of the payment - system mess .
The medical insurance cartel got its biggest boost in World War II , when wage controls caused business to compete based on benefits rather than pay .
Here we see a direct connection between the warfare state and the welfare state .
As usual , they work hand in hand .
Third , innovations in official and alternative treatments are very seriously shackled by the FDA , an institution that overrides patients ’ freedom to choose their own treatments , and constructs its approval process to favor only the largest pharmaceutical companies .
So we face a peculiar situation in which there is an overuse of approved drugs and nonuse of needed but unapproved drugs and other remedies .
The way around this problem is to leave it to the market , but that is a solution hardly anyone wants to consider .
You might be able to argue that in past ages , a government bureaucracy was necessary to collect and assess information about a drug , and finally approve it , on grounds that consumers did not have the information to make their own decisions .
I do n’t happen to think that argument is correct , given the universal efficiency of markets over government .
But in these times , the case for bureaucracy is even more obviously incorrect .
Consumers have more medical information from more sources at their fingertips than at any time in human history .
The people who need specialized but unapproved treatments are aghast to find that the FDA is withholding approval .
Increasingly , we see cases where a manufacturer does n’t even bother to file for approval in the US .
In this context , too , we need to raise the subject of medical patents , which are nothing but government privileges given to an innovative company to prolong the period of profits that come from being the first firm to gain approval for the drug .
Patents have no justification in a free market .
There is no patent given on recipes for food , and yet that has not inhibited innovation nor diminished the quality of food at restaurants .
The high profits flowing to pharmaceutical companies from patents , combined with increasing government subsidies , have led to an untenable situation .
The prices of prescription drugs have soared by 50 % in the last 10 years .
Non-prescription drugs have gone up by 6 % , which in real terms means falling prices .
I suggest to you that this data set tells us pretty much all we need to know .
Recently , Wal - Mart made the remarkable announcement that it would begin making generic drugs available at its stores for $ 4 .
This program has been a phenomenal success .
People wonder how they can do this .
It might be true that Wal - Mart is using drugs as a loss leader , trying to get people in the store who might otherwise be going to smaller drug outlets .
If this is what they are up to , I say it ’s all to the good .
The fact is that in any market exchange , both parties benefit and human welfare improves .
The very existence of the program has pushed prices down in competitive businesses .
This is the way the market is supposed to work .
Wal - Mart has helped solve some of the problems that have been generated by the scandalous prescription drug benefit program pushed by the Bush administration .
Not only will this cost far more than the Clinton medical reform might have cost , many people have found the program itself to be a bureaucratic headache .
But with Wal - Mart we once again discover how the market comes to the rescue .
The striking fact of all of human history is how the market works around government ’s failure to solve human problems and , indeed , the market finds the way to correct for human problems that the government itself has created .
To watch the flow of history is to observe two great streams of activity .
In the private sector , we find innovation , efficiency , cost cutting , human service , dynamism , and problem solving .
In the public sector we find stagnation , bureaucracy , inefficiency , cost overruns , human coercion , and problem creating .
If the government alone had been in charge for the last 500 years , our world would look very different .
Indeed , we might have no civilization to speak of .
But fortunately the market — meaning innovating and cooperating human beings — seems to find a way around the problems that government has created .
This is nowhere more true than in the medical sector .
It is thanks to the market that there is more medical information available today than ever before in history , more life - saving techniques , more access to services , and more choice .
Ideally , we would have radical reform so that government programs would be abolished , medical cartels smashed , and medical service provision wholly privatized .
But what if that does n’t happen ?
It could be that 50 years from now , the competitive private sector , with its dazzling capacity for finding ways around every barrier , will be completely dominant in the medical industry , and those sectors that have lived off government largess will be reduced to near insignificance .
For the sake of our health and prosperity , let us hope for this as a 2nd best solution to the complete separation of health and state .
Ideally we would come to see health and medicine the way it ’s been seen in the whole of human history prior to the century of socialism .
At every level and in every sector , it should be subject to market discipline .
The money we use to purchase medical services should be private money , whether out of our own bank accounts or from charitable sources .
We need to rethink the meaning of medical insurance , which , if it exists at all , should only apply to catastrophic cases to cover life contingencies over which we have no control .
And of course we need freedom for all schools of treatment .
The path for progress here , as in every aspect of economics and civilization , lies with privatization , the elimination of restrictions and welfare , and freedom itself .

The researchers have already shown that the stretch - grown axons can be implanted into rat spinal cord and continue to grow .
Since feeding electronic signals to growing nerves can train them to perform " lost " functions , this combining of growing nerves with interfaced neurochips holds many possibilities .
If you add the right stem cells and growth factors to the mix , you may be able to do restorative wonders to the central nervous system .
Restoring control of muscles to the previously paralyzed , and restoring control of parts of the brain previously lost to injury or disease , is just the first step .
The next step is brain : electronic interface for controlling prosthetic actuators , and actuators that are completely separate from the body .
It is not difficult to imagine thought control over a look - alike robot , that can be sent as a proxy to conduct business , give lectures , or other more intriguing possibilities .

Russia 's military has been tarnished by a series of scandals
The command of the interior ministry unit denied the claims made by the Soldiers ' Mothers human rights group .
The group says it was contacted by a parent of a conscript who had been forced to work as a male prostitute .
Last year , an 18 - year - old soldier was so badly beaten that he had to have his legs and genitals amputated .
The BBC's James Rodgers in Moscow says the latest claims follow a series of scandals which have damaged the Russian army 's reputation .
A spokeswoman for the Soldiers ' Mothers , Ella Polyakova , told the BBC that in St Petersburg there was " a network of clients " who would pay for sex with soldiers .
Older servicemen are said to have forced younger conscripts into prostitution and then taken the money for themselves .
Brutality
The Sychev bullying case drew worldwide attention to Russian army abuses .
Private Andrei Sychev was forced to squat for several hours by fellow soldiers and then tied to a chair and brutally beaten up last year .
As a result he developed gangrene in his legs and genitals , which had to be amputated .
Now permanently disabled , Pte Sychev has just announced that he is to write a book about his ordeal .
Such cases have highlighted the appalling conditions suffered by some Russian service personnel at a time when Russia is seeking a greater role on the world stage , our correspondent says .
A Saudi-run school in London uses textbooks which describe Jews as monkeys and Christians as pigs , according to papers filed with an employment tribunal by a former teacher .
Teaching materials used at the King Fahd school in Acton , west London , translated from Arabic for an unfair dismissal claim against the school , say Jews " engage in witchcraft and sorcery and obey Satan " , and invite pupils to " name some repugnant characteristics of Jews " and to give examples of worthless religions , such as Judaism and Christianity .
Colin Cook , 57 , a British convert to Islam who taught English at the school for 19 years until he was dismissed last December , said pupils had been heard saying they wanted to kill Americans , that 9/11 was good , and that Osama bin Laden was a hero .
He is claiming £ 100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal , race discrimination and victimisation .
The school was originally set up to educate the children of Arab diplomats , but most of its 750 pupils are now British Muslims .
It teaches Wahhabism , the dominant faith in Saudi Arabia , which is an extreme form of Islam that insists on a literal interpretation of the Qur'an .
Mr Cook 's solicitor , Lawrence Davies , said he was taking the " extraordinary step " of issuing a statement because British pupils were being put at risk .
" We are concerned at the fact that these racist textbooks are being taught in a Saudi - funded school to British pupils and to date no school inspection by Ofsted has identified this appalling practice . "
The teacher , who earned £ 35,000 a year , says he blew the whistle to Edexcel , the examinations body , after children were allowed to refer to their annotated texts in an English language exam in breach of the rules .
The school denies his allegations and claims he was rightly dismissed for misconduct .
His tribunal hearing is expected to be held later this year .
Will Self ’s new novel , “ The Book of Dave ” ( Bloomsbury USA ) , is about a London cabdriver who inadvertently founds a religion when a ranting diatribe he buries in the garden of his ex-wife is dug up five centuries later , in a now post - apocalyptic world , and becomes a sacred text .
Mr. Self ’s own text is immensely learned in cabbie lore and even creates a cab - based “ Clockwork Orange ” - like language , in which the sun is the “ foglamp , ” for example , and the moon an “ édlite . ”
When Mr. Self recently traveled to New York , however , he did not take a taxi from his house in South London to Heathrow .
He walked the whole 26 miles .
Upon arriving in New York , he walked from Kennedy Airport to the nearby Crowne Plaza Hotel — a journey more perilous than he expected , because it involved a nighttime traverse of expressways with no curbs .
The next morning Mr. Self , who is unusually tall and very thin and has a long , melancholy face that he once described as looking “ like a bag full of genitals , ” packed his knapsack , rolled a cigarette and , puffing from a Hunter Thompson - style cigarette holder , set off on foot for Manhattan .
Smoking is Mr. Self ’s only remaining vice .
He used to be a prodigious drinker and drug - taker , famous for late - night altercations , not always coherent public appearances and marathon hours at trendy spots like the Groucho Club .
During Britain ’s general election of 1997 , he set a new standard for journalistic infamy by getting himself bounced off John Major ’s campaign plane for snorting heroin in the bathroom .
Az Apple Computer megmutatta a világnak , hogy egy operációs rendszer is lehet szép , a Microsoft megpróbálja utánozni az Apple dizájnguruit , a nyílt forráskódú fejlesztők meg esélyesek arra , hogy mindannyiójukat lekörözzék .
Kipróbáltuk a háromdimenziós Xgl kezelőfelületet .
Sok ezer alkalmazással vértezték fel a Suse Linux 9.3 oprendszert , hogy legyőzze legfőbb riválisát , és még a hardvereket is jól felismeri .
Linuxon is van háromdimenziós kezelőfelület , a nemrég bemutatott Xgl , amely a számítógép grafikus processzorát használja , így a teljesítmény romlása nélkül is megjelenhetnek félig áttetsző objektumok és tárhatású látványelemek .
Alapvetően parasztvakítás , de van gyakorlati haszna is , mert ezzel a módszerrel gyorsan lehet megjeleníteni az ablakokat meg a szövegeket , ráadásul ezek az elemek minőségromlás nékül nagyíthatóvá válnak .
Azért is fontos az új technika , mert könnyen elképzelhető , hogy a jövő grafikus kártyáiban egyáltalán nem lesz kétdimenziós megjelenítési mód , csak háromdé .
Hekkre fel !
Halvány elképzelésem sem volt arról , hogy honnan kell letölteni a három dimenziós kezelőfelületet , de a Google segítségével rögtön megtaláltam az Xgl telepítéséről szóló hivatalos leírást az OpenSuse közösségi fejlesztői oldalán .
Első ránézésre egyszer űnek tűnt a feladat , mégsem volt az .
Az első akadály az volt , hogy az általam használt OpenSuse 10.1 béta operációs rendszer egyáltalán nem volt felkészítve a 3d-s kezel őfelület fogadására , ezért le kellett töltenem a GeForce 6600 GT videokártyához egy hivatalos linuxos drivert az Nvidia weboldaláról , amelyet azonnal meg is kellett szerelnem egy hibajavítással - enélkül képtelen volt feltelepülni .
Legalább egy órán át szöszmötöltem a javítással , mert bár a telepítő parancsok ott voltak a hivatalos leírásban , nem működtek .
Végül egy fórumbejegyzésben találtam megoldást .
Ezt követően felgyorsult a folyamat , már csak három lépést kellett megtennem : letölteni és telepíteni az Xgl futtatásához szükséges csomagokat , beállítani a rendszert , hogy induláskor az Xorg kezel őfelület helyett az Xgl töltődjön be , és bejelentkezés után el kellett indítani a látványos képhatásokat .
Az első lépés csak néhány kattintás volt , a második lépésnél egy fontos rendszerfájlban kellett átírni egy sort , majd számomra tökéletesen ismeretlen parancsokat kellett lefuttatni .
Index .hu háromdében
Először nem sikerült tökéletesen beindítani a 3d-s rendszert , például egyáltalán nem tudtam megmozdítani az ablakokat , majd amikor a rendszerfájlokban turkálva megpróbáltam kijavítani a hibát , sikerült tökéletesen elrontanom mindent .
Amikor az újraindítás után nem csúcstechnikás grafikus kezelőfelület fogadott , hanem egy ASCII karakterekből összetákolt hibaüzenet , majdnem sírva fakadtam , és megesküdtem , hogy soha többé nem foglalkozom Linuxszal , a hosszú órákig tartó küzdelemmel úgyis csak magamat szívatom meg .
Aztán a leírás alapján ú jra végigcsináltam a telepítési folyamatot , legalább négyszer ugyanaz a hibaüzenet sokkolt , majd egyszer csak - fogalmam sincs , hogy mitől - minden helyreállt , és az ablakok nemcsak mozdíthatók lettek , hanem még hullámzottak is , mint amikor egy szőnyeget ráznak .
Nem gyűrt le a kódcunami .
Legyen
Ön is dizájnguru !
E telepítési hercehurcából még véletlenül sem szabad arra következtetni , hogy a Linux rendszergazdáknak való .
Az Xgl kísérleti rendszer , amelynek a használatát az OpenSuse projekt mögött álló Novell egyelőre nem támogatja .
Viszont könnyen elképzelhető , hogy az Xgl hamarosan több rajongót szerez , mint a Mac OS X valaha , Steve Jobs nagyra tartott operációs rendszere ugyanis csupán egy jól összerakott rendszer , amelyet zseniális , de zárt körben fejlesztett kezelőfelülettel szereltek föl .
Áttetsző ablakkeret
Több mint valószínű , hogy a Novell is össze tud rakni egy jó rendszert , és bár a cég elismeri , hogy három dimenziós kezelőfelületének bizonyos részeit mások találták ki , könnyen lekörözheti riválisait .
Az Xgl projekt ugyanis nyílt forráskódú , azaz bárki hozzáteheti a tudását , és e nyitottság nagyban elősegíti a forradalmian új 3D kezelőfelületek kialakulását is .
Bárkiből lehet Steve Jobs .

In its zeal to rid the world of the scourge of music sharing over peer - to - peer networks , the RIAA has unleased a barrage of lawsuits over a span of two - plus years .
Two defendants are fighting back : one by exploring whether the record industry uses file sharing apps themselves , and another by insisting that a name and IP address is n't sufficient basis for a lawsuit .
We talked to a lawyer involved in one of the cases to get some additional insight into what 's at stake here .
UMG v. Lindor : does the music industry use P2P ?
In the case of UMG v. Lindor , the defendants are asking some tough questions of the RIAA about its own use of p2 p networks for sending music to radio stations , questions that the RIAA does n't want to answer .
The case covers familiar ground : the RIAA discovers an IP address involved in file sharing , attempts to tie it to somebody , and then offers that individual a chance to settle out of court .
On many occasions , the would - be defendants decide to write a four - digit check to the RIAA and make the problem go away .
In a few cases , the defendants have decided to fight back , with mixed results .
With UMG v. Lindor , the defendant is taking a hitherto unseen course : investigating the possible use of P2P network by RIAA member companies .
On July 25 , the judge directed UMG Recordings Inc. to answer a defendant 's interrogatory concerning P2P usage by its employees .
The RIAA objected to this line of questioning in part on the grounds that it was " not relevant to the claim or defense of any party , " " not relevant to the subject matter involved in this action , " and is not " reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence . "
The RIAA finally did answer the questions after a fashion .
Instead of divulging whether the employees of record labels had used P2P networks , the plaintiffs merely replied that the two in - house lawyers they contacted and the head of procurement said that the record label has never registered accounts .
The response ( PDF ) submitted by the RIAA to the court says that since they have not used " file - sharing programs " such as Kazaa to provide music to radio stations , " they therefore " have no documents in their possession , custody , or control that are responsive to this Request . "
Ray Beckerman , the attorney for the defendant , is upset , saying that RIAA deliberately narrowed the judge 's instructions to cover the conduct of the labels themselves , rather than its employees , as the interrogatory had directed .
Beckerman informed Ars Technica that the record labels have been encouraging P2P file sharing , with employees of the record labels using it to get songs out to radio stations .
Radio station DJs have told Beckerman that the labels have quit sending them CDs .
" Historically , the radio promo guys used to come around [ to the radio stations ] with CDs , but they stopped doing that , " says Beckerman .
" They started telling the DJs to go out and get the songs on Kazaa themselves . "
Record labels using Kazaa and other P2P networks in the course of their business ?
That would n't look good in a court , especially with the labels arguing that the mere use of a P2P network indicates guilt .
Beckerman believes that " encouraging misconduct " using P2P networks to get songs out to radio stations while simultaneously litigating against others doing the same thing undermines their legal arguments .
In a statement , an RIAA spokesperson informed Ars that they have delivered a written statement to the defendant " saying that our member companies do not use peer - to - peer to distribute to radio stations . "
Elektra v. Wilke : search party
With Elektra v. Wilke , the RIAA is facing another motion for summary judgment .
Paul Wilke , who is accused by the RIAA of illegally sharing music over a P2P network , says that the RIAA 's lawsuit should be dismissed because his name is not " Paule Wilke " as the RIAA says in its lawsuit , he has never used any " online media distribution " systems for filesharing purposes , and that he does n't own any of the songs the RIAA 's investigators allegedly discovered .
The RIAA has responded by filing a motion for expedited discovery .
It claims that despite the misspelling of his name , Wilke has been positively identified by SBC as the owner of the IP address flagged by the RIAA .
As Wilke decided to file for a summary judgment against the RIAA based on lack of evidence instead of filing an answer to the RIAA 's complaint , the RIAA now wants time to conduct a thorough investigation of Wilke , including looking for " evidence of copyright infringement on the Defendant 's computer hard drive . "
Wilke appears to be taking the position that the RIAA has not submitted enough evidence for a lawsuit to go forward .
The RIAA 's evidence appears to be limited to the following :
An IP address identified by Media Sentry as sharing copyrighted material Someone telling the RIAA that Paule Wilke had that IP address at some point in time .
That appears to be enough for many defendants to settle before the case even goes to court .
However , Wilke and his attorneys are arguing that the limited information provided to the court by the RIAA is not enough to go forward with a suit .
Instead , the court should issue a summary judgment in favor of Wilke because the evidence provided by the RIAA is n't even enough to merit a trial .
Such a ruling would be disastrous for the RIAA , as it would significantly raise the bar for future legal actions against music fans .
The RIAA 's response boils down to this : give us a chance to search for additional evidence against the defendant , and then we can talk about a summary judgment .
Summary judgment motions typically need to be defeated by what Beckerman describes as " competent evidence sufficient to create a material issue of fact that can be used at trial . "
A name , an IP address , and a list of songs does n't rise to that level in his opinion .
All the RIAA has in most cases is " suspicion and conjecture , " says Beckerman
Both of these cases bear watching .
If the record labels are using P2P to share music themselves , couts could view this as undermining their credibility and undercuts their legal arguments .
If Wilke gets his summary judgment against the RIAA , it is likely to make it much more difficult for the RIAA to successfully litigate cases of copyright infringement when the defendants decide to fight back .
Researchers at Harvard , Gray et al , are conducting an ongoing mind survey , and have also reported some findings from that online survey , based on a sample of more than 2,000 people .
The survey attempts to make one think about different forms of entities that may have a mind and to assign different degrees of consciousness / mind to them .
Gray worked alongside fellow psychologists Heather Gray and Daniel Wegner on the study , which presented respondents with 13 characters : 7 living human forms ( 7 - week - old fetus , 5 - month - old infant , 5 - year - old girl , adult woman , adult man , man in a persistent vegetative state , and the respondent himself or herself ) , 3 non-human animals ( frog , family dog , and wild chimpanzee ) , a dead woman , God , and a sociable robot .
Participants were asked to rate the characters on the extent to which each possessed a number of capacities , ranging from hunger , fear , embarrassment , and pleasure to self - control , morality , memory and thought .
Their analyses yielded two distinct dimensions by which people perceive the minds of others , agency and experience .
The participants attribute different degrees of these factors to the characters based on a forced choice between a pair of characters on a particular ability related to a mind capacity like feeling fear or making moral decisions .
I believe they then did factor analysis or some such statistical method to come up with two independent dimensions or factor underlying the concept of mind : Agency and Experience .
Agency seems to be related to the fact that people ( entities with mind ) can take volitional actions and are thereby responsible for their actions .
They can thus also be judged morally based on their actions and the choices they make .
Experience seems related to the fact that people ( entities with mind ) have an ability to feel and are emotional entities that have subjective experience of emotions like pain , fear and hunger and also have desires , longings and feelings etc .
The ability to perceive qualia surprisingly did n't come out as a separate entity and consciousness or ability to perceive qualia is supposedly covered under the Experience factor .
These dimensions are independent :
An entity can be viewed to have experience without having any agency , and vice versa .
For instance , respondents viewed the infant as high in experience but low in agency -- having feelings , but unaccountable for its actions -- while God was viewed as having agency but not experience .
" Respondents , the majority of whom were at least moderately religious , viewed God as an agent capable of moral action , but without much capacity for experience , " Gray says .
" We find it hard to envision God sharing any of our feelings or desires . "
The regular readers of this blog will remember that one of the important distinction that I hypothesized between Schizophrenia and Autism was that due to agency : with schizophrenics attributing too much Agency ; and Autistic attributing too less Agency to others ( other people or other entities that may have mind ) .
Also as God is perceived as having too much Agency , but not much Experience , thus when the Schizophrenia end of spectrum kicks in , they may also attribute too much agency to themselves and feel God - like or Divine .
The negative symptoms related to less of experience would also fit the fact of being God - like or being an angel / special person and thus not having too much emotions .
The Autistic end of the spectrum however would be guided by too - less - mind sort of attributions and thinking ; and thus they may view themselves and others as brains and not minds .
They might thus be more capable with inanimate objects and rules of nature ( thus making them good scientists / engineers / systemizers ) ; but poor at social / ethical aspects that require attributing minds to animals for example .
One should also distinguish between the two dimensions of Agency and Experience .
Thus Autistic may have a defect due to Agency , but may have mirror neurons or other systems that confer on them the ability to feel , not only subjective feelings of self - but empathetic feelings of others too .
Also , it has been this blogs contention that the Dimension of experience is best seen as a dimension on one end of which is the Bipolar patients and on the other end of which is the Deprosanalisation / apathetic / derealization spectrum .
while the Bipolar feels too much emotions and motivations ; the depersonalised / derealized person may show too less emotion / motivation .
Thus in mind at one end we have people having too much mind / believing in too much mind ( and exemplified by Schizophrenic and Bipolar ) and at the other end we have too people having too much brain / believing in too much brain ( exemplified by Autistic / depersonalised people ) .
One gives great Art , the other great Science .
Returning to the current study :
" The perception of experience to these characters is important , because along with experience comes a suite of inalienable rights , the most important of which is the right to life , " Gray says .
" If you see a man in a persistent vegetative state as having feelings , it feels wrong to pull the plug on him , whereas if he is just a lump of firing neurons , we have less compunction at freeing up his hospital bed . "
This is exactly one of the pertinent point made by the film Munnabhai MBBS - that coma patients have feelings and have a right of life .
While I have featured the effects of Lage Raho Munnabhai earlier ; I would also like to pay tribute to its prequel / precursor .
On that note , let us keep our antennas up for how thinking about us as entities with Agency and Experince can lead to Art ; while thinking of us as brains can lead to good science .
I 'm sure you 'll agree that we need both of these concepts about us humans .

Chalk up one more point for calorie restriction ( CR ) .
Limiting the dietary intake of monkeys slows the age - related decline in the immune system .
Specifically , CR delays the phenomenon known as T cell senescence , which is characterized by a slower rate of T cell production and a failure to maintain memory cells that have responded to past infections .
From Messaoudi et al. :
Caloric restriction ( CR ) has long been known to increase median and maximal lifespans and to decreases mortality and morbidity in short - lived animal models , likely by altering fundamental biological processes that regulate aging and longevity .
In rodents , CR was reported to delay the aging of the immune system ( immune senescence ) , which is believed to be largely responsible for a dramatic increase in age - related susceptibility to infectious diseases .
However , it is unclear whether CR can exert similar effects in long - lived organisms .
Previous studies involving 2 - to 4 - year CR treatment of long - lived primates failed to find a CR effect or reported effects on the immune system opposite to those seen in CR - treated rodents .
Here we show that long - term CR delays the adverse effects of aging on nonhuman primate T cells .
CR effected a marked improvement in the maintenance and / or production of naïve T cells and the consequent preservation of T cell receptor repertoire diversity .
Furthermore , CR also improved T cell function and reduced production of inflammatory cytokines by memory T cells .
Our results provide evidence that CR can delay immune senescence in nonhuman primates , potentially contributing to an extended lifespan by reducing susceptibility to infectious disease .
It ’s not clear whether one or several mechanisms are at work here .
Levels of both naïve and memory T cells are increased under CR , both of which could be ascribed to an increase in cellular lifespan ( i.e. , a decrease in the rate of disappearance in both types of cells ) without invoking a further increase in the rate of new T cell production .
But it seems that the cells are not merely more numerous but also more effective , able to mount more efficient specific immune responses without producing large quantities of sometimes counterproductive inflammatory cytokines .
So the effect observed is not a simple matter of keeping cells around for longer .
These findings have significant clinical ramifications : Resistance to infection decreases over the lifespan , especially among the frail elderly ( many of whom exhibit a dramatic increase in circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines , possibly originating in part from senescent memory T cells ) .
Finding a means of boosting immune function in these individuals — e.g. by finding a CR mimetic compound that could trigger the T cell improvements observed in this primate study — could help turn decades of decrepitude and chronic illness into more robust “ golden years ” for millions of human beings .
Infection is n’t the only thing that specific immunity combats in the body .
Cancers , whose cells often present unusual peptides on MHC as well as express inappropriate cell - surface proteins , is also detected and attacked by a combination of T and B cell action .
Declining immune function represents another manner in which aging facilitates cancer .
Improving the maintenance and effectiveness of T cells by delaying senescence could therefore defend the body not only against infection , but also the ravages of late - life cancer .
Hence , while CR is n’t all wine and roses , this is one more reason to study the phenomenon carefully in the search for clinical benefits .

McCain has backed the president over Iraq - so far
Senator John McCain also accused the administration of mismanaging the war .
Other Republicans have distanced themselves from the war and from President George W Bush .
But Mr McCain had been seen as an important backer of Mr Bush 's efforts to drum up political support for his new Iraq policy .
Change of mind
When Donald Rumsfeld resigned as defence secretary last November , John McCain said he deserved respect and gratitude .
Rumsfeld : " One of the worst " , according to McCain
At that stage Senator McCain , a Vietnam war hero and military expert , was the front runner in the race to find a Republican replacement for President Bush in 2008 .
But since then the senator 's support for the troop surge has put him in the uncomfortable position of being closely tied to the Bush White House and he has been slipping in the polls .
In what appears to be a bid to restate his independence , Senator McCain launched a devastating attack on the way the war had been handled .
He said mismanaged was the kindest word he could use .
" I think that Donald Rumsfeld will go down as one of the worst secretaries of defence in history , " he added .
For the White House these are wounding comments and a worrying sign that bashing the Bush team might be seen as the best way for top Republicans to campaign for 2008 .

I began my day in Tehran on the subway .
The Tehran Metro is , if you will pardon my overzealous language , an absolute wonder .
Situated in central parts of the city , it runs on three lines .
I bought a ticket on the Imam Khomeini line , the red line , and queued up with Tehranis on their way to work at the Hafte Tir station to embark on some sightseeing .
Fatima riding the Metro in Tehran
" Do we have to sit in the women 's only cabins ? "
I asked my interpreter Samira as we waited on the platform equipped with TV screens announcing the arrival of the next trains .
She waved her hands , " If you like " .
The grey subway announced its arrival with some music , which was conveniently replayed at every single stop accompanied by the station 's name .
We hopped on and I felt like I was on the London tube .
Samira had to push me off the subway ; I was quite willing to hang on to my seat for the rest of the day .
We walked to Sarkis Cathedral on Karim Khan-e - Zand Street , an Armenian Orthodox church built in the late 1960s .
Unlike the gothic churches hidden away in Saddar and under heavy Ranger protection , Sarkis Cathedral was a prominent landmark in Tehran .
It is said to be the most visible non-Islamic building in the city ; just in case you miss it , across the street painted on a large building is a mural of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus in her arms , angels sprinkled around their halos .
I asked Samira ( whose name is pronounced saam - ee - raah , which I kept butchering by not properly elongating my vowels ) if religious minorities felt safe practicing their religion in an Islamic Republic .
" They are the same as all of us , they speak Farsi , we look the same , we have the same names - there 's no way of telling us apart " .
" Except that they speak Armenian " I ventured .
Samira waved her hands again .
She spoke a little Armenian too .
There is so much to discover in this megalopolis of 14 million people ; it even makes Karachi look quaint and small .
The landscape of Iran is said to have been continuously inhabited by a single nation of people longer than any other part of land the world over .
Single nation of people sounds difficult to stomach in an age where nationalism , identity , and ethnicity dominate much of our politics , but Aryans aside , Iran is home to Azeris , Kurds , Arabs , Lors ( said to be descendants of those single nation people ) and Balochis .
Safak Pavey , a Turkish woman who heads the United Nations High Commission for Refugee 's external relations office , told me that in the early 1990s , after the Gulf War ( part one ) Iran was home to 4.5 millions refugees from Iraq and Afghanistan .
" Iran should receive thanks for that ; can you imagine a European country giving 4.5 million refugees asylum ? "
While the number of Iraqis and Afghani refugees is slowly decreasing with repatriation projects UNHCR and the Iranian government are initiating , Iran remains a veritable melting pot .
Tehran itself is composed of a diverse and unusual mix of ethnicities , nationalities , and religions and those people - including Jews , Christians , and Zoroastrians - live safely and comfortably alongside Muslims and have done so for thousands of years .
In Tarjish Square there is even a Little Pakistan where immigrants have set up a small bazaar of Pakistani made textiles , embroideries , and shoes .
What can't you find in Tehran ?
My rigorous sightseeing program continued with a stop at the Sa'd Abad Palace , once a summer home for the last Pahlevi Shah .
It was a summer home the size of Malir and everything inside , except for the carpets , was French .
Marie Antoinette looks down at you from every lamp , every table top , and every chest of drawers .
It was a bit much .
We toured the offices where Pahlevi senior is said to have plotted the CIA sponsored coup against the populist and democratically elected Mohammad Mossadegh , who nationalized Iran 's oil , took photographs by the boots of Pahlevi junior 's statue ( the only remaining part , it was cemented to the ground and could n't be torn off with the rest of his monstrous bronze image ) and marveled at the fully equipped dentist 's chair installed in the Shah's Niyavaran Palace , feet away from his bedroom , just in case such an emergency would arise .
It 's a miracle the Pahlevis left in one piece , so opulent was their grandeur .
I met with Mitra , a journalist , later in the day still disturbed by the ostentatious lifestyle of Iran 's monarchs .
How can these two very extreme histories , Western and Islamic , exist in one country ?
" Look , " she explained " Instead of instinctively bashing the post revolutionary period , we should be able to acknowledge the positive gains brought by the Revolution .
The Revolution helped spur on today 's feminist movement - in the Shah 's days only affluent families would send their daughters to universities for higher education .
The poorer classes did not .
This , " she gestured tugging at her head scarf " made it more acceptable for women to attend large co-ed universities and pursue higher learning .
It does n't have to be celebrated - it 's not an ideal situation - but it needs to be acknowledged .
Today 65 % of university students in Iran are women " .
Mitra is an elegant and professional woman , the weekend before Muharram she was wearing red ; I would n't have pegged her as having Revolutionary sympathies .
And she did n't necessarily , but like most Iranians she was willing to balance the difficult and sometimes frustrating changes of the Revolution with its benefits .
It is impossible to essentialize in Iran , impossible to paint things black or white - or red - there are so many facets to life in this country .
Those diametric opposites do share the same space in Iran and its people , and perhaps Mitra , are examples of its dynamism .
Mitra continued " Did you know that at government health centers you can receive free contraceptives ?
Or that the topic of birth control is spoken about openly ? " I did n't .
Women in mosques are permitted to discuss reproductive rights , there are no taboos surrounding it , and in recent years counseling dealing with sexual and physical health has become compulsory for couples before marriage .
Before receiving a marriage license , couples have to attend not only a counseling session but must also pass a university class centering on sexual health , HIV , and addiction .
There was more that deserved acknowledgement and I struggled to write as quickly as Mitra continued down the list .
Government health centers are setting up rehabilitation centers for the country 's large number of heroin addicts , even offering needle exchanges and methadone doses to those in need .
Female circumcision was banned by Khameini years ago , and while practiced dangerously in neighboring African and Arab countries , it is virtually non-existent in Iran .
Religious minorities now receive the same amount of blood money in the case of bereavement that Muslims do , whereas before the Revolution they were only offered half the amount that Muslims could claim .
Mitra told me incredulously that sex change operations are legal in Iran .
Though the procedures are sanctioned as a way of warding off homosexuality , a major crime in the country , it was the Imam Khomeini who gave his approval to gender reassignment while in exile in Iraq .
This was light - years before the very topic became acceptable , and even fashionable , in Western countries .
If Mitra and I had not spent the previous hour discussing the freedom of the press and Marxist blogs ( very popular in Iran ) I would have thought I was being taken for a ride .
Even my liberal bearings could not absorb this last piece of information .
" You can't be serious " I said , half expecting her to tell me she was just having a go at a foreign journalist for fun .
" No , I am absolutely serious " Mitra insisted , amused at my look of utter disbelief .
After medical and psychological evaluations , he or she is given a temporary permit which allows them to dress as the gender they will soon become without any fear of punishment .
" Once the operation is done , sometimes in government hospitals , he or she can legally get married and live officially as the gender they have chosen for themselves " .
Gender reassignment is not as openly discussed as birth control , Mitra went on , ignoring my stumped look , but you can see interviews with such people in the newspapers and even advertisements sometimes .
Does any of this happen in Pakistan ?
She reasonably asked since I had n't stopped talking about Iran and Pakistan 's similarities from the moment we sat down .
" Not exactly ... "
Before Mitra and I parted ways I thanked her for her time and for opening up new windows to Iran for me .
Every hour spent in Tehran is an education ; ideas are debated freely and openly , past and present shared without prejudice , politics and gender reassignment equal fodder for conversation .
This is so much more than the Iran of my imagination .
I cannot wait for tomorrow 's lesson .

Businesses are squeezing more and more people into smaller offices .
And the pressure on overcrowded personal space , at home , work and on public transport has never been more intense .
Does it feel like you 're getting less and less space at work ?
Is that next - door desk now butting ever closer ?
Is it starting to feel like your office is taking part in a battery - farming experiment ?
A report from a property company shows that companies are " sweating " their offices to get more people into less space .
The research , carried out by Knight Frank , shows that the amount of floor space allocated per employee is being cut by up to a third .
" It 's about maximising the usable office space , with much less wasted space , less luxurious reception areas , even down to the loo size , " says Catherine Penman , head of research for Knight Frank .
The big driver for this is saving money - particularly in the places where office space is most expensive , such as London and the south east of England .
The report says that while companies might want to expand staff numbers , they 're not providing more room - and that the amount of floor space left for staff is going to challenge " previously accepted norms " .
Close quarters
" Companies moving into new buildings or refurbishing existing ones are occupying at significantly higher densities ... and there is increasing anecdotal evidence that the trend is permanent , " says the Knight Frank report .
I used to sit so close to my colleagues I could actually smell them .
Silly as it sounds , I actually remember secretly celebrating when the guy next to me decided to buy a new pair of shoes .
Ali , London
How much higher density ?
Maybe a third less space , but it also quotes an unnamed firm in the Thames Valley where 1,200 staff have about half the previous average floor space allowed per person .
This is being achieved by reducing the gaps between desks , getting rid of partitioned management cubicles , cutting down on meeting rooms and storage - as more and more people have to be crammed on to the floor tiles .
The diminishing office space also reflects the changes in how people are working .
" A lot more offices are using flexible working and hot desking , " says Ms Penman .
And if people are calling into their offices less frequently , they do n't need to have as much desk space - allowing offices to shrink by 20 % to 30 % .
" It depends what industry you 're working in ... you might only be in the office 10 hours a week , the rest of the time you might be on the laptop or the Blackberry , " she says .
And the report highlights the trend towards office workers no longer having fixed PCs , but instead having laptops , which they can take with them wherever they are working .
Rats in a sack
But for those still stuck in the office , cramming people in can have some very unhappy consequences .
In the animal kingdom overcrowding causes aggression
" In the animal kingdom , overcrowding leads to more aggression , more fighting , " says Cynthia McVey , a psychologist at Glasgow Caledonian university .
In the human zoo of the office , she says people without enough personal space are going to get bad - tempered and defensive , feeling that their territory is under threat .
They become the proverbial rats in a sack .
" Personal space is very important to us - and if it 's invaded , if people come too close , it makes you feel very uncomfortable , " says Dr McVey .
" If there is a personality clash between people at work , and there is enough space around them , it can be dealt with .
But if they 're sitting on each others ' shoulders , you 're much more likely to get aggression .
They can get obsessed with the person who is annoying them , " says Dr McVey .
Overcrowded open - plan offices , without the relaxation of any privacy , can make people feel insecure , she says .
" It can create a sense of nervousness , with people feeling that they 're in direct competition with each other , always on display - and that leaves them feeling threatened , " says Dr McVey .
' Rootless '
The figures from the office space survey are " very illuminating and quite depressing " , says Stephen Overall , spokesman for the Work Foundation think - tank .
Airport lounge : People no longer need an office for work
There are sensible organisational reasons why businesses shifted towards open - plan offices , he says .
But he fears that " shrinking office syndrome " is a long - term threat to the welfare and creativity of employees .
" Where you have offices with people cramped up against each other , jostling for desk space , with nowhere that is their own , where they 're perpetually rootless - it 's very hard not to see it as a step backwards , " he says .
Apart from being a lousy way to spend a large part of your life , the Work Foundation warns that such overcrowding will be counter - productive for businesses wanting to improve productivity .
" Employers should be very cautious about taking this too far . "
In the type of jobs which require initiative and ideas , people need space for " solitude , thought and concentration , " says Mr Overall .
Overcrowded lives
It 's not as if there 's a lot of space for everyone outside work .
Overcrowding is part of modern living .
The Rail Passenger Council has warned about the adverse effects of overcrowding on commuter trains .
But do n't expect it to get much better , because Network Rail has just forecast that passenger numbers will rise by a third in the next decade .
England is the fourth most densely - populated country in the world
And as a population , we 're much more crowded than our European neighbours .
The UK has an average density of 244 people per square kilometre - compared to 192 in Italy , 109 in France and only 81 in Spain , claimed a survey from the Optimum Population Trust .
England , excluding the rest of the UK , is the fourth most densely - populated country in the world , behind Bangladesh , South Korea and the Netherlands , reported the population research organisation .
So with overcrowded roads causing road rage ... and overcrowded shops causing trolley rage ... overcrowded trains causing commuter meltdown ... do n't come too close .
What is worse is if you sit next to someone who blows his nose like a horn every 10 mins , and chomps on his food like a zoo animal ....
Jon , Fenchurch Street
The running joke in our office is that the next thing they will do is have ' bunk desks ' with little ladders that will take you to the top .
Christina , London
From my desk , if I reached my arms out to the side I 'd touch the people sitting next to me , I can easily shake hands with the guy sitting opposite ( without getting up ) .
Battery farming is a good way to look at it .
I get no chance to think .
Oh well , best go home on a crowded tube and train !

Where I used to work I used to sit so close to my colleagues I could actually smell them ( about 50 cm away ) .
Silly as it sounds , I actually remember secretly celebrating when the guy next to me decided to buy a new pair of shoes as his old pair had caused me several weeks of misery .
It is worth noting that we are not talking about call centre workers here , but managers and highly qualified professionals .
Ali , London
It can be really depressing when you come in the morning and have no idea whether or not you 'll have desk to sit at , let alone a computer to work on .
Add a crowded office to the mix and you 've got a disaster waiting to happen .
J , London
Our office has nine desks for 14 staff .
It 's hot desking on a first - come - first - served basis .
If you do n't get a desk when you arrive then you do some work that does not require IT .
It has an effect on hidden costs such as sickness absence , stress and generally low production .
PL , Durham
I experienced this in my work space where we crammed three people into an office that was designed for two .
There was noticeable competition and aggressiveness and it certainly affected my productivity .
Samuel , Isleworth
This morning on my way to work I was unable to get onto four buses because they were crammed to capacity with passengers .
I have just been out to lunch and ended up walking around trying to find a shop where I could buy lunch without queing for twenty minutes .
I am now sat at my desk competing for desk space with the guys sitting next to me .
Is it me or is London becoming more and more overcrowded ?
Guy Marcal , London
Sitting at my desk I can see 34 other people , that is 34 keyboards clacking and a potential 68 phones to ring - half of those with a potential for extremely annoying ringtones .
I struggle to shut out the noise and concentrate .
Some of my co-workers wear their iPods ( adding a background hiss ) , I just go for ear - plugs - it works for me .
I hate being in the office , but have no choice in my current role .
If , in my office , we were to get less space it would be very uncomfortable indeed .
Clare , London
I am currently in an office with 16 other members of staff , not all in the same department , that used to be taken up by only five people from the same department .
The office is mainly for IT staff , and they are supposed to be able to fix and build PCs as required , very difficult in the space we occupy .
Tracy , Scotland
Our offices tried reducing the amount of space per person .
The air conditioning units could n't cope with the increased heat ( from PCs , monitors , people ) so had to go back to normal desks .
I pity the people where common sense did n't prevail !
John , Sheffield
I worked in a call centre where the cubicles were only just big enough to fit the computer , keyboard and phone terminal in .
We were a paperless environment and therefore needed " no space to sit and write " .
As we had to " hot desk " we did n't even know if we were returning to the same desk after our tea breaks .
Some offices are the equivalent of the industrial revolution factories .
Cecilia Weightman , Bristol
I envy the people who can only see 40 people , I 'm on one of those football pitch sized trading floors and the noise of phones , mobiles , people shouting at each other really bothers me - more so I find as I get older .
I work in IT so need time to concentrate on detail - very difficult .
I think we totally underestimate the damage overcrowding has on our wellbeing .
Jools , London
I 've worked for the same company for nine years .
When I started , I shared an office with three others .
It was bliss , looking back on it .
Over the years my personal space has become less and less .
We moved to partitioned open - plan arrangements a long time ago , but now , the partitions have also been removed , and along with them , all individual shelving , or places to pin up a memo etc .
Now , although I 'm in a much more senior position than I was in nine years ago , I occupy a desk that is 3ft 9 inches in length ( I just measured it ) .
That is my only space .
My boss sits directly next to me - I can touch him if I reach out my arm .
My job is 100 % web - based , I commute 1 ½ hours each way to get to work , have my own lap - top and am wi - fi connected at home .
Yet I am still not allowed to work from home , even for one day a week , as my company does not want to ' set a precedent ' .
It makes me miserable because I like my job and do n't want to leave .
I just wish I had more control over my space and time .
Martha , London
Technology is helping to fuel this trend .
For example , moving to flat screen monitors means that desks can be shuffled closer together allowing you to squeeze more desks into the same space .
Matt Daniels , London
Yes , the crowded office I work in , crowded house I live in and crowded transport networks I travel to work on depress me .
What 's worse is the mood of people these days .
People are so angry and rude in the UK now and I am sure the overcrowing of everything here contributes .
Ashley Wilks , Cambridge
The managing director of our company keeps employing staff , but they are always desk - hopping in order to fit everyone in ... when there 's nobody off on holiday or ill then all hell breaks loose there 's not enough desks or computers for the amount of employees .
SD , Kent
Well , we live in the 21st Century with high - tech communication systems , makes you wonder why we need to go to the office ?
It 's all about trust .
Employers do not trust employees , specially managers , that if they work at home they do n't work .
I will take every opportunity to work from home as it increases , not decreases , my productivity .
But try telling senior management that ..... mmmm... sort of Dickensian attitudes .

For the first time , physicists have devised a way to make visible light travel in the opposite direction that it normally bends when passing from one material to another , like from air through water or glass .
The phenomenon is known as negative refraction and could in principle be used to construct optical microscopes for imaging things as small as molecules , and even to create cloaking devices for rendering objects invisible .
In the March 22 in the online publication Science Express , California Institute of Technology applied physics researchers Henri Lezec , Jennifer Dionne , and Professor Harry Atwater , will report their success in constructing a nanofabricated photonic material that creates a negative index of refraction in the blue - green region of the visible spectrum .
Lezec is a visiting associate in Atwater 's Caltech lab , and Dionne is a graduate student in applied physics .
According to Lezec , the key to understanding the technology is first in understanding how light normally bends when it passes from one medium to another .
If a pencil is placed in a glass of water at an angle , for example , it appears to bend upward and outward if we look into the water from a vantage point above the surface .
This effect is due to the wave nature of light and the normal tendency of different materials to disperse light in different ways - in this case , the materials being the air outside the glass and the water inside it .
However , physicists have thought that , if new optical materials could be constructed at the nanoscale level in a certain way , it might be possible to make the light bend at the same angle , but in the opposite direction .
In other words , the pencil angled into the water would appear to bend backward as we looked at it .
The details are complicated , but have to do with the speed of light through the material itself .
Researchers in recent years have created materials with negative diffraction for microwave and infrared frequencies .
These achievements have exploited the relatively long wavelengths at those frequencies -- the wavelength of microwaves being a few centimeters , and that of infrared frequencies about the width of a human hair .
Visible light , because its wavelength is at microscopic dimensions -- about one - hundredth the width of a hair - - has defeated this conventional approach .
Dionne , one of the lead authors , says that the breakthrough is made possible by the Atwater lab 's work on plasmonics , an emerging field that " squeezes " light with specially designed materials to create a wave known as a plasmon .
In this case , the plasmons act in a manner somewhat similar to a wave carrying ripples across the surface of a lake , carrying light along the silver - coated surface of a silicon - nitride material , and then across a nanoscale gold prism so that the light reenters the silicon - nitride layer with negative refraction .
Thus , the process is not the same as the one used for negative refraction of microwaves and infrared radiation , but it still works , says Dionne .
And this discovery is particularly exciting because visible light , as its name suggests , is the wavelength associated with the world of objects we see , provided they are not too small .
" Maybe you could create a superlens that can beat the diffraction limit , " says Dionne .
" You might be able to see DNA and protein molecules clearly just by looking at them , without having to use a more complicated method like X - ray crystallography . "
Atwater , who is the Howard Hughes Professor and professor of applied physics and materials science at Caltech , says the plasmonic technique indeed has potential for a compact " perfect lens " that could have a huge number of biomedical and other technological applications .
" Once the light coming from a nearby object passes through the negative - refraction material , it would be possible to recover all the spatial information , " he says , adding that the loss of this information is why there is ordinarily a limit to the size of an object that can be seen in a microscope .
Even more tantalizing is the possibility of an optical " invisibility cloak " device that would surround an object and bend light in such a way that it would be perfectly refocused on the opposite side .
This would provide perfect invisibility for the object inside the cloak , in a manner similar to the cloaks used by Harry Potter or the Klingons in the old Star Trek television series .
" Of course , anyone inside the cloak would not be able to see out , " Atwater says .
" But maybe you could have some small windows , " Dionne adds .

A Washington Guide To Late - Night Comedy
On any given day , some big - time , bold - faced Washington name is on the Delta Shuttle to New York en route to the set of Dave , Jon , Conan or Colbert .
Those 47 minutes or so in flight are almost always used to memorize the suggested one - liners assembled by the politician 's staff .
I would argue that going on those shows just to launch into prepared material is the kind of strategy that got Donald Rumsfeld fired .
Instead , I wish to submit some advice assembled by a one - man , self - appointed Humor Study Group .
Advertisement
If you are a high - profile public figure , getting yourself booked on these shows is almost always a good idea -- provided you do n't go on with the wrong idea in your head .
The wrong idea is : I must be hysterically funny .
As with any important task , it is imperative to understand from the outset whose job it is to do what .
Dave Letterman , Jon Stewart , Conan O'Brien and Stephen Colbert are paid to be funny .
In fact , they are paid a lot more than you -- plus they have writers -- so if anyone should feel pressure to elicit laughs , it 's them and not you .
The reason you have been booked on their show is to facilitate the funny .
So when they make a joke at your expense , try to look amused -- or at least bemused .
When you make them look funny , you are doing your job -- and in all likelihood , doing yourself a favor .
A hypothetical case in point : Let 's say Dick Cheney found the courage to go on Letterman .
Dave 's premise would surely be " Hey , Dick Cheney -- you sure are evil ! "
The biggest favor Dick Cheney could do for himself would be not to get defensive but to accept the comic premise and participate in the skit that has him sacrificing live chickens .
After all , what could make the premise more laughable than that ?
Why should any political power player -- Dick Cheney , no less ! -- consent to such treatment ?
More and more , programs like " The Daily Show " and " The Colbert Report " are the alternate forums for the serious ideas of our day .
Topical humor shows are the closest equivalent of the " no- spin zones " that other cable talk shows only pretend to construct .
Humor can be the true anti-spin .
Here 's why : Spin is : " I think you are just dumb enough to believe this " -- and the partisan talking points kick in from there .
Humor is : " I think you are smart enough to understand what 's really going on . "
And when done correctly in this setting , a concession that would otherwise be a dangerous " gaffe " generates an approving laugh .
And your short visit to " The Daily Show " can be the once - in - an - election - cycle opportunity to say with impunity what is otherwise unsaid and inoculate yourself from the easy jokes that others are eager to make at your expense .
The real opportunity comes from an understanding that these comedy couches are where message and messenger are truly one and the same .
Which means you can actually make a serious point while you are there -- but only if you are first willing to concede other points .
That is the price of admission , and it's a small price to pay .
To cynical ears , conceding the obvious buys back likability and credibility .
That is why I would urge you to spend your time on the Shuttle thinking about candor and not about comedy .
Trying too hard to be funny is both unseemly and dangerous .
Politicians are there to show that they are in on the joke and that the joke cannot hurt them .
By the time the segment is over , all that must be proven is that you ( Clark Kent ) can sit down with the host ( Lex Luthor ) and demonstrate that no joke in the world ( kryptonite ) can harm you .
That does not necessarily require you to launch a prewritten joke in hopes of getting laughs , only to demonstrate the same good - natured countenance of Superman as bullets bounce off his chest like so many spitballs .
All that being said , if the opportunity comes to pull out the pitch - perfect , self - directed joke from your back pocket , take it .
In these high - stakes settings , laughter is a sound of approval and / or forgiveness .
And as any seasoned power player should know , things are only as bad as the stuff you can't joke about .

1. The Cold Fusion Incident
Fusion power has been heralded as the solution to our future power needs .
After all , it promises to provide a nearly limitless supply of energy with minimal environmental impact .
The current problem , though , is that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to fuse together nuclei .
So , when Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann announced to a hungry scientific world that they 'd discovered cold fusion in 1989 ( a process that supposedly used much less energy ) , the duo were welcomed with splashy headlines .
Other scientists were dubious , and when Pons and Fleischmann withdrew their paper from Nature magazine and refused to answer questions , charges of fraud were made .
Pons and Fleischmann never gave enough details of the experiment to allow others to replicate it , and more than 10 years later no one has been able to replicate their results .
There are still scientists who believe Pons and Fleischmann were on to something , but the premature claims of cold fusion cast such doubt on these two researchers that they were doomed to ignominy .
Now that JRuby is getting more and more mature , several people are thinking of finally doing something to improve the world of build scripts by replacing ant with rake .
My former colleague Matt Foemmel has starting doing this for real and is writing up progress on his FoemBlog .
Matt 's written more build scripts than most and around 2000 we both made the mistake of thinking an XML based build file was the way to go .
We also both now believe you need a full scripting language .
The thing with build scripts is that you need both declarative and procedural qualities .
The heart of a build file is defining tasks and the dependencies between them .
This is the declarative part , and is where tools like ant and make excel .
The trouble is that as builds get more complex these structures are n't enough .
You begin to need conditional logic ; in particular you need the ability to define your own abstractions .
( See my rake article for examples . )
Rake 's strength is that it gives you both of these .
It provides a simple declarative syntax to define tasks and dependencies , but because this syntax is an internal DomainSpecificLanguage , you can seamlessly weave in the full power of Ruby .
A big issue with Rake for Java builds is that it was tricky to avoid lots of starts of the Java VM .
JRake runs on top of JRuby which runs inside the Java VM , so this issue goes away .
One argument against using rake for builds that I often hear is that it adds another language that people have to learn .
What this argument misses , is the point that ant is really its own language anyway .
The fact that it 's compliant XML does n't alter the fact that you still have to understand how all the various ant tasks work and fit together .
Of course if you already know ant , then it is extra effort to learn rake ; but given a mind free of both I do n't think rake + ruby is any harder , and there 's lots of other things a scripting language can do for you .
( I believe that every programmer should be comfortable with at least one scripting language - there 's just so many useful things you can do with them . )
With so much invested in ant , it will still be around for a while , but we think rake is the better solution for the future .
You might read a post on this blog and decide I 'm full of crap .
That 's fine .
I often am full of crap .
I encourage you to leave a comment explaining why you feel this way .
And , while you 're at it , feel free to point out any errors or inaccuracies in anything I 've written .
This kind of simple , immediate , highly visible public dialog is why I believe so strongly in comments as an essential part of blogging .
But sometimes a mere comment is n't enough .
Maybe you have your own blog .
Depending on the depth of your feelings on the matter , you might want to write an entire post on your blog explaining , in great detail , specifically why I 'm full of crap .
Then you 'd publish your post for the world to see .
But how do you know that I , the target of your vitriol , have read your post ?
How do you know that I can even find your post ?
You could email me directly , but that feels a little too intimate .
Or , you could leave a comment linking to your response , but that feels like additional work .
The answer lies in trackbacks .
Trackbacks are a way of relating conversations across websites .
After you publish your post , you send a trackback to my post .
This is usually handled automatically by the blogging software .
The trackback links our two posts together .
I get notified of any trackbacks to my posts , so I can follow the trackback to read your response .
Furthermore , trackbacks are public , just like comments .
So any future readers can also follow our conversation thread by directly navigating from my blog to yours with a single click .
Tom Coates created a little diagram which illustrates this process :
They 're a great idea .
Unfortunately , trackbacks are so horribly and fundamentally broken that they 're effectively useless .
The original trackback specification was published by Six Apart in summer 2002 .
It 's very basic .
The trackback URL is published in the metadata embedded in every blog post :
< rdf: Description rdf:about = " http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html " trackback : ping = " http://www.codinghorror.com/mtype/mt-tb.cgi/666 " dc:title =" The Programmer 's Bill of Rights " dc:identifier = " http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html " dc:creator= " Jeff Atwood " dc:date = " 2006-08-24T23:59:59-08:00 " />
You simply HTTP POST a bit of data to the trackback URL of the post you 're commenting on , like so :
POST http://www.codinghorror.com/mtype/mt-tb.cgi/666
Content - Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded ; charset=utf - 8 title=He's+full+of+crap&url=http://www.bar.com/&blog_name=Foo
See ?
Simple .
And it works great .
In one swell foop , you 've created a coherent conversation that flows across two totally different websites !
Well , it was great .
Until the spammers realized two things :
how high the pagerank is for popular blogs ( 7+ ) how trivially easy it is to abuse the trackback mechanism because trackbacks have no authentication mechanism whatsoever .
CAPTCHA has completely solved my comment spam problem .
But distinguishing between humans and machines is useless on trackbacks , which are all machine entered by definition .
I 've fought the good fight against the rising tide of trackbacks with various blacklists over the last three years , but as this blog grows more and more popular , I 'm clearly losing the war .
Malicious spammers can batch register dirt - cheap domain names and write scripts to mass - POST these URLs all over the blogosphere far , far faster than I can ever hope to blacklist them .
Every day starts with a depressing routine of adding 4 - 8 new spam URLs to my blacklist .
Yes , there are distributed blacklists like Akismet .
Yes , you can put all your trackbacks into a moderation queue and spend 5 minutes every day deleting them all manually .
Yes , you could retrieve the linking page and make sure it contains the promised link to your post .
But these are only slightly larger band - aids over a massive , sucking chest wound .
These are n't sustainible solutions .
We have a much deeper problem .
Trackbacks , as we currently know them , are dead , kaput , expired .
It 's an absolute travesty , and I completely blame Six Apart 's initial trackback specification .
How could they forget the rich history of email spam we 've had to deal with for the last ten years ?
Trackbacks , as a result of Six Apart 's incredibly naive initial design , are now a total loss .
That 's what happens when you design social software without considering the impact of malicious users from the very beginning .
Now , hopefully you 'll understand why I 've disabled all trackbacks for this blog as of today .
But I still believe in the concept of trackbacks .
I want to read your response to my posts , whether it's on your site , or mine as a comment .
So rather than relying on direct peer - to - peer links , I 'm exploring the use of external indexing services .
I experimented with using Google searches to find all the pages that have linked to the URL of a post , but I was n't happy with the results .
For now , I 've replaced the automatic trackback with a bit of JavaScript from Technorati which automatically lists any blogs that linked to a particular post .
It 's not quite as egalitarian as I 'd like , because you have to join Technorati to participate .
And it 's another unwanted external dependency which I 'll have to deal with .
But it 's the best I can do for now .
And please , if you 're designing social software , try to avoid repeating the many mistakes of our forefathers .
Again .
Design from day one with the assumption that a few of your users will be evil .
If you do n't , like Six Apart , your naivite will make the entire community suffer sooner or later .
Tsunami Harddisk Detector
the worlds first freely available P2P warning system NEWS :: September 2006 : :
TsunamiHDD has won an award at PrixArs2006
[ The problem ]
Tsunamis pose a serious life threat which can , however , be significantly alleviated by reliable warning systems .
Unfortunately many countries can not afford such facilities , partly because they require expensive maintenance . [ The solution ]
The Tsunami-Harddisk - Detector utilizes your existing computer hardware to detect earthquakes , which can lead to tsunamis .
It is a pure software solution , therefore it can be distributed free of charge .
The computers ( nodes ) participating in the project connect to a P2P ( Peer - to - Peer ) network , thereby establishing a distributed computing platform with high reliability .
A few of the participating computers act as supernodes , thereby performing data analysis on their attached nodes .
In case of emergency , the supernodes inform their attached nodes instantly .
Hence , if you decide to participate and install the client software , you will be automatically warned about potential tsunamis .

The other day I was talking with someone about the novel and non-obvious ways that people use Excel in their work and home life .
Gotta say , I 've personally seen some pretty amazing stuff happen when people take a favorite app , get really good at it , then bend it to their will .
( And Excel is perfect for this . )
This tracks to Danny 's Life Hack concept by which the alpha geeks were achieving lofty heights of productivity partly by mastering 1 - 3 " killer apps " -- then using them to solve most of their information and functional problems in fairly novel ways .
So my question for you :
What 's your killer app ?
Is there one place where 80 % or more of your activity takes place ( by choice ) ?
Vim ?
Excel ? Perl ? Firefox ?
Post - it Notes ?
What 's yours and when did you realize you 'd become a badass at using it ?
PHYS771 Lecture 2 : Sets
Scott Aaronson
Thursday 's class started out with a brief presentation by Rahul Jain about atomist ideas in Jainism ( circa 500BC ) .
It seems the Jain ( the ancient ones , not Rahul ) were barking up more or less the same tree as Democritus , but their ideas ( like many of the pre-Socratics ' ) were mixed with generous helpings of mysticism .
I mentioned another example of East - West convergence : apparently , several ancient cultures independently came up with the same proof that A = π r2 .
It 's obvious that the area of a circle should go like the radius2 ; the question is why the constant of proportionality ( π ) should be the same one that relates circumference to diameter .
Proof by pizza :
Cut a circle of radius r into thin pizza slices , and then " Sicilianize " ( i.e. stack the slices into a rectangle of height r and length π r ) .
QED .
One thing I forgot to share with you on Tuesday was a quote from Democritus :
" I would rather discover a single cause than become king of the Persians . "
Something to keep in mind when you consider those job offers from Microsoft or Google ...
Today we 're gonna talk about sets .
What will these sets contain ?
Other sets !
Like a bunch of cardboard boxes that you open only to find more cardboard boxes , and so on all the way down .
You might ask , " how is this relevant to a class on quantum computing ? "
I can give three answers :
When I gave that puzzle on Tuesday ( which by the way , we 're going to " answer " today ) , some of you asked what " countable " means .
OK , dude .
Math is the foundation of all human thought , and set theory -- countable , uncountable , etc. -- that 's the foundation of math .
So even if this class was about Sanskrit literature , it should still probably start with set theory .
I have a hidden agenda : I 'm told we have some physicists here , and I intend to browbeat you into thinking like mathematicians .
I mean , what you do in the lab is your own business , but now you 're in theorem country .
There actually is a tenuous connection between quantum computing and set theory , which I 'll touch on in the next lecture .
To give a sneak preview , the connection is that quantum mechanics applied to finite - dimensional systems ( like qubits ) seems like an interesting " intermediate " case between a continuous and a discrete theory .
That is , it involves quantities ( the amplitudes ) that vary continuously , but that are not directly observable .
In this way , it seems to avoid the " paradoxes " associated with the continuum in a way that other continuous physical theories do not .
But what are those paradoxes ?
Well , welcome to my haunted house horror tour of the continuous and the transfinite ...
So let 's start with the empty set and see how far we get .
THE EMPTY SET .
Any questions so far ?
Actually , before we talk about sets , we need a language for talking about sets .
The language that Frege , Russell , and others developed is called first - order logic .
It includes Boolean connectives ( and , or , not ) , the equals sign , parentheses , variables , predicates , quantifiers ( " there exists " and " for all " ) -- and that 's about it .
So for example , here are the Peano axioms for the nonnegative integers ( where S( x ) is the successor function , intuitively S( x ) =x+1 , and I 'm assuming functions have already been defined ) :
Zero Exists :
There exists a z such that for all x , S( x ) is not equal to z .
There exists a z such that for all x , S( x ) is not equal to z .
Every Integer Has At Most One Predecessor : If S( x ) =S(y ) then x=y .
The nonnegative integers themselves are called a model for the axioms ( though interestingly , they 're not the only model ) .
Writing down these axioms seems like pointless hairsplitting -- and indeed , as someone pointed out in class , there 's an obvious chicken - and - egg problem .
How can we state axioms that will " put the integers on a more secure foundation , " when the very symbols and so on that we 're using to write down the axioms presuppose that we already know what the integers are ?
Well , precisely because of this point , I do n't think that axioms and formal logic can be used to " place arithmetic on a more secure foundation " ( whatever that would mean ) .
But this stuff is still extremely interesting for at least three reasons :
The situation will change once we start talking not about integers , but about different sizes of infinity .
There , writing down axioms and working out their consequences is pretty much all we have to go on !
Once we 've formalized everything , we can then program a computer to reason for us : Premise 1 : For all x , if A ( x ) is true then B( x ) is true .
For all x , if A ( x ) is true then B( x ) is true .
Premise 2 : There exists an x such that A ( x ) is true .
There exists an x such that A ( x ) is true .
Conclusion :
There exists an x such that B ( x ) is true .
Well , you get the idea .
The point is that deriving the conclusion from the premises is purely a syntactic operation -- one that does n't require any understanding of what the statements mean .
Besides having a computer find proofs for us , we can also treat proofs themselves as mathematical objects , which opens the way to metamathematics .
Anyway , enough pussyfooting around .
Let 's see some axioms for set theory .
( I 'll state the axioms in English ; converting them to first - order logic is left as an " exercise for the reader . " )
Empty Set :
There exists an empty set .
There exists an empty set .
Extensionality :
If two sets have the same members then they 're equal .
If two sets have the same members then they 're equal .
Pairing : For all sets x , y there exists a set {x , y} .
For all sets x , y there exists a set {x , y} .
Union :
For all sets x , there exists a set equal to the union of all sets in x .
For all sets x , there exists a set equal to the union of all sets in x .
Existence of Infinite Sets :
There exists a set x that contains the empty set and that contains y∪{y} for every y∈x .
There exists a set x that contains the empty set and that contains y∪{y} for every y∈x .
Power Set :
For all sets x there exists a set consisting of the subsets of x .
For all sets x there exists a set consisting of the subsets of x .
Replacement ( for every function A ) : For all sets x , there exists a set { A (y ) | y∈x} .
For all sets x , there exists a set { A (y ) | y∈x} .
Foundation :
All nonempty sets x have a member y such that for all z , either z∉x or z∉y .
( This is a technical axiom , whose point is to rule out sets like {{{{ ... }}}} . )
These axioms -- called the Zermelo - Fraenkel axioms -- are the foundation for basically all of math .
So I thought you should see them at least once in your life .
Alright , one of the most basic questions we can ask about a set is , how big is it ?
What 's its size , its cardinality ?
You might say , just count how many elements it has .
But what if there are infinitely many ?
Are there more integers than even integers ?
This brings us to Georg Cantor ( 1845 -1918 ) , and the first of his several enormous contributions to human knowledge .
He says , two sets have the same cardinality if and only if their elements can be put in one - to - one correspondence .
Period .
And if , whenever you try to pair off the elements , one set always has elements left over , the set with the elements left over is the bigger set .
What possible cardinalities are there ?
Of course there are finite ones , and then there 's the first infinite cardinality , the cardinality of the integers , which Cantor called ℵ 0 ( " Aleph - Zero " ) .
The rational numbers have the same cardinality ℵ
0 , a fact that 's also expressed by saying that the rational numbers are " countable " ( i.e. , can be placed in one - to - one correspondence with the integers ) .
What 's the proof that the rational numbers are countable ?
You have n't seen it before ?
Oh , alright .
First list all the rational numbers where the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 2 .
Then list all the rational numbers where the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 3 .
And so on .
It 's clear that every rational number will eventually appear in this list .
Hence there 's only a countable infinity of them .
QED .
But Cantor 's biggest contribution was to show that not every infinity is countable -- so for example , the infinity of real numbers is greater than the infinity of integers .
More generally , just as there are infinitely many numbers , there are also infinitely many infinities .
You have n't seen the proof of that either ?
Alright , alright .
Let 's say you have an infinite set A .
We 'll show how to produce another infinite set , B , which is even bigger than A .
This B will simply be the set of all subsets of A ( which is guaranteed to exist by the Zermelo - Fraenkel axioms ) .
How do we know B is bigger than A ?
Well , suppose we could pair off every element a ∈A with an element f( a ) ∈B , in such a way that no elements of B were left over .
Then we could define a new subset S⊆A , consisting of every a that 's not contained in f( a ) .
Notice that this S can't have been paired off with any a ∈A -- since otherwise , a would be contained in f(a ) if and only if it was n't contained in f( a ) , contradiction .
Therefore B is larger than A , and we 've ended up with a bigger infinity than the one we started with .
This is certainly one of the four or five greatest proofs in all of math -- again , good to see at least once in your life .
Besides cardinal numbers , it 's also useful to discuss ordinal numbers .
Rather than defining these , it 's easier to just illustrate them .
We start with the natural numbers :
1 , 2 , 3 , ...
Then we say , let 's define something that 's greater than every natural number :
ω
What comes after omega ?
ω +1 , ω+2 , ...
Now , what comes after all of these ?
2 ω
Alright , we get the idea :
3 ω , 4 ω , ...
Alright , we get the idea :
ω 2 , ω3 , ...
Alright , we get the idea :
ωω , , ...
We could go on for quite a while !
Basically , for any set of ordinal numbers ( finite or infinite ) , we stipulate that there 's a first ordinal number that comes after everything in that set .
The set of ordinal numbers has the important property of being well - ordered , which means that every subset has a minimum element .
Now , here 's something interesting .
All of the ordinal numbers I 've listed have a special property , which is that they have at most countably many predecessors ( i.e. , at most ℵ 0 of them ) .
What if we consider the set of all ordinals with at most countably many predecessors ?
Well , that set also has a successor , call it α .
But does α itself have ℵ 0 predecessors ?
Certainly not , since otherwise α would n't be the successor to the set ; it would be in the set !
The set of predecessors of α has the next possible cardinality , which is called ℵ 1 .
What this sort of argument proves is that the set of cardinalities is itself well - ordered .
After the infinity of the integers , there 's a " next bigger infinity , " and a " next bigger infinity after that , " and so on .
You never see an infinite decreasing sequence of infinities , as you do with the real numbers .
So , starting from ℵ 0 ( the cardinality of the integers ) , we 've seen two different ways to produce " bigger infinities than infinity . "
One of those ways yields the cardinality of sets of integers ( or equivalently , the cardinality of real numbers ) , which we denote 2 .
The other way yields ℵ 1 .
Is 2 equal to ℵ 1 ?
Or to put it another way : is there any infinity of intermediate size between the infinity of the integers and the infinity of the reals ?
( Note : No sooner had I revealed that there were more reals than integers , than a student actually asked this .
He claimed never to have heard of the question before ; he thought he was just asking for a technical clarification . )
Well , the question of whether there are any " intermediate " infinities between the integers and the reals was David Hilbert 's first problem in his famous 1900 address .
It stood as one of the great math problems for over half a century , until it was finally " solved " ( in a rather disappointing way , as you 'll see ) .
Cantor himself believed there were no intermediate infinities , and called this conjecture the Continuum Hypothesis .
Cantor was extremely frustrated with himself for not being able to prove it .
Besides the Continuum Hypothesis , there 's another statement about these infinite sets that no one could prove or disprove from the Zermelo - Fraenkel axioms .
This statement is the infamous Axiom of Choice .
It says that , if you have a ( possibly infinite ) set of sets , then it 's possible to form a new set by choosing one item from each set .
Sound reasonable ?
Well , if you accept it , you also have to accept that there 's a way to cut a solid sphere into a finite number of pieces , and then rearrange those pieces into another solid sphere a thousand times its size .
( That 's the " Banach - Tarski paradox . "
Admittedly , the " pieces " are a bit hard to cut out with a knife ... )
Why does the Axiom of Choice have such dramatic consequences ?
Basically , because it asserts that certain sets exist , but without giving any rule for forming those sets .
As Bertrand Russell put it : " To choose one sock from each of infinitely many pairs of socks requires the Axiom of Choice , but for shoes the Axiom is not needed . "
( What 's the difference ? )
The Axiom of Choice turns out to be equivalent to the statement that every set can be well - ordered : in other words , the elements of any set can be paired off with the ordinals 1 , 2 , ... , ω , ω+1 , ... 2 ω , 3 ω , ...
If you think ( for example ) about the set of real numbers , this seems far from obvious .
It 's easy to see that well - ordering implies the Axiom of Choice : just well - order the whole infinity of socks , then choose the sock from each pair that comes first in the ordering .
Do you want to see the other direction : why the Axiom of Choice implies that every set can be well - ordered ?
Yes ?
OK !
We have a set A that we want to well - order .
For every proper subset B⊂A , we 'll use the Axiom of Choice to pick an element f( B ) ∈A\B .
Now we can start well - ordering A , as follows : first let s 0 = f( {} ) , then let s 1 = f( {s 0 } ) , s 2 = f( {s 0 , s 1 } ) , and so on .
Can this process go on forever ?
No , it can't .
For if it did , then by a process of " transfinite induction , " we could stuff arbitrarily large infinite cardinalities into A .
And while admittedly A is infinite , it has at most a fixed infinite size !
So the process has to stop somewhere .
But where ?
At a proper subset B of A ?
No , it ca n't do that either -- since if it did , then we 'd just continue the process by adding f( B ) .
So the only place it can stop is A itself .
Therefore A can be well - ordered .
OK , should we come back to the puzzle from Tuesday ?
We have a box , [ 0, 1] 2 .
To each real number x∈ [ 0,1 ] , we associate a countable subset S( x ) ⊂ [ 0,1 ] .
Now , can we choose S in such a way that for every ( x , y ) pair , either y∈ S ( x ) or x ∈S (y ) ?
What do you think ?
I 'll give you two answers : that it is n't possible , and that it is possible .
Which answer do you want to see first ?
Alright , we 'll start with why it is n't possible .
For this I 'll assume that the Continuum Hypothesis is false .
Then there 's some proper subset A ⊂ [ 0,1 ] that has cardinality ℵ 1 .
Let B be the union of S( x ) over all x∈A .
Then B also has cardinality ℵ 1 .
So , since we assumed that ℵ 1 is less than 2 , there must be some y∈ [ 0,1 ] not in B .
Now observe that there are ℵ 1 real numbers x∈A , but none of them satisfy y∈ S ( x ) , and only ℵ 0 < ℵ 1 of them can satisfy x ∈S(y ) .
Now let 's see why it is possible .
For this I want to assume both the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis .
By the Continuum Hypothesis , there are only ℵ 1 real numbers in [ 0,1 ] .
So by the Axiom of Choice , we can well - order those real numbers , and do it in such a way that every number has at most ℵ 0 predecessors .
Now put y in S( x ) if and only if y≤x , where ≤ means with respect to the well - ordering ( not the usual ordering on real numbers ) .
Then for every ( x , y ) , clearly either y∈ S ( x ) or x ∈S(y ) .
Today 's puzzle is about the power of self - esteem and positive thinking .
Is there any theorem that you can only prove by assuming as an axiom that the theorem can be proved ?

The plague of rats gripping towns and cities has been worsened by the greed of local councils , pest control firms said yesterday .
As revealed in the Mail yesterday , rat infestations have shot up by nearly 40 per cent in six years .
Last night it emerged that the plague has coincided with town halls charging to send out ratcatchers .
Six out of ten of councils have stopped deploying pest control teams free of charge , said the
National Pest Technicians Association .
Instead , householders are having to pay up to £ 65 to have rats removed .
The fees have come while council tax bills have been rising by more than double the level of inflation each year .
The NPTA , which represents vermin control organisations , says the charges have contributed to the rise in rat numbers because householders are more reluctant to call out a ratcatcher if they know they will have to pay .
The association also blames " recycling mania " in government , with the adoption of fortnightly , instead of weekly , rubbish collections .
It said in a report : " The alarming trend towards charging policies seems to be spreading through local authorities , whose senior officers seem to be revenue driven .
" This is causing more people to go over to DIY pest control and this is a step in the wrong direction .
" Bureaucrats in central and local government continue to put public health at risk by imposing unrealistic budgets which reduce the efficiency of pest control and force authorities to make a charge to eradicate pests . "
NPTA chief executive John Davison added : " We have seen a lot of councils reporting an 80 per cent reduction in the number of call - outs .
" If you see a rat cross your garden , are you going to pay £ 65 to get it sorted out ?
People are not reporting it and making the population much bigger . "
How would you like to permanently boost your productivity by making some simple changes to your work area ?
If you ’re going to spend so much time at your desk , then make sure it ’s going to be a pleasant experience .
How does your workspace make you feel ?
If you ’re at your desk right now , take a moment to clear your mind , and think about how your work area makes you feel .
Take a deep breath and get a sense of the subtle energies you pick up .
How does this place make you feel ?
Do you feel stressed ?
Worried ?
Relaxed ?
Peaceful ?
Fired up ?
Motivated ?
Energized ?
Drained ?
Happy ?
Depressed ?
Overwhelmed ?
Busy ?
Important ?
Insignificant ?
Bored ?
Excited ?
Rushed ?
Angry ?
Creative ?
Aroused ?
Come up with a few words to describe the feeling you get from your environment .
I recommend you leave your work area , go someplace else for a few minutes , and then re-enter your work area so you can pick up a fresh impression .
Notice how your feelings change very subtly as you enter your place .
What do you notice about this change ?
Get a second opinion
If you have a hard time sensing your work area objectively , get a second opinion .
Grab a coworker who has a fairly different work area than yours , and invite him / her to sit down at your desk .
Ask him / her how it feels to enter and to sit in your work area .
Get several opinions if you like .
Have some fun with your co-workers , and hop from desk to desk to see how each person ’s work area feels .
Sit in each chair and imagine what it would be like to work there for a day .
Whose work area do you like best ?
Whose do you like least ?
Maybe even rate each one on a scale of 1 - 10 .
Notice how each environment makes you feel .
Also notice that no two are quite the same .
What ’s different about the work areas you rated most highly ?
What did you like about them ?
What if you do n’t like how you feel ?
If you realize your work area makes you feel lousy , that ’s OK .
Changing the way your work environment makes you feel is n’t too difficult .
There ’s always a way to improve it .
All you really need to do is follow this simple rule :
If it feels right , it is right .
If you use that as your guiding principle for making changes to your work environment , there ’s no need to bring in a feng shui expert .
I spent a good bit of time studying feng shui and ultimately felt that this simple rule covered about 80 % of what I wanted to remember .
Imagine your ideal space
Identify how you ’d like to feel in your work area .
What mental state would you consider the very best to have as your daily default ?
Pick two or three words to describe it .
When I did this , I chose relaxed , peaceful , and focused .
Now picture what kind of work environment would help to create the feelings you ’ve selected , even if it does n’t seem realistic to work in such a place .
For example , if you chose to feel peaceful , what ’s the most peaceful place you can imagine ?
Create a mental image of the ideal place for you to work .
Alter your space
Now take your imagined ideal space , and project it onto the reality you have to deal with .
Maybe you ca n’t work on a mountain lake , but perhaps you can bring part of that vision into your real space .
Make a list of simple changes you can make to your work area .
If you ’re not sure they ’ll work , that ’s OK .
Think of these changes as experiments .
If you do n’t like them , you can always undo them .
One by one take some time to implement these changes .
Add a poster , a fountain , a candle , a plant , or some photos .
After making each change , notice how your feelings change .
Remember to follow the rule , “ If it feels right , it is right . ”
If a change feels wrong or neutral , then undo it and try something else .
I want to emphasize that the rule is , “ If it feels right , it is right . ”
Note that I ’m not saying , “ If it looks right , it is right . ”
How your environment makes you feel is more important than how it looks .
Commanding position
The most valuable idea I got from studying feng shui was the concept of the commanding position .
This is the position where you feel supported from behind ( and optionally on the sides too ) and open in the front .
For example if your house has a mountain or hill behind it , then your home would be in the commanding position , much like a highly defensible castle .
In workspace terms , the commanding position ideally means that you work facing the entrance to your work area and have a wall right behind you .
The commanding position creates a feeling of security .
It makes it easier to relax when you work .
When you have your back to the wall and you face the entrance to your workspace , your focus is forward , and a forward focus contributes to high productivity .
You never have to concern yourself with someone approaching you from behind .
If part of your focus is on what ’s happening behind you , you ’ll be more distracted , and your productivity will suffer .
I used to work with my desk against the back wall of my office , so my back was towards the door .
That just seemed an efficient layout for my office .
But after studying feng shui , I decided to give the commanding position a try and rearranged the furniture so that my back was to the wall and I could see the door .
It made a noticeable difference even before I ’d made any other changes .
I felt more comfortable and relaxed .
There ’s something about the feeling of being supported from behind that makes it easier to work productively .
If you think of the layout of a top executive ’s office , it ’s almost invariably in the commanding position .
The person sits facing the entrance to the room .
You do n’t walk into an executive ’s office and see their back .
If you ’ve never worked in the commanding position , find someone else who has their office setup this way , and go sit at their desk .
Notice how different it feels versus if your back is to the entrance and you have to worry about people coming up behind you .
Even if you have a door behind you with a lock , the commanding position is still better .
If you make only one change to your work area , this would be the one to make .
Once you ’ve tried it for a few months , you ’ll never want to go back .
My experience
Several months ago I altered my home office with the intention of creating the feelings of relaxation , peace , and focus .
It was n’t difficult to do , and I made most of the changes in the first week .
I gave myself a budget of $ 200 for the alterations , but I spent less than half of it .
I was n’t sure these changes would make any difference , but it was worth a try — even a small increase in productivity would be worth it .
When I made these changes my office was designed with functionality and efficiency in mind , so I wanted to keep those benefits while changing the way the location felt to me .
Currently as I sit at my desk , I ’m facing into the middle of the room , so I can see the door .
On the wall behind me is a poster of a mountain forest ( which further reinforces the commanding position ) .
I count nine scented candles within reach of me , some in decorative candle holders with small rocks .
The room smells of cranberry , since that ’s the candle that ’s burning right now .
There are three plants in the room : a medium - sized one on my filing cabinet and two small bamboo plants .
The bamboo plants are next to a small fountain , which creates background sounds of water splashing over rocks .
Behind the fountain and bamboo plants is a small mirror , which has the visual effect of doubling their presence .
Relaxing music is playing through my PC speakers ( currently I ’m listening to Enya ’s new Amarantine CD , which is one of my favorites ) .
There are a few decorations around the room : a small stuffed yellow bear , a dragon sculpture , a turtle sculpture , a couple stone gargoyles , a miniature zen rock garden , and a crossbow .
I keep my office organized and uncluttered as well , which contributes to the feelings of relaxation , peace , and focus .
When I sit down at my desk , switch on the fountain , light a candle , and put on some relaxing music , it often feels like I ’m about to get a massage rather than go to work .
Because the environment is so peaceful and relaxing , it ’s hard for me to feel stressed or overwhelmed .
I look forward to going to my office because it ’s a nice place to live , not just a productive place to work .
I ’m sure I ’ll continue improving it over the years ahead , but I ’m pretty happy with the results so far .
When my wife sat down at my desk after I made the initial changes , she remarked at how different it felt .
In fact , she became instantly jealous .
Eventually she decided to work on transforming her office too .
For Christmas
I gave her a fountain and some scented candles to get her started .
She set them up on a corner of her desk , and even that small change gives her work area a very different feel .
If you do n’t like it , change it
If you find yourself too often feeling stressed , overwhelmed , bored , unmotivated , frustrated , etc. at work , perhaps your environment is reinforcing is these negative states .
Take those feelings as a signal to make some changes and create a more balanced and comfortable work area for yourself .
A few simple changes you make today can serve you for years to come .
And do n’t just read about it , think about it , or talk about it .
Go do it !
You ’ll be glad you did .
A legged robot able to teach itself to walk by continuoulsly modeling its own body using internal simulations .
The same on - board algorithm also allows the robot to diagnose structural damage , such as the separation of a leg , and to recover from such damage by teaching itself to walk using a different gait .
A newly designed robot can sense and recover from unexpected damage , an ability that is sure to prove handy in dangerous terrain , researchers announced today .
Living organisms have the ability to continuously evaluate their abilities and surroundings and adjust their behavior accordingly .
If a person twists an ankle , he walks differently so as to not put too much pressure on the injured muscles .
But robots are n’t typically equipped with such capabilities .
They are programmed with a rigid model describing them and the surrounding environment .
When they become damaged or something unexpected occurs , they are typically unable to adapt , limiting their potential .
Often when exploring new terrain , such as on another a planet , researchers cannot predict what a robot might encounter .
So they designed a machine that can improvise in response to unexpected injuries .
Referred to as Starfish , the new four - legged robot creates a model of itself and revises that model to respond and adapt to injury by synthesizing new behaviors .
" We never officially named it , but we usually refer to it as the Starfish robot , even though a real starfish has five rather than four legs , " said lead study author Josh Bongard of the University of Vermont .
" Also , a real starfish is much better than our robot at recovering from injury , because it can actually regrow its legs . "
Starfish first walks around on a flat surface in order to observe its own motions using sensors .
With the information it gathers , it ’s able to create a virtual version of itself in an internal computer model [ video ] .
Each time it moves , it updates this model and uses it to generate future motion .
For example , when the researchers shortened one of its legs , the robot was able to shift its gait .
" Most robots have a fixed model laboriously designed by human engineers , " said study co-author , Hod Lipson , a researcher from Cornell University .
" We showed , for the first time , how the model can emerge within the robot .
It makes robots adaptive at a new level , because they can be given a task without requiring a model .
It opens the door to a new level of machine cognition and sheds light on the age - old question of machine consciousness , which is all about internal models . "
This concept , the researchers hope , will help the development of more robust machines and could even aid in understanding animal and human behavior .
The study is detailed in the Nov. 17 issue of the journal Science .
Gene tests on a sample of “ indigenous ” Englishmen have thrown up a surprise black ancestry , providing new insight into a centuries - old African presence in Britain .
The research , funded by the Wellcome Trust , identified a rare West African Y chromosome in a group of men from Yorkshire who share a surname that dates back at least as far as the mid-14th century and have a typical European appearance .
They owe their unusual Y chromosome to an African man living in England at least 250 years ago and perhaps as early as Roman times , the researchers say .
Mark Jobling at the University of Leicester , UK , and colleagues recruited 421 men who described themselves as British and analysed their genes as part of a survey of British Y chromosome diversity .
To the researchers ’ surprise , they found that one individual in the study carried a very rare Y chromosome , called hgA1 .
This particular variant has previously been identified in only 26 people worldwide , three African Americans and 23 men living in West African countries such as Guinea - Bissau and Senegal .
“ It ’s so distinctive , it really sticks out like a sore thumb , ” Jobling says of the chromosome ’s unique sequence .
He adds that it is virtually impossible for this sequence to have coincidentally evolved in Britain .

The white British subject with the hgA1 variant , however , knew of no African family connection .
Father to son
To explore the mysterious origin of his Y chromosome scientists recruited 18 other men that shared his rare surname , which dates back to the first use of surnames , hundreds of years ago , and was first recorded in the county of Yorkshire , in northern England .
The researchers have not disclosed the surname to maintain the men ’s privacy .
The team hoped that this would help them pinpoint when the hgA1 had variant entered the lineage , since Y chromosomes , like surnames , are passed from father to son .
Of the 18 men with the Yorkshire surname , six of them carried the hgA1 Y chromosome – including one man in the US , whose ancestors had migrated from England in 1894 .
Genealogical records linked these men to two family trees , both dating back to the 1780s in Yorkshire .
Jobling believes that these two genealogies are connected by a common male ancestor of West African descent living in England at least 250 years ago .
Viking capture
The British men carry an hgA1 Y chromosome that closely matches the one identified in men presently living in West Africa .
This suggests that the former group ’s black ancestor arrived in Britain within the past few thousand years .
Had their hgA1 Y chromosome been introduced any thousands of years earlier , when humans first migrated from Africa to Europe , its sequence would have shown greater divergence from the one currently found in West Africa .
The hgA1 Y chromosome could perhaps have entered the gene pool in northern England 1800 years ago when Africans fought there as Roman soldiers , Jobling says .
It also might have been introduced in the 9th century , when Vikings brought captured North Africans to Britain , according to some historians .
But scientists note that the majority of black men with the hgA1 variant currently live in Guinea - Bissau and nearby countries in West Africa .
Because many slaves from this area came to Britain beginning in the mid-16th century , it is likely that the white men with the hgA1 variant have a black ancestor that arrived this way , researchers say .
This ancestor could have been a first - generation immigrant African or one whose family had lived in Britain for generations .
Famed writer
Jobling says his study provides the first evidence of a long - lived African presence in Britain .
He adds that it raises the possibility that relationships among black and white people was perhaps more historically acceptable in Britain than some people might believe .
Vincent Brown of Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , US , agrees and points to the example of Olaudah Equiano , a black man who bought his freedom in Britain in the mid 18th century and achieved fame for his writing .
Equiano claimed to be a slave from west Africa , though some argue that he had arrived from colonial America .
He lived in London and eventually married a white woman , notes Brown .
The new findings are unusual because they reveal the hidden African ancestry of white men , Jobling says .
He notes that it is much more common for studies to discover or confirm the reverse .
For example , gene tests gave strong evidence that the black descendents of the slave Sally Hemmings could also trace their ancestry to her “ owner ” , the third US president , Thomas Jefferson ( Nature , vol 396 , p 27 ) .
And several years ago , Jobling ’s team found that more than a quarter of British African - Caribbean men have a Y chromosome which traces back to Europe rather than Africa .

Yet in many ways this inversion of Spengler is a fundamental misreading of the trajectory of the last hundred years .
Far from being a time of Western ascendancy , the past century has in reality witnessed something more like a re-orientation of the world — albeit only a partial re-orientation — and the relative decline of the West .
In 1900 the West really did rule the world .
From the Bosporus to the Bering Strait , from Siberia to Ceylon , nearly all of what was then known as the Orient was under some form of Western imperial rule .
The British had long ruled India , the Dutch the East Indies , and the French Indochina ; the Americans had just seized the Philippines ; the Russians aspired to control Manchuria .
All the imperial powers had established parasitical outposts in China .
The East , in short , had been subjugated , even if that process involved far more complex negotiations and compromises between rulers and ruled than used to be acknowledged .
Western hegemony was one of the great asymmetries of world history .
Taken together , the metropoles of all the Western empires — the American , Belgian , British , Dutch , French , German , Italian , Portuguese , and Spanish — accounted for 7 percent of the world ’s land surface and just 18 percent of its population .
Their possessions , however , amounted to 37 percent of global territory and 28 percent of mankind .
And if we regard the Russian empire as effectively another European empire extending into Asia , the total share of these Western empires rises to more than half the world ’s area and population .
This was a political globalization unseen before or since .
What enabled the minority in the West to rule the majority in the East in 1900 was not so much scientific knowledge in its own right as its systematic application to both production and destruction .
By contrast , the empires of the East , from the Ottoman to the Qing , failed disastrously to modernize themselves .
Their economies remained trapped in subsistence agriculture while the West forged ahead , colonizing and industrializing , devouring sugar and burning coal .
Their tax systems were inefficient , forcing Oriental rulers to borrow from Western capital bankers .
Eastern armies remained long on pageantry and short on firepower , while the West could deploy well - drilled troops equipped with machine guns and heavy artillery .
Eastern navies stood no chance against the Western combination of steam and steel .
Nothing symbolized better the humiliation of the East than the Western military intervention to suppress the Boxer Rebellion , in China , in 1900 .
The rebels , who had menaced Western diplomats and missionaries , relied on martial arts and magic .
Having wiped them out , the Western expeditionary force staged a “ grand march ” through Beijing ’s Forbidden City and then undertook punitive raids deep into Shanxi Province , Inner Mongolia , and Manchuria .
Just a few years later , however , the East began to re-assert itself .
Japan ’s defeat of Russia on land and at sea in 1904 –5 marked a turning point in world history .
From that point on , the balance of geopolitical power began to turn , slowly and painfully , back toward the more populous part of the world .
It is only when the extent of Western dominance in 1900 is appreciated that the true narrative arc of the 20th century reveals itself .
This was not “ the triumph of the West , ” but rather the crisis of the European empires , the ultimate result of which was the revival of the East — beginning in Japan — and the relative decline of the West .
This has not been a decline in the sense that Spengler envisaged : a kind of corrosive metropolitan ennui .
Rather , it has been an unexpected but inexorable military decline .
It has been a scarcely perceptible economic decline .
It has been a subtle but unmistakable cultural decline .
Above all , it has been a creeping demographic decline .
In short , it has been a decline in precisely the sense that Gibbon understood the decline of Rome ’s empire .
In my list of weird coincidences , this has got to rank pretty high : earlier this year , I ’m flying to London to do the publicity tour over there for Everything Bad .
I ’m sitting next to a British guy , and and an hour or so into the flight , we start chatting .
He asks if I ’m flying over for business or pleasure , and I say business , and he asks what I do , and I say I ’m promoting a new book .
Him :
Oh really ?
What ’s the book ?
Me :
It ’s this funny little thing called Everything Bad Is Good For You .
Him : [ smiling ]
Ah yes , I ’ve read it .
Me : No way !
It has n’t even come out in Britain yet !
Him :
Actually , the paper where I work bought the first serial rights .
Me : How amazing .
So you worked at the London Times ?
What do you do there ?
Him : [ somewhat sheepishly ]
I ’m , um , the editor - in - chief .
Crazy , huh ?
I said later that not only was he the first person I ’d randomly sat next to on a plane who ’d actually read one of my books — he was also the first person I ’d randomly sat next to who had bought the first serial rights to one of my books .
I say all this because during the flight I was also watching episodes of the ABC show Lost on my laptop , and I brought it to my seatmate ’s attention because there are often shots of the original plane crash interspersed through the episodes , and I did n’t want him looking over and thinking I was some kind of a freak who liked to watch footage of plane crashes while actually flying in a plane .
So we got started talking about Lost , which had not made it over to the UK at that time .
And then three months later , I get an email from an editor at the Times saying that the show is now airing over there , and that his boss recalls me saying something interesting about the show and did I want to write a piece about it .
I thought it sounded like a great idea , because in many ways
Lost embodied a lot of the themes I was exploring in the book , but I did n’t get around to seeing it until the manuscript was done .
( As is so often the case , I was prodded into watching it by my longtime pop culture confidant , Alex Ross , who was a huge help when I was writing the book . )
So I wrote a nice little column for the Times , which for the life of me I cannot find on their website .
But about half of it will be familiar to most of you who have followed the Everything Bad discussion .
Given that ABC is about to start airing season two of Lost next week , I thought I ’d quote a little from the Lost - specific parts of the piece :
By genre , Lost is a disaster narrative — closest in spirit to the airplane disaster movies over the seventies , which were as a genre so awful that they spawned an entire sub - genre of parodies .
But Lost ’s creator J. J. Abrams — who co-wrote and directed the show ’s breaktaking two - hour opening episode — announced in the very first seconds of the show that this was no Airport 77 remake .
If the networks had made Lost thirty years ago , it would have followed a fixed narrative flight path : introduce all the passengers and the pilots and the feuding stewardesses ; learn each of their backstories ;  and then have the engines fail .
Abrams did away with that entire prologue :
Lost begins seconds after the crash , and so from the very beginning of the show , the twenty - odd survivors that we focus on are complete mysteries to the audience .
We know nothing about them , and so the narrative pleasure comes from watching these interlinked histories being slowly revealed over the course of the season , in flashbacks and reminiscences .
Thirty years ago , of course , no American show would have dared to put twenty recurring characters into a network drama .
( Even the socially complex prime - time soaps like Dallas tended to max out at around ten primary characters , while the sitcom ’s sweet spot seemed to be at around six : just enough for a nuclear family and the wacky neighbor next door . )
But no show back then would have dreamt of submitting the audience to so much deliberately murky narrative information .
Only the notoriously opaque Twin Peaks — a minor network hit in the early nineties — compares to Lost ’s entanglements .
And indeed , Lost came very close to disappearing off the map itself : executives at ABC and its parent company Walt Disney had so little faith in the project that they fired the network chairman who had originally proposed the idea of a plane crash epic to Abrams .
Only the lavish budget already spent on the pilot — $ 12 M , several times larger than television norm — persuaded the network to give the show a chance .
Mystery , of course , is a staple of much serial drama .
( Dickens , after all , compulsively ended his installments with a tantalizing cliffhanger . )
But when American television has withheld information for the purposes of suspense , it has historically focused on a single unanswered question , who shot JR ?  being the canonical example .
As uncanny as it was , Twin Peaks itself would have never attracted a mainstream audience without a central , catchphrase mystery at its core : who killed Laura Palmer ?
The genius of Lost is that its mysteries are fractal : at every scale — from the macro to the micro — the series delivers a consistent payload of confusion .
There are the biographical riddles : why was the beautiful Kate accompanied by a federal marshal on the flight ?
There are geographic riddles ( why have the rescue teams missed the island , and why does it appear to have a history of attracting castaways ? ) and historical ones ( why has that SOS signal been playing for so many years ? )
And then there are existential riddles : are these people even alive at all ?
Perhaps there were no survivors , and these characters are just ghosts haunting an island of lost souls .
Or does Abrams have up his sleeve an elaborate homage to The Island Of Dr. Moreau ?
These are only a handful of the unanswered questions that arise in the first six episodes .
I did a back - of - the - envelope calculation and came up with roughly thirty genuinely mysterious plot elements that season one offers up .
I wo n’t give anything away , but each of the main characters turns out to be , well , more complicated than they initially appeared , and the island itself turns out to be the most complicated of all .
Narratives by definition work by withholding information about future events ; you tune in to find out what will happen next .
But with Lost , the mystery lies in the present tense : half the time , you have no idea what ’s happening right now .

Currently the Project 's activities are being coordinated by Charles Montgomery , who would welcome comments , suggestions , code contributions , or whatever , at cgm@physics.utoledo.edu
Skip 's Original Introduction
Its not standardized , so how can I port my software ?
I have lots of pre-existing FORTRAN code that works perfectly well and I am not in any hurry to re-write it .
Can Forth interface with my FORTRAN code ?
There are no scientific libraries in Forth .
The recently adopted ANS Forth handily addresses # 1 , and in fact it is the adoption of the standard that makes issues # 2 and # 3 worth addressing .
With regard to # 2 , I think the adoption of the standard will help here , since the interface to other software is the kind of feature that will distinguish one vendors ANS Forth from anothers .
While the standard does not address such interfaces , I do n't think that there will be too much divergence on how this is done .
The Unix world has no such standard , and I have only encountered 2 different C- FORTRAN conventions in over 15 years of using Unix .
So # 1 is now solved , and the vendors will ( I hope ! ) address # 2 .
The third point can be addressed by the Forth community itself .
Several potential scientific users of Forth discussed these issues at the 1994 Rochester Forth Conference .
It was decided that we should undertake the project of writing a scientific library in ANS Forth .
The plan is to write a set of Forth words to implement such libraries as the ACM libraries , BLAS , LINPACK , etc .
The libraries will be publicly available in source form ( in some sort of " public " release : public domain , copyleft , copyrighted but freely distributable , etc ) .

Well is n't this interesting .
Remember when I bought General Wesley Clark 's cell phone records for under a $ 100 in order to prove that anyone 's privacy could be violated ?
Well , since that time there have been a number of bills in the House and Senate to address this problem .
The House recently passed one bill unanimously , and a second bill was coming up in the House today .
But it suddenly disappeared without a word right when the story broke about the Bush administration illegally spying on all of our phone records .
Coincidence ?
Not according to what Representative Markey may be hearing .
He wrote to House Speaker Denny Hastert today asking what happened to the bill :
" With no notice or explanation , H.R. 4943 summarily disappeared from the House floor schedule that day and it has not been seen or heard from since .
I am concerned about reports that some intelligence agency or interest had a hand in the bill 's disappearance .
. .
Is it currently in some legislative ' Guantanamo Bay ' ? "
Legislation that no one disagreed with - legislation to protect your cell phone records - suddenly disappears from the House floor on the very day that we find out George Bush is spying on - what ?
- our phone records !
Which begs the question of whether the Republican Congress has now suddenly changed its mind on the value of protecting your phone records .
The House was for it with NO DISSENTING VOTES only a few weeks ago .
Now the legislation is utterly missing , and no word from the Republicans as to where it went .
And on the Senate side , we 're still waiting to see a vote on the legislation .
Did George Bush just kill a bill that would stop people from selling your phone records for a $ 100 ?
There 's still hope since one bill already passed the House , but let 's see if the Republicans have the backbone to pass a bill in the Senate and make this thing law .
( I knew about this story this morning , but a hat tip to Patriot Daily anyway for reminding me to post this after a very busy day . )
Nerd mit Sechs Thomas Pany
Wann dürfen sie ran ?
In den dicken Mauern einer Wohnung , erbaut im Jahre 1921 , herrscht deutlich hörbar jetzt der frische Geist des 21 .
Jahrhunderts .
Sattes Röhren von virtuellen Rennboliden im Kinderzimmer , eine mit R&B - Rhythmen unterlegte Fotoslideshow auf dem Monitor im Wohnzimmer und im Schlafzimmer MTV - Werbespots .
Der Siebenjährige läuft zwischen Papa , Mitbewohner , Besucher und den verschiedenen Bildschirmstationen herum , demonstriert kurz seine Fingerfertigkeit beim " Car - Racing - Game " , blättert mit der Maus blitzschnell die Fotos vom Kindergeburtstag durch , bis er das Lieblingsbild gefunden hat , und rennt ins Schlafzimmer , wo er ein paar Hip - Hop - Bewegungen vortanzt .
Auf Fragen reagiert der Junge nur einsilbig , schüchtern .
Er läuft zurück zum Autorennen .
Ich sehe seinen Vater an , der grinst , unverkennbar beglückt über mein Staunen , stolz :
Ich weiß Mediennutzung von Kindern ist kontrovers .
Ich halte nichts davon , meinen Sohn vom Computer fernzuhalten , wie es mir andere Eltern raten .
Jetzt lernt er am besten , je früher er damit anfängt , umso besser .
Der kann schon besser mit den Steuerungen umgehen als ich - und viel schneller .
Abhalten kann ihn jetzt eh keiner mehr .
Er wird bessere Chancen haben als ich .
Ein Genie
Manuels Vater arbeitet in der IT - Branche .
Selten , dass er weniger als zehn Stunden am Tag arbeitet , ein Arbeitszimmer zuhause ist nicht notwendig , der Computer schon .
Kein Wunder , dass es nicht lange dauerte , bis sich Manuel dafür zu interessieren begann .
Schon bevor er zwei Jahre alt war , begann er mit dem Keyboard auf eine Weise zu spielen , die der Vater fördern wollte .
Der Mitbewohner ist beeindruckt , der Junge sei zwar etwas schwierig , weil ziemlich introvertiert , aber ein " Genie " : " Wie sensibel , fein und intelligent der steuert und die Spiele kapiert .
Unglaublich . "
In der Schule hat der Junge ein paar Schwierigkeiten .
" Konzentrationsschwäche " , meint die Lehrerin , so der Vater .
Aber das sei doch normal für Kinder seines Alters .
" Die haben anderes im Kopf . " Etwas Sorgen macht ihm das doch , der Stolz ist aus seinem Gesicht verschwunden .
" Is that a good thing ? "
Es scheint , als ob Kinder in jeder neuen Generation immer früher von Medien penetriert werden , so der amerikanische Journalist , Internet - Kolumnist und Neue - Medien - Experte ( vgl. Weblogs und die große Freiheit ) , Mark Glaser und fragte Anfang März seine Online - Leserschaft : " Is that a good thing ? "
Sein dreieinhalbjähriger
Sohn würde Emails an die Großeltern schreiben und sei davon " besessen " , das Malprogramm für Kinder auszuprobieren und jedes Mal , wenn er seinen Vater am Computer arbeiten sehe , würde er lauthals danach verlangen , die Webseite der Sesam Street zu besuchen .
Die Eltern hätten sich darauf geeinigt , die Zeit , die der Zögling vor dem Computer verbringt , auf zwanzig Minuten zu beschränken .
Doch Verunsicherungen bleiben :
Ist das die richtige Zeit für ihn , einen Computer zu benutzen ?
Welches
Alter ist das beste und warum ?
Wie früh sollten Kinder online gehen und Erfahrungen mit dem Internet machen ?
Wie stehts mit Videogames ?
Wie beschränken Sie die Zeit , welche die Kinder vor dem Bildschirm verbringen ?
Positive Tendenz
Die Antworten der Leser des in den USA bekannten Medienbloggers liefern naturgemäß auch nur anekdotische Einblicke in die Reaktionen der Eltern auf diese neue pädagogische Herausforderung , aber in der großen Mehrheit der veröffentlichten Kommentare zeigt sich - trotz kritischer Einschübe - eine positive Tendenz gegenüber der frühkindlichen Mediennutzung ( und der Stolz mancher Eltern auf die Frühbegabung ) :
My son started watching the iTunes display while the baby sleep folder played as an infant .
As soon as he had enough manual dexterity to push a key , less than 6 months I think , he had learned how to change manipulate the colors and shapes a little by hitting several keys on the left side of the keyboard and to change a song he did n't like by hitting the right arrow key .
He also learned to hit the space bar to stop the color show .
Internet sites are even beginning to market to children under 5 years of age ( and their parents of course ) by attempting to build new brand names using tools such as podcasting ...
Maybe " listening " to a computer has greater appeal to kids in this age group do n't ya' think ?
My son began " using " the computer at 4 months old .
Now , at 6 - months , he loves " typing " and looking at still pictures of babies .
I do n't have him watching moving pictures with bright colors ans things though .
I do fear overstimulation .
I think when your child shows interest is when you should let them learn .
Selbstverständlich achten alle Eltern , die Glaser geschrieben haben , darauf , dass die Kinder nur eine begrenzte Zeit vor dem Bildschirm sitzen , dass sie beaufsichtigt werden und dass darüber gesprochen wird , schließlich wird Glasers Blog ja von Menschen gelesen , die sich mit Medien auskennen .
Neun Tage nach der Umfrage ist für Glaser zumindest klar :
Das Engagement der Eltern ist der Schlüssel .
Lassen Sie Ihr Kind nicht alleine online gehen und herumsurfen .
Wenn sie online gehen , ist es verblüffend zu sehen , wie viele Quellen es jetzt schon für sie gibt , damit sie den Jargon der Online - Welt lernen .
Die tägliche DVD
Ellen Wartella ist Leiterin des College of Communication an der University of Texas , Austin und Mitautorin der " bahnbrechenden Studie " von 1993 " Zero to Six : Electronic Media in the Lives of Infants , Toddlers and Preschoolers " .
Demnächst soll nun eine neue ebenso bahnbrechende Studie , an der sie mitgearbeitet hat erscheinen : Babys in Media Land .
War man 1993 noch davon Überrascht , dass Kinder unter sechs Jahren täglich im Durchschnitt zwei Stunden vor einem Bildschirm verbringen , ist die frühkindliche Nutzung neuer Medien in der neuen Studie schon quasi Grundannahme :
Noch vor einer Generation wurden Kinder wahrscheinlich durch Bücher oder das Lesen von Comics auf dem Schoß ihrer Eltern in die Medien eingeführt .
Das ist nicht mehr der Fall .
Heutzutage werden Kinder in sehr frühem Alter durch elektronische Medien in alle Arten der Mediennutzung eingeführt .
Ellen Wartella
Nach den Vorabergebnissen der neuen Studie schauen etwa 42 % der amerikanischen Kinder unter zwei Jahren Video oder DVD - " on any given day " .
Am meisten hat Wartella Überrascht , dass die Studie herausgefunden hat , dass 26 Prozent aller Kinder unter zwei Jahren einen eigenen Fernseher in ihrem Zimmer ( " bedroom " ) haben ( vgl. Fernsehen : Angriff auf das Gehirn ? ) .
In einem Email an Glaser schreibt Wartella , dass die Daten der Studie aber keinen Hinweis darauf geben , dass die " Screen time " für jüngere Kinder schädlich sei .
Dafür sei das
Thema nicht detailliert genug bearbeitet worden .
Allerdings würden die Ergebnisse von einer Serie von Untersuchungen , die andernorts gemacht wurden , nahe legen , dass Kinder erst mit zwei Jahren " screen literacy " entwickeln würden .
Was und wie sie von Bildschirm - Medien vor diesem
Alter lernen können , sei unklar .
Keine Ahnung
Ähnlich vage auch das Vorabergebnis der neuen Studie .
Zwar würden Pädagogen empfehlen , Kinder unter zwei Jahren - in Deutschland werden die Grenzen gemeinhin noch deutlich höher gesetzt - nicht vor einen Fernseh - Bildschirm zu setzen , weil Kinder Interaktion nötig haben , um ein " gesundes Gehirn " zu entwickeln .
Doch werde von keinen Untersuchungsdaten gedeckt , wie sich Fernsehen auf das Wachstum des Gehirns auswirke .
Forscher hätten dazu keine Daten .
Eine Untersuchung , die Mitte Dezember letzten Jahres veröffentlicht wurde , brachte ebenfalls ans Licht , dass die Forscher keine genauen Anhaltspunkte dafür hatten , wie die neuen Medien sich auf Kleinkinder auswirken , was aber auch heißt , das keine Forschung bestätigen konnte , was die Hersteller von " Baby Einstein " ( vgl. Burnout mit Fünf ) und " Brainy Baby " behaupten , nämlich dass diese neuen " Tools " irgendeinen erzieherischen
Wert hätten .
Die Wahrheit sei , dass wir von Medien überschwemmt würden , aber " nicht wissen , was das für Kinder bedeutet " .
Man wisse auch nicht genau , warum die Eltern sich so oder so entscheiden würden .
Bis dato würden sich die Forscher noch immer nach Anekdoten ausrichten .
Wir sitzen in der Küche .
Plötzlich Explosionen und laute Schusssalven aus dem Wohnzimmer .
Manuels
Vater steht abrupt auf , läuft ins Wohnzimmer , wir hören jetzt Kommandos lauter als der Schusswechsel : " Mach das sofort aus .
Wie oft hab ich dir gesagt , dass du dieses Spiel nicht spielen darfst . "
Mit einem Lächeln im geröteten Gesicht , das den Vaterstolz über den Lausejungen nicht ganz verbergen kann und die Spur Peinlichkeit , die trotz allem entstanden ist , wiedergibt , setzt sich Manuels Vater wieder : " Mediennutzung ist kontrovers , ich weiß schon . "

There is no doubt that the credit - card - marketing industry is a great source of income for many people , especially in the current economic times .
This is due in part to the fact that credit card companies have been doing their best to make money off of consumers over recent years , while at the same time lowering their standard of service to make the credit card transaction more convenient for consumers .
However , with so many different companies out there claiming to have the best credit card marketing programs
on the market , how do consumers find which one is the right fit for their needs ?
There are a number of steps that consumers can take that will make credit card marketing and search engine marketing dallas with them much easier and more profitable .
The first thing that consumers should do when looking for credit card marketing programs is to make sure that they research the companies that they are considering .
Researching the credit card companies that you are considering is the first step that consumers should take in order to get an understanding of what you will be getting in return for the money you spend with the credit card company .
One of the best things that consumers can do when looking for credit card marketing programs is to make sure that they do not choose the first credit card marketing program that comes to them .
Instead , consumers should do a little bit of background research on the credit card company to make sure that they are the right fit for their needs .
Another way that consumers can make credit card marketing easier is to make sure that they look at all the credit card companies that they are considering .
One of the most important aspects of credit card marketing is making sure that consumers can get the best deals on credit cards from all the different credit card companies .
This will help ensure that consumers are able to make the most money with their credit cards .
If consumers are looking for credit card marketing programs , they should look at the features
of all the credit cards that they are considering .
Some credit card companies offer more than others , so consumers will want to make sure that they take a look at the features that the company has to offer .
Consumers should also make sure that they check out the interest rates for the different credit cards that they are considering , because these interest rates can make a huge difference in the amount of money that consumers will end up spending each month with the company .
Finally , consumers should also make sure that they look at the rates for the credit cards in question before making their final decision .
to use the credit card .
With this information in mind , consumers will be able to find the best credit card marketing program for their specific needs .
that will help them make the most money in the end .
One of the best features that a credit card offers consumers is the ability to make purchases online .
This is an especially important feature for consumers to consider when trying to find credit card marketing programs .
Because consumers can make purchases online , they will be able to pay for their purchases at the same time that they are making their credit card payments .
Credit card marketing companies will also be able to track consumers ’ purchases ,
so that they can see how well the credit card is performing .
This means that consumers will be able to see what credit card is paying off the most in interest .
When consumers are trying to find the best credit card for their needs , they will want to make sure that the card that they are considering offers the best deal on the card that they want .
In this case , they will be able to find the best deal on their credit cards .
Consumers will also want to make sure that they are not signing up for a card that has a lower interest rate than what the card that they want .
This will help them to avoid paying more money in interest than they have to .
Make sure that they compare the different offers so that they can find the best deal .

Recently , Anderson Cooper and one of his correspondents , Gary Tuchman , condemned price gouging in New Orleans as if they were reporting an inherently unjust practice that no reasonable person would accept .
So , once again , it needs explaining why price gouging is not only not bad , but is essential to the welfare of everyone involved .
Without it , people do n't get the essential goods they need after disasters .
Free markets here are humane and necessary .
After a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina , there is usually a great increase in the desire on the part of consumers ( the victims of such a disaster or war ) for those newly found goods which they most urgently desire .
That 's symptomatic of the law of marginal utility , which is universally valid and deducible from every single action — that every action is directed towards satisfying one 's most urgently desired need .
And how do we deduce this ?
Because that action is undertaken in preference to every other possible course of action .
In disaster areas , this usually means that people 's most urgently desired needs happen to be those most closely related to survival and restarting their livelihoods , such as by getting food , building materials , electricity , etc .
But while the demand for these goods goes way up , the supply may be the same or even less after a disaster .
There 's a major problem for both consumers and producers here for the allocation of goods .
For consumers , those who most urgently desire them must be able to get them , and those who less urgently desire them must be " directed , " in a sense , to consume cheaper , substitute goods , and less of those goods they would purchase more of if the price were lower .
The problem with producers is that there is n't enough for everyone .
More firms and production needs to occur and bring the things people need to disaster areas .
Both consumers and producers are facilitated by the " jacking up " of prices .
Their interests are in harmony here .
Higher prices are painful for consumers , but a vital and corrective tendency .
It means that those who most urgently desire goods will be able to get them — they wo n't just show up at stores and find nothing left for them .
Those who less urgently desire these goods have a guide for rational economic calculation .
Some will find the new prices make the consumption of the good less beneficial than foregoing it and purchasing some other , cheaper substitute .
For instance , instead of buying higher - priced milk , a person may just buy water instead .
And since they did n't buy the milk , they wo n't buy cereal , but instead perhaps get oatmeal .
Or , instead of buying two gallons of milk , a person may buy just one .
This means that the people who need goods the most will get them , and not because producers and consumers are moral , intelligent , or generous .
It 's because such a clearing of markets , or rational economic calculation , is based upon prices .
But the higher price brings further benefits to consumers , in the absence of which their suffering would be even further prolonged .
Just as higher prices mean marginal consumers will no longer deem it beneficial to purchase a certain good , for marginal producers the higher prices make it profitable to sell in a disaster area like New Orleans , where previously it had not been profitable to do so .
The new price acts as a coordinator to firms that will now provide even more goods to needy people in New Orleans .
Again , not because they are good people , but because they 're self - interested , just as consumers are .
Vested interests have little sway in capitalism , where consumers bind the hands of producers to serve them because they can patronize whoever they wish .
When more firms bring their products to a disaster area , the price is inevitably brought down because of price competition on the greater supply of goods .
Each firm is seeking to undercut its competitors .
The most vulnerable people get what they need , and can have more urgently desired wants satisfied so they can proceed to satisfy less and less urgently desired ones and have a better quality of life .
This process continues indefinitely , of course , since with the greater supply and lower prices , there are more marginal firms who will not find it profitable to sell in that area .
This is a dynamic and ongoing process .
It happens to look very different on the surface after a disaster , but it is as essential as ever .
Now , let 's consider what happens when prices are artificially suppressed by the government after a disaster .
Lots of people want cheap goods and fast .
Not only that , but they 'll buy more of them if they 're cheap , for fear that others will get to them first .
So consumers just show up to empty store shelves .
They lose out ; businesses lose out on more profits ; but the government certainly does n't lose anything .
In fact , this new crisis serves as the pretense for even more violent government interventions , since on its face it looks like a market - induced crisis .
There 's one more rather simplistic fallacy that was not only propagated by Tuchman , but seems to be generally accepted among the opponents of free markets in disaster areas : that higher costs of production after a disaster justify higher prices , while greed - induced higher prices are unjustified .
Here we have an example of markets actually being damned with false exculpation , since higher costs neither justify nor bring about higher prices .
In the first place , this commonly held opinion hints at some measure of a " just price " absent the one people voluntarily agree to as beneficial .
Secondly , costs do n't determine prices .
Rather , prices determine costs .
Since entrepreneurs are constantly attempting to capitalize on some market where other entrepreneurs have underestimated the desires of consumers , they are necessarily future oriented .
The prices they set are based on their calculations of the future , maximizing profits by adjusting prices based on their expectations about the future valuations of consumers .
Finally , to pass judgment on the prices set after disasters , or under any circumstances , based on the possible psychology of businessmen is to promote envy over consequences .
Psychology plays no part in the consequences , since they are a function of action , not intention .
The consequences outlined here are n't predicated upon good intentions , but merely upon self - interest .
We do n't have capitalism in New Orleans or anywhere else , of course .
There are lots of problems with producers trying to enter the market because of wage and price , environmental , health , building , safety , and licensing regulations and taxes , which act as government - sponsored grants of monopoly privilege to those supra-marginal producers who can afford them , as opposed to the sub - marginal ones who can't .
Only government can grant monopoly privilege to put obstacles in the way of people getting what they need .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - U.S. authorities began testing a controversial new X - ray machine to screen air passengers for weapons in Phoenix on Friday , which critics likened to a “ virtual strip search . ”
An airport employee checks a passenger 's boarding passes as he enters a security checkpoint in terminal 4 at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix , Arizona November 22 , 2006 .
U.S. authorities began testing a controversial new X - ray machine to screen air passengers for weapons in Phoenix on Friday , which critics likened to a " virtual strip search . "
REUTERS / Jeff Topping
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration rolled out an X - ray machine that uses so - called “ backscatter ” technology at one checkpoint at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport .
The machine peers beneath passengers ’ clothes to search for hidden explosives and weapons .
The TSA will test the machine in Phoenix for 60 - 90 days before deploying machines in Los Angeles and New York ’s John F. Kennedy Airport for additional testing by the end of the year .
“ Everyday the bad guys are working and improving their tools .
We need to continue working to improve ours and introducing this technology is part of that work , ” TSA regional spokesman Nico Melendez told Reuters .
Privacy groups and the American Civil Liberties Union have labeled the new screening a “ virtual strip search ” that could be abused .
But TSA officials said Friday they had worked with industry specialists to blur any images of body parts generated by the scan , and likened the resulting picture to a “ chalk outline ” of a person .
The machine is made by Boston - based American Science and Engineering Inc. , and is on loan for the trial .
Passengers selected for secondary testing at the airport , which is the nation ’s eighth busiest , can choose an X - ray scan or a pat - down search .
It is strictly voluntary .
Airline passengers who choose to use the new machines stand in front of it with their arms in the air .
A tiny laser beam scans the passenger from head to toe .
The images come up on a computer screen in a room about 50 feet away .
A green or red light -- for pass or fail -- is pressed and shows up at the screening location .
Officials said the computer does not have the ability to save or store images , a concern expressed by privacy - rights groups .
“ It gives our officers the absolute best opportunity to find prohibited items , ” said Michael Golden , the TSA ’s chief technology officer .
Airport travelers had mixed opinions about the new device , saying they hope it does n’t slow down the process of getting through security .
Few had any privacy concerns .
“ If it ’s something that ’s going to improve safety , then I do n’t have any problem with it , ” said Ashley Houston , 32 , as she waited for a plane to Albuquerque .
“ I have nothing to hide . ”
Usage ( require - extension ajax )
This extension provides a set of procedures to use asynchronous callbacks from a browser to a Chicken - powered web - server ( for example Spiffy ) .
This is done using Prototype 's wrappers around the xmlHttpRequest API .
Holds a procedure that will be called for every registered xmlHttpRequest callback ( see below ) .
Specifies how HTML and script - fragments generated by the procedures of this package should be handled .
SYMBOL should be either shtml or html , where the former requests output as SXML expressions and the latter as text containing HTML .
html is the default .
procedure : ( ajax [ KEY [ SCRIPTFILENAME ] ] )
Initializes callback handling for this page / response and returns a HTML or SHTML fragment containing a script element linking to the given source filename , which defaults to prototype.js .
The Prototype library is included in the distribution and will be installed in the extension repository .
The optional argument KEY is used to make the generated callback - URLs for this page more unique and may be an arbitrary string .
This procedure resets the callback - handling for this response and must be called before using any of the remote - ... procedures described below .
procedure : ( remote-url THUNK [ ARGUMENTS ] [ SESSIONID ] [ UNIQUEID ] [ LIFETIME ] )
Registers a HTTP callback handler for a generated URL that invokes THUNK , a procedure with no arguments .
If ARGUMENTS is given , then it should be a string or an association - list mapping URL - encoded argument - names to values .
In both cases the arguments will be encoded in the url .
If SESSIONID and LIFETIME are given , this url will be expired when the LIFETIME in seconds is passed from the last access of urls with the SESSIONID .
If UNIQUEID is given and not #f , it is used to remove the previous url with the same UNIQUEID .
This procedure returns an URL as a string .
procedure : ( remote - action THUNK #! key arguments update insert - before insert - after insert - top insert - bottom method success failure name frequency eval - scripts sessionid uniqueid lifetime )
Returns a string containing Javascript code to invoke the zero-argument procedure THUNK via an xmlHttpRequest callback .
Depending on the keyword arguments the result returned from THUNK is treated as HTML or SHTML and describes a HTML fragment that should be used to modify the current document .
The meaning of the various keyword arguments is as follows .
arguments
A string or an association list of URL - encoded variable / value pairs ( see remote - url for more information ) update the id of a document node that should be replaced with the SXML of this reply insert - before Document - id of element before which the reply will be inserted insert - after Document - id of element after which the reply will be inserted insert - top Document - id of element in which the reply will be inserted as the topmost sub-element insert - bottom Document - id of element in which the reply will be inserted as the bottommost sub-element method HTTP request method used success Javascript code to be evaluated on successful reply failure Javascript code to be evaluated on non-succesful reply name
The name of a Javascript variable which should be assigned to the created Prototype placeholder object frequency
The interval in seconds after which the callback should be invoked eval - scripts
If true , evaluate JavaScript code received in the response sessionid Pass to remote - url uniqueid Pass to remote - url lifetime Pass to remote - url Note that the update , insert -... , success and failure arguments are mutually exclusive .
If the frequency argument is given , a periodical timer will be started ( you can use the name argument to obtain a reference to the timer and call the start and stop Javascript methods to control it ) .
procedure : ( remote - link TEXT THUNK KEYWORD -ARGUMENTS ...)
Returns HTML or SHTML for a link ( < a > ) that will invoke THUNK when clicked .
The KEYWORD - ARGUMENTS are the same as for remote - action .
procedure : ( remote - button TEXT THUNK KEYWORD -ARGUMENTS ...)
Returns HTML or SHTML for a button ( < button > ) .
procedure : ( remote - timer FREQUENCY THUNK KEYWORD -ARGUMENTS ...)
Are there secrets to life - long brain power ?
Research shows that there are .
According to Dr Dharma Singh Khalsa , president and medical director of the Alzheimer 's Prevention Foundation International in Tucson , Arizona and author of Brain Longevity ( 1997 ) , Meditation as Medicine ( 2002 ) , and Food as Medicine ( 2004 ) , " your brain needs three different kinds of exercise to thrive best " .
These are mental exercise , aerobic physical exercise , and mind / body exercises .
Mental effort , the so - called " hard thinking " actually stimulates brain cells to send out microscopic filaments called dendrites to establish new connections with one another .
" Hard thinking " also promotes the growth of glial cells ( the brain 's little housekeepers ) that support the metabolism of the cells that do the thinking and keep brain nerve pathways clean .
Types of this form of exercise include learning to play the piano , doing cross - word puzzles , taking up a new hobby where new skills must be learned .
Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain and stimulates the release of nerve growth factor .
This is a vital hormone that restores damaged neurons and boosts the levels of the brain 's neurotransmitters ( messenger chemicals ) that the brain needs for thinking and memory .
Types of this form of exercise include walking , swimming , and bike - riding .
Dr Khalsa claims that mind / body exercises are derived from ancient Eastern religious practices .
" They regenerate the brain by increasing energy levels and boosting the ability to concentrate by 20 per cent or more . "
Types of this form of exercise include meditation , deep - breathing , and listening to meditative music .
Dr. Khalsa also suggests that the brain thrives best , if you eliminate stress .
He adds : " When you 're pushed - or you push yourself too hard - your brain goes into destructive overdrive .
The damage that stress causes is slow and subtle , and it builds up over a lifetime .
So it is essential to take steps to reduce your stress level every day . "
Dr Khalsa contends that " the well - nourished brain " is a well - thriving brain too .
Fat promotes brain deterioration , much as it wreaks havoc with the heart and arteries .
It clogs the vessels that carry oxygen and glucose - the brain 's energy fuel - to millions of neurons and produces free radicals - the highly reactive and destructive chemicals that scar and kill brain cells .
He suggests : " Keep your fat intake below 20 per cent of total calories . "
He further suggests the taking of vitamin E ( the antioxidant ) , vitamin B ( the energy booster ) , coenzyme - Q - 10 ( the brain cell - refueling substance ) , and ginko biloba ( the brain blood circulation enhancing substance ) .

artificial ignorance : how - to guide
Previous message :
Here is my plan for firewall implementation
Next message : artificial ignorance : how - to guide
Messages sorted by : [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]
By request , here 's a quick how - to on log scanning via artificial ignorance . :)
It assumes UNIX and the presence of a good grep - you could use other stuff if you wanted to but this is just an example .
Setting up a filter is a process of constant tuning .
First you build a file of common strings that are n't interesting , and , as new uninteresting things happen , you add them to the file .
I start with a shell command like this : cd / var / log cat * | \ sed -e 's /^.*demo//' -e 's / \ [ [ 0 - 9 ] *\]//' | \ sort | uniq -c | \ sort -r -n > /tmp/xx
In this example " demo " is my laptop 's name , and I use it in the sed command to strip out the leading lines of syslog messages so that I lose the date / timestamps .
This means that the overall variation in the text is reduced considerably .
The next argument to sed strips out the PID from the daemon , another source of text variation .
we then sort it , collapse duplicates into a count , then sort the count numerically .
This yields a file of the frequency with which something shows up in syslog ( more or less ) : 297 cron : ( root ) CMD ( /usr / bin / at ) 167 sendmail : alias database /etc/aliases.db out of date 120 ftpd : PORT 61 lpd : restarted 48 kernel : wdpi0 : transfer size=2048 intr cmd DRQ ... etc
In the example on " demo " this reduced 3982 lines of syslog records to 889 .
Then what you want to do is trim from BOTH ends of the file and build an " ignore this " list .
In this example , I do n't care that cron ran " at " OK so I 'd add a regexp like : cron . * : ( root ) CMD ( /usr/bin / at )
That 's a pretty precise one . :)
At the bottom of my file there were about 200 entries that looked like : 1 ftpd : RETR pic9.jpg 1 ftpd : RETR pic8.jpg 1 ftpd : RETR pic7.jpg 1 ftpd : RETR pic6.jpg
Clearly these are highly unique events but also not interesting .
So I add patterns that look like : ftpd .*: RETR ftpd .*: STOR ftpd .*: CWD ftpd .*: USER ftpd .*: FTP LOGIN FROM
Now , you apply your stop - list as follows : cat * | grep - v -f stoplist | \ sort , etc --
This time I get 744 lines .
Putting a pattern in that matches : sendmail .* : .* to= Drops it down to 120 lines .
Just keep doing this and pretty soon you 'll have a set of patterns that make your whole syslog output disappear .
You 'll notice that in the early example I had a warning from sendmail because the aliases database was out of date .
Rather than putting a pattern for that , I simply ran newalias .
Next time my aliases database is out of date , my log scanner will tell me .
System reboots are cool , too .
My log shows : 48 kernel : wdc2 at pcmcia0 : PCCARD IDE disk controller 48 kernel : wdc1 at pcmcia0 : PCCARD IDE disk controller 48 kernel : wdc0 at isa0 iobase 0x1f0 irq 14 : disk controller 48 kernel : wd0 at wdc0 drive 0 : sec/int=4 2818368*512 ...
Those will be pretty much static .
So I add those exact lines .
Now they wo n't show up whenever the system boots .
BUT
I 'll get a notification if a new SCSI drive is added , or ( I did this deliberately ! ) : kernel : fd0 c : hard error writing fsbn 1 of 1 - 19 ( fd0 bn 1 ; cn kernel : fd0 : write protected Oooh !
Some bad boy trying to step on my tripwire file !
Or : kernel : changing root device to wd1a .. interesting .
My pattern was for wd0a !
I used to run this kind of stuff on a firewall that I used to manage .
One day its hard disk burned up and my log scan cheerfully found these new messages about bad block replacement and sent them to me . :)
The advantage of this approach is that it 's dumb , it 's cheap -- and it catches stuff you do n't know about already .
Once you 've got your pattern file tuned , put it in cron or whatever , so it runs often .
The TIS Gauntlet has a hack I wrote called " retail " which I can't unfortunately release the code for , but is easy to implement .
Basically , it was like tail but it remembered the offset in the file from the previous run , and the inode of the file ( so it 'd detect file shifts ) - the trick is to keep one fd open to the file and seek within it , then stat it every so often to see if the file has grown or changed inode .
If it has , read to EOF , open the new file , and start again .
That way you can chop the end of the log file through a filter every couple seconds with minimal expense in CPU and disk I/O .
I 'm sure there are lots of fun ways this simple trick can be enhanced -- but just in its naive form I 've found it quite useful .
I wish I had a program that helped me statistically build my noise filters , but in general I find it 's about a 2 hour job , tops , and it 's one you do once and forget about .

On October 8 , 1997 , [ lawyer , GOP activist and current NRO contributor George ]
Conway sent a long E-mail message via America Online to Matt Drudge .
" Subject : Your Next Exclusive " is the caption on that message .
" Remember me ? " it begins .
" I 'm Laura [ Ingraham ] 's friend .
We talked once about Kathleen Willey ...
This is being given to you , of course , subject to your not disclosing the source . "
( Conway forwarded the same message to Ingraham the following day . )
The main topic of the October 8 message was not Willey but the " distinguishing characteristic , " a matter nearly as sensitive as the Willey allegations .
Like Coulter , Conway must have realized that with the leak of its details to Drudge , any further settlement negotiations could again be disrupted .
For the next few years , Conway ... spoke to me about little else but Clinton ’s rumored sexual habits , and the supposed size and shape of his genitalia .
D IS FOR DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS :
His was the first First Penis to have an official statement issued on its behalf , following its formal examination by Captain Kevin O'Connell of the National Naval Medical Center as Exhibit A in Paula Jones 's sexual harassment suit .
' In terms of size , shape , direction , ' announced his lawyer Bob Bennett , ' the President is a normal man . '
P IS FOR PUSSY : Some years back , asked what he and the President talked about during their frequent afternoons on the golf course , Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan replied succinctly , ' Pussy . '
Presumably this is a reference to Kathleen Willey 's late cat , who mysteriously disappeared after she went public with her accusations against the President .
Q IS FOR QUEEN , BEAUTY : Mr Clinton has had relationships with at least three winners of the Miss Arkansas competition : Sally Perdue , Miss Arkansas 1958 ; Lencola Sullivan , Miss Arkansas 1980 ; Elizabeth Ward Gracen , Miss Arkansas 1982 .
S IS FOR THE SMALL - BREAST DEFENCE :
When Kathleen Willey accused the President of assault , Monica was indignant : how could the President be unfaithful to her ?
Fortunately , Mr Clinton was able to reassure her that Mrs Willey 's story was completely unbelievable because he'd never grope a woman with such small breasts .
If you study the women who disrobed for Playboy and Penthouse , this appears to be one of the less risible Clinton defence arguments .

CAMPAIGN DRAMA ROCKS DEMOCRATS :
KERRY FIGHTS OFF MEDIA PROBE OF RECENT ALLEGED INFIDELITY , RIVALS PREDICT RUIN
** World Exclusive * * ** Must Credit the DRUDGE REPORT **
A frantic behind - the - scenes drama is unfolding around Sen. John Kerry and his quest to lockup the Democratic nomination for president , the DRUDGE REPORT can reveal .
Intrigue surrounds a woman who recently fled the country , reportedly at the prodding of Kerry , the DRUDGE REPORT has learned .
. . .
Democratic presidential frontrunner John Kerry is planning a response to a DRUDGE REPORT exclusive which first revealed the frantic behind - the - scenes drama surrounding a woman who recently fled the country , reportedly at the prodding of Kerry ! . . . .
The nature and details of a claimed two - year relationship , beginning in the Spring of 2001 , between a young woman and Kerry is at the center of serious investigations at several media outlets .
I 've got some interesting , juicy details on this book on Hillary by Ed Klein , but I 'm not going to be the first to mention them .
I 'm not going there .
It will come out eventually .
It has to do with sexual orientation , and I 'm not going to be the one .
That 's the book that everybody says is going to be presenting a firestorm .
. . .
" I mean , where are the real men in the Democratic Party ?
Where are the real men ?
Hillary Clinton 's one of them , but where are the others ? "
OK , folks , I think I got enough information here to tell you about the contents of this fax that I got .
Brace yourselves .
This fax contains information that I have just been told will appear in a newsletter to Morgan Stanley sales personnel this afternoon .
...
What it is is a bit of news which says ... there 's a Washington consulting firm that has scheduled the release of a report that will appear , it will be published , that claims that Vince Foster was murdered in an apartment owned by Hillary Clinton , and the body was then taken to Fort Marcy Park .
My views of him as a man are fairly unremarkable .
Few people dispute that the guy is a hormonally challenged selfish jerk .
. . . So now we are on the verge of finding out , according to the Drudge Report , whether Bill Clinton is a deadbeat dad .
Will it change things ?
I do n't know .
But if the last year is any indication , it wo n't .
The president 's defenders at this point just do n't care . . .
I do n't know if Clinton fathered that child .
But would anyone be surprised ?
So I guess what astounds me is that in all three categories she is either a stunning failure ( see list in above item ) or an even more stunning fraud .
Her marriage was supposed to usher in this new paradigm of equal partnership between spouses — two for the price of one .
It can not be under - emphasized the degree to which they claimed theirs was a loving , real marriage .
Where ?
What love ?
What reality ?
Who in America wants their marriage to be like the Clintons ' ?
Gail Sheehy writes in the upcoming Vanity Fair that Hillary is an addict .
She loves saving her husband when he gets himself into horny - goat trouble .
He may not be hitting her but can anybody say " battered - spouse syndrome ? " . . . .
Sheehy says friends of the First Lady believe that Hillary is the only person in America who would n't get a cigar joke .
Um , what ?
So , she 's fully forgiven him and yet she does n't know the full extent of his piggishness .
Talk about transactional immunity .
This is not an open , loving marriage .
This is the Jerry Springer show with nicer clothes .
the dominant issue of the 1998 election will be Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton alone ; his perjury ; his cover - up ; his obstruction of justice ; and , yes , his sexual misconduct .
Bush 's campaign strategists , including Karl Rove , devised a push poll against John McCain .
South Carolina voters were asked " Would you be more likely or less likely to vote for John McCain for president if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child ? " .
They had no interest in the actual percentages in the poll , the goal was to suggest that [ McCain had a black child ] .
This was particularly vicious since McCain was campaining with his adopted [ dark skinned ] Bangladeshi daughter .
Flying down to South Carolina after the upset defeat of Bush in the New Hampshire primary , Rove and Bush were said by a reliable source to have had a frank conversation about what was necessary to defeat Sen.
John McCain , who had just defeated Bush in New Hampshire .
. . .
Before the votes were cast , McCain was accused by Rove - managed surrogate groups of fathering a mixed - race child out of wedlock , being married to a drug addict , not being an attentive husband , using his wife 's family fortune to buy his U.S. Senate seat and , worst of all , turning his back on Vietnam veterans ; and all of this happened while George W. Bush was at rallies urging his primary opponent to please engage in a civilized debate on the issues .
Ann Richards was a socially progressive and inclusive governor of Texas , appointing a few gays and lesbians to state boards and commissions .
In 1994 , Rove pinpointed this as an issue certain to help George W. Bush win election in a conservative state .
Of course , Rove was not about to let his candidate broach the subject himself .
Instead , he worked through Republican operatives in East Texas .
Rumors soon began to circulate through coffee shops and agricultural co-ops that implied Gov. Richards , an unmarried woman , might be a lesbian .
Without identifying the topic , she acknowledged she was being hurt .
" You know what it 's about , " she told reporters , dismissively , after being asked about the rumors .
" And I 'm not talking about it . "
When it comes to the politics of distraction , Bush 's decision to stoke fears among religious conservatives about gay sex is part of a historical pattern among Republicans .
In fact , the last time the party fought a battle over '' traditional ' ' marriage -- attempting to uphold state bans on interracial marriage during the 1960s -- the political landscape was eerily similar .
Sixteen states had laws on the books outlawing marriage between whites and blacks , and seventy percent of Americans opposed interracial marriage .
Those are almost precisely the numbers that Bush marshaled to justify his call to ban gay marriage .
. . .
The turning point from race - baiting to gay - baiting came in 1984 , when Jesse Helms framed his Senate campaign -- then the most expensive in history -- as a struggle between '' the patriotic ' ' and '' the homosexuals . ''
At the time , emotions against integration and busing were on the decline in the South , and Republicans needed a new scare issue to frighten voters .
'' One of Helms ' political architects told me at the time that it was not about ' values ' -- it was about provoking a visceral , gut - level response , '' says Bob Hall , who studied the campaign for the Institute for Southern Studies in Durham , North Carolina .
'' It 's not rational -- it 's Snakes on a Plane . ''
Helms , he adds , '' proved the value of gay - baiting in a campaign -- even against a moderate opponent .
He helped embed it into the culture of the right - wing political operatives . ''
Gay - bashing has been part of the GOP 's political bread and butter ever since .
'' The gay issue has taken the place of the race issue for the Republican right , '' says Richard Cohen , president of the Southern Poverty Law Center .
'' This is true not only in the South but nationwide . '' . . .
'' Homophobia is replacing the set of flag and race issues of a generation ago , '' says Kevin Phillips , the one - time Nixon strategist who coined the term '' Southern Strategy ' ' to describe the GOP 's leverage of racial prejudice to wrest the South from Democratic control .
'' It 's the last refuge of the scoundrel . ''
Hi , I 'm a fervent supporter of George Bush , and I vehemently object to preemptive wars , tax cuts for the wealthy , deficit spending , and the use of terrorism to justify expansive government power .
Those things are immoral and reprehensible and the Democrats ' use of those things is destroying our country .
for governor
[ Republican nominee ] Vernon Robinson , who has run a series of brash advertisements about the two - term Democratic congressman , charged that Miller wants to import homosexuals to the United States and supported scientific studies that would pay teenage girls to watch pornography .
" Those are San Francisco values , not North Carolina values , " said Robinson , repeating a common theme of his campaign .
A bemused Miller countered by blasting Robinson for a campaign mailer that implicitly suggested the congressman was gay and criticized Miller for being " childless . "
Miller 's wife had a hysterectomy more than two decades ago .
Scads of right - wing bloggers are scandalized and outraged today because it has been reported that GOP social conservative Senator Larry Craig routinely engages in anonymous sex with men .
Why , they are just furious that anyone would introduce issues of someone 's private sexual affairs into the public arena , and particularly can't believe that someone would try to use a person 's homosexuality as a political weapon .
Most movingly , they lament that exploiting private sexual behavior this way will drive good people out of political life .
I really had n't intended to write about this Larry Craig story when I read about it this morning ( I was and am working on a post on the President 's very inspiring signing ceremony yesterday ) , but then I became exposed to this disgustingly pious concern being paraded about by all sorts of right - wing pundits over dragging sexual innuendo into the public arena and subjecting political officials to unpleasant personal attacks that would drive good people from office , and how can anyone let that raging , violent hypocrisy just go uncommented upon ?
Their entire political movement over the last 20 years has been fueled by sleazy sexual innuendo ; dragging private sexual behavior into the public arena for fun , profit and political gain ; and exploiting the gay issue to drive people to vote for them .
Are they aware of the history and behavior of their political movement when they deliver these sermons or , like the chaos and civil war they brought to Iraq , do they block those facts out and create a different reality for themselves ?
Are they cognizant of any of this : From Joe Conason 's definitive account in Salon of how the odd " distinguishing spots " on Bill Clinton 's penis became a major news story in our country :
From page 182 of David Brock ’s book Blinded by the Right : Matt Drudge , the right - wing Walter Cronkite , " exposing " John Kerry 's secret affair with an intern during the 2004 campaign :
The Boston Globe ( via Daily Kos ) , March 21 , 2004 , on how George Bush beat John McCain in South Carolina : James Moore , writing in Salon ( via Digby ) , on Bush 's defeat of John McCain in South Carolina : James Moore , writing in Salon ( via Digby ) , on Bush 's defeat of Ann Richards with the aid of lesbian rumor - mongering : Tim Dickinson , writing in Rolling Stone , documenting the GOP 's absolute refusal to use homosexuality as a political weapon :
That Bush followers are drowning in the most transparent and rancid hypocrisy is hardly news .
But what incidents like this demonstrate is just how detached so many of them are from the rational realm and just from basic reality .
Listening to Bush followers decry the political use of homosexuality and private sexual behavior would be like listening to a Bush follower say something like this :
If a person said something like that , they would widely be deemed to be crazy , but that sentiment is indistinguishable from the righteous outrage pouring forth over the " left 's " exploitation of sexual behavior for political gain and the destructive invasion into the private sexual lives of political figures .
How can any adherent to the Bush - led Republican party possibly protest tactics of that sort with a straight face ?
It is truly inconceivable .
The Limbaugh - led right wing of the Republican Party pioneered the repugnant tactic of winning elections by claiming the virtues of sexual morality and depicting their political opponents as sexually depraved .
The GOP depends upon , courts and embraces support from the likes of James Dobson , Gary Bauer , and Cliff Kinkaid who care about little other than private sexual morality and the immorality of the homosexual .
Just yesterday , Newt Gingrich argued that " Republicans are right to favor traditional American conservative social values , and the left is completely wrong to put San Francisco left - wing values third in line to be President , " and Tim Graham said in The Corner that Democrats should lose because liberals have a " sexually omnivorous agenda .
"
As should be painfully obvious , the issue with Larry Craig -- or with pointing out the wildly promiscuous recreational - drug - aided sexual behavior of Rush Limbaugh , or Newt Gingrich 's multiple , overlapping broken marriages -- is n't to apply our moral standards to their private lives , but is to apply their own publicly claimed moral standards , as well as the core tactics of the GOP , to document that they live in utter contradiction to the sexual morality they relentlessly embrace for political gain ( an exceedingly simple concept which the intellectually honest La Shawn Barber patiently tries to explain to her fellow Bush supporters , as does Pam Spaulding , a little less patiently ) .
Why does it even need to be pointed out that the issue is n't the sexual morality of Larry Craig , Rush Limabugh and Newt Gingrich , but their vile hypocrisy , equally embodied by the anger being expressed by Bush followers over the use of sexual issues for political gain ?
While many Bush followers are aware of this fact and cynically pretend not to understand it , others ( I think the majority ) are genuinely incapable of understanding that point because they block out the reality that the political movement to which they pledge their loyalty has made private sexual morality and exploitation of people 's private lives a central political weapon .
Just as they spent three years blocking out the extreme violence , chaos and civil war they brought to Iraq ( and some still do ) , they just refuse to recognize facts that undermine their desires .
Watching Bush followers angrily objecting to the use of sexual behavior and homosexuality for political gain -- or listening them oh - so - solemnly lament how the Good People are being driven away from politics because of the personal , invasive treatment to which they are subjected -- is about as jaw - droppingly astonishing as any spectacle one can fathom .
This is a political movement built upon claims of moral superiority in the sexual and private realms .
It is truly difficult to express the level of contempt and scorn that is merited when the most fervent supporters of that same political movement pretend to be offended and angry when it is revealed that the lives being led by their political leaders are grossly inconsistent with the sexual and moral values they claim to monopolize .
Here is video of Sean Hannity , just two nights ago , defending Melanie Morgan and her co-author 's claim in their new book that Cindy Sheehan had an affair with Lew Rockwell and is " addicted to online porn . "
Let 's hear some more from Bush supporters about how terrible it is that the " left " is using private sexual behavior for political gain and exposing people who enter the public arena to such terrible , invasive scrutiny .
And here is what is happening in a North Carolina Congressional raceWhatever else you might want to say about them , Republicans simply will not use people 's private sexual behavior or demonize homosexuals for political gain .
They are outraged by such despicable tactics .
Absolutely outraged . : Nick Gillespie documents how Republican Ken Blackwell is trying to win the Ohio Governor 's race by having the Ohio State GOP Chairman suggest that Blackwell 's opponent , the married Democratic Congressman , Ted Strickland , is a homosexual ( via Mona ) .
Is n't it about time to hear some more sermons about how disgusting it is that " the Left " ( meaning a single gay activist on the Internet ) injects private sexual behavior and homosexuality into politics ? : Jonah Goldberg -- who , along with his mom , played a significant role in dragging the political dialogue in our country down to the lowest and most toxic levels of the sewer ( see above for just a couple of samplings ) -- expresses his very solemn concern over what the Foley scandal and the Craig outing might portend for our political arena .
He calls such tactics " wicked " and compares them to McCarthyism .
Just ponder that for a second -- Jonah Goldberg , spawn of the Clinton sex scandals , who regularly mused in public about the lowest rumors and innuendos about the Clintons ' private lives , lecturing everyone on the dangers of exposing and using the private lives of politicians against them .
The word " hypocrisy " is nowhere near sufficient to describe their reaction to the Craig outing .
It is far beyond that .
While so far Sony 's PS3 launch seems to have gone off relatively error - free ( we 're talking hardware here , crime still does n't pay , kids ) , Microsoft 's 360 was notoriously plagued by errors at launch , and it does n't look like the Wii is going to escape unscathed either .
Reports have been coming in on the official Nintendo forums that after the initial firmware / software update that is downloaded during your first attempt to use WiiConnect 24 , some users are experiencing a " 110213 " error code , which bars them from using WiiConnect 24 completely .
Some people are conjecturing that the update is frying a necessary component to connect to the service , possibly being caused by corrupt downloads due to the incredible demand on the update servers currently .
Whatever the cause , Nintendo phone support is apparently calling this a " fatal error , " and replacing the units for free , including pre-paid shipping labels to make the process as smooth as can be -- of course , " smooth as can be " is little solace to launch day junkies who are halfway through Zelda already and will have to start over on a fresh box .

A new Hubble Space Telescope image reveals stars just in the process of being born amid a fantastic scene of wispy space structures and intense radiation .
The stars have yet to condense into small enough packages to trigger thermonuclear fusion , which is what powers stars , but they appear to be on the verge , astronomers said today .
The setting is 210,000 light - years away in the Small Magellanic Cloud ( SMC ) , a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way .
At the center of the region is a brilliant star cluster called NGC 346 .
Arched and ragged filaments with a distinct ridge surround the cluster .
Radiation from the cluster 's hot stars eats into denser areas , creating the features .
The dark , intricately beaded edge of the ridge , seen in silhouette , contains several small dust globules that point back towards the central cluster , like windsocks caught in a gale .
Energetic outflows and radiation from hot young stars erode the dense outer portions of the star - forming region , formally known as N66 , exposing new stellar nurseries .
The diffuse fringes of the nebula prevent the energetic outflows from streaming directly away from the cluster , leaving instead a trail of filaments marking the swirling path of the outflows , astronomers said .
The NGC 346 cluster , at the center of the new picture , is resolved into at least three sub-clusters and collectively contains dozens of hot , blue , high - mass stars , more than half of the known high - mass stars in the entire SMC galaxy .
A myriad of smaller , compact clusters is also visible throughout the region .
A rich population of infant stars is scattered around the young cluster NGC 346 , reports a team led by Antonella Nota of the Space Telescope Science Institute / European Space Agency in Baltimore .
These stars are likely to have formed 3 to 5 million years ago , together with the other stars in the NGC 346 cluster .
These infant stars are particularly interesting as they have not yet contracted to the point where their interiors are hot enough to convert hydrogen to helium .
The findings will be detailed in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The Small and Large Magellanic Clouds are diffuse irregular galaxies visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere .
They are two smallish satellite galaxies that orbit our own Milky Way Galaxy and will eventually merge with it .
Allpeers is a revolutionary " BitTorrent powered " Firefox extension that makes it easy to share pictures , music , videos , and web pages with friends from within Firefox itself .
The latest addition to the extension is a completely encrypted instant messenger .
The new chat feature that AllPeers has implemented ensures full privacy , a functionality that most other instant messengers lack .
Besides this , it is of course very useful to be able to chat about the files you ’re sharing with your friends .
You can see the new chat feature , and many of the other great features in this excellent video tutorial AllPeers published earlier today .
AllPeers is not meant to replace traditional BitTorrent clients at this point .
It does n’t have a user interface to download . torrent files , and there are no bandwidth management , or other advanced configuration options available .
Matthew Gertner , Chief Technology Officer at Allpeers told TorrentFreak earlier this year that those features will probably be implemented in the 1.0 release .
Many BitTorrent users like the idea of a BitTorrent extension for Firefox , but would prefer a “ lite version ” .
When we asked Matt if they had considered releasing a lite version of AllPeers , without the social stuff , he said : “ We have n’t made a decision about this but I certainly would n’t rule it out .
In any case , we ’re planning to open source AllPeers later this year , so I assume someone could do this themselves afterwards . ”
Every now and then , you have to take a lesson or two from history .
In the case of George Bush ’s Iraq , here ’s one : No matter what the President announces in his “ new way forward ” speech on Iraq next week  including belated calls for “ sacrifice ” from the man whose answer to 9/11 was to urge Americans to surge into Disney World  it wo n’t work .
Nothing our President suggests in relation to Iraq , in fact , will have a ghost of a chance of success .
Worse than that , whatever it turns out to be , it is essentially guaranteed to make matters worse .
Repetition , after all , is most of what knowledge adds up to , and the Bush administration has been repetitively consistent in its Iraqi  and larger Middle Eastern  policies .
Whatever it touches ( or perhaps the better word would be “ smashes ” ) turns to dross .
Iraq is now dross  and Saddam Hussein was such a remarkably hard act to follow badly that this is no small accomplishment .
A striking but largely unexplored aspect of Saddam Hussein ’s execution is illustrative .
His trial was basically run out of the US embassy in Baghdad ; Saddam was held at Camp Cropper , the US prison near Baghdad International Airport .
He was delivered to the Iraqi government for hanging in a US helicopter ( as his body would be flown back to his home village in a US Helicopter ) .
Now , let ’s add a few more facts into the mix .
Among Iraqi Shiites , no individual has been viewed as more of an enemy by the Bush administration than the radical cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
American troops fought bloody battles with his Mahdi Army in 2004 , destroying significant parts of the old city of Najaf in the process .
American forces make periodic , destructive raids into the vast Baghdad slum and Sadrist stronghold of Sadr City to take out his followers and recently killed one of his top aides in a raid in Najaf .
The upcoming presidential “ surge ” into Baghdad is , reputedly , in part to be aimed at suppressing his militia , which a recent Pentagon report described as “ the main threat to stability in Iraq . ”
Nonetheless at the crucial moment in the execution what did some of the Interior Ministry guards do ?
They chanted : “ Muqtada ! Muqtada ! Muqtada ! ”
In all press reports , this has been described as a “ taunting ” of Saddam ( and assumedly of Iraqi Sunnis more generally ) .
But it could as easily be described as the purest mockery of George W. Bush and everything he ’s done in the country .
If , in such a relatively controlled setting , the Americans could n’t stop Saddam ’s execution from being “ infiltrated ” by al - Sadr ’s followers  who are also , of course , part of Prime Minister Maliki ’s government  what can they possibly do in the chaos of Baghdad ?
How can a few more thousands of US troops be expected to keep them , or Badr Brigade militiamen out of the streets , no less the police , the military , and various ministries ?
Consider the “ new way forward , ” then , just another part of the Bush administration ’s endless bubbleworld .
And check out exactly what madness to look forward to in next week ’s presidential address via Robert Dreyfuss , a shrewd reporter and the author of the indispensable Devil ’s Game : How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam .

The Surge to Nowhere
By Robert Dreyfuss
Like some neocon Wizard of Oz , in building expectations for the 2007 version of his “ Strategy for Victory ” in Iraq , President Bush is promising far more than he can deliver .
It is now nearly two months since he fired Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , installing Robert Gates in his place , and the White House revealed that a full - scale review of America ’s failed policy in Iraq was underway .
Last week , having spent months  if , in fact , the New York Times is correct that the review began late in the summer  consulting with generals , politicians , State Department and CIA bureaucrats , and Pentagon planners , Bush emerged from yet another powwow to tell waiting reporters : “ We ’ve got more consultation to do until I talk to the country about the plan . ”
As John Lennon sang in Revolution : “ We ’d all love to see the plan . ”
Unfortunately for Bush , most of the American public may have already checked out .
By and large , Americans have given up on the war in Iraq .
The November election , largely a referendum on the war , was a repudiation of the entire effort , and the vote itself was a marker along a continuing path of rapidly declining approval ratings both for President Bush personally and for his handling of the war .
It ’s entirely possible that when Bush does present us with “ the plan ” next week , few will be listening .
Until he makes it clear that he has returned from Planet Neocon by announcing concrete steps to end the war in Iraq , it ’s unlikely that American voters will tune in .
As of January 1 , every American could find at least 3,000 reasons not to believe that President Bush has suddenly found a way to put Humpty Dumpty back together again .
What ’s astonishing about the debate over Iraq is that the President  or anyone else , for that matter , including the media  is paying the slightest attention to the neoconservative strategists who got us into this mess in the first place .
Having been egregiously wrong about every single Iraqi thing for five consecutive years , by all rights the neocons ought to be consigned to some dusty basement exhibit hall in the American Museum of Natural History , where , like so many triceratops , their reassembled bones would stand mutely by to send a chill of fear through touring schoolchildren .
Indeed , the neocons are the dodos of Washington , simply too dumb to know when they are extinct .
Yet here is Tom Donnelly , an American Enterprise Institute neocon , a co-chairman of the Project for a New American Century , telling a reporter sagely that the surge is in .
“ I think the debate is really coming down to : Surge large .
Surge small .
Surge short .
Surge longer .
I think the smart money would say that the range of options is fairly narrow . ”
( Donnelly , of course , forgot : Surge out . )
His colleague , Frederick Kagan of AEI , the chief architect of the Surge Theory for Iraq , has made it clear that the only kind of surge that would work is a big , fat one .
Nearly pornographic in his fondling of the surge , Kagan , another of the neocon crew of armchair strategists and militarists , makes it clear that size does matter .
“ Of all the ‘ surge ’ options out there , short ones are the most dangerous , ” he wrote in the Washington Post last week , adding lasciviously , “ The size of the surge matters as much as the length .
The only ‘ surge ’ option that makes sense is both long and large . ”
Ooh  that is , indeed , a manly surge .
For Kagan , a man -sized surge must involve at least 30,000 more troops funneled into the killing grounds of Baghdad and al - Anbar Province for at least 18 months .
President Bush , perhaps dizzy from the oedipal frenzy created by the emergence of Daddy ’s best friend James Baker and his Iraq Study Group , seems all too willing to prove his manhood by the size of the surge .
According to a stunning front - page piece in the New York Times last Tuesday , Bush has all but dismissed the advice of his generals , including Centcom Commander John Abizaid , and George Casey , the top US general in Iraq , because they are “ more fixated on withdrawal than victory . ”
At a recent Pentagon session , according to General James T. Conway , the commandant of the US Marines , Bush told the assembled brass : “ What I want to hear from you now is how we are going to win , not how we are going to leave . ”
As a result , Abizaid and Casey are , it appears , getting the same hurry - up - and - retire treatment that swept away other generals who questioned the wisdom on Iraq transmitted from Planet Neocon .
That ’s scary , if it means that Bush  presumably on the advice of the Neocon - in - Chief , Vice President Dick Cheney  has decided to launch a major push , Kagan - style , for victory in Iraq .
Not that such an escalation has a chance of working , but there ’s no question that , in addition to bankrupting the United States , breaking the army and the Marines , and unleashing all - out political warfare at home , it would kill perhaps tens of thousands more Iraqis .
Personally , I ’m not convinced that Bush could get away with it politically .
Not only is the public dead - set against escalating the war , but there are hints that Congress might not stand for it , and the leadership of the US Armed Forces is opposed .
Over the past few days , a swarm of Republican senators has come out against the surge , including at least three Republican senators up for reelection in 2008 in states that make them vulnerable : Gordon Smith of Oregon , whose remarkable speech calling the war “ criminal ” went far beyond the normal bland rhetoric of discourse in the US capital , along with John Sununu of New Hampshire and Norm Coleman of Minnesota .
In addition , Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , less vulnerable but still facing voters in 2008 , has questioned the surge idea .
And a host of Republican moderates  Chuck Hagel ( NE ) , Dick Lugar ( IN ) , Susan Collins ( ME )  have lambasted it .
( Hagel told Robert Novak : “ It ’s Alice in Wonderland .
I ’m absolutely opposed to the idea of sending any more troops to Iraq .
It is folly . ” )
Even Sam Brownback , one of the Senate godfathers of the neocon - backed Iraqi National Congress , has expressed skepticism , saying : “ We ca n’t impose a military solution . ”
According to Novak , only 12 of the 49 Republican senators are now willing to back Sen.
John McCain ’s blood - curdling cries for sending in more troops .
Meanwhile , says Novak , the Democrats would not only criticize the idea of a surge but , led by Senator Joe Biden , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , might use their crucial power over the purse .
“ Biden , ” writes Novak , “ will lead the rest of the Democrats not only to oppose a surge but to block it . ”
Reports the Financial Times of London : “ Democrats have hinted that they could use their control over the budget process to make life difficult for the Bush administration if it chooses to step up the military presence in Iraq . ”
A Kagan - style surge would require a vast new commitment of funds , and with their ability to scrutinize , put conditions on , and even strike out entire line items in the military budget and the Pentagon ’s supplemental requests , the Democrats could find ways to stall or halt the “ surge , ” if not the war itself .
Indeed , if President Bush opts to Kaganize the war , he will throw down the gauntlet to the Democrats .
Unwilling until now to say that they would even consider blocking appropriations for the Iraq War , the Democrats would have little choice but to up the ante if Bush flouts the electoral mandate in such a full - frontal manner .
By escalating the war in the face of near - universal opposition from the public , the military , and the political class , the President would force the Democrats to escalate their own  until now fairly mild - mannered  opposition to the war .
However , it ’s possible  just possible  that what the President is planning to announce will be something a bit more Machiavellian than the straightforwardly manly thrust Kagan wants .
Perhaps , just perhaps , he will order an increase of something like 20,000 American troops , but put a tight time limit on this surge  say , four months .
Perhaps he will announce that he is giving Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki that much time to square the circle in Iraq : crack down on militias and death squads , purge the army and police , develop a plan to fight the Sunni insurgency , find a formula to deal with the Kurds and the explosive , oil - rich city of Kirkuk which they claim as their own , un - de - Ba’athify Iraq , and create a workable formula for sharing the fracturing country ’s oil wealth .
By surging those 20,000 troops into a hopeless military nowhere - land , Bush will say that he is giving Maliki room to accomplish all that  knowing full well that none of it can , in fact , be accomplished by the weak , sectarian , Shi’ite - run regime inside Baghdad ’s fortified Green Zone .
So , sometime in the late spring , the United States could begin to un-surge its troops and start the sort of orderly , phased withdrawal that Jim Baker and the Carl Levin Democrats have called for .
Levin suggested as much as 2006 ended .
“ A surge which is not part of an overall program of troop reduction that begins in the next four to six months would be a mistake , ” said Levin , who will chair the Armed Services Committee .
“ Even if the President is going to propose to temporarily add troops , he should make that conditional on the Iraqis reaching a political settlement that effectively ends the sectarian violence . ”
That may be too much to ask for a Christian - crusader President , still lodged inside a bubble universe and determined to crush all evil - doers .
And it may be too clever by half for an administration that has been as utterly inept as this one .
At the same time , it may also be too much to expect that the Democrats will really go to the mat to fight Bush if , Kagan - style , he orders a surge that is “ long and large . ”
Maybe they will merely posture and fulminate and threaten to well , hold hearings .
If so , it will be the Iraqis who end the war .
It will be the Iraqis who eventually kill enough Americans to break the US political will , and it will be the Iraqis who sweep away the ruins of the Maliki government to replace it with an anti-American , anti-US - occupation government in Iraq .
That is basically how the war in Vietnam ended , and it was n’t pretty .

The Samaritan Pentateuch
I started doing a lot of research into the Samaritans when working on a proposal to encode their writing system into Unicode .
Yes , it turns out they 're still around , still doing their thing ( and more power to them ) .
They preserve a unique perspective on the ancient underpinnings of Judaism ( and therefore also Christianity and Islam , which both have roots in Judaism ) .
There is plenty to be said about the Samaritans in general , but for this article I plan to focus on their Torah .
The Samaritan 's Holy Writ consists only of the Pentateuch ( the Five Books of Moses , the Torah ) , though they do seem to have some tradition of significance ( but not sanctity ) to the book of Joshua ( or something very much like it ) .
The Samaritans and the Jews parted ways all the way back in Biblical times , so most of our Prophets and Writings are not part of their history .
Yet both have the Torah , both started out from the same place .
But the Torahs they have are not exactly the same .
Plenty has been written about the differences among various versions of the Hebrew Scriptures , but of course the most striking thing about the differences is how few there are .
A cantillation here , a vowel there , occasionally an actual consonantal difference , which is almost always just a matter of full vs. defective spelling , but for the most part the various sources for the Hebrew Scriptures are in agreement .
This is because the Hebrew Scriptures were codified by the Jewish community ( the Masoretes ) and declared fixed and correct , and since then have been preserved with painstaking care and nitpicking detail by each successive generation of scribes .
The schism with the Samaritans predates this canonization , though , and the Samaritans themselves never went through one like it , so their version of the Torah is more significantly different from the Masoretic text , and moreover , there are many , many more versions of their text ( I read somewhere that estimates run over 6,000 ) , with much more variation among them than is seen among the ancient Jewish sources .
And of course , there are and were philosophical differences between the Jews and the Samaritans , which are sometimes reflected in their respective versions of the text .
I knew about some of this even before I started my research .
I knew they had a version that differed from the Masoretic version , anyway .
And I always wanted to see what the differences were , exactly .
In the course of my research , I obtained a copy of a book showing just that : a comparative text of the Torah , with the Masoretic version on one side and the Samaritan version ( or rather , one of the Samaritan versions ) on the other side , with the differences highlighted .
It was published in the sixties by Abraham and Ratson Tsedaka ( father and uncle to my own contact in the Samaritan community , Benyamim Tsedaka ) , and is thus not widely available .
And yet it was so interesting !
Every page had a difference that made me think .
It was too interesting to be so hard to find ; I decided to make my own version of it .
The story of the creation of my Comparing Pentateuch is interesting and geeky in its own way , but I do n't plan to tell it here .
Get your own copy and tell me what you think !
Or at least look at the preview .
There are many differences between the two versions , and many of them are as trivial as the ones between Masoretic versions : full vs. defective spellings , slightly different spellings , etc .
But there are many differences that are more significant .
Some of these can be categorized and generalized a little :
Consistency :
This is probably the main distinguishing feature of the Samaritan version , and I suspect some of the other categories I discuss will be included in it .
The Samaritan version shows much greater internal consistency than the Masoretic version .
And by this I mean not that the plot hangs together better , but that when , for example , an event happens in the text which is then later recounted by someone also in the text , the re-telling and the event are often verbatim copies .
So , for example , one of the most consistent and noticeable differences in the Book of Exodus has to do with the warnings given to Pharoah .
In the Masoretic text , we sometimes read “ God said to Moses , ‘ Say unto Pharoah thus and such ....’ ” in preparation for a plague , and then the text skips ahead to the actual performance of the plague without recounting that Moses did , indeed , relay the message .
Or conversely , we read of Moses delivering a warning to Pharoah about an upcoming plague without ever reading that he was commanded to do so by God .
The Samaritan text is more consistent : when God tells Moses to relay a message , we then read that Moses relayed the message — in the same words — and then initiated the plague .
When Moses warns Pharoah , we read beforehand that God had told him to give that very warning .
When the Israelites say to Moses in Exodus 14:12 , “ Did n't we say to you in Egypt , ‘ Leave us alone ; let us serve the Egyptians ’ ? ” in the Samaritan version they did , indeed , say those exact words while still in Egypt , in Exodus chapter 6 .
The Masoretic version has them saying other things in a similar vein in Egypt , but never exactly that .
And presumably if the Bible is considered infallible , how could it say that they said it if they did n't ?
The Samaritan Torah is therefore longer , in terms of letter or word count , than the Masoretic version .
Whenever a story is retold , whenever something is referred to in the past ( e.g. , the events of the desert being recounted in the book of Deuternomy ) , the Samaritan version consistently has the event and the retelling in harmony .
Grammar :
This is a different kind of consistency .
Samaritan Hebrew grammar is not quite the same as Masoretic Hebrew grammar , and their pronunciation and vocalization are totally different ( though that 's probably best saved for another article ) .
The Samaritan version is often grammatically neater ( and stylistically somewhat later in the development of the language ) than the Masoretic version .
Similarly , where the Masoretic version has verbs or adjectives in the wrong gender in many places , the Samaritan version has appropriate gender agreement .
There are also consistent differences related to the grammatical differences between Samaritan Hebrew and Masoretic Hebrew .
So some verbs are conjugated into different forms in the two versions ( e.g. וישתחו , “ and he bowed ” is written וישתחוי in the Samaritan version ; instead of צו it has צוי , and a few others .
At least in the version I was working from ; others have וישתחוה ) .
There are some grammar differences in the pronouns , some of which affect the spellings of other words .
For example , in Samaritan pronunciation , the third - person plural masculine pronoun הם is pronounced imma , and so the Masoretic spelling המה would be redundant , and is not found in the Samaritan version .
And the dreadfully confusing spelling of the feminine pronoun היא in the Masoretic text , ( sometimes ) spelling it identically with the masculine pronoun הוא , is not also found in the Samaritan text ( thus providing another example of the consistency of the Samaritan text ) .
The second - person feminine singular past tense conjugation and pronoun in the Samaritan pronunciation preserve the old Hebrew - i ending ( found in a few places even in Masoretic texts ) , and so are sometimes spelled with a final י .
This can occasionally be confusing , since it might look at first glance like a first - person singular verb !
Naming Details :
There are a few somewhat consistently different names used between the two versions .
Probably the most striking is the spelling of one of the tribes of Israel , which is Binyamin בנימין in the Masoretic version and Binyamim בנימים in the Samaritan version , both consistently throughout ( and that makes sense : for “ the son of one 's old age ” , as he is called in Genesis 44:20 , calling him בן ימים is perfectly sensible : the son of [ my many ] days ) .
Another one is the spelling of הר גריזים , which is two words in the Masoretic version , but one word , הרגריזים , in at least some Samaritan versions .
I 'm not sure what the significance of this is .
Obviously Mt. Gerizim is of great significance to Samaritans ( see below ) , but I do n't understand why spelling it as one word somehow shows more respect or whatever .
Maybe that is n't even relevant .
The city of “ Luz ” לוז mentioned in Genesis 28:19 ( of the Masoretic version ) is consistently “ Luzah ” לוזה in the Samaritan version , and indeed that is what they call their town on the slopes of Mt. Gerizim ( which of course is where the events of Genesis 28 took place according to their tradition ) even today .
Philosophical Differences :
Some of the distinctions seem to be motivated by ( or reflect ) the actual philosophical differences between Judaism and Samaritanism .
Some of these are glaringly obvious , like the inclusion of a passage in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments restating the command to build of an altar on Mt. Gerizim , and stating plainly that Mt. Gerizim is the site at which all future sacrifices are to be offered .
Since the location of God 's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism , it makes sense that this passage should be in one version and not the other .
Along the same lines , wherever the Masoretic text speaks of “ the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name ” ( Deut. 12:11 ) , the Samaritan text has it in the past tense : “ the place the LORD your God has chosen .... ”
Some of the philosophical differences are a little less central .
For example , the Samaritan version shows much less anthropomorphism than the Masoretic version .
Exodus 15:3 in the Masoretic version reads “ The LORD is a warrior , ” or more literally the Hebrew says “ the LORD is a man of war , ” whereas the Samaritan version does not call God a “ man , ” but says that God is “ a hero of war ” or “ mighty in war . ”
Perhaps this is also the reason behind the difference of reading in Genesis 48:16 , which reads in the Masoretic version המלאך הגאל אתי ( “ the angel who redeemed me ” ) , while the Samaritan version has המלך instead ( “ the king who redeemed me ” ) , thus putting the focus on God and not an angel .
When describing the curtains of the Tabernacle , saying they are joined “ one to another , ” the Masoretic version a rather anthropomorphic idiom for “ each other , ” saying literally “ a woman to her sister ” ( this sounds less weird in the masculine , like in “ between a man and his brother , ” but the curtains are grammatically feminine ) .
The Samaritan version here , too , does n't show the anthropomorphism , but simply says they are joined “ one to one . ”
Sometimes it just seems to be a matter of clarity .
In Exodus 21 , where the Masoretic version talks about an ox goring someone the Samaritan version is more inclusive , specifically speaking “ an ox or any animal striking ” someone .
Non-Consonantal Differences :
This really is not a category parallel to the others listed above , but a supercategory containing instances of all of them and others besides — but which I 'm not going to deal with in much detail .
Naturally , the distinctions shown in my comparing text are only those which are present in the consonantal spelling .
And there 's a lot more to understanding a text than its consonants , particularly in Hebrew .
The Masoretic and Samaritan dialects of Hebrew are not exactly corresponding in the first place , and there are plenty of places where the texts use different grammatical forms from each other .
Moreover , there are many words in the Pentateuch whose exact meaning and even whose basic root is not completely obvious , so the interpretation depends greatly on the translation tradition .
This leads off into a big discussion on Biblical translation ; a discussion I 'm not going to have right now .
Suffice to say , the Samaritan tradition makes for many significant differences in meaning that are not necessarily reflected in the consonantal text .
I am not really qualified to discuss these in detail ; maybe I 'll write up a few that I happen to know about .
I know that there is a comparative English translation in the works , showing the difference between traditional Masoretic / Septuagint translation and Samaritan tradition .
I do n't yet know when this will be available .
Please note that I have tried to avoid phrasing things in terms of one version or another “ adding ” or “ omitting ” things .
I am not trying to imply that either version is more authentic than the other .
I also believe that this sort of comparison is interesting and worthwhile no matter what one believes ( or what is true ) about the origins of the Bible .
There is no denying that the Bible is probably the most influential text in Western culture , no matter its origin .
And it has to be interesting to see how different branches of culture saw fit to preserve it , and the differences that were introduced by the different ways of preserving it .
Here at Fort Lewis , at least two of the base ’s Stryker brigades played a key role in developing the new uniform , advising engineers at the Army ’s Soldier Systems Center in Natick , Mass .
The Third Brigade , Second Infantry wore a prototype during its initial deployment to Iraq in 2003 .
Sergeant Fisher stood in a parking lot outside the Foxhole , a military surplus store , and provided an impromptu tour of his new uniform .
The most obvious change is its digital - pixel camouflage , a blur of muted tones that many soldiers say seems best suited to desert combat .
The old uniform , by contrast , came in bold black , brown , tan and green blotches .
In Iraq , many soldiers have worn the older Desert Combat Uniform , a variation on the standard one , but with desert hues .
But the new uniform , which will replace both the old one and its desert counterpart , has colors and a camouflage pattern that its designers say is effective in desert , “ woodland ” and urban combat .
Having just one combat uniform saves the Army money .
New expansion pleats allow more freedom in the shoulders .
The new collar , which can be worn up or down , does not chafe the neck .
Buttons are gone .
The material is meant to be tougher , though some soldiers dispute that claim .
An Army News Service article from June 2004 noted that the new uniform , then being tested , would probably cost about $ 88 , some $ 30 more than the old one .
However , the article said , “ soldiers will eventually reap gains in money and time by not having to take uniforms to the cleaners or shine boots . ”
Though there was no official requirement to have the old uniforms professionally cleaned and pressed , Army culture outside of combat situations has often been to do so .
Now it is not only unnecessary , but also impractical .
“ The plastic zipper and the Velcro , if we press it , that ’s going to melt it , ” said Moon Kim , who has been in the dry cleaning business near Fort Lewis since 1984 .
Web Design : 15 Important Research Findings You Should Know
A small selection of web design , usability , and accessibility related results of research , most of them derived from Human Factors International ( newsletter ) .
Some of them are relatively known , while others may enrich our professional self - understanding :
Design is a key determinant to building online trust with consumers .
For motivated users of an information site , bad design ( busy layout , small print , too much text ) hurts more than good design helps .
— Sillence , Briggs , et al. ( 2004 ) .
Also see Stanford University ’s Guidelines for Web Credibility .
Layout on a web page ( whitespace and advanced layout of headers , indentation , and figures ) may not measurably influence performance , but it does influence satisfaction .
— Chaperro , Shaikh , and Baker ( 2005 ) .
Experience matters :
Blue links are easier to click than black ones , even though black ones have higher visual contrast and are easier to see .
— Van Schaik and Ling ( 2003 ) .
It ’s important to consider the users when you have a choice of icons , links , or both .
Initial performance is best with the link alone .
Frequent users can use either equally effectively .
Icons are not faster , relative to text links alone .
— Wiedenbeck ( 1999 ) .
Rules of thumb for icons :
Make them as large as feasible , place frequently used icons in a persistent task bar , and arrange them either in a square ( first choice ) or in a horizontal layout .
— Grobelny , Karwowski , and Drury ( 2005 ) .
The acceptance and impact of animation is enhanced when users are warned to expect it and allowed to start it when they want .
— Weiss , Knowlton , and Morrison ( 2002 ) .
Use of whitespace between paragraphs and in the left and right margins increases comprehension by almost 20 % .
— Lin ( 2004 ) .
A format of 95 characters per line is read significantly faster than shorter line lengths ; however , there are no significant differences in comprehension , preference , or overall satisfaction , regardless of line length .
— Shaikh ( 2005 ) .
Applications vs. websites :
In general , visual layout guidelines for GUIs also apply to the web , but there are differences to be aware of .
For example , dense pages with lots of links take longer to scan for both GUI and web ; however , alignment may not be as critical for web pages as previously thought .
— Parush , Shwarts , et al. ( 2005 ) .
Narrative presentation enhances comprehension and memory .
Narrative advertisements produce more positive attitude about the brand and a higher incidence of intent to purchase .
— Escalas ( 2004 ) .
On sites with clear labels and prominent navigation options , users tend to browse rather than search .
Searching is no faster than browsing in this context .
— Katz and Byrne ( 2003 ) .
Users will wait longer for better content .
Users will wait between 8 - 10 seconds for information on the web , depending on the quality of the information .
— Ryan and Valverde ( 2003 ) .
Consumer purchase behavior is driven by perceived security , privacy , quality of content and design , in that order .
— Ranganathan and Ganapathy ( 2002 ) .
In 2001 , Bernard found that prior user experience with websites dictated where they expected common web page elements to appear on a page .
The same still holds true today : Users have clear expectations about where to find the things they want ( search and back - to - home links ) as well as the things they want to avoid ( advertising ) .
— Shaihk and Lenz ( 2006 ) .
When assessing web accessibility under four conditions ( expert review , screenreader using JAWS , automated testing via “ Bobby , ” and remote testing by blind users ) those using screenreaders find the most issues , while automated testing finds the least number of accessibility issues .
— Mankoff , Fait , and Tran ( 2005 ) .

The US has very strict approach to DRM issues
The report frequently serves as a blueprint for the US Trade Representative 's Section 301 Report , a government - mandated annual report that carries the threat of trade barriers for countries that fail to meet the US standard of IP protection .
The IIPA submission generated considerable media attention , with the international media focusing on the state of IP protection in Russia and China , while national media in Canada , Thailand , and Taiwan broadcast dire warnings about the consequences of falling on the wrong side of US lobby groups .
While the UK was spared inclusion on this year 's list , what is most noteworthy about the IIPA effort is that dozens of countries - indeed most of the major global economies in the developed and developing world - are singled out for criticism .
The IIPA recommendations are designed to highlight the inadequacies of IP protection around the world , yet the lobby group ultimately shines the spotlight on how US copyright policy has become out - of - touch and isolated from much of the rest of the globe .
The IIPA criticisms fall into three broad categories .
First , the lobby group is very critical of any country that does not follow the US model for implementing the World Intellectual Property Organisation 's Internet Treaties .
Those treaties , which create legal protection for technological protection measures , have generated enormous controversy with many experts expressing concern about their impact on consumer rights , privacy , free speech , and security research .
Double standards ?
Countries singled out for criticism should not be deceived into thinking that their laws are failing to meet an international standard .
Michael Geist
Given the US experience , it is unsurprising that many countries have experimented with alternate implementations .
This experimentation invariably leads to heavy criticism from the IIPA as countries such as Canada , New Zealand , Japan , Switzerland , Hong Kong , South Korea , Israel , Mexico , and India are all taken to task for their implementation ( or proposed implementation ) of anti-circumvention legislation .
Further , countries that have not signed or ratified the WIPO Internet treaties ( which still includes the majority of the world ) , face the wrath of the US lobby group for failing to do so .
Second , in a classic case of " do what I say , not what I do " , many countries are criticised for copyright laws that bear a striking similarity to US law .
For example , Israel is criticised for considering a fair use provision that mirrors the US approach .
The IIPA is unhappy with the attempt to follow the US model , warning that the Israeli public might view it as a " free ticket to copy . "
Similarly , the time shifting provisions in New Zealand 's current copyright reform bill ( which would permit video recording of television shows ) are criticised despite the fact that US law has granted even more liberal copying rights for decades .
The most disturbing illustration of this double standard is the IIPA 's criticism of compulsory copyright licensing requirements .
Countries around the world , particularly those in the developing world ( including Indonesia , the Philippines , Lebanon , Kuwait , Nigeria , and Vietnam ) all face demands to eliminate compulsory licensing schemes in the publishing and broadcasting fields .
Moreover , the report even criticises those countries that have merely raised the possibility of new compulsory licensing systems , such as Sweden , where politicians have mused about an Internet file sharing license .
Long list
Left unsaid by the IIPA , is the fact that the US is home to numerous compulsory licenses .
These include statutory licenses for transmissions by cable systems , satellite transmissions , compulsory licenses for making and distributing phonorecords as well as the use of certain works with non-commercial broadcasting .
Some countries are criticised for offering exceptions to universities
Third , the IIPA recommendations criticise dozens of efforts to support national education , privacy , and cultural initiatives .
For example , Canada , Brazil , and South Korea are criticised for copyright exceptions granted to students and education institutions .
Italy and Mexico are criticised for failing to establish an easy method for Internet service providers to remove allegedly infringing content ( without court oversight ) , while Greece is viewed as being offside for protecting the privacy of ISP subscribers .
Greece is also taken to task for levying a surcharge at movie theatres that is used to support Greek films .
Moreover , countries that have preserved their public domain by maintaining their term of copyright protection at the international treaty standard of life of the author plus an additional fifty years are criticised for not matching the US extension to life plus 70 years .
There are literally hundreds of similar examples , as countries from Europe , Asia , Africa , North and South America are criticised for not adopting the DMCA , not extending the term of copyright , not throwing enough people in jail , or creating too many exceptions to support education and other societal goals .
In fact , the majority of the world 's population finds itself on the list , with 23 of the world 's 30 most populous countries targeted for criticism ( the exceptions are the UK , Germany , Ethiopia , Iran , France , Congo , and Myanmar ) .
Countries singled out for criticism should not be deceived into thinking that their laws are failing to meet an international standard , no matter what US lobby groups say .
Rather , those countries should know that their approach - and the criticism that it inevitably brings from the US - places them in very good company .
Michael Geist holds the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E- commerce Law at the University of Ottawa , Faculty of Law .
He knows that some of the families will not want to see him , and he understands .
Grief works in different ways , he says .
For others , however , it will be an opportunity to talk , to learn something , he hopes , of the inexplicable nature of their children 's deaths .
So , when he has a moment , when he is not driving round the battlefield that is eastern Baghdad , Vail examines the map and plans his flights and his car hire .
And he wonders at the reception he will receive - a messenger of death , bringing the war back from Iraq to the home front .
For when Vail and his soldiers return , it will be in the knowledge that the United States that they are going home to is not the one that they left .
That in their year - long absence a seismic shift has occurred in support for the war in Iraq .
And that the deaths that Colonel Vail must carry back with him to grieving families - deaths that once seemed to Americans to be a necessary cost - now seem to the majority a dreadful and pointless waste .
It will also be in the knowledge that the battle that they began with such confidence barely four months ago , to secure and then rebuild some of the most dangerous areas of the Iraqi capital , like the campaigns before , has failed .
With that failure the entire future of Iraq and the US and British - led occupation has been brought to a tipping point of enormous consequence not simply for Iraq and the region , but for the Bush and Blair administrations .
For despite a massive campaign involving the troops of Vail 's unit and others , backed by thousands of Iraqi troops , the US military leadership in Baghdad has been forced to admit that attacks during the holy month of Ramadan have increased by 22 per cent , and that the US death toll for October , standing at 74 at the weekend , will be one of the deadliest for US troops since the invasion in 2003 .
More worrying still is the assessment that both Sunni and Shia nationalist resistance movements have reached the level of being ' coordinated / consolidated ' - able to reply to multinational offensives with their own ' push capability ' .
This was admitted explicitly last week by the top US spokesman in Baghdad , General William Caldwell .
' We 're finding insurgent elements , the extremists , are pushing back hard .
They 're trying to get back into those areas where Iraqi and US forces have targeted them , ' he said .
' We 're constantly going back in to do clearing operations . '
In a few short weeks , the US and British policy over Iraq has dramatically unravelled .
In the US that policy has been summed up in the phrase ' stay the course ' , the message designed months ago by Republican strategist Karl Rove , as a stick with which to beat the Democrats in the critical midterm elections on 7 November .
It was a simple formula intended to suggest that it was President Bush , and not those calling for a rethinking of the war , who was the patriot .
Now that message appears to be backfiring as many Republican candidates up for re-election on 7 November have sought to distance themselves from Bush 's handling of the war .
It is an unravelling driven by the increasingly dire circumstances on the ground , which have seen a sharp escalation of the blood - letting as the government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki weakens in the face of the challenge of the Shia militias .
It has been driven , too , by the criticisms voiced by senior military figures - both American and British - of the conduct of the war , and it has been accelerated by the most potent catalyst of all , the collapse in popular support for the handling of events in Iraq , most notably in the US .
Recent polls have suggested that disapproval of Bush 's handling of the war in Iraq is now hovering around 63 - 64 per cent .
The collapsing poll figures mean that suddenly it is not only the Democrats who are challenging the Bush administration 's conduct of the war but Republican incumbents themselves , fearful that the White House 's longstanding denial of the reality of the situation in Iraq will toss them out of power .
Republican strategists believe that in the House of Representatives 12 seats inevitably are doomed , with the Democrats needing only 15 seats to take the House .
Privately , however , the same strategists concede that a loss of 18 - 25 seats is more likely .
In the Senate , too , controlled by the Republicans for all but one of the last 12 years , the Republican hold is under threat .
The result has been a political fall - out that many now expect will pressure Bush - and by extension the UK - into yet another change of tactics over the conduct of the war .
The question remaining is what policy could now deliver any more success ?
That expectation of change has been driven by ever more visible criticism in the US media over a policy that many now believe is political poison .
It has not been helped by the comments of President Bush himself .
He responded to an article by columnist Thomas Friedman which compared the present spike in violence in Iraq to the Tet offensive in the Vietnam War by appearing to accept the comparison .
' I do n't believe that we can continue based on an open - ended , unconditional presence , ' Senator Olympia Snowe , a centrist Maine Republican , told the Washington Post last week .
' I do n't think there 's any question about that , there will be a change . '
Snowe is not alone .
Senator John Warner , the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , has also weighed into the fray after returning from a fact - finding mission to Iraq and stating , in sharp contradiction to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit last month , that the country was adrift and all options should be examined .
Most damning of all , however , were the comments of Richard Haass , a former Bush administration foreign policy official , who told reporters yesterday that the situation is reaching a ' tipping point ' both in Iraq and in US politics .
' More of essentially the same is going to be a policy that very few people are going to be able to support , ' said Haass , now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations .
He added that the administration 's current strategy - of a stable , democratic Iraq , within a politically feasible time frame - ' has virtually no chance of succeeding ' .
This sense of a growing crisis has only been deepened by comments from the Iraq Study Group , chaired by the Bush family friend and former Secretary of State James Baker , which have made it abundantly clear that he does not believe that the present Iraq policy is working .
In a second uncomfortable comparison with Vietnam and the Tet offensive , some are now beginning to compare Baker 's bilateral group with the ' three wise men ' who advocated the change of US military policy in that war .
Baker has let it be known to Bush that he believes that what is required is a timetable for withdrawal .
But that comes with its own problems .
' Jim 's problem is that he wants a way to make clear to Maliki that we 're leaving , but without signalling to the Shia and the Sunni that , if they bide their time , they can battle it out for Iraq , ' one long - time national security expert told Friday 's New York Times .
' How do you do that ?
Got me .'
If there is an answer to that question , then Deborah Pryce would like to know - and in a hurry .
A popular Ohio congresswoman , a moderate Republican , Pryce 's only political error may turn out to have been in getting too close to her party 's leadership during the execution of a highly unpopular and expensive foreign war .
In November , she will probably leave office as decisively as she arrived in the Republican midterm sweep in 1994 .
Pryce would like to talk about local issues like the new control tower at Columbus airport , but the country is in alarm over the war in Iraq , the faltering economy and political sleaze in Washington .
For Pryce , the fourth - ranking Republican in Congress who has not faced a serious challenge since she was elected in 1994 , her seat , in the 15th district , is a microcosm of the national picture .
For , as a touchstone state , what is true for Ohio is true nationally .
In Ohio all the talk is of war and broken government .
Incumbent Republicans in all races - House , Senate and governorship - are behind by double digits .
In the Senate campaign alone , the Republican national committee has cut campaign spending on its amiable candidate , Mike DeWine , and reallocated campaign money to other states such as Tennessee where victory is still a possibility .
While other issues come and go on the front pages , war is the constant , the backdrop .
Once candidates such as Pryce could count on the ' soccer mums ' renamed ' security mums ' for the post - 9/11 world .
Once these women accepted the administration 's explanation for war .
Not any more .
' People are upset about our kids being killed in Iraq in a war that everyone now knows was started on false pretences , ' said housewife Vicky Harman .
' Every day there 's more information about the cover-ups , the efforts to misguide the public and - worst of all - their absolute lack of remorse . '
With the realities of Iraq as a ' new Vietnam ' setting in , voters in the Midwest last week expressed a sense of political powerlessness .
Julie Smith wanted to see ' the boys come home from Iraq ' but did n't expect them to ' cause I know Bush is gonna do what he likes ' .
If there is a hope of wide - ranging change in large quarters of the Republican Party and in Washington 's political circles at the week 's end it was not being articulated by the two men most closely associated with the war , Bush himself , and his closest lieutenant , the combative Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , whom many believe should be sacrificed for the errors of the war so far .
Ahead of a meeting with Vice - President Dick Cheney and the top American commanders in Iraq - George Casey and John Abizaid - Bush and Rumsfeld were still insisting that the goals remain unaltered : creating a country that can govern and defend itself ' that will be an ally in the war against these extremists ' .
By yesterday Bush was even more emphatic in his weekly radio address , insisting that , while the increase in violence was disappointing , ' our goal in Iraq is clear and unchanging : our goal is victory .
What is changing are the tactics we use to achieve that goal . '
If anyone was left in any doubt , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also played down expectations of a major change when she briefed reporters while en route to Moscow .
' I would not read into this somehow that there is a full - scale push for a major re-evaluation ( of Iraq strategy ) , ' she said .
Perceptive analysts have noted , however , that while Bush has remained apparently robust , he has dropped his insistence that the end product of his policy is the creation of a ' flourishing democracy ' at the heart of the Middle East to focus instead on the much more limited idea of a ' stable ' Iraq .
Now , the message from the White House and Pentagon is that , while tactics on the ground may be up for grabs , the overall strategy is not .
None of which may be enough to save a Republican meltdown .
This considerable problem is being confronted by not only the disillusioned US electorate , but by Bush 's allies as well .
For it is not only in America that the implications of the unravelling of Bush 's Iraq policy are being felt .
For if the situation is difficult for Bush , it is infinitely more complicated for his supposed ally , Tony Blair .
Already wrongfooted by the outburst from the Chief of the General Staff , General Sir Richard Dannatt , Downing Street has spent the week struggling to stay on the right side of a constantly changing argument in Washington .
Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett , who has spoken to Condoleezza Rice within the last few days , will indicate today that tactics were bound to change in the run-up to the US polls , but she insists that she does not detect ' that much of a change of pace or mood ' in the Washington administration on Iraq .
However , she admits there are ongoing discussions about the way forward : ' I think it is just people recognising how things are going and there are bound to be some areas where it would be easier if we were not there . '
What was most striking , she said , was that 'in some areas we were part of the problem , in other areas we were not . '
The difficulty for the British government is that American policy on Iraq is now likely to be determined by the outcome of the November elections : if Bush does badly , an early exit becomes more likely , but if he does unexpectedly well there could even be a push to send more troops to Iraq to quell the insurgency .
As the junior partner in the coalition , Britain will inevitably be swept along by whatever new American policy emerges .
But that policy remains unclear , leaving British politicians essentially playing for time until they establish what Bush is likely to do .
And Bush is not the only one with elections on his mind .
If the midterm contest goes badly for the Republican Party , Labour minds will inevitably turn to the elections due here in May for local councils and the Scottish and Welsh assemblies .
In Scotland particularly , Iraq is a hot political potato and Labour 's two main opponents north of the border , the Liberal Democrats and the SNP , are both highly critical of the war .
All of which , however , is academic for those in the killing fields of Iraq .
Ending the Iraq nightmare - the key points
A Partition
What it means
One of the options being looked at by James Baker and his team - asked by Bush to study the exit alternatives .
Lines would be drawn across a map of Iraq dividing it into three autonomous regions - Kurdish in the north , Sunni in the middle and Shia in the south .
Consequences
Dividing Iraq along sectarian lines would exacerbate sectarian violence and lead to ethnic cleansing .
It would also unequally split up Iraq 's oil resources - and leave the Sunnis with little arable land - which would give opposing sides an economic reason to fight each other .
Partition would be far from straightforward in heavily mixed communities , holy cities would be contested and Baghdad would probably explode .
Support
Outside powers such as Iran would find it easy to dominate the new entities .
The militias are already creating a partition and more and more people are becoming displaced .
B Regional help
What it means
Sub - contracting problem - asking Iran , Syria and Saudi Arabia to step in .
Consequences
Risks drawing the regional players into a wider conflict that could engulf the Arab world .
It could mean Bush facing demands from countries he regards as enemies in exchange for help .
It 's also debatable whether any of those countries would have influence to curb sectarian killings .
Support
It looks good on paper , Baker is very keen , but not popular in Washington .
White House press secretary Tony Snow said it unlikely Bush administration would consider ending its ban on talks with Iran and Syria .
' We'd be very happy for them not to foment terror , ' Snow said .
' But it certainly does n't change our diplomatic stance towards either . '
C Immediate withdrawal
What it means
The cut - and - run option where the US - led coalition troops simply pull out overnight .
Consequences
Could worsen the chaos and enfeeble the struggling Iraq government and military .
Danger of full - scale civil war and carnage , destabilising the region and leaving a failed state open to use by al - Qaeda .
But it would stop UK and US soldiers dying .
Support
Bush will never be persuaded it is the right thing to do .
The aim has always been to leave an Iraq that could govern itself .
It would mean utter humiliation for his war on terror .
The US would forever be blamed for the mess it left behind and could even be forced to intervene again in the future .
Bush has been listening to Henry Kissenger who has told him cut and run is not an option and ' victory is the only meaningful exit strategy ' .
D Phased withdrawal
What it means
' We notify the Iraqis that we 're going to be drawing down a reasonable but careful percentage of our troops over a reasonable interval of months - for example 5 per cent every three months , ' said Richard L Armitage , former presidential adviser .
US General George W Casey has suggested Iraqi security forces would be ready to take over in 12 - 18 months .
Views of whether it takes weeks or years vary but the pressure is on Bush - and Tony Blair - to produce a timetable .
Consequences
If the weak Iraqi government makes no progress in disarming the militias and death squads then the same results as immediate withdrawal .
Insurgents would perceive it as a victory and move into the vacuum .
Support
Democrats winning control of one of the Houses of Congress would increase pressure for an end date to be set .
Favoured by Britain and the subject of the row earlier this month engulfing General Sir Richard Dannatt 's comments when he called for a swift pull - out of UK troops .
Blair has also stressed a desire to leave but only when ' the job is done . '
International press : what they are saying around the world
Los Angeles Times
Tim Rutten , yesterday
The Bush administration 's problems in Iraq have nothing to do with public relations and everything to do with the facts .
American voters - a substantial majority of whom now recognise the war in Iraq as a mistake - will make their own decisions in November , but the real lesson concerning the American failure in south east Asia that the news media ought to hold in mind over and against all criticism - no matter how adroitly it 's spun - can be summed up in one word : quagmire .
New York Sun
Daniel Freedman
Iraq is not like Vietnam , as the anti-war movement likes to say - ie , a failure
The reality is America only lost [ in south east Asia ] because the political leadership lost the resolve to back the troops
The crucial part now is to ensure American troops are n't abandoned as in Vietnam .
El Pais
' Impossible Victory ' , yesterday
All the alternatives Bush has put on the table to solve an increasingly deteriorating situation in Iraq are terrible .
This war - and above all its bad management , even more so than at the beginning of the war - has finally turned into the focus of the campaign for the American Congress elections on 7 November .
Even the president has now recognised its resemblance to the Vietnam war .
At this stage , the Bush administration is looking for a political escapade .
But if the option were clear , they would have already opted for one .
Le Monde
' The strategy in Iraq puts the Congress elections at stake ' , 18 October
Will James Baker succeed in finding an exit strategy in Iraq 's dead end for president George Bush ?
Three weeks before the Congress elections that some observers see as the ' referendum on Iraq ' , the former Secretary of State is omnipresent in the media , accrediting the idea that the change of policies in Iraq is perhaps less distant , as opposed to Bush 's denials of change .
Mr Baker promotes this idea specially in his book , an autobiography where he shares his emotions as well as revealing his discovery of African - American cousins and his taste for hunting , a pastime he shares with the father of the current president .
Sydney Morning Herald
Leader , yesterday
The debate over Iraq policy in the US , Britain and Australia is being driven by bad news from Baghdad and increasingly hostile public opinion at home .
It is good that this is forcing political leaders to review and adjust their strategies .
It will be even better if it leads them to stop reviling their critics as traitors or cowards and instead explain the moral , political and military complexities of the Iraq situation .
The case against a premature withdrawal should not rest on defence of an invasion that was launched partly on false pretences but , rather , on the new realities created by that invasion and its bungled aftermath .
So dire are those realities that pulling out now would not only expose the Iraqis to the danger of even worse bloodshed in an outright civil war , but also present violent jihadists with a victory that would embolden them to further atrocities .
Washington Post
Colbert King , yesterday
There is a new Iraq emerging before our eyes .
It is an Iraq that torments Christians , that indulges in unrelenting sectarian bloodbaths , that cheers for Hizbollah , that is no more a friend to Israel than is Iran , all despite the lies sold to the White House and Pentagon by self - serving , power - hungry Iraqi expatriates .
The new Iraq is not what George W. Bush talks about .
But that 's the Iraq he 's got .
And , worst of all , that 's the Iraq we are in . '
The Economist , London
Leader , yesterday
The only honest alternative is indeed probably just to go and let one side win .
America did that in Vietnam and Britain did it in Palestine ...
Vietnam turned out well enough , regional dominoes did not all fall and America went on to win the cold war anyway ...
Maybe something similar will happen in Iraq , not least because the rival versions of theocracy on offer from Iran and al - Qaeda are nonsensical too .
But just going would be a fantastic gamble , not only with America 's global power and prestige but also with other people 's lives .
Better , still , to stay .
