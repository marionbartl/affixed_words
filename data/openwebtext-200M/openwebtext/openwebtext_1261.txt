A resident of the 300 block of West Caracas Avenue , Derry Township , told police someone smeared birthday cake over his son's car on July 30 .
The police report noted that the cake on the Mitsubishi Eclipse was chocolate and vanilla with sugar icing in a blue and orange color scheme .
It was " very moist and fresh to the touch , " the report noted .
The car 's owner told police it was the fourth time the car had been attacked with food .
It was twice pelted with Twinkies , he said , and once splattered with a platter of Chinese food .
Do n't know about you , but sometimes I can't sleep at night for wondering what it might be like if Gary Glitter were executed .
I just can't picture it in quite enough detail for my liking .
Would they fry him ?
Gas him ?
Or pull his screaming head off with some candy - coloured rope ?
I can never decide , and it often leaves me restless till sunrise .
Thank God , then , for The Execution Of Gary Glitter ( Mon , 9 pm , Channel 4 ) , which vividly envisions the trial and subsequent capital punishment of pop 's most reviled sex offender so you do n't have to .
I can't believe what I 'm typing : this is a drama - documentary that imagines a world in which Britain has a )
Reinstated the death penalty for murder and paedophilia , b) Changed the law so Britons can stand trial in this country for crimes committed abroad , and c ) Chosen Gary Glitter as its first test case .
It blends archive footage , talking - head interviews with Miranda Sawyer , Garry Bushell and Ann Widdecombe , and dramatised scenes in which Gary Glitter is led into an execution chamber and hanged by the neck until dead .
He 's not just swinging from a rope , mind .
The Glitterphile is all over this show , like Hitler in Downfall .
There are lengthy scenes in which he argues with his lawyer , smirks in court , plays chess with the prison chaplain , weeps on the floor of his cell , etc .
Visually , we 're talking late - period Glitter , with the evil wizard shaved - head - and - elongated - white - goatee combo that makes him resemble a sick alternative Santa .
It would be funnier if they showed him decked out in full 70s glam gear throughout , being led to the gallows in a big spangly costume with shoulder pads so huge they get stuck in the hole as he plunges through .
I assumed the Glittercution would feature dry ice , disco lights , and a hundred party poppers going off as his neck cracked .
But here there 's not so much as a can of Silly String .
This is a terribly serious programme .
Yes .
It 's illegal to laugh at this , see ; it 's not a comedy show , but " an intelligent and thought - provoking examination of the issue " which " confronts viewers with the possible consequences of capital punishment in the UK " .
There 's going to be an online debate afterwards and everything , which should help clear up all our thoughts about the death penalty .
Let 's face it , none of us really knew where we stood until we were " confronted " by the sight of Gary Glitter staring wretchedly at an expectant noose .
It really crystallised things , y'know ?
Before , I always thought of hanging as an abstract , faraway event existing only in ancient woodcuts or the minds of passing clouds .
This makes it so much more real .
My sincere thanks , Channel 4 , for the searing moral clarity I 've been granted .
By the way , is the real Gary Glitter going to be taking part in that online debate thing afterwards ?
That 'd be awesome .
What with this and the previous Killing Of George Bush drama - doc a few years ago , the Channel 4 family is establishing itself as the home of thought - provoking celebrity death fantasises .
Now they 've whacked a president and strangled a paedo , what next ?
How about a two - hour drama - documentary that wonders what Britain might look like if al - Qaida attacked the Baftas ?
Lots of detailed close - up slow - motion shots of bullets blasting through the ribcages of absolutely everyone off Coronation Street , that kind of thing .
It 'd really kick - start that debate about terrorism we 're all gasping for .
Perhaps it could solve it altogether .
Or what about a mini-series showing what 'd happen if you kidnapped a bunch of newsreaders and X Factor contestants and kept them on a remote island and glued masks on their faces and fed them LSD and MDMA for two years until they started killing each other and rutting the corpses and shoving bits of blunt stick in their eye sockets and howling at the sun ?
That 'd help society explore its relationship with authority , celebrity , identity , controlled substances , sex , violence and sticks .
And God knows we need to .
Help us , Channel 4 . Guide us .
You 're our moral compass .
You 're our only hope .
Glad people seem to be enjoying the comic !
The idea stemmed from an encounter with Lakitu where he literally gave me 99 lives without even trying .
I can just see him reporting back to Bowser what had happened .
I like that Ray suggested the ‘ blueprint ’ style as it gives a fresh look to the comic and allowed us to work in that great punchline .
Aw , man … just when he got to the end , too .
All that knowledge …
The year was 1999 .
The world was preparing to end , thanks to the Millennium bug that would either blow us all up , or give out free money from ATMs at midnight on New Year ’s Eve .
Some events of 1999 included the establishment of the Euro , the Columbine High School Massacre , the first episode of Spongebob Squarepants , the war in Kosovo , the debut of Napster , Lance Armstrong wins his first Tour De France and Boris Yeltsin resigns as President of Russia .
I was working as a web designer and programmer for a Norwegian telecoms company , looking after their intranet design and occasionally helping with marketing bits and pieces .
I could n’t program my way out of a paper bag ( still can ’t ) but I loved the excitement of Web Design , typing HTML in notepad and editing images with Paint Shop Pro .
I was over the moon when the company invested in Macromedia Flash 4 .
Animation on the web !
The same year a friend “ loaned ” me a copy of something I had heard a little bit about called Photoshop 5 …
In 1999 , the web was a smaller place , filled with tables , some seriously dodgy background images and blinking text .
But what sort of designs did the really big boys have on their web site ?
Would you recognize them today ?
I used the Wayback Machine archive to take a look at ten web sites that are fairly huge today .
Here ’s what they looked like then .
Note :
When I was taking screen grabs , the resolution of my screen was 1280 x 800 pixels , you ’ll see how narrow the designs were then by the amount of white space visible .
Apple.com , nice and clean even then , and advertising the Power Mac G4 .
Amazon.com had a liquid layout and looked very similar to how it is today .
BBC was reporting on the murder of Jill Dando .
Microsoft.com offered a download of Internet Explorer 5 .
Wired Magazine
Yahoo ! was currently showing a sneak peak of their new homepage , but it used to look like this for quite a while .
Monster.com : Many a CV has passed through here since 1999 .
The Onion.com , built with frames , remember them ?
The White House is the most dramatically changed of all the ten web sites listed here .
Oh look !
A new search engine .
What were YOU doing in 1999 ?
And what do you think about how some of these web site designs have ( or have n’t ) changed in ten years .
The ugly web is over ; the trick is to add a Django middleware to process every HttpResponse ( with content - type text / html ) of Django using BeautifulSoup .
The source - code of the middleware is simple :
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup class BeautifulMiddleware ( object ) : def process_response( self , request , response ) : if response.status_code == 200 : if response [ " content - type " ].startswith ( " text / html " ) : beauty = BeautifulSoup( response.content ) response.content = beauty.prettify ( ) return response
We simple check for HTTP response code 200 and then check for a “ text / html ” content and use BeautifulSoup to process the response .
See an example of what it does :
1 ) I ’d a html in my Django application , very ugly and with missing tags :
This HTML template will be rendered as showed above by Django without the BeautifulSoup middleware , but with the middleware pluged in the settings of your Django app , it will render that html source :
BeautifulSoup has figured out sensible places to put the closing tags of the HTML source and has created a pretty indented structure , automagically =)
It ’s very easy and interesting create new django middlewares , examples can be JavaScript obfuscators , compressors , automatic performance analysis of html code to improve the render speed of browser and these sort of things .

The Clemson Women 's Rowing Team About To Become Famous For All The Wrong Reasons
In about 2001 , Martin Davies — a former Utah radio personality who was once named Best Talk Radio Host by City Weekly readers — found that his pension , unemployment insurance and other safety nets had evaporated in a company bankruptcy , reducing the 61 - year - old ’s income to just a $ 432 monthly Social Security check .
Unemployed and uncertain of his future , Davies went hiking near Ogden , where he made a surprising discovery that would open an entirely new career path for him .
He stumbled into a garden of marijuana .
The English - born Davies then saw an elderly gentleman appear from the woods .
“ You ’re not going to hurt my plants , are you ? ” the mysterious man said .
The old man explained he was sick and grew the plants for his own medicinal use .
Davies has arthritis in his hip , which he soon learned was greatly alleviated by the use of marijuana .
Shortly thereafter , Davies grew a small amount of marijuana for his personal use , but his small operation did n’t stay that way .
“ A brother - in - law happened on to [ Davies ’ marijuana ] and indicated that he would like to buy it .
[ Davies ] let him do that , and that began the trip that got us here , ” said defense attorney Bernie Allen during a speech in court that was also the source for the old - man - in - the - woods story above .
“ Here ” was the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City in 2008 , where Davies was facing 10 years to life in prison after police discovered three houses and a storage unit stuffed with hydroponic marijuana growing operations .
More than 1,000 plants were found in various stages of development at the four locations .
According to warrants , “ The Martin David Davies Marijuana Trafficking Organization ” had been pegged by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a multi-state marijuana source .
A lot had happened since Davies met the old man .
Davies had disappeared from public life before expanding his operations throughout the Ogden area .
Rumors of his death were even reported , and debunked , in a 2003 Deseret News article .
Years passed before he was arrested , booked , jailed , bailed out , released , indicted and defended .
Now it was time to face U.S. District Judge Dee Benson , where Davies pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana .
“ Was it pretty good marijuana ? ” Benson asked Davies after he entered the guilty plea .
“ It was extremely high - quality , I am told , ” Davies replied .
“ Well , they say since we started growing it in the states , it is a lot better quality than the stuff that [ defense attorney John Caine ’s ] friends used to smoke in high school , ” Benson said .
A record 44 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana , according to an October 2009 Gallup poll , so perhaps a little friendly pot - talk between judge and defendant should n’t be surprising .
It ’s not like the judge was chit - chatting about “ pretty good ” heroin .
But everything else about Davies ’ case surprises Weldon Angelos , a 29 - year - old father of three , who lived in Salt Lake City before the same U.S. Attorneys who would eventually prosecute Davies came after him .
Charged in 2002 with marijuana and firearms possesion , Angelos is currently serving a 55 - year prison sentence .
His judge , U.S. District Court Judge Paul Cassell , now a University of Utah law professor , called the sentence “ unjust , cruel and irrational ” during the sentencing hearing .
Angelos received a stiffer punishment than most convicts of child rape or second - degree murder , yet the judge was powerless to reduce the sentence any less than 55 years .
He wrote in the sentencing report that “ the system has malfunctioned ” and Angelos ’ sentence was “ demeaning to victims of actual criminal violence . ”
Angelos will not have his first opportunity for release until 2052 , even with good behavior .
Davies , on the other hand , was sentenced to three months in prison and three months ’ house arrest for operating three houses and having a storage unit full of weed .
His sentences have already been completed .
How did their cases diverge so drastically ?
Both were treated as first - time offenders , though Angelos had juvenile convictions and Davies had a British conviction from the 1970s .
Both were accused by prosecutors of being big - time marijuana dealers , though prosecutors seized a lot more marijuana from Davies .
Neither Davies nor Angelos , whose family is Greek , belong to a racial class that is disproportionately prosecuted or incarcerated .
Both were subject to mandatory - minimum sentences .
Both had guns seized in addition to marijuana .
Angelos believes he was unfairly targeted by prosecutors .
“ My case goes to show you how much discretion the prosecutors have .
I felt my prosecutor [ Robert Lund ] was out to get me . ”
While they phrase it differently , several legal scholars agree and say Angelos ’ , who has become a poster boy for groups like Families Against Mandatory Minimums , is n’t the only case of injustice .
UP IN SMOKE : ANGELOS
Still in his early 20s , Angelos ’ music career was budding .
He owned his own record label , Salt Lake City - based Extravagant Records , and released several albums , one of which contained a track by legendary rapper and marijuana enthusiast Snoop Dogg .
Angelos hung - out with gang members , and pictures shown at his trial show him flashing the gang sign of Varrio Loco Town , a local gang the Salt Lake County Sheriff ’s Office says is unaligned with any larger gangs .
Angelos maintains he was n’t in a gang , but the community he lived in was steeped in gang culture .
His sister , Lisa Angelos , agrees .
“ In the apartment we grew up in [ in Midvale ] , there were gangs and wannabe gang members .
That ’s pretty much the people we knew .
You can either shun them and get beat up every day , or just be friends with them . ”
Angelos was also a gun fanatic , a trait he inherited from his father .
“ They put into evidence that even at 15 I had guns , ” Angelos said from within the Davis County Jail , where he ’s been held for much of 2009 while his appeal is heard at the federal court in Salt Lake City .
His “ home ” prison is in Lompoc , Calif. , where he will return if this — perhaps his last — appeal fails .
He is the father of two boys and a girl .
Angelos agrees that there is “ undisputed proof that I was involved with marijuana . ”
He ’s never denied that , perhaps , in part , because it was guns , not pot , that allowed for his harsh sentence .
By 2002 , he says , his rap career was flourishing and he was phasing marijuana sales out of his life .
Then , “ good friend ” and VLT gang member Ronnie Lazalde enters the story .
According to court testimony , Lazalde asked Angelos for a drug hook - up , and Angelos obliged .
On three occasions between May 21 and June 18 , 2002 , Angelos sold Lazalde 8 ounces of marijuana for $ 350 .
He refused to sell to Lazalde a fourth time , but it was too late .
Lazalde , allegedly facing his own weapons and drugs charges , was cooperating with federal investigators .
Investigators searched Angelos ’ home and found three pounds of marijuana , $ 20,000 cash and three firearms .
They found another pound of marijuana and a revolver in the trunk of his car .
They found more marijuana and more guns at an apartment he rented on Fort Union Boulevard .
But despite all that evidence , Angelos ’ major crime was the sale of small amounts of marijuana to Lazalde while carrying a gun .

Last night , Cameron Maybin put up four hits , including two line drive doubles , against the Philadelphia Phillies as part of a 7 - 2 win .
That performance brought Maybin ’s season batting line up to .257/.328/.419 , an impressive feat given that he left us on May 10 with a .202/.280/.310 line .
On the month , Cameron has hit .313/.376/.530 in 95 PA , a marked improvement over his first month or so in the majors with Florida .
Where has he improved ?
Where do we start ?
In 93 PA , Maybin has drawn nine walks and struck out only 18 times , compared to the eight walks and 31 strikeouts he recorded in his first 93 PA of the season .
While I ca n’t be sure ( i.e. I have n’t yet done the research ) on whether this a significant approach change or just an issue of teams not pitching to him , I can say that given how poorly he was hitting early in the season , it ’s unlikely that teams decided to drop their old pitching habits to him .
He ’s swinging at pitches like a league average hitter , so there ’s not a whole lot to complain .
This is likely a little high for a walk rate for Maybin , but if his pitch recognition and contact can improve a little bit , his strikeouts will go down and he ’ll be a slightly better player .
What we were missing when the season started was power , and he ’s flashed it so far in his second stint up .
In those 95 PA , he ’s recorded 11 extra - base hits , including three home runs .
Compare that to six extra - baggers he got when he was up here first .
What ’s ironic is that while he was down in the minors , he was not performing in terms of power .
In 342 PA this season in Triple - A New Orleans , Maybin only had 23 extra - base hits and two home runs when his raw stats are translated to major league equivalents , according to Minor League Splits .
This is a bit less than major league average in terms of extra - baggers , but iat this point it could be an expected result for Maybin .
Despite his more towering major league shots , it appears as if he ’s still developing his power ; currently , he ’s still mostly a line - drive hitter , which is n’t terrible , especially given Maybin ’s speed .
But let ’s not get too excited .
Maybin ’s posted these numbers this month on the back of a .412 BABIP , which is a monstrous number just waiting to regress .
The better contact has been a good sign , but it does n’t mean that he ’ll hit this well all of next year ; a month is too little in terms of sample size to say anything definitive .
I ran a quick projection using his major league numbers and major league equivalents of his minor league stats and got an expected wOBA of .316 , which is around 8.5 runs below average over the course of 620 PA .
This does n’t project any growth over the offseason as Maybin gets older , and you would suspect a 24 - year old to get better instead of worse , but we ’ve seen problem players before ( see Hermida , Jeremy ) and I do n’t want to get my hopes up too early .
Neither should you .
Let ’s temper our excitement a bit .
Even at this projection I have Maybin being worth about 1.5 WAR at center field , adequate but below average , certainly valuable though .
Let ’s not try to stick too high an expectation on the kid early .
New Possible Drug for Type 1 Diabetes
An existing drug used to treat the cancer type Hodgkin ’s lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis was found to be a possible drug for patients newly diagnosed with type - 1 diabetes .
Rituxan , generically rituximab , is produced by Genentech – a unit of Roche Holding AG and Biogen Idec Inc .
It helps patients keep producing their own insulin even if the diabetes already destroyed some of the pancreatic beta cells that produce the insulin for the body .
Type - 1 diabetes or juvenile diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body ’s own immune system is destroying the beta cells in the pancreas that produces insulin .
The new drug therefore is not yet considered as a cure for the disease not to occur but can be used to help patients recover what they lost from the disease .
Dr. Mark Pescovitz , the lead researcher of the study that found the potential of the drug said , “ What this study does is open the door to a whole new way to approaching type 1 diabetes . ”
You probably have some apps , programs , or other tools that you use often , and , as such , you want to have speedy access to them .
An excellent way to make that happen is to pin those items to the taskbar .
Furthermore , that 's not everything that you can pin to it .
You can also pin special shortcuts and items to the taskbar , such as File Explorer 's " This PC " , Network , and " Quick access " locations .
You can even add taskbar shortcuts for Control Panel items , Administrative Tools , and other stuff .
For all the ways in which you pin shortcuts to the taskbar , read on :

6 . How to pin taskbar shortcuts to the Quick Access , OneDrive , Network , or Recycle Bin ( special locations )
If you want to pin to the taskbar one of the special File Explorer items Quick access , OneDrive , Network , or Recycle Bin you must first create a special shortcut to them .
Unfortunately , you can't drag and drop the new shortcut to the taskbar .
Here 's what you have to do :
Right - click or tap and hold anywhere there 's empty space on your desktop and select " New -> Shortcut . "
Creating a new shortcut
In the Create Shortcut wizard , type explorer .exe followed by a space ( space is essential ) .
Then , type one of the following texts , depending on where you want your new shortcut to point :

This is the one you can drag to the taskbar or right - click ( touch and hold ) and choose " Pin to taskbar . "
Pin Network shortcut to the taskbar
Note that most shortcuts you create and pin to the taskbar this way use by default the File Explorer icon .
If you pin more items like this on the taskbar , you might end up with something like ten File Explorer icons one after another .
Although they open different things , they look the same , which is not helpful , is it ?
To overcome this mishap , before pinning the shortcuts to the taskbar , you should change their icons to something individual for each .
So make sure you assign them new icons before pinning them to your taskbar .

A Beginners Guide to Spanking her ...
( Second in the series for BDSM Beginners )
{ Editorial note : I do not mean to insult A / anyone , but for simplicity for the beginner I did not follow the proper capitalization rules .}
In the first part of this series I talked about the founding principle of BDSM : Safe , Sane , and Consensual .
I do n't think enough can be said about the importance of each of these three areas .
For those of you who did not read the first part , I will cover it here one more time because of how important it is to both the beginner and the experienced BDSM practitioner .
Safety is the first leg of the BDSM three legged stool , if you 'll permit the analogy .
Safety first , second , third and always is the only way to truly enjoy BDSM to the fullest .
That sounds strange does n't it ?
Is n't BDSM about taking absolute control ?
Is n't BDSM about Bondage and Dominance ?
Is n't the S in BDSM stand for sadism , which means to take pleasure in inflicting pain ?
Is n't the M about masochism , or the enjoyment of receiving pain ?
Well , the answer to all those questions is ; yeah , but !
The BDSM lifestyle that we practice at home is a loving relationship that has the basis on the clearest of understandings .
I dominate her , because she needs to submit to feel complete , and I need to have loving control so that I too can be fulfilled .
One without the other is impossible , or better said it is not BDSM and can border on abuse and brutality at its worse .
To the outside world [ those who have only read the words , but not experienced the lifestyle ]
BDSM is the dark pictures they see on the magazines and the brutal pornographic images that sometimes are included in the movies .
Just like a man can't leap over tall buildings , BDSMers do not brutally accost each other for the sake of the Sadism and Masochism traits they share .
BDSM is about the open conversation about the fantasies , desires and needs as well as the enjoyment of dominating or being dominated and for both to heighten their erotic pleasure by the unique sensations they share with each other .
The second leg of the three legged stool of BDSM is " sane " .
All play , no matter how extreme it seems to the viewer is done with an understanding that no [ harm ] will be done .
The difference between pain and harm is very significant .
Think of it this way , you may enjoy having your ass spanked [ the thrill of the sharp sensation and the intimacy that accompanies it ] but you would not enjoy being punched in the nose .
Why ?
Simple , the blow to the cushioned fatty tissues on your buttock which is made for such abuse will cause no harm [ no permanent damage ] .
However , when you are punched on the nose [ even if you use the same force as on the buttock ] you hit less than a millimeter of flesh and then you are applying direct force on soft cartilage and then directly on the bone .
That same force is very likely to break something and cause injury .
Harm is not BDSM , that 's brutality and in no way accepted or condoned in the BDSM world .
Sane also includes the fact that the dominant in the relationship is the one that while in control , also must assume many responsibilities for the safety of his submissive .
This is not a one way street ; it is in fact a very well balanced relationship between submissive and dominant .
The dominant has to make sure that neither is under the influence of alcohol or mind , perhaps it would be better to call it perception , altering drugs .
The dominant has to be able to focus all his attention on the submissive and have a clear understanding of how close she is to her limits .
His reaction time must be at its sharpest to ensure that if the situation gets out of control he can slow it down or stop it in a heartbeat .
That can be the difference between pain and harm .
The third leg of the BDSM stool is consensual behavior .
Neither party gives cart blanche to the other .
The importance of communication , communication and yes more communication cannot be emphasized enough in here .
Long conversations need to take place between the dominant and the submissive to ensure that the scene is clearly laid out and that both know what the limits are and where they can and where they can not be pushed .
Dominants ask questions and make sure that you know exactly what 's on the mind of the submissive .
It is essential that you put her at ease and that she is made to understand that in this type of conversation she is not topping from the bottom : a topic all on its own .
Once you 've resolved all the questions in your mind , as the dominant , you must take control of the situation .
She craves to feel your loving control over her and will only put up a fight to the extent that it heightens her enjoyment of being taken over ; more appropriately taken in hand .
But , at the same time , you must keep in mind that you are doing this for your own enjoyment of taking her and letting her feel your hand landing upon her flesh just as the rest of you will at the end of the scene when you take her .
The same thing applies here that applied in your first experience dominating her : take your time !
There is no reason to rush through a scene .
The moment can be prolonged and minutes made to feel much longer because your adrenaline and hers are fully taking over your brain and the rest of the chemistry in your body .
Give her a set of instructions that make sense to you .
In this article I 'm going to give you some ideas , but in the end remember it is your scene , and NOT mine .
Order her to go to her room and put on appropriate clothing .
My own preference is a loose short skirt , no panties , no bra and a tight low cut top .
I want her to feel the embrace of the clothing and I want the clothing not to interfere with my machinations as I spank her .
Order her also to come back to you and to kneel before you .
The kneeling position I enjoy the most is called NADU and it comes from the Gorean worlds .
She is to kneel , legs spread apart and her ass resting on her heels .
Make sure she 's comfortable enough by providing her a soft spot for her knees .
Her hair is to be put up so that it is out of your way .
Her upturned palms are to lay on her thighs offering herself openly to you .
Once she 's kneeling before you , make a big production out of observing her .
Ensure that she understands that you are gazing upon her body and that it belongs to you .
Make minor adjustments to her position so that it pleases you most .
Arrange her hair the best way for your ability to touch all her skin .
At this point you want her to feel your domination and total control over the mood , because it is that same mood you are setting for the scene .
The mind is what you wish to control ; the body is the easy part .
Enjoy the feel of her breast upon your hands ; do not allow her to look up at you unless you explicitly give her instructions to do so .
Again , you are working on the mood and you are helping her achieve the mind set of the submissive .
Enjoy a long caress down her back , ending on what will be the target of your blows .
Touch her as if your fingertips were as light a feather and do not allow her to squirm because you are tickling her .
Do n't yell at her , just simply and firmly say : Stop !
Do not allow her to protest that she 's being tickled and cannot help it .
A submissive , just as much as a Dominant , has to be in control of herself first and foremost .
She has to have searched her own mind and spirit and decided that she wishes to submit to you , and upon arriving at that depth of self understanding , and then she is ready to experience the fullness of submission .
If she 's failed to do this , take her through this journey of self awareness .
There are no shortcuts in life , and neither are there any in BDSM .
The dominant person takes on many responsibilities as I stated earlier .
The development of her self awareness is one of the requisites for the job .
Come on , it 's no different than the soul searching you did when you realized that you had the potential of becoming a Top or a Dominant or even a Master .
You spent hours thinking about it , what it meant to you and what would be expected of you , she has to reach the same point or you two are not in balance with each other .
Take your hands and roam her body one more time : always taking the opportunity to correct her posture to please you most .
Follow the center of her body down to her thighs and caress them .
Tease her , endlessly !
She is your willing toy at this point and actually expects you to use her .
Caress the inside of her thighs , slapping them softly and telling her : Open !
Be firm , but be nurturing at the same time .
She 's learning what pleases you , and learning what she enjoys at the same time .
Part her lips gently , enjoy the unencumbered view and allow your fingers to penetrate her .
See if she 's wet enough to go to the next step .
Your preparations are to bring her arousal to a nice wetness that signifies that her entire body is ready for you .
Stay in this stage , or similar one , until you have her completely melting to your touch .
Before you move to the next step , keep in mind that there are parts of her body that are made to take punishment , but there are many parts that are not .
Examples of two areas you should stay away from are her spine ( I know , you had figured that out on your own ) and her lower back .
Her lower back , and on the side of her spine is where her kidneys are .
The kidneys are very sensitive and are also attached to the muscular tissue directly connected to her flesh .
A blow to the lower side of her back and you are dangerously close to causing damage to the kidney and to the injuring her .
Not a good idea .
One more area , that I 'm sure you figured out as you walked behind her , was her neck and her head .
Do n't strike a blow to either , they will cause harm .
The last word of caution is her coccyx bone , or better known as her tail bone .
A direct blow to it can cause the tip to break off and that is severe injury and pain .
Now that you have surveyed your property and are certain she is fully aroused , place her in a position that will allow you to spank her comfortably .
Remember , this is not a ten second spanking , this is a good workout and will last a fairly long time .
Once you 've put her in the position you want her in , and then warm her up a bit .
Take her butt cheeks in your hand , cup them and squeeze them .
The purpose is to get her mind ready , and to get the blood flowing nicely to her ass cheeks .
Lightly tap them .
Take your coat off , get comfortable , you 'll be here a while .
Get the lay of the land , so - to - speak .
Feel her ass cheeks ; make sure her legs are still parted because you want clear access to her lips .
You will want to check her moisture level from time to time , and to allow her to vent some of the eroticism she 's feeling by playing with her clit , and plunging a couple of fingers deep in her ; allowing her the pleasure of your penetration .
Continue for a while squeezing and lightly tapping her ass just to get a good feel .
Did you remember to set up a safe word ?
I hope so , if you read the last article .
But in case you 've not here is a good time to discuss safe words .
Pick a nice safe word , one that would not be a commonly used word in this situation .
Stop , is a bad safe word .
Ouch , as I remind my wife , is NOT a safe word .
I do that to give her a second to decide if Ouch was truly Ouch , please stop , or simply enjoyment of a well delivered blow to her lovely ass .
" Blue " could be a good safe word , if you both will listen for it , and both remember the meaning of it .
In addition to a safe word , you also need to find a word or a motion that will let you know that she enjoyed a particular blow very much .
A word that lets you know that you can spank her harder , or a word that means you hit a perfect spot , please remember it so that she may enjoy that feeling again .
Are you getting the idea that this is a lot of responsibility for you as the dominant ?
Good , you are getting it right and you 'll do well .
You must work this entire scene and words ( safe and forward ) out ahead of time .
Begin by delivering a few nice soft but firm blows .
Look for the areas on her ass and thighs she enjoys the most , and give you the most pleasure .
Remember the good spots , and make a mental note to come back to them .
Test her later on with harder blows , or more rapid blows so that you get a general picture of both of your likes and dislikes .
The force and frequency of your blows need to climb steadily .
You should start soft and slow , and then a bit harder and than later a bit faster .
Interchange slaps across her ass , with squeezing and caressing .
Give her body time to fully enjoy the sharp sensation of the blow , and then the tenderness of your love for her .
You are using her ass and thighs to work her out physically , mentally and emotionally .
Do n't be afraid to make her cry ; she may need your spanking to release those emotions .
Do n't be afraid to hold her down in place as you deliver the spanking as long as she does not use her safe word ; but at first you should remind her that squirming or ouch not even crying is a safe word .
Make her feel reassured that you are watching for her safe word , but that you are going to take her to the edge and let her peek over and test the other side , until she uses her safe word .
As you land blows keep in mind that too many blows in one place tend to get painful and no fun for either of you ; unless you are doing it on purpose .
You 'll learn that it is not always painful if she is already worked up enough .
In that case it is a lot of fun and you should not hesitate to do it .
Otherwise , switch cheeks ; slap the lower part of her ass right by her thighs with a little upper movement on the hand to cup the ass cheek .
Let your fingers linger and then plunge them deep inside her .
If she 's wet , pump her a few times , then remove your fingers and deliver additional blows where you know you 'll enjoy the most .
Observe her carefully and she 'll teach you where you will achieve the best results by slapping , how hard , how often and for how long .
Submissive women are not door mats , they are very intelligent and very strong women who simply need to be taken in hand , to be made , by sheer dominant will not brutality , to feel their submission .
Let your manliness come out , peel away the years of political correctness , wash them away and enjoy the power exchange you both share .
It is like nothing else .
As you do these scenes realize that the more you do them , the more you 'll know and the further you can push her .
Many women
I 've talked to tell me that their Tops at first did not push them far enough and that they needed to be taken up there so that they could release totally .
Do n't be afraid to let the scene last a long while ; but always keep an eye on her to make sure her blood flow is not compromised and make sure her breathing is normal ( normal for the emotions she 's feeling ) .
Her safety is in your hands and no one else's .
Her mental and emotional state is yours to control , but it is also yours to observe .
The deeper and deeper she goes into her submission she can get lost inside of herself , and now you have to take great care of her .
Just as you took time to bring her to this level of release , you need to slowly bring her back down .
This is when you have to be gentle with her and let her feel your presence and your continued control of her as she winds her way back down .
Caressing and gentleness are the keys for after care of your girl .
Afterwards talk about how she felt , what she was thinking , what she wanted to feel more of , and what she wanted to feel less of during the scene .
If she 's reluctant to be open with you , remind her that as your submissive her thoughts around a scene you 've put together and delivered belong to you ; both the good and the bad .
Encourage her and reward her for open honest answers .
This will only make your next scene far better than if you only had your thoughts and impressions to work from .
I encourage both Dominants as well as submissives to add to this posting by leaving comments describing your own feelings about spanking scenes that you 've been involved in , and help the beginners gain a better perspective by the variety of thoughts .
To allow my own thoughts and experiences to guide is not sufficient .
A beginner is eager to learn from you and I humbly ask that you add your thoughts to mine .
Blessings to all of you and thank you for reading this article .
Published at last : Jung ’s Red Book documents his “ confrontation with the unconscious ”
Gallery : Soul pictures
JUST before the first world war , the 38 - year - old Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung was troubled by awful dreams and visions .
Analytical to the core , he embarked on what he later described as his “ confrontation with the unconscious ” , and documented the lot .
The material went through various drafts before Jung recopied it all , using an ornate gothic script , into the single big , red , leather journal which gives the previously “ lost ” Red Book its popular name .
Jung went on to add historiated ( enlarged ) initials , ornamental borders …
Okay , maybe requiring minimum IQs as a standard to run for national office is a bit harsh , but can we at least insist that politicians prove that they are actually human and not some mindless automaton programmed with talking points ?
( In the past , ) Foxx has claimed Democratic reforms would mean seniors are “ put to death by their government , ” that health reform is a “ distraction , ” and that “ there are no Americans who do n’t have health care . ”
She was at it again today on the House floor , arguing that health reform is a greater threat to our country than “ any terrorist right now in any country ” : Everywhere I go in my district , people tell me they are frightened . …
I share that fear , and I believe they should be fearful .
And I believe the greatest fear that we all should have to our freedom comes from this room — this very room — and what may happen later this week in terms of a tax increase bill masquerading as a health care bill .
I believe we have more to fear from the potential of that bill passing than we do from any terrorist right now in any country .
Normally , this is where my head makes a very loud thunk against my desk at the stupidity , but instead I just find myself really angry at this illogical fear mongering and ugliness .
But what can you expect from a politician ugly enough to call Matthew Shepard 's murder " a hoax " ?.
Obviously her lip service towards valuing life does n't really mean any living people .
Rep .
Foxx , the lives of those 44,000 Americans who die needlessly every year because they do not have insurance is blood on your hands .
If the server environment supports it the client will automatically run asynchronous and allow the server to handle more requests while waiting for the client .
In environments such as CGI and FastCGI the client will simply fallback to blocking until it is finished .
Multiple client requests will always be handled parallel though and never block each other .

Congrats sri on his progress on Mojo project .
I 'm really glad my Tatsumaki framework still has a relevant competitor :)
Here 's the code to do that non-blocking proxy request in his blog post , as a web handler in Tatsumaki .
It 's built on top of Plack and AnyEvent , so it handles multiple requests in parallel non-blockingly and you can use whatever Plack middleware components and AnyEvent aware modules to do non-blocking work , and Tatsumaki also falls back to the blocking mode in Apache , FastCGI and CGI if it makes sense .
You can see more examples of doing I/O bound response , server push ( streaming or Multipart XHR ) and Comet long - poll in Tatsumaki 's eg/ directory .
US President Barack Obama has arrived for the leaders ' session Leaders have gathered for the final scheduled day of the UN climate summit , amid uncertainty over the shape of any eventual deal .
A draft political agreement drawn up by a small group of countries including the UK , US and Australia was rejected during overnight discussions .
Delegates described the situation as " confusing " and " desperate " .
US President Barack Obama told the conference he had come to the summit " not to talk but to act " .
Addressing delegates on Friday , he said : " While the science of climate change is not in doubt , I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now , and it hangs in the balance . "
As well as the leaders ' session , talks are scheduled on texts that sources say remain full of fundamental divisions .
One developing country negotiator told BBC News that the rejected draft political accord had arrived " as if from God " .
Time wasted ?
BBC environment correspondent Richard Black said some developing countries have repeatedly complained during the two weeks here of high - handed treatment by the Danish hosts and the West in general .
The summit as of this morning is a summit in crisis
Achim Steiner
UN Environment Programme
" It is very confusing , and developing countries are very disappointed because they 've invested a lot of time in the documents they 're negotiating here - the Kyoto Protocol discussions have been going on for four years , " said Martin Khor , executive director of the South Centre , a Geneva - based think - tank .
" Now this other thing comes to undermine it , and people feel their time has been wasted , " he told BBC News .
Achim Steiner , director of the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , told BBC News : " Only the heads of state can bring this summit to a successful conclusion . "
He added : " But the summit as of this morning is a summit in crisis . "
US - LED COPENHAGEN DEAL
No reference to legally binding agreement
Recognises the need to limit global temperatures rising no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels
Developed countries to " set a goal of mobilising jointly $ 100 bn a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries "
On transparency : Emerging nations monitor own efforts and report to UN every two years .
Some international checks
No detailed framework on carbon markets - " various approaches " will be pursued
There were reportedly a number of sticking points over the draft agreement .
One of them appears to have been the absence of a commitment to a legally binding treaty , which many developing countries have been insisting on .
" This declaration has all the meaning and authority of a bus ticket , and certainly wo n't save the planet , " said Joss Garman of campaign group Greenpeace .
" The leaders have just hours left to end this farce but they still can .
If they do n't step up now this conference will forever be branded the shame of Copenhagen . "
President Obama is due to meet individual leaders including the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao .
Correspondents say it is the US and China - the world 's two largest carbon emitters - that hold the key to striking an agreement .
Both countries have indicated they might make concessions .
China signalled it might allow some monitoring of emission curbs while the US said it would commit money for developing countries .
Addressing the meeting on Friday , UN Secretary - General Ban-ki Moon urged delegations to " seal a deal " , adding : " It will be your legacy . "
Despite many expressions of concern about projections of climate change , finance has emerged as an issue more likely to make or break a deal than emission pledges , the BBC's Richard Black reports from Copenhagen .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US was prepared to help establish funding of $ 100bn a year for developing countries if a deal emerged that met US requirements .
The key US demand is " transparency " from China , seen as a must if the US Senate is to pass legislation controlling emissions .
COPENHAGEN CLIMATE SUMMIT
Delegates from 193 nations are in Copenhagen to negotiate an agreement on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , in order to prevent dangerous climate change Developing nations want rich nations to cut emissions by at least 25 % by 2020 - rich nations are reluctant to go so far and want developing countries to curb emissions too
The US will not accept legally binding emissions cuts unless China does the same .
China has been vague on allowing international scrutiny of its emission cuts Ongoing disagreement on how funds to mitigate and adapt to climate change will be provided .
Poor nations want direct aid , while the West favours schemes like carbon trading While Beijing has been hostile to this notion , Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said China was ready to engage in " dialogue and co-operation that is not intrusive , that does not infringe on China 's sovereignty " .
There was no immediate reaction from the US delegation to the Chinese offer but , an Associated Press correspondent reported that it went a long way toward meeting American demands .
Earlier , Indonesia 's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called for all states , both developed and developing , to be flexible about verification .
He indicated the possibility of setting up an international mechanism for monitoring emission cuts .
The draft declaration is reportedly set to mention a cap of 2 C but a document prepared by the UN climate convention secretariat , which was leaked earlier , confirms that current pledges on cutting greenhouse gas emissions are almost certainly not enough to keep the rise in the global average temperature within that level .
The analysis says that to achieve that goal , global emissions should be kept at or below 44 gigatonnes ( Gt ) of carbon dioxide equivalent ( CO2e ) in 2020 .
CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full
But if enacted , the current maximum pledges from developed countries would leave emissions 1.9Gt above that figure ; minimum pledges would mean missing the target by 4.2 Gt .
Unless this gap is closed , it says - for example by developed nations raising their current overall offer to a cut of 30 % from 1990 levels by 2020 - global emissions will " remain on an unsustainable pathway that could lead to concentrations equal or above 550 ppm , with the related temperature rise around 3C " .
" The stark message for world leaders at Copenhagen is that the proposals on the table - especially from industrialised countries - fall far short of what the world needs , " said Keith Allott , head of climate change for WWF in Britain .
In another development , President Obama may reach an agreement in principle on nuclear arms reduction with his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , when they meet in Copenhagen on Friday , a senior US official said .

building a star in the comfort of your lab
Fusion simply has far too much promise not to keep pursing , even if the progress seems slow right now .
Despite the constant grumbling of naysayers , tiny budgets and disappointment from impatient media outlets , fusion researchers have n’t given up .
Igniting a self - sustaining fusion reaction that produces at least ten times the power that was put into it may be an extremely challenging task , but the rewards would simply be too big to ignore .
Today , the next big attempt to kick fusion into high gear is the ITER reactor being assembled by a team of scientists and engineers in the south of France .
While other researchers have been focused on a reliable , effective method of ignition , the ITER team is aiming far higher .
Their goal is to make fusion industrially viable and provide an effective proof of concept test for utility companies interested in building their own artificial sun .
Theoretically , fusion is much more energetic than nuclear fission being used across the world today and it ’s a lot safer .
It produces little waste which decays relatively quickly and a fusion reactor can’t melt down because as soon as the temperature drops even a notch below insanely blistering , the process winds down unlike the runaway chain reactions possible with fission .
Of course , to contain the kind of ferocious reactions produced by nuclear fusion can strip away the lining of the reactor and searing hot plasma that would register at around 150 million degrees ( at this temperature the measurement system is pretty much irrelevant ) would need to be cooled to remove helium and other byproducts to keep the reaction going .
The materials needed to build the reaction chamber and its supporting components ?
Stainless steel , beryllium , tungsten and carbon fiber .
And of course there have to be enough magnets to keep a firm grip on the device ’s churning innards .
Now , you can already hear the skeptics .
The project will cost billions of dollars , it will only be done by 2018 or so , fusion power has been promised for more than half a century now and we ’re still a long ways away .
All the same criticisms leveled at countless complex and time consuming projects .
And they are valid to a degree .
If you ’re going to promise something to the public , do n’t look to become a media darling and make claims that you ca n’t back up in reality .
If you ’re going to take on a challenging project , make good use of your money .
But at the same time , what the skeptics need to realize here is that replicating what happens in the core of a star is n’t exactly like boiling an egg .
High energy physics are n’t mastered overnight and if you really want to make a machine that can do spectacular things , it will take time and money .
Nature does n’t give you anything for free .
You have to work for it .
The $ 10 billion being allotted for ITER is not even a drop in the bucket when it comes to the kinds of subsidies and credits oil companies and existing utility providers will get on a regular basis .
If we allow even less money and demand that scientists somehow cough up new a working fusion reactor , it ’ll take even longer to fulfill the stated goal .
When it comes to radical new technologies that push our technology to the limits , it ’s a question of how badly we want it , how much effort we ’re willing invest and how patient we want to be .
And right now , as far as fusion is concerned , our lack of will and determination is disturbingly glaring .

How exciting !
“ Bad Questions : The Director ’s Cut ” , my sassy improvised comedy video telling rude people how I feel about their questions , has reached over 1,000,000 views !
Combined with the original , longer cut ’s 300,000 views the concept has 1,300,000 + views !
Not bad for a transsexual topic .
What really kicked it off was YouTube ’s surprising decision to contact me and put it on the front page of the site as a promoted video , but actually a huge portion of views have come from just viral spread throughout the community .
Thank you , Cal - pals !
Originally just a list of questions here on my site that I had gathered over years of dealing with the public , one evening I decided to slap some Coty Airspun powder on my face , paint my eyes and lips , slip into a vintage 1970 ’s thrift store dress in Oxblood , have two fingers of Lagavulin and improv away based on the list sitting in my lap .
Since then , “ Bad Questions ” has been translated into French , played for groups at community centers and even shown in college classrooms , far exceeding any expectations I ever had for it .
One just never knows what will become of an evening ’s work !
In celebration of the 1 million mark , here ’s a little essay I ’ve been sending out to people who write to me about the video , usually to express anger at my tone and claim that “ curiosity is normal ” .
In a nutshell , I respond that the tone is comedic and I agree that everyone is curious about unusual people but that curiosity is not a license to ask rude questions .
Look it up , dum dum ! 😉
Bad Questions ?
Thanks for watching the video and sending such well - considered letters .
I want to respond because I appreciate your insight and effort , but this should n’t be considered a formal interview .
My ideas about this are continually evolving , largely in response to the continuing behavior of outsiders and my efforts to secure a place of personal strength and self - preservation .
This letter will express some strong feelings , but I want to say that I am not expressing any negative statements toward you and appreciate your thoughtfulness in writing .
The first thing I like to point out about the video is that it was intended to have a strong comedic element , indicated by the retro background music and highly mannered presentation among other things .
It was improvised from a list of “ bad questions ” sitting in my lap , and done after two glasses of single malt Scotch .
The video was never intended to be the ultimate statement on how to deal with transsexuals , any more than the Jane Fonda Workout video was intended to be the only and ultimate statement on how to exercise .
The ultimate message of the video , I have come to determine , is this :
Curiosity = normal
Acting on it by asking deeply personal questions of a stranger = bad
I cannot repeat that enough .
Yes , I am unusual to “ you ” ( the critical respondent ) .
Yes , you ’re not educated on my issues so you have questions .
No , I do n’t have to smile and be gracious when you start asking rude questions .
Go buy a book or Google it .
If the viewer does not routinely ask casually acquainted transsexual people questions about their genitals or seek to reconstruct the identities which they ’ve spent their lives shedding , then the video and its tone are not directed at them .
If they do , then they need a good verbal spanking and I have given it to them .
I get it that uneducated people are curious .
But at a party , restaurant or one of my shows especially , that ’s a “ YP ” , not an “ MP ” .
Do n’t bother me about it when you do n’t even know me .
Get this : I ’m mildly curious about how they became so overweight , why they ’re limping , who taught them to do their makeup , why they speak with a stutter , do they realize everyone can tell it ’s a toupee , etc etc etc .
But I would never ask , because it ’s rude .
Those questions reflect the lower echelons of my humanity , and it ’s better not to inflict them on a vulnerable person .
And yet , while they would consider me asking their mom or sister about their menopause or episiotomy over our first dinner together as horrifying , people cannot seem to understand that simply “ being curious ” does not entitle them to ask me any and every question that pops into their head without consequence .
So now , if they carelessly cross that line with me , disregarding my feelings , I have personally decided there will be consequences .
That is my perogative , and I absolutely will not be made to keep quiet and endure insulting behavior any longer .
There are consequences to hurting my feelings or insulting me .
Just as they did not care that their questions may have been hurtful to me , I do not care that my responses may be challenging for them to hear .
Considering the low level of empathy and social interaction indicated , I even believe that a bit of sting is necessary to make an impact with this kind of person .
What causes many viewers of “ Bad Questions ” to bristle , especially non-transsexual people , is a strong undercurrent of anger , disgust , condescension and mockery flowing just beneath my artificial smile .
Examining my manner of presentation , and their negative reactions to it , may be the most unintentionally educational aspect of this “ mock ( but not ) ” instructional video .
Because daily I am faced with varying levels of unnatural smiles masking undercurrents of anger , disgust , condescension and mockery , sometimes from even my closest non-trans friends on certain issues .
The outright haters are easy enough to filter out , but facing the roiling confusion of disgust and sideshow curiosity that churns behind “ friendly ” smiles and mouthing of politically correct slogans presents a more difficult challenge .
You really ca n’t begin to understand what it is like to experience an all - permeating , ’round - the - clock disregard and disrespect where all standing and consideration I have with people is considered to be “ a gift from them to me ” , outside of some situations like physical disability , disfigurement or perhaps racial discrimination where shades of distinction such as the occasional ability to “ pass ” or “ blend in ” as the non-hated class is taken into account .
Ultimately , I believe their anger stems from something like this : “ How dare that tranny talk back to me !
How dare that shemale stand up for herself !
How dare that freak consider itself my equal ! ”
As you can tell , I become angry when treated with disrespect .
I am angry at being seen as a 2nd class woman , 2nd class citizen and even 2nd class member of the GLBT community .
And I refuse to feel apologetic about this anger any more , because people will gladly allow me to subjugate myself to a level that is comfortable for them , if I do not speak up .
In any case , I ’m really not there to educate them so much as warn them , perhaps even frighten them , into discontinuing negative behavior .
This is probably a paradigm shift , if you were assuming that I was responding to a lifetime of cruelty and condescension with loving understanding , but no .
I do not have time to lovingly hold the hands of every one of the endless crowd of people who disrespect and discount me .
I simply want to warn them not to do it and go about my business .
This is not to say that I do n’t believe education on these topics is important … it is vitally important and I have done as much as I can do to promote a positive image , support work like Andrea James ’
TSRoadmap and even specifically answer all the questions most people could have right here : “ Good Questions : Calpernia Addams on VideoJug ” .
After a lifetime of being one of the most malleable , considerate , empathetic people possible … and I truly was … the unstopping barrage of meanness has toughened my skin .
It ’s not my job to splay my identity open like a High School biology frog carcass for any tipsy idiot at a party who wonders what might be in my pants .
Now , if a stranger or new acquaintance is a little fearful to begin poking around my identity because they ’ve seen the video , and instead they have to ask things like “ What did you do today ? ” or “ How do you feel about the new health care plan ? ” or “ Did you like that new book by so - and - so ? ” , then I have won … and so have they , really .
I appreciate your writing to me on this , I ’m sure that I have n’t perfectly communicated myself , but in any case my days of enduring disrespect as a matter of course are done .

Advertisement Five British soldiers have been shot dead in Helmand Province , in an attack the UK military blamed on a " rogue " Afghan policeman .
The soldiers , three from the Grenadier Guards and two from the Royal Military Police , had been mentoring and living with the Afghan police in a compound .
The officer opened fire , injuring eight others , before fleeing the compound .
Gordon Brown told MPs the Taliban said they had carried out the attack and may have infiltrated Afghan police .
Speaking in the Commons , the prime minister said evidence was being gathered and security would be stepped up after the shooting .
But he added that training of Afghan police remained an " essential element " of the strategy in Afghanistan and would not be stopped as it was " what the Taliban fears most " .
Manhunt A total of 92 UK service personnel have now been killed this year , the highest annual figure since the Falklands War in 1982 .
Six British servicemen and two Afghan National Police officers were injured in the attack , in the Nad Ali district .
An investigation is under way and the soldiers ' next of kin have been informed of the deaths .
A UK military spokesman said : " One individual Afghan National Policeman , possibly in conjunction with another , went rogue .
" His motives and whereabouts are unknown at this time .
Every effort is now being put into hunting down those responsible for this attack . "
BBC Kabul correspondent Ian Pannell said sources had indicated the attacker was a police officer called Gulbuddin who had fled the scene after the shooting .
Map :
Where the attack happened
It appears he could have been involved in a dispute with his commander , but tribal sources have pointed to a link with the Taliban , our correspondent said .
ANALYSIS Caroline Wyatt ,
BBC defence correspondent
Training the Afghan police as well as the Afghan army is key to Nato 's plans in Afghanistan , so they can ultimately take over security across the country , allowing British and American forces and their allies to gradually leave .
However , recruiting and training the police and ensuring their loyalty to the Afghan government has long been extremely difficult .
In Helmand especially , the police are proving less reliable - as well as more corrupt - than the Afghan Army .
The Afghan police are relatively badly paid - earning rather less than a Taliban fighter - and are said to earn extra cash from taking bribes from ordinary Afghans at official or often unofficial checkpoints .
Latest Afghan deaths : Reaction Read your comments Lt Col Wakefield , spokesman for Task Force Helmand , said the men who were killed had been mentoring a number of Afghan police officers .
He said they had worked and lived in the compound at a national police checkpoint for the past two weeks .
The attack did not come as a result of any breakdown or fight between British and Afghan forces , he stressed .
Col Wakefield said : " It is with the deepest sadness I must inform you that five British soldiers were shot and killed yesterday in Nad Ali district .
" Five British soldiers , five of our own , shot down in the course of their duty .
They will not be forgotten . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the latest deaths were a " terrible loss " .
He said : " My thoughts , condolences and sympathies go to their families , loved ones and colleagues .
I know that the whole country too will mourn their loss .
" It is my highest priority to ensure our heroic troops have the best possible support and equipment - and the right strategy , backed by our international partners , and by a new Afghan government ready to play its part in confronting the challenges Afghanistan faces .
" Our troops deserve nothing less .
My commitment to them remains unshakeable . "
Worst incident Tory leader David Cameron said : " I pay tribute , as will the whole country , to their professionalism and their courage , and send my condolences to their families and their friends . "
Gen Stanley McChrystal , commander of the International Security Assistance Force , said he had spoken to the Afghan Minister of Interior , Haneef Atmar , who shared his regret for the incident .
" He gave me his assurance that this incident will be fully and transparently investigated , " he said .

" We will not let this event deter our resolve to build a partnership with the Afghan National Security Forces to provide for Afghanistan 's future . "
A former commander of British forces in Afghanistan , Col Richard Kemp , said the shootings were a very worrying development .
He said : " It will undermine trust , certainly in the short term , until we establish exactly what happened .
And it would n't at all surprise me now if there are n't a lot of soldiers , British soldiers in Afghanistan , with their fingers very firmly on the trigger when they 're around Afghan police and military . "
The British Military Police have launched an investigation .
The local chief of the Afghan National Police ( ANP ) and the Afghan national director of security have also begun investigating at the scene .
There was a similar incident involving the deaths of two US personnel in 2008 .
The British casualties were evacuated to the field hospital at Camp Bastion in Helmand by medical emergency response teams using Chinook and a US Black Hawk helicopters .
The Grenadier Guards have been advising the ANP and the Afghan National Army in training , tactics and patrol methods .
The deaths take the number of UK troops killed in Afghanistan since 2001 to 229 .
This is the worst single incident in Helmand since 10 July , when five soldiers from 2 Rifles were killed by bombs near the town of Sangin .

Riot police have penned marchers in outside the UN mission in Cairo Protesters trying to march into Gaza a year after an Israeli offensive are on hunger strike after Egypt blocked them from crossing the border .
Hundreds of people in Cairo have been prevented from getting close to the border with Gaza .
A group who got as far as the Sinai port of El Arish have been detained by the Egyptian police .
A separate convoy of vans delivering medical supplies is stuck in the Jordanian port town of Aqaba .
At least 38 people of various nationalities were picked up by Egyptian security services in El Arish and held in their hotel rooms , AFP news agency reported .
' Whatever it takes '
In Cairo hundreds of activists are camped outside the United Nations mission in Cairo trying to get them to pressure the Egyptians to let them cross the border with the Gaza Strip .
The marchers have gone on hunger strike and want the UN to help them " I 've never done this before , I do n't know how my body will react , but I 'll do whatever it takes , " 85 - year - old Hedy Epstein told AFP .
The American activist is a Holocaust survivor , the agency reported .
Meanwhile a convoy of vans carrying supplies which travelled all the way from London to Jordan has been told by Egyptian officials it must go all the way back to Syria to get into Egypt .
The " Viva Palestina " convoy , led by British MP George Galloway , has been blocked from getting on a ferry from Aqaba to the Egyptian town of Nuweiba where it planned to continue by road to the Rafah border crossing .
But now the convoy faces a potentially budget - draining journey back through Jordan to the Syrian port of Latakia , followed by several ferries to El Arish .
' Sensitive situation ' Earlier in December , Egypt rejected a request to allow activists to march across the border into the Gaza Strip to mark the anniversary of last year 's conflict .
The Egyptian foreign ministry said the march could not be allowed because of the " sensitive situation " in Gaza .
Over 1,000 activists from 42 countries had signed up to join " the Gaza freedom march " to mark the anniversary of the Israeli military incursion into Gaza last year .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 Gazans were killed in the 22 - day conflict that ended in January , but Israel puts the figure at 1,166 .
Thirteen Israelis , including three civilians , were killed .
Gaza is under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade , tightened since Hamas took over the strip in 2007 .
Most medicines are allowed into the territory , but their transfer can be slowed by Israeli and Palestinian bureaucracy , and the entry of medical equipment and other supplies is limited .
The World Health Organization says that at the end of November 2009 , 125 of 480 essential drugs were at " zero level " , meaning there was less than one month 's stock left .
Israel says the military operation was - and the continuing blockade is - targeted at Hamas , not Gaza 's civilians .
The Islamist movement has controlled Gaza since June 2007 , and has launched thousands of rockets and mortars into Israel in recent years .

The Chinese version of popular game World of Warcraft is a cash machine for its maker , Activision Blizzard .
But the massively multiplayer online game ’s fate is up in the air again .
A Chinese government agency , the General Administration of Press and Publication , has once again revoked the permit required to operate the game .
The regulators said that NetEase , which operates the game in China for Blizzard Entertainment ( a division of Activision Blizzard ) , must stop charging players and cease accepting any new registrations for “ gross violations ” of Chinese law .
It also rejected the application to create a Chinese version of WoW ’s first expansion pack , The Burning Crusade .
NetEase said in a statement that GAPP said that WoW does n’t have proper approval and that NetEase should stop charging users for the game .
GAPP is also evaluating whether to impose administrative penalties on the joint venture , Shangai EaseNet .
NetEase and Shanghai EaseNet said they believe that they are in full compliance with applicable Chinese laws and are currently seeking clarification from the relevant government authorities .
A spokesman for Blizzard said , “ We ’re committed to doing business in China and throughout the world in accordance with local laws and regulations .
As the operator of the game in China , our partner NetEase will discuss the matter with the related government authorities .
Please note that aside from some downtime yesterday tied to the standard maintenance schedule , the game is online and operational . ”
It seems that WoW is once again the victim of government agency rivalry .
The GAPP and China ’s Ministry of Culture , which approved the game ’s relaunch in September , are jockeying for control of regulation .
Blizzard has n’t commented yet .
The MoC has stated that GAPP has exceeded its authority ( Chinese report ) .
This is starting to make Chinese government officials look like laughing stocks .
It would be funny , but think of all of the four million WoW addicts who are n’t getting their fix in China .
U.S. federal inmate number 29296- 179 was once a very rich man .
The prisoner , known to the world outside the Englewood low - security prison in Littleton , Colo. , as Jeffrey Skilling , once had a net worth of around $ 100 million [ source : Ahrens ] .
He served as CEO of the seventh - largest corporation in the United States [ source : Ackman ] .
These days , still in the early years of his 24 - year prison sentence , Skilling makes about one dollar an hour for menial labor like washing dishes in the prison cafeteria .
Skilling 's downgrade from CEO to inmate was the result of his role as the mastermind of the largest corporate financial scandal in the history of the United States .
( Despite convictions on 19 insider trading , conspiracy and fraud charges , Skilling maintains his innocence . )
Skilling and his mentor , company founder Kenneth Lay , committed massive fraud against the shareholders of the Texas - based energy giant Enron .

The conspiracy was a sophisticated one ; it included fraudulent accounting practices ( the result of a dark alliance between the company and its independent auditors ) , which inflated the company 's earnings and , hence , the share prices of Enron stock .
Although many Enron executives , including Skilling and Lay , were fully aware of the company 's financial troubles , this information was skillfully hidden by the earnings reports the company released .
Enron encouraged its employees to buy stock in the company .
Just before news of the company 's dire financial straits began to trickle out , beginning in April 2001 , several executives -- with knowledge that the company 's stock would soon fall -- sold much of their stock before it plummeted .
By selling their shares ( Skilling made $ 67 million in artificially inflated Enron stock between 1998 and 2001 ) despite knowing that the company 's share price was about to take a dive , 29 executives engaged in what is known as insider trading [ source : Moore , et al ] .
The 21,000 employees of Enron lost both their jobs and their retirement savings ; the average employee had 62 percent of his or her 401 ( k ) tied up in Enron stock [ source : Lindstrom ] .
Every lost job and every lost dollar was the result of fraudulent accounting .
But it was the insider trading that enriched the finances of the same executives who defrauded investors and employees alike that raised the collective ire of the media and the public .
What precisely is insider trading and why is it viewed as such a violation of the public trust ?
It sounds like an oxymoron but I am starting to feel like I am a Consumerist Minimalist .
I am still trying to figure it out , but I think I ’ve hit on exactly what minimalism means to me .
There are other Minimalists out there who are pure in the sense that they REALLY do n’t give in to their wants and desires .
They ’re really trying to live without anything at all and while I admire that , I think “ what ’s the point of my working for all of this money if I cannot enjoy it a little ” ?
I am not saying I should go into debt , or buy things I do n’t want , need or use , but I do want to enjoy my money and my life with the comforts of things .
We all desire things , be it a book , a DVD , a pair of shoes or a new car .
I really do n’t believe that things do n’t make us happy and you can be deliriously happy without anything at all .
Maybe it ’s true for some people , but they ’ve ascended to a level of nirvana that I can’t quite grasp yet .
You need some sort of level of comfort for your lifestyle , and that requires having things .
To be clear , even a table is considered a thing , to me .
And if you decide to live without a kitchen table , kudos .
But for me , it ’s a necessity .
Where I find the balance is that I figure out my priorities and stick to them .
There was a big point in my life when I wanted too much and I could n’t figure out what made me happy or not .
This was also when I had a television , so I ’m going to draw a vague correlation to advertising pressure to my wanting more and more .
But ever since I gave up my television ( and all the commercials that come with cable TV subscriptions ) , I have seen a drastic drop in my desire for things .
I do n’t see the newest gadget out there dancing its way across the screen , and I do n’t want it .
When I read or hear about it , I find it interesting , but I ’ve since learned other strategies to cope with discerning whether or not I really want it .
I have been unplugged from my TV , I do n’t miss it and I definitely do n’t miss paying $ 60 for cable every month .
That is n’t to say I do n’t watch television shows any longer .
I do — just online & without commercials . 😉
Eventually , I found minimalism .
A name to something I could n’t quite put my finger on .
I wanted to live with less , but with the best .
But I had a real problem with the way everyone kept preaching how minimalism is living with less , less , less .
Or nothing at all .
That was n’t what I wanted .
I do n’t like extremes and I do n’t do well with them .
One of the problems was that I loved fashion & style , and I could n’t imagine having such a small wardrobe as a so - called minimalist .
Then I realized that I could find my own balance in minimalism — I could still have a rich , colourful and varied wardrobe and call myself a minimalist , because that was where my priorities in wanting stuff lies .
For example , I do n’t really care about having beautiful decorations for the home , or fancy kitchen utensils even if I love to cook .
Or extra makeup and toiletries that I do n’t really use or want .
Or a fancy new car .
I now look at my needs versus my wants , and but even if it ’s still a want I do n’t immediately say “ No ” .
I just put myself under heavy scrutiny first to ask if I really want it .
And if my budget allows , and it makes sense , I buy it , love it , and am done with it .
So do I need another necklace or a pair of shoes ?
Of course not .
But I cannot deny that having things makes me happy , and that ’s where I think the paradox of being a Consumerist Minimalist lies .
I am able to use minimalism as a way to filter out my true needs and wants , rather than being lost and confused in a world of desirable things , or feeling angry that I cannot live with less .

Hopefully , the United States wo n’t be broadcasting any programs about the Cuban missile crisis to foreign audiences .
President Barack Obama has tapped a former top aide of his predecessor George W. Bush to a key post on a board overseeing government - sponsored international broadcasting , just a few weeks after she called his administration ’s behavior “ unbecoming ” with regards to the so - called “ White House war with Fox News . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Dana Perino , the first Republican woman to serve as White House press secretary , was appointed late Wednesday to the Broadcasting Board of Governors ( BBG ) .
‘ I ’m honored by the president ’s announcement and I ’m looking forward to serving on the bipartisan board , if I ’m confirmed , ’ Perino said .
She currently serves as chief issues counselor for the United States at international public relations firm Burson - Marsteller and as a contributor to the Fox News Channel , which has sparred with the Obama administration over the past several months .
Created in 1994 , the BBG oversees all of the US government ’s non-military international broadcasting outlets , including Voice of America , Alhurra television , Radio Sawa , TV Marti , Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe .
Obama also nominated Walter Isaacson , president of the Aspen Institute leadership group and former CNN chief executive and Time magazine editor , to serve as BBG chairman .
All nominees must next be confirmed by the Senate .
ADVERTISEMENT
The BBG ’s mission is to “ promote and sustain freedom and democracy by broadcasting accurate and objective news and information about the United States and the world to audiences overseas . ”
The BBG ’s site notes , “ The Board is composed of nine bipartisan members with expertise in the fields of journalism , broadcasting , and public and international affairs .
Eight members are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate .
The ninth , an ex-officio member , is the Secretary of State .
The current members of the Board are : James K. Glassman , Chairman ; Joaquin F. Blaya ; Blanquita Walsh Cullum ; D. Jeffrey Hirschberg ; Edward E. Kaufman ; Steven J. Simmons ; and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Nearly two years ago , as RAW STORY reported , Perino was widely mocked after an appearance on National Public Radio ’s quiz show , “ Wait , Wait … Do n’t Tell Me , ” where she shared a story she ’d previously only shared in private .
ADVERTISEMENT
When a reporter asked her a question during a White House briefing in which he referred to the Cuban Missile Crisis — she did n’t know what it was .
“ I was panicked a bit because I really do n’t know about . . . the Cuban Missile Crisis , ” said Perino , who at 35 was born about a decade after the 1962 U.S. - Soviet nuclear showdown .
“ It had to do with Cuba and missiles , I ’m pretty sure . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The exchange was first noted in the Washington Post .
“ I came home and I asked my husband , ” she said on air .
“ I said , ‘ Was n’t that like the Bay of Pigs thing ? ’
And he said , ‘ Oh , Dana . ’ ”
Perino was referring to the White House briefing held on October 26 , when a reporter asked her , “ Do you want to address the remarks by President Putin , who said the United States setting up a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe was like the Soviet Union putting missiles in Cuba , setting up a Cuban missile crisis ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Well , I think that the historical comparison is not — does not exactly work , ” Perino had responded .
Perino is a contributer to Fox News , where she just recently appeared to slam the media over its treatment of former Alaska governor Sarah Palin .
Perino told Fox ’s Greta Van Susteren , “ And actually — you know , I got to travel this weekend , too , out in Colorado and Wyoming , and just meeting some people who said they were excited about the book coming out , interested in what I thought , did I think she was going to run for president .
But one of the things I heard repeatedly is that , I feel like I can trust her and I feel like I can relate to her .
And I do n’t even think that some of the media , when they are asking questions about her or to her , realize how condescending they sound , not just to Sarah Palin , but to all the people who might admire her . ”
“ Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) urged the Obama administration to appoint Perino , ” The Hill reports .
“ The Obama administration and Fox News have openly feuded for several months .
The White House has accused Fox of injecting opinion into its news coverage of the administration . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Think Progress noted that last month on Fox , “ Perino sharply criticized the Obama administration ’s tactics and expressed absolute shock at the example the United States was setting for ‘ the free press in emerging democracies , ’ comparing the criticisms of Fox News to when ‘ Hugo Chavez shuts down television stations . ’ ”
PERINO : That was a coordinated , calculated attack .
It was unbecoming .
And if you look at some of the coverage of what mainstream media covers when , for example , somebody like a Hugo Chavez shuts down television stations , he calls them illegitimate .
Now , I ’m not suggesting that this White House believes that they are going to come over here and shut down Fox News .
But they are defining a narrative in their first year , and it ’s going to be very hard to recover from it . [… ]
Through our State Department , we are trying to help emerging democracies get journalists and government officials to talk to one another , because freedom of the press is essential to any democracy .
Believe me , they are watching this , and they have — surely are raising questions .
A few days earlier , Perino said on Fox that the Obama administration was “ acting like dictators do . ”
Roll Call reports , “ This is the second time a president has nominated McCue to the Broadcasting Board of Governors .
President George W. Bush also nominated her , but Senate Republicans refused to move her nomination to the Senate floor despite repeated attempts by Reid .
Since leaving the White House , Perino , a frequent commentator on Fox News , has worked as the chief issues counselor for the United States at Burson - Marsteller . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
RAW STORY correspondent Eric Brewer often sparred with Perino at the Bush White House briefings , over issues such as Bush remarks alluding to Qaeda allegedly plotting to steal Iraq ’s oil and the Pentagon military analyst program .
Brewer accused Perino of ducking his questions , until she was “ shamed ” by other White House correspondents to call on him .

WASHINGTON -- A
House subcommittee approved legislation Wednesday aimed at forcing college football to switch to a playoff system to determine its national champion , over the objections of some lawmakers who said Congress has meatier targets to tackle .
The bill , which faces steep odds , would ban the promotion of a postseason NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision game as a national championship unless it results from a playoff .
The measure passed by voice vote in a House Energy and Commerce Committee subcommittee , with one audible " no , " from Rep. John Barrow , D - Ga .
" With all due respect , I really think we have more important things to spend our time on , " Barrow said before the vote , although he stressed he did n't like the current Bowl Championship Series , either .
The BCS selections announced last weekend pit two unbeaten teams , No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Texas , in the Jan. 7 national title game .
Three other undefeated teams -- TCU , Cincinnati and Boise State -- will play in a BCS bowl game , but not for the championship .
" What can we say -- it 's December and the BCS is in chaos again , " said the bill 's sponsor , Rep. Joe Barton of Texas , the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
He said the BCS system is unfair and wo n't change unless prompted by Congress .
The legislation , which goes to the full committee , would make it illegal to promote a national championship game " or make a similar representation , " unless it results from a playoff .

Design Software - A Focus on Capabilities
Design Softwares are developed so that the output of a software analysis consists of smaller problems can be solved .
Additionally , the analysis should not be designed very differently across diverse team members or groups .
In contrast , the design focuses on capabilities and thus multiple designs for the similar problem can and will exist .
Depending on the environment , the design often varies , whether it is twisted from reliable frameworks or implemented with appropriate design patterns .
Design examples include operation systems , WebPages , mobile devices or even the innovative cloud computing paradigm .
Software design is both a process and a model .
Design Software Architecture – High - Level Structures
Software architecture refers to the high - level structure of a software system , the regulation of generating such structures , and the documentation of these structures .
These structures are needed to rationale about the software system .
Every structure comprises software elements , relations among them , and properties of both elements and dealings .
The architecture of a software system is a fable , analogous to the architecture of a building .
Design Software architecture is about making primary structural choices which are expensive to change once implemented .
Software architecture choices include precise structural options from possibilities in the design of software .
For example , the systems that proscribed the space shuttle launch medium had the necessity of being very fast and very reliable .
Therefore , a suitable real - time computing language would need to be selected .
Additionally , to satisfy the need for reliability the choice could be made to have numerous redundant and independently produced copies of the program , and to lope these copies on independent hardware while cross-checking results .
Key Design Principles
When getting started with your design , keep in mind the chief principles that will help you to generate an architecture that adheres to proven principles , reduce costs and maintenance necessities , and promotes usability and extendibility .
The key principles are :
Separation of concerns :
Split your application into different features with as little overlap in functionality as likely .
The important factor is the minimization of interaction points to attain high cohesion and low coupling .
However , separating functionality at the wrong boundaries can upshot in high coupling and complexity between features even though the contained functionality within a feature does not considerably overlap .

The important factor is the minimization of interaction points to attain high cohesion and low coupling .
However , separating functionality at the wrong boundaries can upshot in high coupling and complexity between features even though the contained functionality within a feature does not considerably overlap .
Single Responsibility principle : Each component or module should be liable for only a specific feature or functionality , or aggregation of consistent functionality .
: Each component or module should be liable for only a specific feature or functionality , or aggregation of consistent functionality .
Principle of Least Knowledge :
Also identified as the Law of Demeter or LoD , a component or item should not know about internal details of further components or objects .
: Also identified as the Law of Demeter or LoD , a component or item should not know about internal details of further components or objects .
Do n’t repeat yourself ( DRY ) :
You should only call for to specify intent in single place .
For example , in terms of application design , precise functionality should be implemented in only one component ; the functionality should not be replaced in any other component .
: You should only call for to specify intent in single place .
For example , in terms of application design , precise functionality should be implemented in only one component ; the functionality should not be replaced in any other component .
Minimize upfront design :
Only design what is essential , in some cases , you may require upfront comprehensive design and testing if the outlay of development or a failure in the design is very elevated .
In other cases , especially for agile development , you can evade big design upfront ( BDUF ) .
If your application requirements are blurred , or if there is a possibility of the design evolving over time , keep away from making a large design effort prematurely .

Gnome-o- gram : Mortgage Bailout , Roman Style
There is but scant innovation in human folly .
Every generation convinces itself that it 's living in a “ new era ” , where “ all the rules have changed ” , and consequently stumbles into the same potholes which swallowed countless ancestors .
Knowing some history ( rare today ) and paying serious attention to its lessons ( rare in any age ) is an excellent way to avoid all - too - predictable calamities .
Take the current woes in the credit markets , triggered in part by government meddling in the mortgage market .
Certainly , this must be an unforeseen consequence of our twenty - first century fibre - optic globally connected financial system , with computer - modeled financial derivatives , risk management strategies , and all the rest of the hooey cooked up by all those bright fellows on Wall Street — how could they have possibly anticipated the mess they were getting us into ?
A.D.
Well , by reading Tacitus , for one thing .
In Book VI of Tacitus describes how runaway mortgage lending , combined with government meddling with interest rates and loan terms resulted in a credit crunch and an eventual collapse in real estate prices .
All of this happened in32 during the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius
Meanwhile a powerful host of accusers fell with sudden fury on the class which systematically increased its wealth by usury in defiance of a law passed by Caesar the Dictator defining the terms of lending money and of holding estates in Italy , a law long obsolete because the public good is sacrificed to private interest .
The curse of usury was indeed of old standing in Rome and a most frequent cause of sedition and discord , and it was therefore repressed even in the early days of a less corrupt morality .
First , the Twelve Tables prohibited any one from exacting more than 10 per cent . , when , previously , the rate had depended on the caprice of the wealthy .
Subsequently , by a bill brought in by the tribunes , interest was reduced to half that amount , and finally compound interest was wholly forbidden .
A check too was put by several enactments of the people on evasions which , though continually put down , still , through strange artifices , reappeared .
On this occasion , however , Gracchus , the praetor , to whose jurisdiction the inquiry had fallen , felt himself compelled by the number of persons endangered to refer the matter to the Senate .
In their dismay the senators , not one of whom was free from similar guilt , threw themselves on the emperor 's indulgence .
He yielded , and a year and six months were granted , within which every one was to settle his private accounts conformably to the requirements of the law .
Hence followed a scarcity of money , a great shock being given to all credit , the current coin too , in consequence of the conviction of so many persons and the sale of their property , being locked up in the imperial treasury or the public exchequer .
To meet this , the Senate had directed that every creditor should have two - thirds his capital secured on estates in Italy .
Creditors however were suing for payment in full , and it was not respectable for persons when sued to break faith .
So , at first , there were clamorous meetings and importunate entreaties ; then noisy applications to the praetor 's court .
And the very device intended as a remedy , the sale and purchase of estates , proved the contrary , as the usurers had hoarded up all their money for buying land .
The facilities for selling were followed by a fall of prices , and the deeper a man was in debt , the more reluctantly did he part with his property , and many were utterly ruined .
The destruction of private wealth precipitated the fall of rank and reputation , till at last the emperor interposed his aid by distributing throughout the banks a hundred million sesterces , and allowing freedom to borrow without interest for three years , provided the borrower gave security to the State in land to double the amount .
Credit was thus restored , and gradually private lenders were found .
The purchase too of estates was not carried out according to the letter of the Senate 's decree , rigour at the outset , as usual with such matters , becoming negligence in the end .
Translated from the Latin by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb .
Note that even “ evasions ” and “ strange artifices ” ( credit default swaps , anybody ? ) played their part when this whole sordid mess blew up more than twenty centuries ago , and also that the form of the “ bailout ” — injecting liquidity into the banking system — employed by Emperor Tiberius was precisely the same as that cobbled together by the geniuses in charge of things today .

November 15 , 2009
In the wake of the massacre at Fort Hood Texas , two principal theories have emerged to explain the conduct of the accused shooter , identified by the U.S. Army as Major Nidal Malik Hasan , an Army psychiatrist of Jordanian - Palestinian ancestry .
One of these theories is embraced by left liberals and other supporters and acolytes of the Obama regime , and argues that Major Hasan is a sincere and devout Muslim who was the victim of a tragic contradiction between his religious faith and the logic of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , both the heritage of the odious Bush - Cheney regime .
According to this version , Hasan must be viewed as a troubled and tormented individual who “ snapped , ” breaking down psychologically under the stress of his awful predicament .
Here is how Obama summed up this approach : “ Even within the extraordinary military that we have — and I think everybody understands how outstanding the young men and women in uniform are under the most severe stress — there are going to be instances in which an individual cracks . ”
( New York Times , 10 Nov and ember 2009 ) Calling Major Hasan a terrorist amounts , in this view , to racism and vindictive prejudice .
There remains the question of whether Major Hasan ’s psychosis has been artificially produced through a program of brainwashing and heavy - duty “ Clockwork Orange ” psychological manipulation .
The other theory is the one advocated by assorted neocons , reactionaries , Islamophobes and others generally hostile to Obama .
This account maintains that Major Hasan was a homegrown , self - starting Islamic terrorist , trumpeting his devotion to jihad and suicide bombing , seeking to make contact with “ Al Qaeda , ” and generally filled with hate for America , for freedom , and for his fellow soldiers .
In this view , it is only the pervasive political correctness and multicultural obsession of the subversive - riddled and soft on terrorism Obama regime that prevented Major Hasan from being neutralized before he could act , and which prevents Obama and his Democratic allies from telling the truth after the fact .
These views are both superficial , naïve , and inadequate .
[ 1 ]
They amount to two prongs of an articulated campaign of media hysteria and mass manipulation designed on the one hand to prod the dithering Wall Street puppet Obama ­ who is having second thoughts about his own political survival — into an early decision in favor of massive escalation of the war in Afghanistan for the purpose of hastening the breakup of Pakistan , and thus threatening China .
On the other hand , the delirium of Islamophobic hatred being ginned up against Major Hasan by the usual cast of reactionary radio ogres ( Limbaugh , Beck , Hannity , Levin ) seeks to accentuate and strengthen the racist and xenophobic elements in the militant anti-Obama opposition , in particular among the Tea Party movement .
The decision to put the infamous Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his confreres on trail in New York City , plus the recent government seizure of numerous US mosques and other buildings on the grounds that they are Iranian assets , also contribute to a growing mood of anti-Moslem hysteria .
This atmosphere is accentuated by the reckless and irresponsible actions of some Moslem groups which happen to be foundation - funded , and must thus be considered as part of the apparatus of US domestic social control .
The media narrative which is now being consolidated a week after the shootings is full of contradictions , embarrassed silences , and absurdities .
A third and distinct approach to this case is therefore required , one which regards Major Hasan as a manipulated patsy in the context of a relatively sophisticated operation mounted by forces within the US intelligence community , using methods and assets which by now ought to have become familiar .
Major Hasan can be seen as a mixture of Lee Harvey Oswald , legendary 9/11 “ suicide pilot ” Mohammed Atta , and Cho Seung - Hui ( the alleged April 2007 Virginia Tech shooter ) .
He also has elements of reputed Robert Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan , and of John Hinckley Jr. , who was involved in an attempt to kill President Reagan ­ both of whom survived the operations in which they were implicated .
He thus represents a new cocktail of patsy ingredients .
Until now , Islamic terrorists had come in collectivist groups , and not alone .
Major Hasan by contrast is a troubled loner in the tradition of Oswald , at the same time that he embodies the religious fanaticism of Atta , along with some of his peccadilloes .
Major Hasan is that novelty , a troubled Islamic fundamentalist loner , even though this is something of a contradiction in terms .
Like Cho , Major Hasan emerges from the psychiatric clinic , in his case as a practicing psychiatrist , but as a shrink with egregious symptoms of his own .
Like all patsies , Major Hasan combines the flamboyant and bombastic proclamation of his personal creed with a seeming immunity from bureaucratic countermeasures which would normally be automatic in shutting him down .
Hasan is revealed as a fanatic , a misfit , and a quasi- psychotic or psychotic mental case in his own right ­ who could not subsist without protectors in high places of the US intelligence community .
In my 2005 book 9/11 Synthetic Terrorism , I argued that 9/11 and other recent terrorist attacks represented provocations cynically orchestrated by privately controlled rogue networks operating within the US intelligence agencies for purposes of mass political manipulation .
Starting from an overview of terrorist actions from the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 through 9/11 , I developed a method of analysis of state - sponsored false flag terrorism which distinguished the roles of fanatical , duped , or psychotic patsies like Oswald , of subversive moles ensconced as officials within government agencies , and of technicians or professional killers who actually create the observed effects , all commanded and coordinated from outside of government , and all operating within the atmosphere of mass brainwashing provided by the Wall Street media .
I also highlighted the role of drills and exercises which are hijacked and turned into real - world terror attacks .
In order to understand the Fort Hood massacre , it is indispensable to apply this method here as well .
TROOPS THOUGHT IT WAS A DRILL ­ DID MAJOR HASAN THINK SO TOO ?
In investigations like this , it is generally a great mistake to fixate on the scapegoat dished up by the mass media .
The more we focus on the Oswald of the day , the less we understand of what actually happened .
Let us turn away from the TV pundits , and listen instead to the eyewitness testimony of the troops who were present at the shootings .
Many of them are on record agreeing that the events of November 5 were initially interpreted by those on the scene as an exercise , as a drill .
Emphasis will be added to bring out this central fact .
From ABC
News we get the following testimony : Solider Keara Bono ‘ told “ Good Morning America ” today that she initially thought the scene of Hasan standing up , praising Allah and starting to fire was a drill .
She did n’t believe it was real even when she felt her own blood , she said .
“ Then I looked to my left and right and I saw people that were bleeding , ” she said .
That ’s when Bono realized that Hasan ’s rampage was n’t a drill . ’
( ABC News GMA ) [ 2 ]
In the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel of 9 November 2009 we find : “ Pfc. Amber Bahr of Random Lake [ Wisconsin ] heard someone yelling and ducked at the sound of gunfire , but she said she thought supervisors at Fort Hood were holding a drill last Thursday .
She did n’t know she was under live fire until she heard people screaming . ” [ 3 ]
This story was based on an interview given to NBC ’s Today show .
CBS
News reported : “ Two days after narrowly escaping death at Fort Hood and just hours after his release from the hospital , Corporal Nathan Hewitt still can’t believe what happened was real .
The survivor spoke to CBS News Correspondent Don Teague about those fateful minutes .
Even after being shot , Hewitt did n’t believe what was happening .
He thought the gunfire was a training exercise and that he ’d been hit by a rubber bullet .
He says other victims thought the same thing . ” [ 4 ]
ABC newsman Bob Woodruff found further corroboration of this general impression when he was allowed to interview shooting victims who were recovering in the hospital : “ For many of the 43 people wounded when an Army psychiatrist allegedly went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood , the scene was unreal — it seemed like something out of a movie .
Maybe it was a drill .
. Capt. Dorrie Carskadon , a combat stress specialist from Wisconsin , who was at Fort Hood training for a deployment to Afghanistan , said she initially thought the shooting was a drill . ” [ 5 ]
Notice that this testimony comes from a field grade officer , a captain .
The Austin television station KXAN provides the following evidence : ‘ Spc. Scott Hamrick and First Sergeant James McLeod made it out of the Soldier Readiness Processing Center alive after some maneuvering to get away from the suspect , Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan .
“ My initial thought is that it was a drill , ” said Hamrick .
“ Because you know you ’re always getting drilled for situations . ”
However , what Hamrick thought was a drill turned out to be something closer to war at home . '[ 6 ]
The Miami Herald furnished this account : ‘ For Skip Blancett , the senior pastor at the First United Methodist Church of Killeen , news of the shooting left him anguishing for hours because his daughter , Hollye Davis , was at a building next door to where the gunman started firing .
She and others were in lockdown for hours .
Without a cellphone , she could n’t call home .
“ They had no idea what was going on ; everyone thought it was a drill at first , ” Blancett said . '[ 7 ]
The idea that the shooting was part of a drill or exercise was so widespread that it had to be expressly countered in the first emergency announcement posted on the Fort Hood web site , which read : “ Effective immediately .
Fort Hood is closed .
Organizations / units are instructed to execute a 100 per cent accountability of all personnel .
This is not a drill .
It is an emergency situation . ” [ 8 ]
Based on this testimony , it seems clear that unannounced , surprise terror drills are standard operating procedure at Fort Hood and probably other military bases as well .
They are frequent enough to be the first thing many soldiers , including at least one officer , thought was happening .
Drills are designed to be as realistic as possible .
But the acme of realism is reality ­ real killing , which can occur through small but decisive changes in the unfolding of the drill .
We may therefore be dealing here with a drill which has been taken live or flipped live , as so often happens in terror incidents . [ 9 ]
This array of evidence allows us to pose the following question :
If so many of the Army personnel on the scene thought at first that the incident was a drill , did Major Hasan also think he was attending a drill ?
Did he imagine that he was going to be an actor playing the assigned role of a member of the terrorist red team in a realistic exercise ?
In other words , was this inept , troubled and quasi-psychotic individual somehow under the impression that he was attending an officially sanctioned exercise of some routine type , until real bullets began to be fired by other more qualified shooters , thus taking the drill live ?
This might also help us to account for the extraordinary intensity of firing at the scene ­ well over 100 rounds .
For this working hypothesis to stand up , we would have to show that there were other gunmen firing ­ gunmen who knew that the drill was turning into a real massacre .
The additional shooters would according to the classification referred to above represent the technicians in this action ­ the trained killers who have the ability to do the things that the patsy is accused of doing .
Interestingly enough , extra gunmen are exactly what we find .
ONE SHOOTER , OR THREE ?
How many shooters were there ?
Early reports indicated that there were at least one , and perhaps two , in addition to Major Hasan .
Dow Jones newswires reported at about 5 PM Eastern Time : “ A second gunman is in custody after a shooting at the Army ’s Fort Hood in Texas in which at least seven people were killed and 12 wounded , reports KCEN - TV of Waco .
The report comes about two hours after a first suspect was captured , shortly after gunfire broke out . ” [ 10 ]
According to the Dow Jones report cited , shooting had occurred in two separate locations on the Fort Hood base : “ The incident reportedly began at Fort Hood ‘s theater and then moved to the Soldier Readiness Processing Center , Killeen City Public Information Officer Hillary Shine told Fox News . ”
According to an AP wire , these facts were also announced by an official Army spokesman at the base : “ The spokesman , Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Banks , says two shooters were apparently involved .
There is no word yet on who they were , nor on identities of the dead .
Banks says the second incident took place at a theater on the sprawling base . ” [ 11 ]
Many of the embarrassing reports about multiple shooters have been purged after the fact from websites , but a few have survived , as in the case of this Wisconsin radio station , where we read that the triple assassin theory had been embraced by the commander of the base : “ Newsradio 620 WTMJ : Lt. General Bob Cone at Fort Hood confirms 12 dead , 31 hurt in shooting .
Soldier gunman killed .
2 others in custody . ” [ 12 ]
During the later afternoon , cable television talked of three shooters , and in the London Daily Mirror account we find : “ Twelve people were killed and 31 wounded when three gunmen in uniform opened fire at the US Army ’s largest armoured base in Texas yesterday .
One gunman was shot by civilian police and the two others held at Fort Hood . ” [ 13 ]
GEN .
CONE BRINGS MAJOR HASAN BACK FROM THE DEAD AFTER 8 HOURS
It was only in the late evening that the official lone assassin version of these events was assembled in another press conference by General Cone held about eight hours after the shooting had started : ” KILLEEN , Texas ( KXAN / AP / MSNBC ) – Twelve died and another 31 were hurt in a mass shooting on Fort Hood that stunned the nation on Thursday .
Accused gunman Major Malik Nidal Hasan is alive and in stable condition , Lt. Gen .
Bob Cone said at a Thursday evening news conference just outside the storied military post – the largest in the United States .
Counter to initial reports , the 39 - year - old psychiatrist – who was thought to be killed by local police – is hospitalized and not expected to die of multiple gunshots wounds sustained during the 1:30 p.m. attack .
The local police officer who allegedly shot Hasan and injured him is in the hospital also in stable condition . ” [ 14 ]
In the course of the day , we had thus gone from three shooters to only one .
The separate shooting incident at the Howze theater on the post reported earlier had also been expunged in the process .
Most remarkable of all was the ability of Major Hasan to come back from the dead after eight hours in which the world had been assured of his demise .
Such resurrection is of course a physical impossibility for mere mortals .
When individuals are alleged to have performed deeds which are physically impossible in the world as we know it , from Oswald ’s feats of shooting to Atta ’s ( and Hani Hjanjour ’s ) feats of flying , we must become suspicious that intelligence agencies are assisting the probable patsies in hidden ways .
Major Hasan is said to have fired more than 100 rounds using the two pistols he is alleged to have carried .
This seems like a lot of shooting for a single person surrounded by scores of trained combat veteran soldiers , even if these latter had not been carrying their usual weapons .
The categorical imperative for every patsy is to get noticed , and to call attention to himself or herself pointedly and repeatedly , by hook or by crook .
They must stand out so much that they will be remembered by many ordinary people after the process of their demonization has been launched .
In order to fulfill their function , patsies must leave a trail of clues and evidence which will tie themselves and the larger target group they supposedly represent to the heinous actions they will shortly be accused of having committed .
Oswald handed out leaflets sympathetic to Cuba and told a television audience that he was a Marxist .
He went to the USSR , and tried to go to Cuba .
Atta cultivated a frightening stare , and took time to argue ostentatiously about a parking place at an airport in Maine while he allegedly thought he was on his way to death .
Major Hasan seems to have some of the same strange proclivities .
On the day of the shooting , Major Hasan made sure there was no doubt about his religious loyalties by donning a trademark “ Islamic ” white robe and skull cap to go to his local Seven - Eleven , where he was sure to be filmed by the security cameras there .
This footage was then played on all the networks for the next 48 hours .
This gesture recalls the Koran Atta left in his car at Boston ‘s Logan airport .
When the FBI located Atta ’s rented car , they found a copy of the Koran , airline schedules , terrorist literature and videotapes , and Atta ’s crudely forged last will and testament in the luggage ­ all obviously and crudely left behind to make the necessary point .
Atta ’s will betrayed the amateurish attempt of some half - baked area specialist to sound Islamic
At Fort Hood , Major Hasan ‘ told a colleague , Col Terry Lee , that he believed Muslims should rise up against American “ aggressors . ” ‘ [ 15 ]
Count de Borchgrave points out that Major Hasan had made at least one overtly ominous statement just before the shooting spree :
‘ As the Virginia - born major told a female neighbor in his apartment complex , “ I ’m going to do good work for God . ” ‘ [ 16 ]
The neighbor would not forget that grim pledge anytime soon .
Major Hasan was suspected of having authored internet postings that compared suicide bombers with soldiers who throw themselves on hand grenades to save others , although here we must be cautious , since these postings could have been made by imposters .
All accounts agree that witnesses heard a shout of “ Allahu Akbar ” just before the firing started .
Less clear is whether these words were spoken by Major Hasan .
And if he did say them , was this a line from the scenario script of a drill ?
MAJOR HASAN’S RANT TO MILITARY DOCTORS : “ WE LOVE DEATH MORE THAN YOU LOVE LIFE ”
The most elaborate attempts by Major Hasan to assert and establish a thoroughly Islamic profile for himself came in the form of a lecture at the Uniformed Service University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda , Maryland .
He was supposed to present a paper on an issue of medical or clinical interest , but instead elected to make a ranting speech about the oppression of Moslems in the US military and the dangerous consequences this was sure to have .
Here are some relevant parts of the account published by Dana Priest in the Washington Post : ‘ The Army psychiatrist believed to have killed 13 people at Fort Hood warned a roomful of senior Army physicians a year and a half ago that to avoid “ adverse events , ” the military should allow Muslim soldiers to be released as conscientious objectors instead of fighting in wars against other Muslims .
The title of Hasan ’s PowerPoint presentation was “ The Koranic World View As It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military . ”
Under a slide titled “ Comments , ” he wrote : “ If Muslim groups can convince Muslims that they are fighting for God against injustices of the ‘ infidels ’ ; ie : enemies of Islam , then Muslims can become a potent adversary ie : suicide bombing , etc. ” [ sic ]
The last bullet point on that page reads simply : “ We love death more then [ sic ] you love life ! ”
Under the “ Conclusions ” page , Hasan wrote that “ Fighting to establish an Islamic State to please God , even by force , is condoned by the Islam , ” and that “ Muslim Soldiers should not serve in any capacity that renders them at risk to hurting / killing believers unjustly — will vary ! ”
The final page , labeled “ Recommendation , ” contained only one suggestion : “ Department of Defense should allow Muslims [ sic ]
Soldiers the option of being released as ‘ Conscientious objectors ’ to increase troop morale and decrease adverse events . ” ‘ [ 17 ]
Objections were made to Major Hasan ’s tirade : “ Students on a 2007 - 2008 master ’s programme at a military college revealed that they had complained to faculty about Major Hasan ’s alleged anti-American views .
They included him giving a presentation that justified suicide bombing and telling classmates that Islamic law trumped the US Constitution . ” [ 18 ]
But nothing serious happened .
According to National Public Radio ’s Joseph Shapiro , the worst thing that happened was that Hasan was given a period of probation early in his postgraduate work because of his insistence on seeking to convert to Islam some coworkers and the soldiers he was treating .
The title of this speech , “ The Koranic World View As It Relates to Muslims in the U.S. Military , ” sounds very academic and not very Islamic at all .
It seems to imply that Islam and the Koran are just a world view or Weltanschauung among others .
It falls far short of the basic Islamic fundamentalist claim to represent the authority of absolute revealed truth .
We are reminded of Mohamed Atta ’s will and instructions for his own funeral , which Islamic experts have found to be replete with elements and formulations utterly alien to Islam .
The categorical imperative for every mole is to protect the relevant patsies from investigation or arrest until the terror event has occurred and it is time to round the patsies up as scapegoats .
The part about “ We love death more then [ sic ] you love life ! ” is blatant ID format “ Al Qaeda ” speak , and in a military setting this speech would normally be more than enough to trigger a probing investigation into Major Hasan ’s activities and belief structure .
But no serious consequences ensued , suggesting that Major Hasan was an asset who was being protected for the sake of some future mission which he was being groomed and prepared to perform .
Thus , while Hasan ’s medical superiors were aware of him as a problem case , they chose to do nothing : a ” group of doctors overseeing Nidal Malik Hasan ’s medical training discussed concerns about his overly zealous religious views and strange behavior months before the Army major was accused of opening fire on soldiers and civilians at Fort Hood , Texas .
Doctors and staff overseeing Hasan ’s training viewed him at times as belligerent , defensive and argumentative in his frequent discussions of his Muslim faith , a military official familiar with several group discussions about Hasan said .
As a psychiatrist in training , Hasan was characterized in meetings as a mediocre student and lazy worker , a matter of concern among the doctors and staff at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences military medical school , the official said . ”
( AP , 11 November 2009 ) [ 19 ]
At the same time , the training of a psychiatrist involves intensive psychological profiling an depth analysis by professors as an integral part of the training .
As a shrink among shrinks , Major Hasan ’s psychology must have been well known to the military doctors who were his professors .
This opens up an avenue for manipulating and controlling him which has not been present in other terrorism cases .
Did one or more of the Major Hasan ’s analysts have a sideline as terrorist controllers and mind benders working for the rogue network ?
WALTER REED OFFICIALS ASKED : “ WAS HASAN PSYCHOTIC ? ”
A more explicit and illuminating version of Major Hasan ’s psychiatric review comes from National Public Radio .
Here we find that he was variously evaluated as “ disconnected , aloof , paranoid , belligerent , and schizoid . ”
This raised the problem of whether he was actually psychotic and thus suffering from severe mental illness : ‘ Starting in the spring of 2008 , key officials from Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences held a series of meetings and conversations , in part about Maj. Nidal Hasan .
One of the questions they pondered : Was Hasan psychotic ?
Both fellow students and faculty were deeply troubled by Hasan ’s behavior – which they variously called disconnected , aloof , paranoid , belligerent , and schizoid .
The officials say he antagonized some students and faculty by espousing what they perceived to be extremist Islamic views .
His supervisors at Walter Reed had even reprimanded him for telling at least one patient that “ Islam can save your soul . ”
Hasan spent six years as a psychiatrist at Walter Reed , beginning in 2003 , and he had a fellowship at USUHS until shortly before he went to Fort Hood in the summer of 2009 .
A committee of officials from both places regularly meets once a month to discuss pressing topics surrounding the psychiatrists and other mental health professionals who train and work at the institutions .
Participants in the spring meeting and in subsequent conversations about Hasan reportedly included John Bradley , chief of psychiatry at Walter Reed ; Robert Ursano , chairman of the Psychiatry Department at USUHS ; Charles Engel , assistant chair of the Psychiatry Department and director of Hasan ’s psychiatry fellowship ; Dr. David Benedek , another assistant chairman of psychiatry at USUHS ; psychiatrist Carroll J. Diebold ; and Scott Moran , director of the psychiatric residency program at Walter Reed , according to colleagues and other sources who monitor the meetings . '[ 20 ]
Why did this august panel not take any practical steps in regard to Major Hasan ?
This account blames bureaucratic inertia and political correctness founded on the fear of seeming to discriminate against Moslems .
But these reasons need to be supplemented with another possibility : that a witting mole ( or moles ) was shielding Major Hasan from any sanctions so he could go on to greater things as a witting or unwitting agent provocateur and patsy .
One comment included in this NPR account was especially ominous : “ Another official reportedly wondered aloud to colleagues whether Hasan might be capable of committing fratricide , like the Muslim U.S. Army sergeant who , in 2003 , killed two fellow soldiers and injured 14 others by setting off grenades at a base in Kuwait . ”
Despite such real and present dangers , nothing was done .
MAJOR HASAN’S MOSQUE LINKED TO THE CIA’S CHECHEN TERRORISTS
[ efoods ]
In recent years , Major Hasan attended a mosque in Silver Spring Maryland which hosted fundraising for CIA covert operations against Russia : “ Imam Faizul Khan ministered to Hasan when he worshiped at the Muslim Community Center in Silver Spring , Md .
The Muslim Community Center has held fundraisers for Chechen jihadists , and promotes on its website a Shariah - based financial product offered by a Muslim Brotherhood front group under federal investigation . ” [ 21 ]
The essential element here is that the mosque was raising money for Chechen rebellion , which is notoriously a strategic tool of the United States and the United Kingdom against Russia .
Perhaps such a fundraiser for Chechen terrorism might have been attended by Ilyas Achmadov , the de facto ambassador of the leading CIA - backed Chechen organization implicated in terrorism , who lives in Washington , DC at US taxpayer expense thanks to his sponsorship by Zbigniew Brzezinski , and the gray eminence of Obama ’s foreign policy team .
The impression that Major Hasan was in fact a protected patsy is strengthened by reports that he frequented mosques which have figured in previous intelligence operations , and that he was in contact with an American - born Muslim cleric now living in Yemen who currently plays the role of one of the most bombastic agent provocateurs operating under the umbrella designation of “ al Qaeda . ”
ANWAR AWLAKI , PATSY MINDER FOR HANI HANJOUR OF 9/11 INFAMY
In earlier years , Hasan had worshipped with his mother at the radical Dar al - Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church , Va. During 2001 , he worshipped there alongside some of the 9/11 patsies , specifically those alleged to have been aboard the aircraft which allegedly struck the Pentagon .
The dominant figure of this mosque was at that time a certain Anwar Awlaki or Awlaqi , who must be regarded as an intelligence agency operative and patsy - minder , the latter because of his role in supervising the alleged Pentagon suicide pilot Hani Hanjour and other 9/11 figures who frequented the mosque .
Hanjour , whose purported feats of flying would if true have placed him above the Red Baron in the Valhalla of air aces , was in fact a pathetic and clumsy nebbish .
Just after the Fort Hood massacre , Awlaki used his website for a bombastic endorsement of Major Hasan and the Texas slaughter , evidently designed with Pavlovian technique to goad Islamophobic US reactionaries into a frenzy and give the radio ogres much grist for their mill .
Here is the relevant report from the New York Times : ‘ Mr. Awlaki , an American citizen born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents , wrote on Monday on his English - language website that Mr. Hasan was “ a hero . ”
The cleric said , “ He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people . ”
He added , “ The only way a Muslim could Islamically justify serving as a soldier in the U.S.
Army is if his intention is to follow the footsteps of men like Nidal . ” ‘[ 22 ]
This was a piece of crude manipulation , and at the same time an engraved invitation to an anti-Moslem pogrom .
The report went on : ‘ But since leaving the U.S. in 2002 for London , and later Yemen , Mr. Awlaki has become a prominent proponent of militant Islam via his Web site , www.anwar-alawlaki.com.
The Toronto Star reported last month that a group of young Canadians charged with plotting attacks against military and government targets were inspired , in part , by listening to Mr. Awlaki ’s sermons online .
In 2000 and 2001 , Mr. Awlaki served as an imam at two mosques in the United States frequented by three future 9/11 hijackers .
Khalid al - Midhar and Nawaf al - Hazmi attended the Rabat mosque in San Diego , where Mr. Awlaki later admitted meeting Hazmi several times but “ claimed not to remember any specifics of what they discussed , ” according to the report of the national 9/11 commission .
Both Hazmi and another hijacker , Hani Hanjour , later attended the Dar al Hijra mosque in Falls , Church , Virginia after Mr. Awlaki had moved there in early 2001 .
The 9/11 commission report expressed “ suspicion ” about the coincidence , but said its investigators were unable to find Mr. Awlaki in Yemen to question him . ' [ 23 ]
We should notice the nice plug given here to Awlaki ’s web site by the New York Times ; his site traffic is sure to benefit enormously .
Major Hasan had taken care to establish his devotion and fealty to Awlaki during the time leading up to the massacre .
He left no doubt that he was a disciple of Awlaki : ‘ Hasan ’s eyes “ lit up ” when he mentioned his deep respect for al - Awlaki ’s teachings , according to a fellow Muslim officer at the Fort Hood base in Texas , the scene of Thursday ’s horrific shooting spree . '[ 24 ]
Major Hasan , it transpired , had also been exchanging emails with the fiery double agent he so much lionized ; the imam - provocateur had fled abroad after 9/11 and was now operating under “ al Qaeda ” cover from Yemen .
According to one report : “ two government officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case on the record , said the Washington - based joint terrorism task force overseen by the FBI was notified of communications between Hasan and a radical imam overseas , and the information was turned over to a Defense Criminal Investigative Service employee assigned to the task force .
The communications were gathered by investigators beginning in December 2008 and continuing into early this year .
That Defense investigator wrote up an assessment of Hasan after reviewing the communications and the Army major ’s personnel file , according to these officials .
The assessment concluded Hasan did not merit further investigation – in large part because his communications with the imam were centered on a research paper about the effects of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and the investigator determined that Hasan was in fact working on such a paper , the officials said .
The disclosure Tuesday of the defense investigator ’s role indicated that the U.S. military was aware of worrisome behavior by the massacre suspect long before the attack .
Just hours later , a senior defense official , also demanding anonymity , directly contradicted that notion .
The senior defense official said neither the Army nor any other part of the Defense Department knew of Hasan ’s contacts with any Muslim extremists .
Military , law enforcement and intelligence agencies also are defending themselves against tough questions about what each of them knew about Hasan before he allegedly opened fire in a crowded room at the huge military base in Texas . ” [ 25 ]
AWLAKI HELPED ENTRAP FORT DIX SIX , TORONTO DUPES
The decision of the Army to ignore Major Hasan ’s correspondence with Awlaki is all the more astounding given Awlaki ’s status as one of the premier terror impresarios of the age operating under Islamic fundamentalist cover .
More than a mere ideologue , he is a recruiter and an entrepreneur of terror .
His web site would not survive five minutes of concerted US cyber - attacks , but he is not disturbed in his role as a pied piper of patsies .
In particular , Awlaki and his work were used to motivate and encourage groups of mentally impaired and suggestible young dupes who were entrapped into “ terrorist plots ” by busy FBI and Canadian RCMP agents during recent years , thus keeping the boogey man of Islamic terrorism in the public eye .
‘ In addition to his contacts with Major Nidal Hasan , the radical American cleric , Anwar al Awlaki , served as an inspiration for men convicted in terror plots in Toronto and Fort Dix , New Jersey , according to government officials and court records reviewed by ABCNews.com .
Despite his ties to other plots , including the one against the Army post at Fort Dix , some 20 e-mails between Awlaki and Major Hasan were dismissed as “ innocent ” by a military investigator working on the FBI ’s Joint Terror Task Force in Washington , D.C … .
” He is not just a proselytizer but someone who is operational , with deep and longstanding connections to al Qaeda and has been for some time , ” said a former senior American intelligence official who had access to classified information .
Awlaki was characterized in court testimony as an inspiration by two of six Muslim immigrants convicted on conspiracy and other charges in a plot to kill U.S. military personnel at Fort Dix .
In Toronto , members of the so - called Toronto 18 watched videos of Awlaki at a makeshift training camp where they allegedly planned an attack on the Canadian parliament and prime minister . '[ 26 ]
YET ANOTHER DELIBERATE FBI SNAFU
Just as in the 9/11 instance , the scandalous failure to connect the dots and round up the patsies was due to the non-feasance and malfeasance of the FBI , the criminally negligent agency which , according to 9/11 commission co-chair Gov. Thomas Kean , “ failed and failed and failed , ” but nevertheless escaped breakup after 9/11 .
Starting in 1996 , the FBI had been aware that international terrorists were making a show of learning to fly passenger jets at U.S. flight schools , but took no action .
According to a press report , the failure to inform Major Hasan ’s superiors was the direct and specific responsibility of the FBI : “ The Pentagon said it was never notified by US intelligence agencies that they had intercepted e-mails between of the alleged Fort Hood shooter and an extremist imam until after last week ’s bloody assaults , raising new questions about whether the government could have helped prevent the attack .
a person familiar with the matter said a Pentagon worker on the terrorism task force overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigation was told about the intercepted e-mails several months ago .
But members of the terror task forces are n’t allowed to share such information with their agencies , unless they get permission from the FBI , which leads the task force .
In this case , the Pentagon worker , an employee from the Defense Criminal Investigations Service , , helped make the assessment that Major Hasan was n’t a threat , and the FBI ’s ‘ procedures for sharing the information were never used , ’ said the person familiar with the matter . ” [ 27 ]
Those involved in this decision by FBI and the Defense Department need to be probed as possible terror moles .
This is reminiscent of the FBI ’s Dave Frasca , who could not assemble and act on the pre-9/11 intelligence he had on his desk .
This was a new chapter of the story of FBI sabotage told by Colleen Rowley and documented at the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui in 2006 .
If the FBI had rounded up the 9/11 patsies , the operation could not have occurred ­ not because the patsies were going to fly planes into buildings by themselves , but because the jailing of patsies before the fact would have made the targeting of the Moslem world impossible .
In this sense , the same FBI rogue networks which made9/11 possible are still in place and still effectively sabotaging effective law enforcement .
MAJOR HASAN’S SECURITY CLEARANCE : SECRET
Major Hasan reportedly has a security clearance which allows him to receive secret information .
All US Army officers are required to have at minimum a secret - level security clearance , and Major Hasan ’s clearance might even have been at the more stringent top secret level .
All indications are that Major Hasan ’s clearance was never reviewed , despite his ostentatious antics .
Major Hasan ’s aberrant behavior should at the very least have put him in line for a National Agency Check or NAC .
Newsweek writes that ‘ extended NACs , which the officials indicated are more likely for would - be military officers , would include checks of local and state police records in jurisdictions where the subject lived , as well as credit - bureau and financial - record checks .
In the event that some kind of “ derogatory ” information turns up during these checks , one of the officials said , field investigators are likely to be sent out to conduct interviews , and the procedure could also include an interview with the security - clearance applicant . '[ 28 ]
This puts Major Hasan in a very special category , subject to special rules and surveillance which are enforced by specific agencies , and not by military physicians of whatever rank .
Perhaps the most direct evidence that Major Hasan was a protected patsy was the fact that he could make incendiary speeches and correspond with self - proclaimed “ al Qaeda ” firebrands without having his security clearance reviewed , to say nothing of lifted .
As a well informed Stratfor letter to the editor posting points out : “ The contacting of a foreign Islamic militant who openly espouses killing of Americans is , in and of itself , is a violation of U.S. security regulations with respect to individuals with security clearances .
Hasan ’s foreign contact should have been reported through the chain - of - command to his commander .
Lt. Gen. Cone , in consultation with his G - 2 , Counter - Intelligence Staff Officer , Personnel Security Officer and the CID , could have immediately suspended Maj .
Hasan ’s security clearance subject to a local AR 15 - 6 investigation .
Lt. Gen .
Cone is responsible for force protection of assets in his command , not a DoD criminal investigator .
A minimally competent investigation would have uncovered other comments and actions that would probably have resulted in adverse command action on Maj .
Hasan ’s security clearance and possibly led to charges being brought for conduct unbecoming an officer . ” [ 29 ]
But the usual rules were suspended for Majopr Hasan , indicating that he belonged to a special class of persons ­ patsies who were being groomed for future actions and therefore had to be kept out of trouble .
LIKE ATTA AND KSM , THE DEVOUT MAJOR HASAN LIKES STRIP CLUBS
Thanks to the investigative work of Daniel Hopsicker , it has been revealed that key 9/11 figure Mohammed Atta was no devout and puritanical Moslem , but a hedonist .
The legendary Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( KSM ) , touted by the controlled media as the “ 9/11 mastermind , ” was also devoted to alcohol , floozies , and nightlife .
It is striking that Major Hasan , allegedly a rigid and doctrinaire Moslem , also conforms to this model .
Patsies working for or manipulated by the de facto Islamic fundamentalist directorate of Anglo - American intelligence seem to share the same decadent western foibles .
One of Major Hasan ’s favorite relaxations was to attend the local strip club : ‘ Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan came into the Starz strip club not far from the base at least three times in the past month , the club ’s general manager , Matthew Jones , told FoxNews.com .
Army investigators building their case against Hasan plan to interview Jones soon .
“ The last time he was here , I remember checking his military ID at the door , and he paid his $ 15 cover and stayed for six or seven hours , ” Jones , 37 , said .
Jennifer Jenner , who works at Starz using the stage name Paige , said Hasan bought a lap dance from her two nights in a row .
She said he paid $ 50 for a dance lasting three songs in one of the club ’s private rooms on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30 .
She recalled that he arrived at about 6:30 p.m. and stayed until 2 a.m .
She said he brought in a six pack of light beer , took only a few sips from one can and gave the rest to the strippers .
“ He preferred the blondes , ” said Jenner , whose hair was dyed blond at the time .
“ He said he was a medic and that he was being deployed soon , but mostly he wanted to ask us questions . ” ‘ [ 30 ]
Needless to say , alcohol and strippers do not an Islamic fundamentalist make .
As for prominent 9/11 figure Atta , he was in fact not a practicing Moslem at all , but rather a devotee of alcohol , cocaine , call girls , and pork chops .
Like Major Hasan , Atta preferred blondes , specifically pink strawberry ones .
He cohabited with a 22 - year old call girl who may also have been a sex operative for one of the intelligence agencies .
Amanda Keller worked for a “ lingerie model escort service ” in Sarasota called Fantasies & Lace .
Atta loved to attend topless bars , where he would order lap dances at the Pink Pony , or else stuff twenty dollar bills into the g-strings of the dancers at the Olympic Garden nightclub .
He was also a regular at Harry ’s Bar in Naples .
Atta ’s favorite nightspots were the Cheetah in Venice , and Margarita Maggie ’s in Sarasota .
FBI investigators showing around pictures of Atta after 9/11 found that he had been in a bar drinking Stolichnaya vodka for three hours quite recently ; with him was accused suicide pilot Marwan al Shehhi , who preferred rum .
Atta was also a frequent cocaine user .
He would habitually snort rows of cocaine with a dollar bill .
Are we therefore dealing here with two patsies from the same levy , two parallel patsy lives ?
FROM ARMY - MCCARTHY TO ARMY - LIEBERMAN
The reactionaries of today yearn for the days of Senator Joe McCarthy ( R - Wisconsin ) , who launched his campaign of red-baiting and witch - hunting some six decades ago .
At the height of the Cold War , McCarthy launched the hysterical charge that the US Army had been massively infiltrated by agents of the international communist conspiracy .
This led to the infamous and protracted Army - McCarthy hearings in the Senate , during which McCarthy ’s influence reached its demagogic apex .
Today , the neocons are still full of rancor and resentment over their wholesale ouster from the government through the end of the Bush - Cheney era , and the ascendancy of the Brzezinski - Nye - Soros faction of liberal imperialists who control Obama .
Immediately after the shootings .
Now , Senator Joe Lieberman has announced that he will use his homeland security subcommittee to investigate the failure of the intelligence agencies to connect the dots in the Fort Hood incident .
Already , neocon web sites are contending that the US Army of the Obama era is thoroughly infiltrated by Islamic fundamentalists favorable to terrorism .
Lieberman says he wants to know how the Army missed numerous warning signs about Hasan ’s radical views .
The Army - Lieberman hearings may soon launch an anti-Moslem witch hunt in the US military , fulfilling much neocon nostalgia .
The best approach would be to empanel a genuinely independent board of inquiry to investigate the Fort Hood massacre .
Care should be taken to avoid the begging of the question and the blatant conflicts of interest which made the recent Kean - Hamilton 9/11 commission such a mockery .
Care should also be taken to keep the inevitable Lee Hamilton out of any board of inquiry , given his wretched track record of cover - up and misprision .
FORT HOOD MOSLEM CLERIC TO MAJOR HASAN : “ THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU ”
The London Daily Telegraph interviewed Osman Danquah , a local Moslem clergyman , who had contact with Major Hasan .
Osman Danquah had come to the conclusion that Major Hasan had debilitating mental problems , and was not suitable for any leadership roles ­ even though he was an Army officer of the middle rank .
Citing several sources , this paper writes : ‘ What does seem clear is that the army missed an increasing number of red flags that Hasan was a troubled and brooding individual within its ranks .
“ I was shocked but not surprised by news of Thursday ’s attack , ” said Dr Val Finnell , a fellow student on a public health course in 2007 - 08 who heard Hasan equate the war on terrorism to a war on Islam .
Another student had warned military officials that Hasan was a “ ticking time bomb ” after he reportedly gave a presentation defending suicide bombers .
Osman Danquah , the co-founder of the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen , said Hasan never expressed anger toward the army or indicated any plans for violence .
But he said that , at their second meeting , Hasan seemed almost incoherent .
“ I told him , ‘ There ’s something wrong with you ’ .
I did n’t get the feeling he was talking for himself , but something just did n’t seem right . ”
He was sufficiently troubled that he recommended the centre reject Hasan ’s request to become a lay Muslim leader at Fort Hood . '[ 31 ]
The pathos Major Hasan ’s existence is perhaps most clearly portrayed in his unsuccessful effort to find a wife of his own faith : ‘ Relatives said that the death of Hasan ’s parents , in 1998 and 2001 , turned him more devout .
“ After he lost his parents he tried to replace their love by reading a lot of books , including the Koran , ” his uncle Rafiq Hamad said .
“ He did n’t have a girlfriend , he did n’t dance , he did n’t go to bars . ”
His failed search for a wife seemed to haunt Hasan .
At the Muslim Community Centre in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring , he signed up for an Islamic matchmaking service , specifying that he wanted a bride who wore the hijab and prayed five times a day . ”
Major Hasan returned repeatedly and obsessively to the same theme , according to a another acquaintance : “ Adnan Haider , a retired professor of statistics , recalled how at their first meeting last year , a casual introduction after Friday prayers , Hasan immediately asked the academic if he knew “ a nice Muslim girl ” he could marry .
“ It was a strange thing to ask someone you have met two seconds before .
It was clear to me he was under pressure , you could just see it in his face , ” said Prof Haider , 74 , who used to work at Georgetown University in Washington .
“ You could see he was lonely and did n’t have friends . [ 32 ]
WAS MAJOR HASAN BRAINWASHED ?
Given the accumulated evidence that Major Hasan was possibly psychotic , there remains the question of whether this psychosis might have been endogenous and due to natural and spontaneous causes , or whether it had been artificially produced in him through a program of brainwashing and heavy - duty “ Clockwork Orange ” psychological manipulation by others .
We cannot exclude the possibility that Major Hasan went out on November 5 consciously determined to kill , and may also have discharged his weapons .
We thus have two possible scenarios : on the one hand Major Hasan the duped patsy caught totally by surprise when the shooting started , and on the other , Major Hasan the psychotic and criminally insane killer who possessed the will , if not necessarily the ability , for serious shooting .
There may be evidence for both scenarios ..
We should also point out that seeing Major Hasan is a psychotic killer in his own right does not in any way rule out the presence of additional and more capable shooters .
We are reminded here of the case of Sirhan Sirhan , who appears to have fired at Robert Kennedy , but who also appears to have received a powerful assist from some other as yet unidentified more expert shooter who may have actually fired the lethal bullet .
MAJOR HASAN’S VIRGINIA TECH CONNECTION
Where would Major Hasan have been brainwashed ?
An obvious place to look would be the precincts of Virginia Tech , the home of Cho Seung - Hui , the alleged mass killer of 32 students and professors along with himself in April 2007 .
This incident involves far too many unanswered questions to be addressed in detail here .
In any case , the fact that Major Hasan graduated from the alma mater of Cho should be enough by itself to raise some red flags .
We should also recall that several additional homicides have occurred in and around Virginia Tech during the last year .
In January 2009 , a Virginia Tech doctoral student beheaded a fellow student in a campus cafe .
In this incident , a female graduate student who had just arrived from China was killed when another graduate student she knew attacked her with a knife and decapitated her . [ 33 ]
Beheadings are rare on American college campuses even today , so this is an extraordinary event indeed .
In August 2009 , two Virginia Tech University students were found murdered at a Jefferson National Forest campground that is a popular hangout for students .
The bodies of David Lee Metzler , 19 , of Lynchburg and Heidi Lynn Childs , 18 , of Forest were found by a passerby . [ 34 ]
So what in the world is going on in or near Blacksburg , Virginia ?
The report on the Virginia Tech slayings prepared by a special commission set up by Virginia Governor Tim Kane covers up the failure of mental health professionals in and around Virginia Tech to take effective action in regard to Cho , whom they had nevertheless recognized to be a profoundly disturbed and potentially highly dangerous personality .
This report commits the usual fallacy of petition principi , begging the question , and assumes from the start that Cho was the sole shooter . [ 35 ]
Because of this failure to account for numerous salient features of the Cho incident , this entire case must continue to be classified as unsolved .
We must therefore conclude this essay merely by citing one of the many clues which the Virginia investigation chose to ignore , but which might begin to account for the extraordinary number of homicides observed in the area of Blacksburg Virginia .
As a somewhat obscure website alleges in an unconfirmed report , “ Blacksburg , VA houses a US government ABOVE TOP SECRET underground laboratory ( in the side of a local Blacksburg mountain ) that develops in conjunction with DARPA [ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ] , weapons such as human robotic mind control programming . ” [ 36 ]
Does such a facility exist , and what does it do ?
At this point , any further comment would be pure speculation .
We cannot be optimistic that , should he survive , a future trial of Major Hasan will clear up these questions , any more than criminal trials established the real facts in the cases of Sirhan Sirhan , Hinckley , McVeigh , or John Allen Muhammad .
What does appear confirmed as of now is the existence of a mutating model of terrorism alongside the large - scale 9/11 or WMD paradigms of false flag manipulation seen and propagandized during the last decade .
In this sense , Major Hasan represents the evolution of the figures of Cho , and also of Steven P. Kazmierczak , the Northern Illinois University shooter of February 2008 .
As I wrote last year , “ The new model is Virginia Tech gunman Cho , a mentally disturbed or brainwashed mass killer .
Another case was that of Steven P. Kazmierczak , who in mid-February 2008 shot 21 people and killed five of them at Northern Illinois University in Dekalb .
Kazmierczak was described as being intensely concerned with “ corrections , political violence , and peace and social justice . ” [ 37 ]
Will the American public ever learn to see through and reject false flag operations , as many Spaniards were able to do after the Madrid bombs ?
Will Americans ever swear off the dangerous habit of being duped ?
Will opinion leaders ever master the rather elementary methods of rogue network , false - flag terrorism ?
Until this occurs and the gullibility of the public is reduced , such operations are likely to continue on scales both small and large , with incalculable consequences for the future of humanity .
[ 1 ]
Another concept asserts that the 13 Army personnel were killed during the suppression of a mutiny occasioned by the overstretch of US forces caused by Obama ’s contination of the Iraq war and escalation of the Afghan war .
Almost a week after the massacre , no direct substantiation for this idea has emerged .

Last year the UK government reclassified cannabis from a class C to a class B drug , partly out of concerns that cannabis , especially the more potent varieties , may increase the risk of schizophrenia in young people .
But the evidence for the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia or psychosis remains controversial .
A new study has determined that it may be necessary to stop thousands of cannabis users in order to prevent a single case of schizophrenia .
Scientists from Bristol , Cambridge and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine took the latest information on numbers of cannabis users , the risk of developing schizophrenia , and the risk that cannabis use causes schizophrenia to estimate how many cannabis users may need to be stopped to prevent one case of schizophrenia .
The study found it would be necessary to stop 2800 heavy cannabis users in young men and over 5000 heavy cannabis users in young women to prevent a single case of schizophrenia .
Among light cannabis users , those numbers rise to over 10,000 young men and nearly 30,000 young women to prevent one case of schizophrenia .
That 's just part of the story .
Interventions to prevent cannabis use typically do not succeed for every person who is treated .
Depending on how effective an intervention is at preventing cannabis use , it would be necessary to treat even higher numbers of users to achieve the thousands of successful results necessary to prevent a very few cases of schizophrenia .
Matt Hickman , one of the authors of the report recently published in the journal Addiction , said that " preventing cannabis use is important for many reasons -- including reducing tobacco and drug dependence and improving school performance .
But our evidence suggests that focusing on schizophrenia may have been misguided .
Our research cannot resolve the question whether cannabis causes schizophrenia , but does show that many people need to give up cannabis in order to have an impact on the number of people with schizophrenia .
The likely impact of re-classifying cannabis in the UK on schizophrenia or psychosis incidence is very uncertain . "
So it comes down to this : Joe " I Don't Know How Anybody Can Decide Until You See The Actual Language " Lieberman got his widdle feelings hurt , and so Joe will do anything to get back at the mean liberals who hurt his feelings - even if it means hundreds of thousands of people have to die without health care .
Does n't that make him a sociopath ?
And does n't that make the Democrats co-conspirators ?
The Huffington Post and Roll Call are both reporting that Joe Lieberman notified Harry Reid that he will filibuster health - care reform if the final bill includes an expansion of Medicare .
Previously , Lieberman had been cool to the idea , saying he wanted to make sure it would n't increase the deficit or harm Medicare 's solvency .
That comforted some observers , as the CBO is expected to say it will do neither .
Someone must have given Lieberman a heads - up on that , as he 's decided to make his move in advance of the CBO score , the better to make sure the facts of the policy could n't impede his opposition to it .
To put this in context , Lieberman was originally invited to participate in the process that led to the Medicare buy - in .
His opposition would have killed it before liberals invested in the idea .
Instead , he skipped the meetings and is forcing liberals to give up yet another compromise .
Each time he does that , he increases the chances of the bill 's failure that much more .
And it 's hard to imagine there 's a policy rationale here , as he decided against even bothering to wait for the CBO 's analysis before moving against this idea .
At this point , Lieberman is just torturing liberals .
That is to say , he 's willing to directly cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in order to settle an old electoral score . [...]
The final path would be to try the reconciliation , the parliamentary procedure that would allow Democrats to pass chunks of health care reform by a simple up or down vote .
There are a host of hurdles that come with going down this route , including questions over what , exactly , could be passed .
And at this point both the White House and Reid 's office seem hesitant to use the procedural tool , even after Lieberman 's latest round of opposition .
Reid could also try and find another compromise , but it 's not clear there are many of those left .
And at this point , the underlying dynamic seems to be that Lieberman will destroy any compromise the left likes .
That , in fact , seems to be the compromise : Lieberman will pass the bill if he can hurt liberals while doing so .
From Lieberman 's perspective , the compromise is killing the compromise .
Chris Bowers points out the Democrats have put Holy Joe in this position :
For 35 years the federal government has been well aware – yet publicly denied – that cannabis possesses potentanti- cancer and anti-tumor properties .
Even under the Obama administration , which promised to “ base [ their ] public policies on the soundest of science , ” the myth that pot promotes cancer persists .
In fact , the White House ’s website , whitehousedrugpolicy.gov , presently warns , “ Marijuana has the potential to promote cancer of the lungs and other parts of the respiratory tract . ”
Or not .
In a clinical abstract published online on journal of Cancer Prevention Research website in July , a team of U.S. investigators reported – with absolutely no mainstream media fanfare – that lifetime marijuana use is associated with a “ significantly reduced risk ” of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
Investigators at Rhode Island ’s Brown University , along with researchers at Boston University , Louisiana State University , and the University of Minnesota assessed the lifetime marijuana use habits of 434 cases ( patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from nine medical facilities ) compared to 547 matched controls .
Authors reported , “ After adjusting for potential confounders ( including smoking and alcohol drinking ) , 10 to 20 years of marijuana use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNDCC ) . ”
Perhaps even more notably , subjects who smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol and tobacco ( two known high - risk factors for head and neck cancers ) also experienced a reduced risk of cancer , the study found .
“ Our study suggests that moderate marijuana use is associated with reduced risk of HNSCC , ” investigators concluded .
“ This association was consistent across different measures of marijuana use ( marijuana use status , duration , and frequency of use ) .
…
Further , we observed that marijuana use modified the interaction between alcohol and cigarette smoking , resulting in a decreased HNSCC risk among moderate smokers and light drinkers , and attenuated risk among the heaviest smokers and drinkers . ”
Of course , this is n’t the first time that U.S. investigators have documented an inverse association between pot use and cancer .
A separate 2006 population case - control study , funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and conducted by the University of California at Los Angeles , alsoreported that lifetime use of cannabis was not positively associated with cancers of the lung or aerodigestive tract , and further noted that certain moderate users of the drug experienced a reduced cancer risk compared to non-using controls .
Predictably , the federal government ’s goal when green - lighting the UCLA study was to conclusively establish just the opposite result , as explained recently by its lead researcher Dr. Donald Tashkin .
In an interview with the McClatchy newspaper chain in June , Tashkin admitted that he expected his study would find that pot was associated with “ increased health effects . ”
Instead , he summarized , “ What we found instead was no association ( between marijuana smoking and cancer ) and even a suggestion of some protective effect . ”
Perhaps that explains why Tashkin ’s study , the largest trial of its kind , is inexplicably absent from the White House ’s website .
Tashkin added , “ [ A ] t this point , I ’d be in favor of ( marijuana ) legalization .
I would n’t encourage anybody to smoke any substances .
But I do n’t think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance .
Tobacco smoking causes far more harm .
And in terms of an intoxicant , alcohol causes far more harm ( than marijuana ) . ”
Indeed it does .
In fact , according to the findings of a study published online August 3 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , even moderate alcohol consumption ( defined as six drinks or less per week ) is positively associated with an elevated risk of various cancers – including stomach cancer , rectal cancer , and bladder cancer .
The study is the second to be published this year indicating that those who consume even minor amounts of booze are at increased risk for cancer .
In February , a British study of some 1.3 million women age 50 to 64 reported that imbibing in as little as one alcoholic beverage per day significantly elevated females ’ risk of cancer , particularly breast cancer .
For those of us who have closely studied the physiological effects of pot and alcohol the two substances contrasting association with cancer is n’t surprising .
Ethanol , the psychoactive ingredient in booze , is converted by the body to acetaldehyde , a known carcinogen .
By contrast , the active components in marijuana – known as cannabinoids – are relatively non-toxic and actually mimic chemicals naturally produced by the body ( so - called endocannabinoids ) that are necessary for maintaining one ’s proper health .
Of course , that ’s hardly where the differences between marijuana and alcohol end .
As I write in my new book Marijuana Is Safer : So Why Are We Driving People to Drink ( Chelsea Green Publishing , 2009 ) , alcohol consumption is toxic to cells and healthy organs , can depress the central nervous system ( inducing unconsciousness , coma , and death ) , and is strongly associated with increased risks of injury and acts of violence .
The use of marijuana , on the other hand , is incapable of causing fatal overdose – cannabinoids do not act upon the brain stem – and its use is inversely associatedwith aggression and injury .
Naturally , none of these differences should imply that America should return to the days of alcohol prohibition .
Rather , they should spark a long - overdue dialogue in this country asking why our laws target and prosecute those adults who choose to make the rational choice to relax with a substance that is objectively safer , both to the user and to society as a whole , than alcohol .
Perhaps when the President finishes his beer , he can provide an answer .

Stuttgart goalkeeper Jens Lehmann proved he was n’t a shy guy when he went for a toilet break behind the goal during Stuttgart ’s Champions League victory .
The former Arsenal goalkeeper , confronted with the wee problem of being caught short in front of 40,000 fans nipped over the advertising boards , crouched down and urinated .
When the ball went to his half of the field he jumped back on the goal .
When asked to confirm whether he had been caught short , Lehmann only smiled and said : “ I was more nervous than I have been for a long time . ”
Might be time the 40 - year - old goalkeeper Jens Lehmann goes in for a prostate exam …

The vast majority of us understand that in our legal system everyone deserves a fair trial and the legal representation that makes that possible even if many of us , at a gut level , have a hard time understanding being the individual person who mounts a zealous defense of someone who is factually , if not yet legally , guilty of a horrific crime .
But today I was surprised and almost nauseated to see Wolf Blitzer go in for the most stereotypical , craven and showboating knock - about of the retired JAG officer who ’s representing Nidal Hasan .
( Hasan has a regular military defense counsel as well as a civilian attorney retained by his family . )
It ’s not about ideology certainly or even theories of what ’s right or not about the law .
But we know bullying and pompous showboating when we see it .
The retired JAG , Col. John Galligan , stood up to it very well .
And actually got back in Blitzer ’s face in a way that ’s pretty hard to do and uncommon for a non -TV personality going up against a big shot host .
If we want Hannity , we ’ve got Fox for that .

I guess Scott Kurtz made an impression on one of the industry giants he lampooned at this year 's Harvey Awards .
Turns out after the show in which Scott skewered the work of Neal Adams on stage discovered that Adams has a granddaughter that 's a huge fan of Kurtz ' PvP strip .
So both Adams ' granddaughter and Kurtz persuaded Neal Adams into doing a guest stint during this year 's PvP Christmas story arc …

news Disgruntled Star Editor Takes Constructive Revenge
Earlier this week the Toronto Star announced , among other changes , that it was planning to outsource some one hundred in - house , union editing jobs .
In the press release issued by the union in the wake of the announcement , union chief Maureen Dawson explained that “ Journalism is a collaborative effort , the product of a team of reporters , photographers and editors working in concert to produce the kind of activist agenda that has served Star readers and our community so well for so long …
To remove a critical element of that work is to shortchange everyone who depends on it . ”
Now , one ( apparent ) editor at the Star has decided to show us all the benefits of collaboration .
An extensively marked - up copy of Publisher John Cruickshank ’s internal memo announcing the changes was sent to Torontoist by a self - described “ intermediary who was asked to send this for a friend who works at the Star ” this morning ; it ’s , allegedly , “ the work of a Star editor . ”
Here ’s the whole thing :
As we debate how many more troops to dispatch to Afghanistan , it might be a good time to also debate just how far we ’ve already gone in hiring private contractors to do jobs that the State Department , Pentagon and C.I.A. once did on their own .
A good place to start is with the Middlebury College professor Allison Stanger ’s new book on this subject , “ One Nation Under Contract : The Outsourcing of American Power and the Future of Foreign Policy . ”
Image Thomas L. Friedman Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
Every year , more and more of the core business of national security  diplomacy , development , defense and even intelligence  “ is being shifted into the hands of private contractors  much more than our public realizes , ” Stanger said to me .
One big reason why we ’ve been able to fight the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq with so few allies is because we ’ve basically hired the help .
“ Afghanistan and Iraq , ” explained Stanger , “ are our first contractors ’ wars , differing from previous interventions in their unprecedented reliance on the private sector for all aspects of their execution .
According to the Congressional Research Service , contractors in 2009 accounted for 48 percent of the D.O.D. work force in Iraq and 57 percent in Afghanistan .
And the Pentagon is not the only government agency deploying contractors ; the State Department and Usaid make extensive use of them as well .
Contractors provide security for key personnel and sites , including our embassies ; feed , clothe and house our troops ; train army and police units ; and even oversee other contractors .
Without a multinational contractor force to fill the gap , we would need a draft to execute these twin interventions . ”
Or , we would need real allies .
I am not against outsourcing , improving government efficiency or hiring the best people to perform specialized tasks .
But we ’ve fallen into a pattern of outsourcing some of the very core tasks of government  interrogation , security , democracy promotion .
As more and more of this government work gets contracted and then subcontracted  or as Stanger puts it , “ when money and instructions change hands multiple times in a foreign country ”  the public interest can get lost and abuse and corruption get invited in .
We ’re also building a contractor - industrial - complex in Washington that has an economic interest in foreign expeditions .
Does n’t make it wrong ; does make you want to be watchful .
In 2008 , notes Stanger , roughly 80 percent of the State Department ’s requested budget went out the door in the form of contracts and grants .
The Army ’s primary support contractor in Iraq , KBR , reportedly has some 17,000 direct - hire employees there .
The secret behind the origins of human language may lie in the jungle chatter of a species of monkey , a team of scientists has claimed .
The researchers spent months studying the calls of the Campbell 's monkey , or Cercopithecus campbelli , which lives in the forests of the Tai National Park in the Ivory Coast .
They discovered that the animals not only use distinctive alarm calls to warn of specific predators nearby but can also combine them with other sounds to convey extra information – in much the same way humans use prefixes and suffixes .
The team , led by Professor Klaus Zuberbühler of the University of St Andrews , studied alpha male monkeys whose main task is to look out for potential threats and disturbances before using their calls to alert the rest of their group .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The animals used several instantly recognisable alarm sounds , which the scientists described as " boom " , " krak " and " hok " .
A boom was sounded to warn of a falling branch nearby ; a krak was only sounded when a leopard had been seen ; and a hok was almost exclusively reserved for when a crowned eagle was spotted above the forest canopy .
But further analysis revealed that while booms were unaltered , the monkeys occasionally added an " oo " to kraks and hoks , an alteration which appeared to change what their message .
The krak - oo call seemed to be a general alert sounded to warn about most disturbances , but hok - oo was only used to draw the group 's attention to movement high in the tree tops – the presence of neighbouring groups of monkeys or a sighting of birds , for example .
" If you add this subtle additional oo unit to turn krak into krak - oo , then that call can be given to a whole range of other contexts .
If you take the suffix away then it is almost exclusively a leopard alarm call , " Professor Zuberbühler said .
" What is interesting is that the same acoustic modifier is being used for these calls , and that is really analogous to using a suffix in human language . "
The team , whose findings are published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , also discovered that a boom - boom call was given to encourage other group members to make their way towards the monkey making the sound .
If a pair of booms was followed by some krak - oos , falling trees or branches had been spotted .
Furthermore , two booms followed by a combination of krak - oos and hok - oos was sounded to signal the presence of another group of Campbell 's monkeys .
The scientists said the system " may be the most complex example of ' proto - syntax ' in animal communication known to date " .
A grasp of language has usually been regarded as a uniquely human faculty .
When scientists have tried to teach basic syntax to chimpanzees , the animals seemed unable to string together sounds they learned into a sentence with a more complicated meaning .
Simian speech : A brief dictionary
* " Boom " Look out , falling branch , move !
* " Boom - boom " Come to me
*" Krak " Look out , a leopard !
*" Krak - oo " Watch out , a general warning
*" Hok " There 's a crowned eagle up there
* " Hok - oo " Movement above
* " Boom - boom , krak - oo krak - oo " Look out – falling tree
* " Boom - boom , hok - oo krak - oo hok - oo " We are near another group of monkeys
We noted that all the talk of pitchforks and heads on pikes , the folks at Goldman have taken to arming themselves .
But until recently , the talk was aggressive , but bodily harm was non-existent , save for an isolated ( but very nasty ) beating over phony mortgage mod advice .
But that may be changing , per this update from Raw Story ( hat tip reader John D ) .
The story reports on a rise in violent crimes overall since the downturn , including domestic violence , so it is too early to say whether these incidents are merely in line with general trends , or signal than banksters are starting to become targets :
A Los Angeles lawyer who had represented a failed subprime mortgage lender is found dead outside his home , having been shot in the head .
Three men allegedly invade the home of a former subprime lender , and are arrested after reportedly injuring three people inside .
Vandals target the home of the former CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland , smashing windows in the banker ’s home and car .
( Turn down the music which is frankly pretty horrid , but this does give a good juxtaposition of scenes from Bertolucci ’s 1900 .
I ’m no fan of violence , but you ’d be on the side of the peasants after seeing what Donald Sutherland visited on them )
An ambitious plan to map the genomes of 10,000 species of vertebrates – animals with backbones – has been announced by scientists .
Unravelling the DNA sequences of the many species of vertebrates will help science to explain how the leopard got its spots , how the elephant came by its trunk and how the bat learned to fly , the researchers said .
A group of eminent biologists have proposed that the " Genome 10 K " project to decode 10,000 genomes – from frogs , fish and snakes , to birds , whales and monkeys – would enable scientists to tell the 600 - million - year story of how vertebrates evolved from a single marine organism with the first prototype backbone into the plethora of lifeforms in the land , sea and air .

Sydney Brenner , a Nobel laureate and a senior distinguished fellow at the Salk Institute in California , said the project would help evolutionists write the missing chapters in the story of life .
" The most challenging intellectual problem in biology for this century will be the reconstruction of our biological past so we can understand how complex organisms such as ourselves evolved , " Dr Brenner said .
" Genomes contain information from the past .
They are molecular fossils , and having sequences from vertebrates will be an essential source of rich information , " he said .
The aim of Genome 10 K is to collect and sequence the DNA of each vertebrate genus – the collective grouping above a species – from a database of more than 16,000 named species of vertebrate animals compiled by more than 50 institutions from around the world .
" Understanding the evolution of the vertebrates is one of the greatest detective stories in science , " said David Haussler of the University of California , Santa Cruz , one of the project 's architects .
" No one has ever really known how the elephant got its trunk , or how the leopard got its spots .
This project will lay the foundation for work that will answer those questions and many others , " Dr Haussler said .
" Differences in the DNA that makes up the genomes of the animals we find today hold the key to the great biological events of the past , such as the development of the four - chambered heart and the magnificent architecture of the wings , fins and arms , each adapted to its special purpose , " he said .
Each genome is likely to consist of about 3 billion DNA " bases " , or chemical letters in the DNA code , which will be assigned in their correct sequence .
The project has become possible because the cost of DNA sequencing has fallen greatly since the human genome was fully decoded nearly 10 years ago .
Vertebrates are one of the most " malleable " branches of life , Dr Haussler said .
They evolved in the ocean but quickly spread to every habitat on land , as well as to the air in the form of birds and bats , and the sea in the shape of whales , dolphins and porpoises .
During this expansion , they produced innovative structures , such as multi-chambered hearts , bones , teeth and an articulated internal skeleton .
They have also become the most intelligent of lifeforms , symbolised by the large brain and sophisticated language and culture of humans , the scientists said .
By comparing the genomes of the 10,000 vertebrates with that of humans , the scientists hope to gain insight into how man descended from his distant animal ancestors .
" We can understand the function of elements in the human genome by seeing what parts of the genome have changed and what parts have not changed in humans and other animals , " Dr Haussler said .
The following article appeared in the well respected Finland newspaper , Ammenusastia : “ As a communist I do n’t believe in Heaven or the Bible ; but as a scientist I now believe in Hell , ” said Dr. Azzacove .
“ Needless to say we were shocked to make such a discovery .
But we know what we saw and we know what we heard .
And we are absolutely convinced that we drilled through the gates of Hell ! ”
Dr. Azzacove continued , “ . . . the drill suddenly began to rotate wildly , indicating that we had reached a large empty pocket or cavern .
Temperature sensors showed a dramatic increase in heat to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit . ”
“ We lowered a microphone , designed to detect the sounds of plate movements down the shaft .
But instead of plate movements we heard a human voice screaming in pain !
At first we thought the sound was coming from our own equipment . ”
“ But when we made adjustments our worst suspicions were confirmed .
The screams were n’t those of a single human , they were the screams of millions of humans ! ”
Researchers record the screams of the damned ?
Fact or fiction ?
You decide .
Dana Milbank of the Washington Post describes how Coburn Crossed the Line .
At 4 p.m. Sunday afternoon -- nine hours before the 1 a.m. vote that would effectively clinch the legislation 's passage -- Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) went to the Senate floor to propose a prayer .
" What the American people ought to pray is that somebody can't make the vote tonight , " he said .
" That 's what they ought to pray . "
There was absolutely no mystery concerning which senator was being referenced by Coburn .
It was difficult to escape the conclusion that Coburn was referring to the 92 - year - old , wheelchair - bound Sen. Robert Byrd ( D - W.V. ) who has been in and out of hospitals and lay at home ailing .
It would not be easy for Byrd to get out of bed in the wee hours with deep snow on the ground and ice on the roads -- but without his vote , Democrats would n't have the 60 they needed .
Senator Dick Durbin spoke expressed outrage at the behavior of Sen. Coburn .
But the best revenge came from 92 - year - old Senator Byrd himself :
Coburn was wearing blue jeans , an argyle sweater and a tweed jacket with elbow patches when he walked back into the chamber a few minutes before 1 a.m .
He watched without expression when Byrd was wheeled in , dabbing his eyes and nose with tissues , his complexion pale .
When his name was called , Byrd shot his right index finger into the air as he shouted " aye , " then pumped his left fist in defiance .
Here is my prayer : I pray for the people of Oklahoma that they will someday come to their senses and elect principled men and women to office .
( CNN ) -- Florida highway patrol troopers plan to talk to pro golfer Tiger Woods on Saturday to get more information about his car crash near his home , a spokeswoman said .
Woods was treated and released from a hospital after suffering minor injuries in a car accident early Friday in his central Florida neighborhood .
State troopers had tried to speak to Woods on Friday as part of a routine car accident investigation , but his wife said he was sleeping , said Kim Miller , a spokeswoman for the Florida highway patrol .
Troopers decided they would return Saturday afternoon , Miller said .
Cellphone pictures of the accident from CNN affiliate WFTV
A joint statement from Woods ' publicist and Health Central Hospital said the golfer was in " good condition " after the accident outside his home .
Tiger Woods :
A true sporting legend
The single - vehicle accident occurred about 2:25 a.m. in Windermere , a suburb of Orlando , according to police .
Woods pulled out of his driveway in a 2009 Cadillac SUV and struck a fire hydrant , then a tree , according to an incident report from the Florida highway patrol in Orange County .
Police Chief Daniel Saylor said two Windermere police officers were the first to arrive on the scene .
" There was Tiger Woods laying on the ground in front of the vehicle with his wife over him rendering first aid , " he told reporters .
" He was in and out of consciousness with lacerations to his upper and lower lip , " Saylor said .
" He was mumbling but did n't say anything coherent . "
Woods ' wife , Elin Nordegren , told the police she was inside the house when she heard the accident .
She said she went outside and used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle , then pulled him from the SUV .
" According to the officers , yes , she was very upset , " he said in response to a question .
But , he added , " Things like this happen all the time ... I understand he 's stable and he 's fine . "
About 10 minutes later , Orange County fire and rescue arrived and took him to Health Central Hospital , where he was treated and released , he said .
The crash remains under investigation and charges were pending , the police report said .
It also noted the accident was not alcohol - related .
The SUV , which was drivable , was towed and state troopers did n't take pictures of the scene , she said .
Saylor said the vehicle 's front end was damaged .
The 33 - year - old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times , and three U.S. Open Championships .
He was set to host and play the Chevron World Challenge on Monday at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks , California .
Woods has won the tournament -- which helps raise money for Tiger Woods Foundation programs -- four times .
Woods has won six times on the PGA tour this year after returning from knee surgery .
In a post on his blog last month , Woods said he was " absolutely thrilled " about his PGA tour , adding , " This has been one of my most consistent years on the PGA tour . "
Woods and his wife have two children , ages 2 and a baby born in February .

Thriller writer Peter Jukes has written an angry piece for Prospect about why British TV has lost its way so badly that it could never hope to produce a series like The Wire .
It 's familiar but still interesting stuff .
The breakup of the old US network cartel and competition from cable channels such as HBO has been good for competition – the result is that shows have smartened up , rather than dumbed down .
It 's given us series such as Mad Men , The Sopranos , Six Feet Under and Sex and the City .
In the UK , Channel 4 and ITV have largely backed out of adult drama , leaving the whole business in the hands of the BBC – and one man in particular , controller of drama commissioning Ben Stephenson .
It 's not that Britain is short of TV writing talent , reckons Jukes , but that it has n't worked out how to use it .
As a result , the US has cornered the market in the high - end stuff that bears devoted watching and repeat viewing .
Prospect has a graphic to demonstrate the point : one second - series episode of The Wire has 21 interweaving storylines ; an episode of Life on Mars combines four .
The only way to produce sophisticated , rich , long - running drama like The Wire or even ER is to use a team of writers who collaborate under a showrunner , a system the US studios has cracked .
It 's too much for even one great dramatist to write the whole thing , but you can't hire hack writers to work on episodes in isolation .
Result : US viewers sit down to an evening of Damages ; we get Casualty .
It 's interesting that soaps are daytime fodder in America .
In Britain , they clog the primetime slots – and former Holby City writer Jukes reserves most of his bile for them .
He says writing for that show involved " the most dispiriting experiences in my 25 years as a dramatist .
Soaps squeeze the creativity and innovation out of you " .
Sour grapes or has he hit the problem on the head ?
The philosopher forms his principles on an infinity of particular observations . …
He does not confuse truth with plausibility ; he takes for truth what is true , for forgery what is false , for doubtful what is doubtful , and probable what is probable . …
The philosophical spirit is thus a spirit of observation and accuracy .
UN IPCC's Eduardo Zorita : ' By writing these lines I will just probably achieve that a few of my future studies will , again , not see the light of publication '
A UN scientist is declaring that his three fellow UN climate panel colleagues “ should be barred from the IPCC process . ”
In a November 26 , 2009 message on his website , UN IPCC contributing author Dr. Eduardo Zorita writes : “ CRU files : Why I think that Michael Mann , Phil Jones and Stefan Rahmstorf should be barred from the IPCC process . ”
Zorita writes : “ Short answer : Because the scientific assessments in which they may take part are not credible anymore . ”
Zorita indicates that he is aware that he is putting his career in jeopardy by going after the upper echelon of UN IPCC scientists .
“ By writing these lines I will just probably achieve that a few of my future studies will , again , not see the light of publication , ” Zorita candidly admits , a reference to the ClimateGate emails discussing how to suppress data and scientific studies that do not agree with the UN IPCC views .
Zorita was a UN IPCC Contributing Author of the Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 .
Since 2003 , Zorita has headed the Department of Paleoclimate and has been a senior scientist at the Institute for Coastal Research of the GKSS Research Centre in Germany .
Zorita has published more than 70 peer - reviewed scientific studies .
Zorita ’s stunning candor continued , noting that scientists who disagreed with the UN IPCC climate view were “ bullied and subtly blackmailed . ”
“ In this atmosphere , Ph D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the ‘ politically correct picture ’ .
Some , or many issues , about climate change are still not well known .
Policy makers should be aware of the attempts to hide these uncertainties under a unified picture .
I had the ‘ pleasure ’ to experience all this in my area of research , ” Zorita explained .
[ Zorita ’s full statement is reprinted below . ]
Continuing fallout of ClimateGate
Zorita ’s revelations are the latest in a series of continuing fallout to the global warming establishment and to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , since the email and data scandal dubbed “ ClimateGate ” broke earlier this month .
Zorita ’s defection from the global warming establishment comes after the shocking news today that one of the scientists employed at ground zero of what has been termed “ ClimateGate ” has suggested disbanding the United Nations climate panel , the IPCC .

Complete Statement of UN IPCC Scientists Dr. Eduardo Zorita on the UN IPCC ’s “ ClimateGate ” scandal .
CRU files :
Why I think that Michael Mann , Phil Jones and Stefan Rahmstorf should be barred from the IPCC process .
Short answer : because the scientific assessments in which they may take part are not credible anymore .
A longer answer :
My voice is not very important .
I belong to the climate - research infantry , publishing a few papers per year , reviewing a few manuscript per year and participating in a few research projects .
I do not form part of important committees , nor I pursue a public awareness of my activities .
My very minor task in the public arena was to participate as a contributing author in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC .
By writing these lines I will just probably achieve that a few of my future studies will , again , not see the light of publication .
My area of research happens to be the climate of the past millennia , where I think I am appreciated by other climate - research ‘ soldiers ’ .
And it happens that some of my mail exchange with Keith Briffa and Timothy Osborn can be found in the CRU - files made public recently on the internet .
To the question of legality or ethicalness of reading those files I will write a couple of words later .
I may confirm what has been written in other places : research in some areas of climate science has been and is full of machination , conspiracies , and collusion , as any reader can interpret from the CRU - files .
They depict a realistic , I would say even harmless , picture of what the real research in the area of the climate of the past millennium has been in the last years .
The scientific debate has been in many instances hijacked to advance other agendas .
These words do not mean that I think anthropogenic climate change is a hoax .
On the contrary , it is a question which we have to be very well aware of .
But I am also aware that in this thick atmosphere - and I am not speaking of greenhouse gases now - editors , reviewers and authors of alternative studies , analysis , interpretations , even based on the same data we have at our disposal , have been bullied and subtly blackmailed .
In this atmosphere , Ph D students are often tempted to tweak their data so as to fit the ‘ politically correct picture ’ .
Some , or many issues , about climate change are still not well known .
Policy makers should be aware of the attempts to hide these uncertainties under a unified picture .
I had the ‘ pleasure ’ to experience all this in my area of research .
I thank explicitly Keith Briffa and Tim Osborn for their work in the formulation of one Chapter of the IPCC report .
As it distills from these emails , they withstood the evident pressure of other IPCC authors , not experts in this area of research , to convey a distorted picture of our knowledge of the hockey - stick graph .
Is legal or ethical to read the CRU files ?
I am not a lawyer .
It seems that if the files had been hacked this would constitute an illegal act .
If they have been leaked it could be a whistle blower action protected by law .
I think it is not unethical to read them .
Once published , I feel myself entitled to read how some researchers tried to influence reviewers to scupper the publication of our work on the ‘ hockey stick graph ’ or to read how some IPCC authors tried to exclude this work from the IPCC Report on very dubious reasons .
Also , these mails do not contain any personal information at all .
They are an account of many dull daily activities of typical climatologists , together with a realistic account of very troubling professional behavior .

Chronic Art
​ Cliff Maynard of Pittsburgh has blazed a unique trail on the stoner art scene .
The 37 - year - old creates amazing mosaics using the humble medium of used roach papers from smoked joints .
Amazingly , this is just something Cliff does in his spare time .
He ’s one of Pittsburgh ’s finest tattoo artists at his day job .
But it ’s his roach paper Chronic
Art that has captured the imagination of folks nationwide .
As a student at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh , Cliff had the opportunity to take inspiration from the great mosaics of the past .
“ I was studying mosaics in school , ” Maynard remembers .
“ I just remember sort of making this connection in my head between the tiles and roach papers . ”
His roach paper portraits include iconic rock star stoners like Jimi Hendrix , Jerry Garcia , and John Lennon , and hemped hop rap stars like Snoop Dogg and Method Man .
On a scorching hot June day in northeastern Kenya , an hour west of the Kenyan - Somali border , Leila Chirayath Janah arrived at the Dabaab refugee settlement in an armed convoy .
She was there on a mission : to connect jobless , displaced refugees to the rest of the world through legitimate Internet - based jobs .
Leila , 27 , is the founder of Samasource , a non-profit organization reminiscent of a tech startup that outsources web - based jobs to women , youth , and refugees living in poverty in third world countries .
I met her last month in the tiny office space she rents out in downtown San Francisco .
She is tall and well - dressed , and has credentials that include Harvard , Stanford , and a fellowship with TED India .
Her obsession with Africa started in her teens — when she was a senior in high school , she left LA to teach English to a class of 60 blind people in rural Ghana ; a few years later she created an African Development Studies at Harvard , and a few years after that , she started working on Samasource .
Leila 's approach to development is pragmatic ; her goal is to equip poor but educated people with tools needed to turn their intelligence and drive into the opportunity to earn income .
" Donors love health and education , " Leila says .
" It 's so sexy ; everyone loves to be the one to save a life by buying a mosquito net or building a school .
But in reality , when you look at what the developing world really needs , it 's a connection to markets . "
Shortly after launching Samasource , she read an Oxfam report that mentioned a Dutch non-profit had set up a computer lab in the Dadaab refugee camps in Kenya .
" I thought , how crazy would it be if i can get these refugees to do real work for clients in San Francisco ?
What if we could prove to the world that these people who have been written off completely as only good for receiving handouts , who are stuck in this camp receiving food rations , can be productive to the global economy ? "
Before she left for Kenya , Leila hooked up with Lukas Biewald , a former Yahoo !
engineer who had created a job crowdsourcing software web site called Crowdflower .
Lukas had agreed to help her hook up the refugees with real clients in California through Crowdflower — Leila would train the refugees to do simple work like data entry and Google searches at the camps while Lukas watched their progress remotely .
Dadaab 's refugee camps are insanely overcrowded .
300,000 displaced people live in a space that is only meant to accommodate 90,000 .
While some resell goods acquired at the market in town , most of the refugees do n't have jobs because they can't get work permits under Kenyan law .
Boys are routinely recruited out of their mundane reality by rebel groups that turn them into pirates and child soldiers .
The camps are managed by CARE , so Leila coordinated with its reps to have 16 trainees picked out for her Samsource experiment .
They had to have a certain level of education and basic knowledge of English .
The computers in the lab were imported from China and rigged to withstand the heat , pressure , and dust that permeate the refugee camps .
The tasks ranged from simple searches to transcription to virtual assistance to app testing .
Leila spent an hour teaching her workers how Samasource would work and setting them up with a special Crowdflower login and an @samasource.org email address .
" I taught them how to Google , " she tells me .
" They totally got it . "
Two days later , Leila called Lukas to see how her refugee workers were doing .
" They 're getting the same results as our for - profit clients , " Lukas told her .
" And in some cases , they 're doing even better . "
One of the refugees Leila trained was a 24 - year old Sudanese man named Paul Parach — a former Lost Boy who was seized from his home at age nine and survived by walking through the scorching desert with no food for days before arriving at a refugee camp in Kenya , where he was shot in the leg by a guy from a rival tribe .
" You could see in his eyes that he wanted to get out of there , " she says .
A few weeks after she left Dadaab , Leila got a friend request on Facebook from Paul the refugee .
" It was just crazy , " she remembers .
" This is a guy who , two months ago , had no idea he could be connected to the world this way . "
After that , he even dug up her cell phone number and started sending her texts with credit he bought using the money he made through Samasource .
Leila points out that Paul is now just one connection away from Mark Zuckerberg ( Samasource was one of this year 's fbFund Rev winners ) .
" Paul now has power and social capital ; he 's starting to build an online reputation and starting to become visible to the world .
It was a totally unanticipated side benefit . "
Leila 's experiment proved that a Somali refugee with a Kenyan public education could do a lot of the same work that educated Americans were doing .
She now has 520 workers in six countries who are working with Samasource .
They 've generated over a quarter million dollars in sales working for clients like Google and the Stanford University Library , and have made more money than they would in years of doing backbreaking 50 - cent - a - day labor at the camp .
" Some people have accused us of creating a virtual sweatshop , " Leila says .
" I find that very funny .
This is like the ultimate creme de la creme job you can possibly get .
If your opportunities are working at a quarry or toiling away on some field , the chance to sit in front of this cool machine and do this work that connects you to the world is so empowering for people , especially people from marginalized groups who have been told their whole lives that they 're not worth anything .

The troubles of the nation 's largest community organizing organization , ACORN , are being felt in the liberal Bay Area , where there is normally no shortage of supporters of the group 's efforts to provide free tax help and other services to low - income residents and people of color .
Amid allegations that employees of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now participated in voter registration fraud and , most recently , gave business advice to undercover filmmakers posing as a pimp and prostitute , Bay Area agencies that had supported the group have cut off tens of thousands of dollars of funding .
ACORN 's problems accelerated in September after widespread media coverage of the secretly recorded videos at the group 's offices in Southern California and elsewhere .
Republicans and Democrats in Congress voted to cut federal funding for the organization .
The group has filed suit in federal court to reinstate the funding .
Six days later , the Internal Revenue Service said ACORN no longer would be included in its list of organizations allowed to provide free tax preparation .
While the organization is mostly funded by private donations and $ 10 - a - month dues from its 400,000 members , the organization has received $ 53 million in federal funds since 1994 .
In light of the videos recorded by conservative activists , Attorney General Jerry Brown launched an investigation into the actions of two Southern California ACORN offices - and of the clandestine filmmakers .
State law prohibits recording someone without their consent .
There has been no evidence that allegations of voter registration fraud against employees of the organization resulted in fraudulent ballots being cast .
And ACORN officials themselves alerted authorities to some allegations of voter registration fraud last year when some employees were accused of submitting false registration forms .
Voter registration was only part of the organization 's California work , which also has included efforts to raise minimum wages and fight predatory lending practices .
The group has helped residents get speed bumps and stop signs in San Bruno and clean up of lead paint in East Oakland apartments .
Bay Area staff cut
The loss of local funding means ACORN has had to cut nearly two - thirds of its 26 - person staff in the Bay Area since September .
Officials at the organization say they were forced to discontinue a program focused on helping homeowners modify loans in anticipation of a new wave of home foreclosures next year .
" Our core work of organizing will continue and the fact that we 've been around the Bay Area for ( 20 ) years means that we 've built some strong relationships , " said John Eller , ACORN 's Bay Area regional director and lead organizer .
Although other organizations will try to help thousands of Bay Area families facing foreclosure in the next few months , he said , " it will be a heavy lift for a lot of them . "
San Francisco's Human Services
Agency ended its relationship with the group two months ago because the IRS was no longer recognizing it as a certified free tax preparer .
The city had paid San Francisco 's ACORN office $ 75,000 to help low - income people prepare taxes .
In the past year , ACORN and the agency helped 3,022 San Franciscans collect $ 1.3 million in earned income tax credit refunds .
" They did a good job , " said Trent Rhorer , executive director of the Human Services Agency .
" They helped us reach people we could n't reach . "
While he was confident the group 's work would be picked up by another local agency , he said " their asset is their experience . "
Also in September , the United Way of the Bay Area declared a moratorium on grants made to ACORN .
" We have the public trust of our donors and we want to make sure that we 're distributing their money to organizations that have the public trust , " said Carole Watson , chief community investment officer for United Way of the Bay Area .
The charity awarded $ 44,000 to Bay Area ACORN affiliates to help low - income people with tax preparation during the 2008 - 09 tax season .
It also had donated $ 40,000 to ACORN San Mateo 's foreclosure prevention program .
ACORN was one of 250 organizations giving free tax advice that resulted in $ 47 million in refunds to 47,000 low - income Bay Area tax filers in the past year , United Way officials said .
Watson said her organization had received no complaints about ACORN .
" They were highly regarded for their performance , " she said .
The group 's tax preparation program helped Modesta Arias .
In the past , the 70 - year - old Excelsior district resident had gone to for - profit tax preparers in the Mission District " but they try to take advantage of Latin people who speak Spanish , " she said .
She has been so grateful for ACORN's help that she has volunteered twice a month to go door - to - door in her neighborhood to help organize residents on housing and crime issues .
Support in S.F .
The San Francisco Foundation is standing behind the group .
" To date , they have met our rigorous and standardized grant eligibility requirements , as well as operated and served with mission and values aligned with those of the San Francisco Foundation , " spokeswoman Sara Ying Rounsaville said .
The foundation gave $ 72,000 to Bay Area ACORN affiliates this year .
“ Though women begin their lives more fulfilled than men , as they age , they gradually become less happy , ” Buckingham writes in his new blog on The Huffington Post , pointing out that this darker view covers feelings about marriage , money and material goods .
“ Men , in contrast , get happier as they get older . ”
Buckingham and other experts dispute the idea that the variance in happiness is caused by women carrying a bigger burden of work at home , the “ second shift . ”
They say that while women still do more cooking , cleaning and child - caring , the trend lines are moving toward more parity , which should make them less stressed .

When women stepped into male - dominated realms , they put more demands  and stress  on themselves .
If they once judged themselves on looks , kids , hubbies , gardens and dinner parties , now they judge themselves on looks , kids , hubbies , gardens , dinner parties  and grad school , work , office deadlines and meshing a two - career marriage .
“ Choice is inherently stressful , ” Buckingham said in an interview .
“ And women are being driven to distraction . ”
One area of extreme distraction is kids .
“ Across the happiness data , the one thing in life that will make you less happy is having children , ” said Betsey Stevenson , an assistant professor at Wharton who co-wrote a paper called “ The Paradox of Declining Female Happiness . ”
“ It ’s true whether you ’re wealthy or poor , if you have kids late or kids early .
Yet I know very few people who would tell me they wish they had n’t had kids or who would tell me they feel their kids were the destroyer of their happiness . ”
The more important things that are crowded into their lives , the less attention women are able to give to each thing .

By Date By Thread Metasploit Framework 3.3 Released From : HD Moore < hdm ( ) digitaloffense net >
Date : Tue , 17 Nov 2009 07:57:36 - 0600
We are excited to announce the immediate availability of version 3.3 of the Metasploit Framework .
This release includes 446 exploits , 216 auxiliary modules , and hundreds of payloads , including an in - memory VNC service and the Meterpreter .
In addition , the Windows payloads now support NX , DEP , IPv6 , and the Windows 7 platform .
More than 180 bugs were fixed since last year ’s release of version 3.2 , making this one of the more well - tested releases yet .
- http://www.metasploit.com/framework/download/
Metasploit runs on all modern operating systems , including Linux , Windows , Mac OS X , and most flavors of BSD .
Metasploit has been used on a wide range of hardware platforms , from massive Unix mainframes to the Apple® iPhone™ .
Installers are available for the Windows and Linux platforms , bundling all dependencies into a single package for ease of installation .
The latest version of the Metasploit Framework , as well as images , video demonstrations , documentation and installation instructions for many platforms , can be found online at http://www.metasploit.com/framework/.
This release of the Metasploit Framework was driven by numerous key contributors , including James Lee , Yoann Guillot , Steve Tornio , MC , Chris Gates , Alexander Kornbrust , Ramon Carvalle , Stephen Fewer , Ryan Linn , Lurene Grenier , Mike Kershaw , Patrick Webster , Max Moser , Efrain Torres , Alexander Sotirov , Ty Bodell , Joshua Drake , JR , Carlos Perez , Kris Katterjohn and many others .
The startup speed up the Metasploit Console and all utilities has been greatly improved due to performance patches by Yoann Guillot and a string processing overhaul by James Lee .
Metasploit now fully supports the 1.9.1 version of the Ruby interpreter , clearing the way for support under a variety of alternate Ruby VMs in the future .
The Windows installation now includes a fully - functional console interface , using Cygwin and RXVT as a front - end to the framework .
The Windows installer now runs on all supported versions of Windows , from Windows 2000 to Windows 7 .
The Windows version of Metasploit is now portable and can be silently installed via the /S / D=Dest parameters .
The Linux installers now include everything needed to run the Metasploit Framework on most versions of Linux released over the last five years .
The official Linux installers are recommended for anyone using a Linux distribution other than Ubuntu ( 8.04 + ) .
These installers include Ruby 1.9.1 , Subversion 1.6.6 , and all dependencies , along with convenient scripts for keeping the framework updated .
The Metasploit Console now indicates how many days have passed since the last update , reminding users when their installation becomes out of date .
The console now uses a Ruby implementation of the Readline library by default , solving a number of issues with Mac OS X and other platforms with broken Readline support .
The console now supports and enables ANSI colors by default , making it much easier to discern between errors and status messages on a busy terminal .
The database functionality is now enabled by default , as long RubyGems and at least one database driver is available on the system .
The db_drivername plugins are deprecated and the db_driver and db_create commands are active by default .
The db commands now support filters for everything from open ports to IP ranges .
The db_autopwn command now cross-references across multiple ports and services name instead of a single port , when the -p parameter is supplied .
All applicable exploits now have OSVDB references thanks to a major effort by Steve Tornio .
Two - ways links have been setup between the Metasploit module browser and their matching OSVDB entries .
CVE references have been audited across the entire module tree , with a number of typos and other fixes corrected in the process .
Oracle exploit support has been implemented through a tag - team effort between MC and Chris Gates , with assistance from Alexander Kornbrust .
Oracle modules have been developed for exploiting TNS protocol stack and Web - based Oracle services , as well as post - authentication database - level privilege escalation flaws .
Microsoft SQL
Server support has been overhauled , with the addition of a brand new native Ruby TDS driver exclusive to the Metasploit Framework and a large number of new modules .
Microsoft SQL
Server 2000 through 2008 versions have been tested with the new modules .
The MSSQL and Oracle login modules can now brute force passwords from a dictionary file .
Automated client - side exploitation has been overhauled with a rewrite of the browser_autopwn module by James Lee .
A number of existing client - side exploits have been updated to use better fingerprinting and evasion techniques .
All TCP - based exploits can now be launched through SOCKS4 , SOCKS5 , and HTTP proxies .
The payload encoding library can now embed Metasploit payloads into arbitrary executables .
The -x parameter to msfencode allows an arbitrary executable to be used as a vector for a Metasploit payload .
This significantly reduces the impact of anti-virus tests during penetration tests and allows the use of familiar executables in social engineering endeavors .
Payloads can be generated as VBA macros for insertion into Word documents , as Windows Scripting Hosts scripts and the standard formats ( C , Ruby , Javascript , etc ) .
Metasploit now supports 64 - bit Windows as a target platform , with the ability to use standard stagers , generate executables with embedded payloads and load Meterpeter on 64 - bit systems .
Metasploit now supports 64 - bit Linux on the PowerPC architecture as a target platform .
The alphanumeric encoders have seen a number of bug fixes and improvements since version 3.2 , including the ability to prepend alphanumeric GetEIP code via the AllowWin32SEH parameter .
AIX support as a target platform has been improved , with a number of additional payloads and an exploit module for the newly discovered rpc_ttdbserverd realpath vulnerability .
These payloads support versions 5.3.7 through 6.1.4 of the AIX platform and work with auxiliary modules and the database to select the right syscall numbers for each particular operating system revision .
32 - bit PowerPC support now includes POWER and Cell Broadband chips in the supported architecture set through an effort by Ramon Carvalle of RiSE Security .
The reverse_tcp stager now has a configurable number of retries ( ReverseConnectRetries ) and exits gracefully if the connection fails .
The reverse_tcp_allports stager will cycle through all possible outbound ports in order to punch through host or network firewalls .
The standard Windows stagers were overhauled to use a new hashing method , support Windows 7 , allocate their own memory during staging and avoid a middle stager by performing their own reliable transfer mechanism .
The new stager development was driven by Stephen Fewer of Harmony Security .
Support for JSP payloads has been integrated , opening the door for new exploit modules for Java - based application engines , like Bea and Tomcat .
The existing CMD , PHP , Ruby and Perl payloads have all seen a revamp and update to their compatibility - matching system .
Auxiliary scanner modules now instantiate a new module instance for each thread , allowing more of the exploit mixins to be used to develop network scanners .
This greatly improved the reliability of the existing scanners and allowed for dozens of new ones to be developed .
Scanner modules now report their progress as they scan the network and the frequency of reports can be controlled through advanced options .
A simple fuzzer API has been added as a mixin , along with over a dozen new fuzzer modules that demonstrate their use and capabilities .
While fuzzing is not the focus of the framework , the API is easy to use and can meet the requirements of many on - the - spot service tests .
Ryan Linn 's HTTP NTLM capture module has been integrated into the framework .
Support for the DECT COM - ON - AIR driver has been integrated into Metasploit , along with two example modules for locating DECT base stations and detecting active calls .
The Lorcon2 library is now supported through a new ruby - lorcon2 Ruby extension and exploit mixin .
All existing modules using the old Lorcon API have been ported .
The airpwn and dnspwn modules developed by Mike Kershaw ( also one of the Lorcon2 authors ) have been integrated into the framework .
The pcaprub Ruby extension has been updated to build on Ruby 1.9.1 .
Max Moser 's pSnuffle packet sniffer ( modeled after dsniff ) has been integrated into the framework .
The Meterpreter and VNC injection payloads now use Stephen Fewer 's Reflective DLL injection technique ; the previous DLL injection stages have been renamed and will be deprecated in a future release .
The Meterpreter now negotiates a full SSL link after the staging process has been completed , even going so far as to fake a HTTP request over the SSL session to mimic the traffic profile of a normal web browser .
The Metepreter AutoRunScript parameter can now support multiple scripts with arguments .
The Meterpreter can now take screen shots , provided that the process has access to the desktop ( e.g. migrated into explorer.exe ) , using the ESPIA extension developed by Efrain Torres .
The Meterpreter can now capture traffic from the compromised system , using an in -memory sniffing extension based on the MicroOLAP Packet Sniffing SDK .
This feature creates a ring buffer of up to 200,000 packets , allowing a snapshot to be downloaded and converted to a standard pcap log file .
The Meterpreter can now capture keystrokes , including those of console logins , by migrating in the appropriate process and using the keyscan commands .
The long - missing " rm " command has finally been added to the Meterpreter command line .
The " background " command has been added for situations when using ^Z is not feasible .
Alexander Sotirov 's METSVC has been added to the framework and a Meterpreter script has been included to automatically deploy it on a compromised system .
The beginnings of POSIX support have been implemented by JR , targeting the Linux and BSD platforms .
The stdapi extension for POSIX has been partially completed and should continue to improve going forward .
All Metepreter scripts now support the " - h " parameter for usage .
As of Metasploit 3.3 , there are almost 30 different Metepreter scripts included in the release , many of which were exclusively written by Carlos Perez .
Enjoy the release !

Small rise in temperature thousands of years ago caused rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet .
The Greenland ice sheet could melt more rapidly than had been thought as a result of climate change .
Getty
The Greenland ice sheet melted much more rapidly as a result of warmer temperatures in the recent past than previously estimated , a team of international scientists has revealed .
They warn that future warming could have more dramatic effects on the ice than researchers have assumed .
Between 9,000 and 6,000 years ago , Earth went through an unusually warm period .
But puzzlingly , unlike data from many other spots in the Northern Hemisphere , measurements of isotopes in ice cores drilled from the Greenland ice sheet ( GIS ) has n't reflected that temperature change .
So models of the ice sheet 's behaviour based on these data have suggested that the height of the ice above bedrock has remained quite stable during the past 12,000 years .
Now , new data from ice cores drilled in six different places on and around the ice sheet reveal that this unusually warm period affected the GIS too , and that in response to these temperatures — which were 2 – 3 °C hotter than the current temperature — it lost 150 metres in height at its centre and shrank by 200 kilometres at the edges .
Big thaw
A team led by Bo Vinther from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen , Denmark , analysed the ice cores for evidence of the regional temperature and elevation of the Greenland ice sheet in the Holocene , the geological era that began about 12,000 years ago .
Each core is basically a long rod of ice , drilled down 3 kilometres to the bedrock .
It is sliced up and the content of particular isotopes , such as those of oxygen , in water and air bubbles from the appropriate section is measured in the lab .
The researchers analyzed data from ice cores in six different places around Greenland .
B. M. Vinther , et al .
To work out the ambient temperature on the ice sheet , the team had to disentangle changes in temperature that were due to the change in elevation from changes in temperature due to climate change — a task that has proved difficult in the past .
To do this , they analysed two ice cores from small ice caps that did not form part of the main sheet and which , the researchers believe , did not change elevation .
They used these measurements to work out the temperatures on the ice caps , and by comparing these with temperatures obtained from main - sheet ice cores were able to work out the thickness of the main sheet at different times in the past .
" What we can now say for sure is that 8,000 years ago it was in fact 2 - 3 °C warmer than now , and it was this 2 - 3 degrees that actually caused quite a bit of melting , " says Vinther .
" And that of course gives us an indication that if climate was to warm a few degrees , then the ice sheet might start to lose mass again . "
The team 's results are published in Nature1 .
Forcing the issue
Eric Rignot , who studies ice and climate at the University of California , Irvine , and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , is excited by the new result but cautious about applying it to future warming .
He is working with others to develop better models of ice - sheet behaviour for use in the next report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , with the goal of explaining patterns observed in the past decade .
ADVERTISEMENT
" Climate forcing is of a very different nature today to the Holocene , " he says , but notes that analyzing the climate of the past " still gives us information on how sensitive the ice sheet is to climate change . "
Rignot agrees with Vinther and his team that in future the ice is likely to melt more rapidly than current models predict .
" How quickly is difficult to say , " he says .
But , he adds , we need to be using this data to think one step ahead .
" The climate machine is moving on in the meantime . "
Sen . Al Franken ( D - Minn. ) , above , and Sen. John Thune ( R - S.D. ) sparred sharply on the Senate floor Monday evening , a departure from the usually dormant speeches in the august chamber .
Franken feuds with GOP's No. 4
Sen . Al Franken ( D - Minn. ) and Sen. John Thune ( R - S.D. ) sparred sharply on the Senate floor Monday evening , a departure from the usually dormant speeches in the august chamber .
Franken said he was struck by a speech in which he said Thune had refused to highlight when benefits to the health care bill would kick in and instead emphasized the negative parts of the bill .
Advertisement
“ You know , again , we are entitled to our own opinions , we ’re not entitled to our own facts , ” Franken said , his booming voice rising .
And in a reference to a chart
Thune held up , Franken said : “ If you ’re going to hold up a chart that says when taxes kick in and when benefits kick in , you say 1,800 days , you better include the benefits that do kick in right away . ”
Thune , No. 4 in GOP leadership , asked the freshman Democrat to yield for a question , and asked : “ Did the senator from Minnesota , when I was pointing out the chart , understand the point I was making – that the tax increases start 18 days from now , and that the benefits , the spending benefits under the bill which are the premium tax credits and the exchanges that are designed to provide the benefit that ’s delivered under this bill do n’t start until 2014 ? ”
Franken responded sharply : “ Does the senator understand that spending benefits start right away ? ”
To which ,
Thune said tersely : “ If the senator missed the point , I can get the chart out again . ”
Franken said : “ I asked a question , senator .
I yield to you for a question .
I ’m asking a question . ”
Senators typically argue in less direct terms on the floor , and a sharp exchange between a freshman senator and a member of the other party 's leadership is unusual .
And it was n’t the first time that Franken has taken on one of his new colleagues : earlier this fall in a private exchange on the floor , the former comedian delivered a heated rebuke to Sen.
Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) over an op - ed the senator wrote defending his vote against an amendment the Democrat wrote .
Over the summer , Franken reportedly berated T. Boone Pickens at a private Democratic lunch for the oil tycoon ’s help financing the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks against Sen .
John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign .
On the floor Monday , Franken laid out a series of benefits he said would kick in right away under the bill .
When
Thune tried to ask a question , Franken yielded his floor time to Sen.
Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) instead .
Brown accused the GOP of siding with insurance companies , and when Thune tried to ask Brown a question , Brown said the Democrats had already given the Republicans 30 minutes to argue their points .
“ We have our time , ” Franken said .
“ Sen .
Thune wants to monopolize our 30 minutes , ” Brown said .
Thune again tried to interject , but Franken refused to yield to Thune for a question .
At which point , Thune left the floor .
Franken continued his speech , saying Thune “ does n’t want to hear ” that benefits kick in sooner .
Soon after the exchange , Thune returned to the floor , with some GOP reinforcements .
Sen .
John McCain called Franken ’s claims “ misleading , ” which he said was the “ kindest way I could describe it . ”
Responding to Franken ’s arguments ,
Thune said that his chart was accurate and was backed up by the Congressional Budget Office .

Countertop convection ovens can be found in many modern kitchens whether there is a conventional oven available or not .
Countertop convection ovens have many advantages because of their small size and diverse functionality .
The small size leaves more space is a small kitchen and the efficient heating offers economical energy usage .
But size and efficiency are n’t the only reasons countertop convection oven cooking is gaining in popularity .
People are often attracted to convection oven cooking by the flavor of the food cooked , as well as the need for the space saving features of countertop convection ovens .
We ’ll address the greater cooking flavors first .
Flavors of Convection Baked Food
Convection oven cooking has been a secret of chefs around the world for many years .
Ever wonder why your roast beef tastes so great at your favorite restaurant — nothing like when you cook it at home ?
And you ca n’t get the baked potatoes to taste quite as good at home .
Not to mention the “ to die for ” flakey crusts on the pastries from your favorite bakery — which you ca n’t get to taste the same baked at home , even when your cousin , who worked there , smuggled you the secret recipe ?
What makes the difference in that gourmet tasting food is the commercial convection oven .
Chefs have been using for a long time .
And chefs that use them love them .
Not only is the flavor of the food superior , the air circulates throughout the oven so the food all cooks at the same speed , regardless of placement in the oven .
No more food scorched on the bottom while the tops are n’t browned evenly .
And no need to cook cookies one pan at a time to get them uniform and perfect .
One of the best advantages is that convection ovens seal in the meat juices so steaks , roasts , chicken and turkey are more moist and flavorful .
Pastries , such as cookies , croissants or pies , will brown evenly regardless of rack placement .
Lots of pans in the oven do n’t cause any problems .
And , because of the quick , even heat , the flour and butter wo n’t fuse but flakes to perfection .
( that is why the secret recipe did n’t work at home )
Convection Ovens Come Home
So it is easy to see why convection ovens are no longer set aside for high - end restaurants , and are now a sought after addition to modern kitchens or the countertop of scores of home cooks .
But what makes them work ?
Countertop convection ovens , as well as a full sized convection oven or commercial convection ovens use radiant heat like traditional ovens but add air circulation to cook food more evenly and more quickly .
The convection ovens use fans to force hot air all around the food .
With the circulation of the hot air , the heat reaches all the foods evenly .
The result is that foods warm faster so that less energy and less cooking time is required .
What happens is that the circulating air pushes away the slight layer of air which otherwise surrounds and insulates what you are cooking .
This moving air creates a phenomenon somewhat like the wind chill factor you hear of on the weather news , only the factor is hotter because of the “ wind ” instead of colder .
Another advantage is that food cooks more evenly because the heat is n’t blocked from one dish by another .
Your steak , cookies or pizza or other foodstuffs will cook at the same rate no matter where it is placed in the oven .
Top , bottom , front , back — no difference .
Convection Cooking is Different
Because convection cooking is different than the majority of home cooks are used to , there is an adjustment period for switching to a convection oven .
For a creative cook this is no problem and the results will be the reward for learning something new .
Just follow a few convection oven tips and you will have no problems cooking like the pros .
In the long run , convection cooking is much easier and more satisfying than conventional cooking .
In a convection oven most foods will cook more quickly , which can be disconcerting when you set a turkey to be ready at 5 pm and it is done to perfection at 2 pm .
My daughter complained loudly with her first attempt , but loves her convection oven now .
Countertop Convection Ovens For Convenience
The next plus with countertop convection ovens is the energy and space saving nature .
Because convection ovens cook more quickly and at a lower temperature , you can save money and time .
It is especially helpful for cooking a small batch when you do n’t want to heat up a standard size oven or cooking a large amount of food at one time because you can use all your oven racks .
There are many countertop convection ovens to choose from , as well as commercial convection ovens and combined conventional / convection ranges .
You just need to decide which size is best for your kitchen and family requirements and features you want , then find the model that best suits your needs .
Some of the regular features to look for include digital or analog temperature control as well as a choice of settings for roast , broil or bake .
Some manufacturers include an automatic shut off when baking is done .
This is a great safety feature and especially helpful on the countertop convection ovens and especially for people like me , who need help remembering to check what ’s cooking .
Countertop convection ovens are no longer the secret of leading chefs .
You can have one too , regardless of the size of your kitchen or family cooking needs .
Be sure you get an oven that will be large enough for your needs .
Especially in the countertop models as size does vary .
There are many excellent models to choose from .
Some of the most popular of the countertop convection ovens are the Delonghi convection oven , Cuisinart , Waring , Hamilton Beach , the Deni convection oven and the Farberware convection oven .
Whether it is the compact size of the countertop convection ovens that attracts you , or the large capacity of the full sized model , the advantages of quicker cooking and reduced energy costs , or perhaps the superior taste are irresistible .
Sergeant Kimberly Munley was the heroine America desperately sought in the hours after the massacre at the Fort Hood army base in Texas .
But a week after Major Nidal Hasan allegedly shot and killed 13 people and wounded dozens more , it has emerged that a previously unheralded police sergeant may in fact have fired the bullets that ended the attack , not Munley .
A witness to the shooting spree told the New York Times today that Hasan was taken down by Senior Sergeant Mark Todd , a veteran police officer .
The revelations came as the US military announced today that it had charged Hasan with 13 counts of premeditated murder amid growing questions about the failure of US authorities to arrest Hasan before the massacre .
The White House said today that President Barack Obama had ordered an internal review of intelligence gathered on Hasan prior to the attack .
Obama said the inquiry by John Brennan , an adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism , would not interfere with the criminal investigation .
In TV appearances , Munley and Todd have thus far failed to clear up exactly who shot him .
Munley insisted that she fired at Hasan , but did not say whether she had hit him .
Todd talked of firing the shots that brought down Hasan - the first time he had ever fired at a human being in his 25 - year career - but could not say whether Hasan had already been shot .
" I seen him [ sic ] , I drew his attention toward me , and then he opened fire and then I neutralised him and secured him , " Todd told CBS 's Early Show this morning .
Pressed whether Hasan was still armed and threatening when he opened fire , Todd said : " We were engaged in a gunfight , and then I neutralised him , or we neutralised him . "
Hasan , 39 , is recovering in the hospital from police gunshot wounds .
Ballistics tests and further investigation may ultimately determine which of the two police sergeants shot him .
The tale of Munley 's apparent heroism recalls the case of Jessica Lynch , an army private first class who the US military said was wounded while fighting off Iraqi troops during the US invasion , reportedly firing her rifle heroically before being captured .
It later emerged she was injured in a vehicle accident during an ambush and was well cared for by the Iraqis .
Munley , a petite , highly - trained civilian police officer and firearms expert , was initially said to have encountered Hasan during the attack , rushed at him and shot him down , taking at least three bullets from his pistol in the process .
Quoting an anonymous eyewitness , however , the New York Times called into question that account , reporting that Hasan remained on his feet , apparently unharmed and reloading his pistol , after shooting Munley .
The witness said it was unclear whether Munley fired off a shot before Todd arrived seconds later , shooting Hasan until he fell to the ground then kicking his gun away and handcuffing him .
" It 's muscle memory , " Todd told CBS .
" In a situation like this you do n't have to think about it , you just react .
By the grace of god I 'm standing here with no injuries , with not a scratch . "
Contrary to previous reports , Hasan 's military personnel record indicates that he did not apply for an early discharge from the army , as a conscientious objector or for any other reason , according to military officials .
Hasan , who was born in the US to Palestinian parents , was widely understood to have sought and been denied an early separation from the army , a factor that could have helped explain why he allegedly snapped and went on the shooting rampage .
Family members have said that Hasan sought desperately to leave the army , especially ahead of an expected deployment to Afghanistan .
A cousin in the West Bank has said that as recently as a week before the incident the army rejected Hasan 's effort to gain an early separation .
The army , short on psychiatrists and desperate to retain Arab - Americans among its ranks , was highly unlikely to accede to such a request from Hasan , having paid for his medical training .
But the Pentagon has found no evidence Hasan ever formally sought to leave the military .
Another indication Hasan had not put in for a discharge :
He was promoted to the rank of major in May , after an army board endorsed his performance as an officer , the Washington Post reported .
Meanwhile , officials involved in Hasan 's medical training have described him as belligerent , defensive and argumentative when discussing his apparently deeply held Muslim faith .
Officials also described him as a mediocre student and a lazy worker , and said the combination led to a decision to send him to Fort Hood , where other medical personnel could pick up the slack if he continued to perform poorly and superior officers could document behaviour problems , the Associated Press reported .

Firefighters in Canada are fighting to contain several forest fires that have destroyed large swathes of land in the eastern province of Quebec .
The fires , thought to have been caused by lightning strikes , have sent clouds of smoke over the country 's border with the United States as far as Boston and Washington DC .
Up to 500 firefighters have been dropping water from planes over a group of 45 fires in the Lake St Jean region around 240 kilometres ( 150 miles ) north of Quebec City .
However they are being hampered by a lack of rain - none has been forecast until Thursday - and a tendency for the water to evaporate before it hits the fires .
" These are really big fires , we are using firebreaks , sprinklers , hoses and motorized pumps , " spokesman for the Quebec Forest Service Eric Santerre told the Associated Press news agency .
" We need rain to bring down the amount of smoke before we can go in . "
Safety fears
A further 75 firefighters have dug firebreaks and poured water on a second group of about 40 fires in the Nemiscau region south of James Bay , where around 630 people were evacuated from villages because of safety fears .
Smoke has blanketed the city of Montreal , leading city officials to warn children , the elderly and people with respiratory problems to remain indoors due to health fears .
The US states of New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania also advised residents with respiratory and heart conditions to stay indoors , with New York and New Jersey 's warnings extending state - wide , Pennsylvania 's extending to 20 counties .
Since the fires began last week up to 100,000 hectares ( 250,000 acres ) of land have been destroyed , officials from Quebec 's forest fire protection service said .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S.
House leaders have dropped plans to spend $ 550 million in the Air Force budget on passenger jets used by lawmakers and senior government officials , officials said on Monday .
The House of Representatives reversed the move to upgrade the executive jet fleet after public criticism , opposition from other lawmakers and the Defense Department had said it did not need more planes that it had requested .
“ If the Department of Defense does not want these aircraft , they will be eliminated from the bill , ” Representative John Murtha , chairman of a House panel on defense appropriations , said in a statement .
A spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she supports the decision .
Before leaving for the August congressional recess , the House approved a Defense Appropriation bill for fiscal year 2010 that included $ 550 million for three Gulfstream jets and five military versions of a Boeing 737 .
The Pentagon ’s original request was $ 220 million to purchase one Gulfstream plane and three Boeing Co. aircraft .
Murtha , a Pennsylvania Democrat , said the four additional planes his subcommittee ordered would have replaced older aircraft that have safety and maintenance issues .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 26/11/2009 ( 3960 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
She was heading home after a busy night leading Girl Guides through a badge ceremony .
Little did the 39 - year - old woman know she would need to confront a shotgun - wielding carjacker who would point his weapon at her as she stepped out of her car .
BORIS.MINKEVICH@FREEPRESS.MB.CA
Dawn ’s stick shift foiled a would - be carjacker .
But the self - described " mother bear " did n't scare easily , especially with her seven - and 12 - year - old daughters still in the vehicle .
When the would - be carjacker told her to hand over her keys , she did .
She calmly asked him if he could drive a standard vehicle .
Then the unexpected happened .
The man , whose driving abilities were apparently restricted to automatic transmissions , tossed the keys back , apologized and ran down a back lane .
" It was n't spunk .
It was n't bravado , " said Dawn , less than 24 hours after the attempted carjacking .
Dawn , who works as a special education teacher in the city , requested the Free Press not publish her last name .
She said she harbours no anger against the prospective carjacker , but she meant business when it came to protecting her kids .
The attack was random , she believes .
" He said , ' I 'm sorry for doing this to you , ' and he told me not to call the police , " she said .
She later said : " I was giving him whatever he wanted .
My priority was ... my children . "
She parked near her St. John 's Avenue home at about 9 p.m. with her two daughters .
The three were returning from a Girl Guides meeting .
Dawn opened her door and was getting ready to climb out of the car when she saw the man walking up with a gun pointed at her chest .
Another man stood behind him in the shadow of some elms .
Immediately , Dawn 's thoughts jumped to her daughters .
Next to her , one sat in the front passenger seat .
Her other daughter sat in the back .
She ordered them out .
" My concern was that he was going to get in the car and drive away , " she said .
" I wanted to make sure they were clear of the vehicle at that point . "
Her daughters immediately climbed out and stood on a nearby sidewalk , she said .
" The two understood the intensity of the situation , " she said .
And they watched as their mother passed over her keys , only to have them thrown back .
The three waited until after the two men were gone before running into a house and calling police .
Dawn said she is not angry with the carjacking suspects because she does n't know their backgrounds .
" There 's that level of empathy that I have ... it was n't personal , " she said .
" At the same time , safety is important , too . "
She and her husband , plus their three daughters , have lived on St. John 's since 2001 while they build another property .
She said she asked the man if he drove a standard because she was afraid he might grow angry if he realized he could n't drive the car .
" My concern was he would get in the car , realize that he could n't drive it and then there might be some ramification to that , " she said .
" ( I was concerned ) he would be angry and want to take it out on somebody . "
About 20 minutes later , police said , a 42 - year - old man and 38 - year - old woman were near their vehicle on the 300 block of Burrows Avenue when two men came up to the woman and threatened her with a shotgun as the man came out of their house .
The suspects then took off again .
One suspect is described as an aboriginal man , 16 to 18 years old , about 5 - foot - 8 .
Police said he has short black hair and wore dark jeans and a red lumberjack jacket .
The second suspect is described as an aboriginal man , 25 to 27 years old .
Police said he had long , ponytailed black hair and wore a dark nylon jacket .

It ’s not really a surprise to see Abu Dhabi hand over another bunch of dollars to its wayward relative Dubai .
It had to be so ; it was just a matter of time .
The bailout or handout or whatever one wishes to call this latest transfer of money was necessary to shore up the reputation of the Emirates .
It ’s the second time that Dubai has had help from it ’s more conservative and wealthier neighbour .
In February 2009 Abu Dhabi pledged $ 10 billion to prop up the ailing Emirate in a move to assist Dubai ’s $ 20 billion long - term bond program .
The Central Bank of the UAE bought up the first tranche of the bond issue .
Read
This latest bailout of $ 10 billion has been a must - do action .
When one of your poor relatives , and Dubai with very little oil reserves may be considered that , gets ahead of itself by engineering a building boom literally built on sand it is but a matter of time before the white flag is hoisted .
Add to this extraordinary grandiose real estate vision a global recession that world wide knocked property prices down a peg or two and one could easily see that the possibility of an economic shock in Dubai were highly likely .
Initially it seemed as if Dubai had decided on a solo flight by announcing on 25 November 2009 a unilateral decision to restructure $ 26 billion in debt .
For this you may read – not pay its debt obligation on time .
The global market went into shock .
It was as if the stock exchanges simultaneously suffered heart attacks .
Some reaction had been anticipated as the announcement was cleverly made just before Thanksgiving on 26 a long week - end in the USA and the Eid al - Adha Festival a few days later on 28 November .
It is mooted by economists that the fall - out would have been even worse if this timing had not been used to soften the blow .
Regardless of this clever timing , the markets reacted dramatically with stock exchanges posting serious drops and currencies such as the Euro and Pound taking part in jittery dance routines .
To a certain extent the dessert dust stirred up is still inhibiting a clear view of the action .
It seems that the bailout coincides with a deadline for a payment related to an Islamic bond or sukuk due on Monday December 23 .
Whatever the reason , whether an Islamic bond or the global economy , the funding provided by Abu Dhabi has one significant purpose and that is to shore up confidence in not only Dubai but the entire Middle East block of countries .
It will be immensely damaging to the entire region if one of its members defaults on repaying interest on debt never mind the capital sum borrowed .
A severe knock to ones reputation is of greater significance than any actual reality .
Lehman Brothers discovered this when they had to close their doors on facing irreparable damage to their reputation .
And casting ones mind even further back the demise of Arthur Anderson was such an instance too .
Abu Dhabi had to face the fact that it needed to fight for the reputation of the UAE as well as the entire Middle East Region .
It ’s a heavy responsibility to carry , but regrettably this Emirate has little choice in the matter .
The consequences to the region of allowing Dubai to falter would be a hugely damaging blow from which the region might not recover for many years .

The notion of a neutral money is no less contradictory than that of a money of stable purchasing power .
Money without a driving force of its own would not , as people assume , be a perfect money ; it would not be money at all .
It is a popular fallacy to believe that perfect money should be neutral and endowed with unchanging purchasing power , and that the goal of monetary policy should be to realize this perfect money .
It is easy to understand this idea as a reaction against the still - more - popular postulates of the inflationists .
But it is an excessive reaction , it is in itself confused and contradictory , and it has worked havoc because it was strengthened by an inveterate error inherent in the thought of many philosophers and economists .
These thinkers are misled by the widespread belief that a state of rest is more perfect than one of movement .
Their idea of perfection implies that no more perfect state can be thought of and consequently that every change would impair it .
The best that can be said of a motion is that it is directed toward the attainment of a state of perfection in which there is rest because every further movement would lead into a less perfect state .
Motion is seen as the absence of equilibrium and full satisfaction , as a manifestation of trouble and want .
As far as such thoughts merely establish the fact that action aims at the removal of uneasiness and ultimately at the attainment of full satisfaction , they are well - founded .
But one must not forget that rest and equilibrium are not only present in a state in which perfect contentment has made people perfectly happy , but no less in a state in which , although wanting in many regards , they do not see any means of improving their condition .
The absence of action is not only the result of full satisfaction ; it can no less be the corollary of the inability to render things more satisfactory .
It can mean hopelessness as well as contentment .
With the real universe of action and unceasing change , with the economic system which cannot be rigid , neither neutrality of money nor stability of its purchasing power are compatible .
A world of the kind that the necessary requirements of neutral and stable money presuppose would be a world without action .
It is therefore neither strange nor vicious that in the frame of such a changing world money is neither neutral nor stable in purchasing power .
All plans to render money neutral and stable are contradictory .
Money is an element of action and consequently of change .
Changes in the money relation , i.e. , in the relation of the demand for and the supply of money , affect the exchange ratio between money on the one hand and the vendible commodities on the other hand .
These changes do not affect at the same time and to the same extent the prices of the various commodities and services .
They consequently affect the wealth of the various members of society in different ways .
Holding on to hope may not make patients happier as they deal with chronic illness or diseases , according to a new study by University of Michigan Health System researchers .
" Hope is an important part of happiness , " said Peter A. Ubel , M.D. , director of the U - M Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in Medicine and one of the authors of the happily hopeless study , " but there 's a dark side of hope .
Sometimes , if hope makes people put off getting on with their life , it can get in the way of happiness . "
The results showed that people do not adapt well to situations if they are believed to be short - term .
Ubel and his co-authors -- both from U - M and Carnegie Mellon University -- studied patients who had new colostomies : their colons were removed and they had to have bowel movements in a pouch that lies outside their body .
At the time they received their colostomy , some patients were told that the colostomy was reversible -- that they would undergo a second operation to reconnect their bowels after several months .
Others were told that the colostomy was permanent and that they would never have normal bowel function again .
The second group -- the one without hope -- reported being happier over the next six months than those with reversible colostomies .
" We think they were happier because they got on with their lives .
They realized the cards they were dealt , and recognized that they had no choice but to play with those cards , " says Ubel , who is also a professor in the Department of Internal Medicine .
" The other group was waiting for their colostomy to be reversed , " he added .
" They contrasted their current life with the life they hoped to lead , and did n't make the best of their current situation . "
The research was published in this month 's edition of Health Psychology .

Ubel was joined in the research by Dylan M. Smith , Ph.D. , a research specialist at the Ann Arbor VA Health Services Research and Development Center and a U - M psychologist ; Aleksandra Jankovic , of U - M's Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in Medicine and George Loewenstein , professor in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University .
Loewenstein said these results also may explain why people who lose a spouse to death often recover better emotionally over time than those who get divorced .
" If your husband or wife dies , you have closure .
There are n't any lingering possibilities for reconciliation , " Loewenstein said .
Ubel said health professionals find it easier to deliver optimistic news to patients even when they believe the prognosis is unfavorable , justifying it by assuming that holding on to hope was better for the patient .
Said Loewenstein : " It may be easier for a doctor to deliver a hopeful message to a patient , even when there is n't much objective reason for hope , but it may not be best for the patient . "
" Hopeful messages may not be in the best interests of the patient and may interfere with the patient 's emotional adaptation , " Ubel says .
" I do n't think we should take hope away .
But I think we have to be careful about building up people 's hope so much that they put off living their lives . "
The research was funded by the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development .
Smith was supported by a career development award from the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Ron Paul vs. Lindsey Graham
Created : October 14 , 2009 15:36 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
It ’s on .
The Texas congressman is milking Sen. Lindsey Graham ’s ( R - S.C. ) attack on his followers and policies for all it ’s worth , telling members of his Campaign for Liberty that he ’ll mount a media offensive against Republicans who want their party “ controlled by the ‘ neoconservatives . ’ ”
For far too long , the Republican Party has been controlled by the “ neoconservatives , ” those who readily abandon the free market at the drop of a hat if it means expanding government power and who think the United States should be the policeman of the world .
They want us to support those who throw substance and principle to the wind in favor of political expediency .
Last Monday night , Senator Lindsey Graham reiterated his disdain for Ron Paul and limited government conservatives at a town hall when he said that he was not going to allow the Republican Party to be “ hijacked by Ron Paul . ”
Instead , he thinks we should get behind those who he tells us “ can win , ” even if it means abandoning every belief we hold dear in the process .
In addition to his afternoon appearance on Judge Napolitano ’s Freedom Watch , Congressman Paul will be responding to the neoconservatives on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer tonight at 6 pm eastern and also on MSNBC’s The Ed Show at 6:30 pm eastern .

Could it all be a hoax ?
Maybe it 's a massive joke , but all kinds of Norwegian news sites are reporting on it .
According to NKR — Norway 's national TV channel — it could be related to a rocket fired from a Russian submarine in the White Sea .
The Russians are denying any part on it at this at the moment .
Nick Banbury , a witness located at Harstad , described how it all happened :
We are used to seeing lots of auroras here in Arctic Norway , but on my way to work this morning I saw something completely unexpected .
Between 7:50 and 8:00 a.m. local time , there was a strange light in the sky .
It consisted initially of a green beam of light similar in colour to the aurora with a mysterious rotating spiral at one end .
This spiral then got bigger and bigger until it turned into a huge halo in the sky with the green beam extending down to the earth .

As hard as it is to believe , you can't dispute the fact that the strange spiral was witnessed and recorded by thousands of people from hundreds of miles away , which means that the phenomenon occurred at a very high altitude .
Even Phil Plait from Bad Astronomy agrees that this is real , and says that it was probably a rocket out of control .
Norwegian astronomers and news outlets have actually confirmed that this was a failed Russian missile launch .

The Transatlantic accent , also called a Mid-Atlantic accent , is a way of speaking English that is halfway between American and British .
It makes you sound like you have a good education but no one can tell quite where you are from .
You hear it in old Hollywood films from the 1930s and 1940s .
It is the accent of Cary Grant , Katherine Hepburn , William F Buckley and ( at least in some films ) God .
There is no town in the world where people grow up speaking English that way .
Instead you get the accent in one of three ways :
Learn the accent on purpose ( actors used to do that ) .
Grow up or live on both sides of the Atlantic ( but that can lead to even stranger accents , like those of Loyd Grossman and Madonna ) .
Pick it up at a top boarding school in America before the 1960s .
The accent comes from American boarding schools in New England where students were taught to speak English in more of an RP or high - class British way .
In the 1930s and 1940s it was seen as a good accent to use in film and theatre since it sounded universal and not from any particular part of the world .
That makes it a good accent for God and creatures from outer space .
You do not hear it much any more because people have grown used to the general American accent , thanks in part to Humphrey Bogart and the extremely Middle American John Wayne .
Transatlantic English goes something like this :
Start with a mainstream American accent .
Drop your r’s at the end of words , like in “ fear ” and “ winner ” .
Say all your t’s as t’s not d’s ( like in “ water ” and “ butter ” ) .
Use RP ( British ) vowels .
So “ dance ” becomes “ dahns ” .
If you start from a British accent the rules are different .
It is an Americanized RP accent .
It is a very particular accent .
There is even a book , now out of print , called “ Teach Yourself Transatlantic : Theatre Speech for Actors ” ( 1986 ) by Robert L. Hobbs .
It is a hard accent to do – people will laugh at you if you do not get it right .
So it takes plenty of practice .
But for the British it is an easier accent to master than a general American one .
It is a good accent for those foreign to English , strangely enough : since no one grows up speaking it , you will not sound to anyone like you have a foreign accent !
Some learn it to go into business overseas .
Some who spoke with a Transatlantic accent or something close to it : Katherine Hepburn , Ingrid Bergman , Franklin Roosevelt , William F Buckley ( in his own way ) , Niles and Frasier on “ Frasier ” , the millionaire on “ Gilligan ’s Island ” , Orson Welles in “ Citizen Kane ” , Peter Jennings , Vincent Price , Anthony Hopkins , Cary Grant , the Tin Man in “ The Wizard of Oz ” , Bette Davis , and most British actors who try to sound American ( but not , of course , Idris Elba or Hugh Laurie of “ House ” ) .

Thirteen states have laws that legalize medical marijuana : State Year passed How passed California 1996 Ballot measure Alaska 1998 Ballot measure Oregon 1998 Ballot measure Washington 1998 Ballot measure Maine 1999 Ballot measure Colorado 2000 Ballot measure Hawaii 2000 Legislature Nevada 2000 Ballot measure Montana 2004 Ballot measure Vermont 2004 Legislature Rhode Island 2006 Legislature New Mexico 2007 Legislature Michigan 2008 Ballot measure Source : ProCon.org LOS ANGELES 
Almost 13 years after California became the first state to allow the sale of marijuana for some medical conditions storefront purveyors of the drug are nearly as easy to find as a taco stand .
Yet police and prosecutors say the law is vague on who can sell pot and in what circumstances .
They worry that the state unwittingly created safe havens for drug pushers who are doping the population with immunity .
" They appear to be run by drug dealers who see an opening in the market and a way to make a fast buck , " says San Diego district attorney Bonnie Dumanis , who says every pot store her office has looked at is operating illegally .
The tangle of regulations and alleged criminality that has followed in the aftermath of California 's first in the nation medical marijuana law is hardly restricted to the Golden State .
Thirteen states , from New England to the Pacific Northwest , have passed laws by ballot or legislative action permitting marijuana possession for some medical reasons even though the drug is illegal under federal law .
Some , like Rhode Island , where a medical marijuana law passed in 2006 , officials are still trying to figure out how to set up places where people can buy the drug .
In Colorado , which approved medical marijuana sales in 2000 , cities are passing moratoriums to halt the blossoming of marijuana stores .
New Mexico's lone non-profit licensed to distribute pot is overwhelmed by demand .
In Washington state , a legal dispute rages over whether the law permits people to just grow their own pot or also buy it from dispensaries .
Stewart Richlin , lawyer for more than 150 medical marijuana collectives in Southern California , says states that legalize medical marijuana must accept the commerce that follows .
" Once we acknowledge patients have a right to cannabis , they have to get it somewhere , " he says .
The medical marijuana movement was begun by advocates who say pot can provide relief for a wide range of illnesses , from AIDS to arthritis .
Why should people suffer when pot can help , they say ?
" It 's highly effective in certain circumstances , " San Diego physician Bob Blake says .
Critics say a law meant to benefit a relatively few number of patients is being exploited by entrepreneurs who are making big money .
Los Angeles Police Lt. Paul Torrence says the department investigated a clinic in the fashionable Venice area that was doing up to $ 140,000 in sales a month .
In San Diego , where authorities this month shut down 14 medical marijuana sellers , Dumanis said at least one was operating on that scale as well , over $ 700,000 in six months .
City Council members Janice Hahn and Dennis Zine , in proposing Los Angeles tax medical marijuana sales , point to Oakland , where they say four licensed dispensaries had gross sales of $ 19.6 million in 2008 .
" It 's a very , very profitable business , " says Torrence , of LAPD 's gang and narcotics division .
" That 's clearly outside the boundaries of the voters ' intention in passing Prop 215 . "
California voters approved that proposition in 1996 .
The law leaves regulation up to local governments , and there 's a vast difference in how receptive each is to medicinal pot .
State Attorney General Jerry Brown issued guidelines that said non-profit cooperatives and collectives are legal if certain requirements are met .
In Los Angeles , the growth of storefronts selling marijuana has been explosive .
Torrence says there are more than 400 registered with the city .
But there may be many more — as many as 800 applications have been filed and many operate without approval , says Jane Usher , special assistant city attorney .
" The practical reality has proven to be these facilities have by and large opened without any kind of registration , application , nothing , " Usher said .
Colorado says it 's beginning to see something similar .
Its law created a state registry to track patients authorized to use medical marijuana , but made no provision for sellers .
" They have kind of sprung up rather recently in numbers across the state , " says Mike Saccone , spokesman for Attorney General John Suthers .
" Law enforcement is concerned . "
To qualify for medical marijuana in California , patients must have a doctor 's " recommendation . "
Prescriptions for pot are prohibited by federal law .
Advertisements abound from doctors who recommend medical marijuana to qualifying patients .
Blake , 60 , who went into a practice devoted to medical marijuana after 28 years as an emergency room physician , says he does n't use it himself but sees pot as a safer alternative to morphine , OxyContin and other conventional painkillers .
" I never saw a person die of a marijuana overdose .
Narcotics overdose ?
You bet , " he said .
Police are skeptical about the medical need in most cases , Torrence said .
" I have yet to see a person enter the clinic that appears to have any kind of medical problem , " he said .
" Most of the people I see going in are young people that appear very healthy . "

Oh , robots , they grow up so fast , do n’t they ?
No wait a minute … they do n’t .
Well , anyway , Honda celebrated the ninth birthday of their famous ASIMO robot at the beginning of the month .
With over 200 fans attending the ceremony at Honda headquarters in Tokyo , the young robot was dancing for joy .
Honda invited many other nine year olds ( and adults ) to the celebration and had silent comedy duo Gamarjabat perform to entertain them ( watch it here ) .
Executive Chief Engineer ( and father of ASIMO ) Masato Hirose spoke , reaffirming his commitment to developing a robot that can live and work in the human world .
While Honda has reportedly spent hundreds of millions of dollars on ASIMO , executives decided to cut costs and keep the cake a cardboard facsimile rather than the real thing .
What do robots need with cake anyway ?
ASIMO has certainly been a favorite here at the Hub over the years .
We ’ve seen the bot walk through difficult terrain , endure an early brain control system , and even fall down the stairs .
The next nine years are likely to be even more eventful for ASIMO as robotics continues to grow rapidly .
So Happy Birthday , ASIMO , enjoy your childhood while you can .
They ’ve got to put you to work sometime .
Do n’t they ?
You ca n’t just have a robot wandering around doing nothing all day …

Barack Obama stepped into the chaotic final hours of the Copenhagen summit today saying he was convinced the world could act " boldly and decisively " on climate change .
But his speech offered no indication America was ready to embrace bold measures , after world leaders had been working desperately against the clock to try to paper over an agreement to prevent two years of wasted effort — and a 10 - day meeting — from ending in total collapse .
Obama , who had been skittish about coming to Copenhagen at all unless it could be cast as a foreign policy success , looked visibly frustrated as he appeared before world leaders .
He offered no further commitments on reducing emissions or on finance to poor countries beyond Hillary Clinton 's announcement yesterday that America would support a $ 100 bn global fund to help developing nations adapt to climate change .
He did not even press the Senate to move ahead on climate change legislation , which environmental organisations have been urging for months .
The president 's speech followed the publication of draft text , obtained by the Guardian this morning , that reveals the enormous progress needed from world leaders in the final hours of the Copenhagen climate change summit to achieve a strong deal .
The draft says countries " ought " to limit global warming to 2C , but crucially does not bind them to do so .
The text , drafted by a select group of 28 leaders – including UK prime minister , Gordon Brown – in the early hours of this morning , also proposes extending negotiations for another year until the next scheduled UN meeting on climate change in Mexico City in December 2010 .
In his address , Obama did say America would follow through on his administration 's clean energy agenda , and that it would live up to its pledges to the international community .
" We have charted our course , we have made our commitments , and we will do what we say , " Obama said .
But in the absence of any evidence of that commitment the words rang hollow and there was a palpable sense of disappointment in the audience .
Instead , he warned African states and low island nations who have been resisting what they see as a weak agreement that the later alternative — no agreement — was far worse .
" We know the fault lines because we 've been imprisoned by them for years .
But here is the bottom line : we can embrace this accord , take a substantial step forward , and continue to refine it and build upon its foundation , " he said .
" Or we can again choose delay , falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years .
And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month , year after year – all while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible . "
He also took a dig at China , drawing attention to its status as the world 's biggest emitter and reinforcing America 's hardline on the issue of accountability for greenhouse gas emissions .
The lacklustre speech proved a huge frustration to a summit that had been looking to Obama to use his stature on the world stage – and his special following among African leaders – to try to come to an ambitious deal .
The president was drawn into the chaos within minutes of his arrival at Copenhagen , ditching his schedule to take part in a meeting of major industrialised and rapidly emerging economies .
Responding to Obama 's speech , a British official said : " Gordon Brown is committed to doing all he can and will stay until the very last minute to secure a deal ... but others also need to show the same level of commitment .
The prospects of a deal are not great . "
Many reactions were strongly critical of Obama .
Hugo Chávez , the president of Venezuela , described Obama 's speech as " ridiculous " and the US 's initial offer of a $ 10 bn fund for poor countries in the draft text as " a joke " .
Tim Jones , a spokesman for the World Development Movement , said : " The president said he came to act , but showed little evidence of doing so .
He showed no awareness of the inequality and injustice of climate change .
If America has really made its choice , it is a choice that condemns hundreds of millions of people to climate change disaster . "
Friends of the Earth said in a statement , " Obama has deeply disappointed not only those listening to his speech at the UN talks , he has disappointed the whole world . "
The World Wildlife Fund said Obama had let down the international community by failing to commit to pushing for action in Congress : " The only way the world can be sure the US is standing behind its commitments is for the president to clearly state that climate change will be his next top legislative priority . "
The extent of crisis in the talks has taken leaders by surprise .
The Brazilian leader , Lula da Silva , told the conference that the all - night negotiating sessions took him back to his days as a trade union leader negotiating with his bosses .
Special By By Carol Forsloff Nov 9 , 2009 in Environment Several days ago CBS News reported the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warning for states to comply with quality water standards .
In an era of environmental concerns , there is remarkable deviation in water quality across the U.S. Delores Blalock , a resident of Natchitoches , Louisiana , is planning to install a water filtering system in a house where she is living as a caretaker .
She is familiar with the issues of water pollution to some extent , as she has done some research about the negative consequences to the environment in areas where hydraulic fracturing has been used to tap natural gas .
Her property in Saline , Louisiana is approximately 50 acres , and folks around her have capitalized on natural gas companies using their land to drill for gas lines .
She maintains since the drilling has taken place outside the boundaries of the Clear Water
Act that there should be certain safeguards exercised for protection of the water .
Recently she expressed special concern about Natchitoches water , given the regular updates from the city offices that the city water is not up to quality standards .
She said , " I worry about the water around here . "
Her answer to the problem is to use filters for shower and drinking .
While Blaolock worries about water quality in Natchitoches and other areas of Louisiana , Ed Matthews of Portland , Oregon brags about the water quality of Portland .
An avid reader of the Portland Oregonian , Matthews mentions that there have been entrepreneurs interested in literally bottling Bull Run water because it is of such good quality .
He remarks , " I 'm proud to live in an area where the water quality is considered excellent and where I do n't have to worry . " .
Across the United States , people are beginning to take special interest in protecting the environment .
In the meantime the USDA has issued directives to those areas requiring compliance with water quality standards .
It is of interest to those who advocate good environmental standards for quality of life , as both Matthews and Blalock maintain .
According to CBS News , the USDA provided the six states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and the District of Columbia with a set of expectations in order to reduce pollution in rivers , streams and the Bay in order to meet standards of good quality water .
In parts of Louisiana , the concern has been expressed by citizens about pollution and how oil and gas drilling might negatively affect water quality .
Residents in Oregon , however , brag about Bull Run water , eagerly drinking what they consider nature 's best right out of the tap .

Is Timothy Geithner tough enough to be an effective US treasury secretary ?
The Obama administration 's finance man is getting a true kicking today over his role in last year 's botched bail - out of AIG in which Wall Street banks seem to have run rings round the government .
Geithner was chairman of the New York Federal Reserve which led an $ 85 bn effort to salvage AIG when the insurer was wobbling on the edge of bankruptcy in September last year .
The inspector - general appointed to oversee the US government 's bail - out efforts , Neil Barofsky , has produced a scathing report today attacking poor negotiation , ineffective contingency planning and a lack of public openness in the handling of this rescue .
" How can Geithner survive this ? " demanded the Huffington Post in a banner headline this morning .
Congress is investigating the AIG bail - out which , in the eyes of both Democratic and Republican critics , was a dismal saga of government officials crumbling under pressure from Wall Street .
One Republican , Darrell Issa , has already raised questions about the " transparency , accountability and wisdom " of the New York Fed 's actions .
Having pumped $ 85bn of taxpayers ' funds into AIG , the Fed is accused of allowing $ 32.5 bn to flow out of the insurer 's back door to satisfy , in full , the major counterparties to the company 's disastrous credit default swaps - including Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , Societe Generale , Barclays and Deutsche Bank .
Critics argue that instead of paying out these clients in full , the Fed ought to have taken a tough negotiating line to safeguard public money .
It seems that the Fed did politely ask each of the banks concerned to take a " haircut " but , unsurprisingly , they all politely declined - with the exception of UBS which offered a 2 % reduction .
France 's banking regulator stepped in to say that two banks - SocGen and Calyon - would have to get their full payout under French law , which seems to have torpedoed any further discussion .
The inspector - general is dismissive of this approach , pointing out that an insistence by the Fed on treating every bank equally gave each institution " effective veto power " over any deal .
Geithner 's negotiating strategy , says the report , " had little likelihood of success " in spite of the fact that the Fed ought to have held a trump card - that without its intervention , AIG would have gone bust and the banks would have been left severely out of pocket .
This weakness is very fishy - particularly when , as Barofsky points out , the US government felt able to demand very considerable concessions from creditors of General Motors and Chrysler following the motor companies ' bail - outs .
Wall Street seems to have more sway than humble Midwestern car parts suppliers .
On top of that , the Fed initially refused to disclose the identity of AIG 's counterparties , warning that exposure could further undermine the insurer and jeopardise the stability of the markets .
When , under intense political pressure , the amounts paid to individual banks were published , the inspector - general points out that " the sky did not fall " .
He says that a fundamental principle was compromised - " the public is entitled to know what it being done with government funds " .
It all adds up to a sorry picture and casts Geithner in a particularly poor light .
It hardly inspires confidence in the man now charged by the Obama administration with devising ways to crack down on reckless risk - taking and telephone - number sized bonuses on Wall Street .

A feisty 82 - year - old woman has described how she beat off two intruders with a floor brush and her Bible at her east Belfast home .
Maisie Chapman was resting at her Oberon Street home on Saturday afternoon .
She heard a noise and found a stranger in her hallway and a second man upstairs ransacking her bedroom .
" I have a brush behind the door ...
I lifted it and gave them a whack , " Mrs Chapman said .
" When I lifted the brush , I lifted my Bible and said , ' This is the word of God ' .
They 're bad rascals and I think I scared them - one of them was shaking . "
Earlier , the stranger in the hall claimed he was a policeman .
But he had no identity card .
Mrs Chapman went upstairs to where the second man was ransacking her bedroom .
" I started to scream when he pushed me on to the bed and he told me to stop , " she said .
When I lifted the brush , I lifted my Bible and said , ' This is the word of God ' .
They 're bad rascals and I think I scared them
Maisie Chapman
" But I did n't stop and I just kept screaming .
Then he got his two hands and held them over my mouth and I could n't breathe .
But I got one of my arms free and I pushed him and I got free .
" I hobbled down the stairs and went over to my neighbours to get the police . "
The men left the house empty handed .
Mrs Chapman , a widow , was shaken by her ordeal .
It is not the first time that people have broken into her home .
It has happened twice before .
But she has lived in Oberon Street for more than 50 years and she said she has no intention of leaving it .

There 's a battle line being drawn , separating those who believe in the dollar carry trade and those who do n't .
Roubini and the IMF both believe in it , and thinks it 's a major problem .
Critics include David P. Goldman , the pseudonymous " Mad Hedge Fund Trader " contributor to this site , and now Goldman Sachs , or at least analyst Mark Tan .
FT Alphaville quotes his latest note :
The IMF in a report prepared for the recently concluded G - 20 Finance minister ’s meeting cited ‘ In addition to foreign funds moving into emerging market equities , led by expectations of higher growth , there are indications that the U.S. dollar is now serving as the funding currency for carry trades .
While there has been a pick - up in investment in higher yielding currencies and assets , there is a distinction to be made between speculative carry trades and investments made on the basis of stronger EM fundamentals .
It is hard to draw the line where investment activity becomes a speculative bubble but we do not think that we are in the midst of a ‘ carry bubble ’ at the moment .
Yes , inflows into EM assets have accelerated rapidly over the last several months but this has also arguably been led by improving fundamentals in these countries in general .
One other point he makes , according to FT , is that a lot of the selling in the USD is being exacerbated by foreign owners of US assets , who are hedging -- thus the selling is not necessarily a directional bat on the currency 's decline .
Contrary to what previous reports have shown , the popular uTorrent application may very well not be the most used BitTorrent client .
According to data collected from more than 357 million unique peers IDs , the Chinese BitTorrent client ' Thunder ' is actually the most used BitTorrent client .
It is no secret that BitTorrent is huge in China .
Earlier this year The Pirate bay published a map of all their tracker connections , which revealed that roughly a third of all connections were made from China , compared to a measly 8 % from runner up the US .
What is new to many is that contrary to most other parts of the world , people from China also prefer to use a local BitTorrent client to manage their downloads .
This new insight comes from data collected from three of the largest BitTorrent trackers adding up to a sample of 357 million unique peer IDs .
With the help of other tracker operators , EZTV ’s NovaKing has gathered statistics from the OpenBitTorrent , PublicBitTorrent and Denis Stalker trackers .
Spanning over a week , the overall statistics show that it ’s not uTorrent but actually the Chinese BitTorrent client Thunder ( also known as Xunlei ) that has the largest market share .
We have to admit that this data came as a complete surprise to us and that we initially doubted its validity , but TorrentFreak is assured that these statistics are indeed correct .
Previously we have reported on the market share of the various BitTorrent clients , but Thunder never made it into the list of most used clients .
In this list below , however , Thunder / Xunlei actually beats uTorrent .
10 most used BitTorrent clients .
The logical explanation for this surprising result is that the previous statistics were gathered from a sample of torrents that did not include many Chinese downloaders .
Apparently the Chinese prefer to use a local client ( and local content ) that ’s available in Chinese , instead of uTorrent or Vuze which have a dominant market share in the rest of the world .
When we go through the rest of the stats we see that uTorrent has a small lead over Vuze ( formerly Azureus ) .
However , the difference is much smaller than our previous market share reports have suggested .
This is another indication that the sample used for our previous reports was not as representative as it should have been , despite the large sample size .
Transmission and BitComet have a market share of 3.3 and 4 percent respectively , which is in line with previous reports .
In ninth place we find another Chinese client , Tuotu , which is listed as Unknown in the list above .
The new data sheds a new light on the market share of BitTorrent clients .
More than anything it reveals that there are quite a few regional differences when it comes to BitTorrent habits .
By itself this is nothing new , but that a BitTorrent client used by tens of millions of people can fly under the radar for so long outside China has certainly surprised us .

Here are six principles I strive to live by .
This is my own “ personal productivity manifesto ” : it summarizes what works for me about personal productivity .
Whenever I follow these guidelines , I am at my very best , feeling productive and joyful .
If I feel that I am doing things outside these guidelines , I know I can refer to them and quickly get back on track .
Since these principles work so well for me , I figured they might work for you , too .
Here they are :
Principle 6 : Devote Time
No matter how capable or gifted we may be , it ’s an illusion to think we can do it all .
As my favorite productivity adage goes , we can do anything , but not everything .
At every moment , we ’re presented with infinite possibilities — we really could be doing anything !
But freedom to do whatever we set our sights on comes at a price , and the price is that we need to constantly make choices about what really matters to us .
These choices , at the most fundamental level , always boil down to how we allocate and spend our time .
The value of our achievements is primarily determined by what we consistently invest our time in .
We need to be aware of that every day , diligently investing the time in what matters and having the courage to let the unimportant stuff go .
How to Apply this Principle
Use a time budget .
In a time budget you define shares of time for the areas or goals you care about .
It ’s just like a money budget , but for time : it guarantees that you do n’t overspend on things that do n’t matter , so you can make the most out of the things that do .
To learn more about setting up a time budget , check out Time Budget : An Easy Way to Avoid Prioritization Dilemmas and Keep Your Life Balanced .
Principle 5 : Focus Your Attention
If the previous principle was about allocating time for the things that matter , this one is about how well you ’re able to spend that time .
Very often it seems we just can’t concentrate , even though we know what we should be doing , right ?
Resistance , procrastination , allowing ourselves to get sidetracked by distractions : these are formidable obstacles even for the most resolute people .
Developing a strategy for overcoming resistance and dealing with distractions , then , is essential for maximum productivity .
How to Apply this Principle
Use time boxing .
Time boxing is a technique I use every day to overcome procrastination , conquer perfectionism and maximize overall efficiency .
The concept is really simple : delimit blocks of time to work on tasks .
But do n’t let the simplicity of the concept deceive you : you really got to try it to see how effective it is in overcoming resistance , focusing your attention and actually doing what needs to get done .
To learn more about time boxing , check out 15 Time Boxing Strategies to Get Things Done .
Principle 4 : Honor Thy Commitments
Personal productivity is not about cramming as much stuff as we possibly can in our days .
Here is a situation that sometimes happens to me , and I am sure it must have happened to you too : in a given day we write down a gazillion tasks to do , cross a lot of them off but , at the end of the day , still feel anxious about the tasks we did n’t do .
Why is that ?
The feeling of being productive comes not from the quantity of tasks we do , but from honoring the commitments we set for ourselves .
Doing what we said we would do is what we should primarily strive for .
Tasks that keep being left undone in our to do lists are broken promises to ourselves , and are a sure recipe for frustration : no matter how much we do in our days , we ’ll always look at them and feel bad about ourselves .
Before trying to get more stuff done , make sure you honor your current promises ( to yourself and to others ) :
Be clear about them , drop those that you know you wo n’t be able to honor and then ensure that you really complete the ones that remain .
How to Apply this Principle
Use will - do lists .
‘ Will do ’ lists replace a bunch of intentions ( the traditional to do ’s ) with a small set of commitments .
It ’s not only much shorter than a to - do list , but also does n’t grow as your day progresses — and you feel just terrific when you cross off 100 % of it day after day .

Go With a ‘ Will - Do ’ List Instead .
Principle 3 : Develop a Sustainable Pace
We need to strike a balance between work and play — between engagement and rest , between creation and recreation .
In the productivity game we should take our leisure time as seriously as our work time .
Even if we feel energetic and motivated to work long hours , the most effective long - term strategy is to hold ourselves back when feeling too enthusiastic and follow a sustainable pace instead .
Also , defining clear boundaries between work and rest is very important : “ Work when you ’re working , rest when you ’re resting ” , I often say .
Whenever I forget this , I end up in a very ineffective ‘ not - quite - working / not - quite - resting ’ zombie - like state .
How to Apply this Principle
The two tools I use for the previous principles also work wonders here :
Will - do lists .
As soon as I ’m done with the will - do list for the day , I ’m done : I must resist the urge to work longer .
I admit that sometimes — especially when I ’m feeling highly energetic — I still stretch and go “ get the most out of the day ” .
However , I always regret it the day after , as I ca n’t sustain the pace for too long and end up much worse than if I had just stopped working at the right time instead .
Time boxes .
also help keep work activities together .
That helps a lot in making the boundaries between work and recreation very clear .
Principle 2 : Keep Moving On
More important than setting big goals is to just keep going .
I know this goes against most of the “ set bold goals for yourself ” advice you see everywhere , but it ’s what works for me .
Going after a “ big vision ” is something that always felt awkward , and it always made me more anxious than it helped .
Now , what does work for me is to constantly think about how to improve my life and define little steps to make it happen .
Think continuous improvement .
Take small steps and see how things change .
Experiment .
Sure , it ’s perfectly fine to have a general direction , but do n’t get too obsessed about it : circumstances will change — you will change .
It ’s in each step that you learn and adjust your direction .
How to Apply this Principle
Daily and Weekly Reviews .
Assess your projects and tasks every day and make sure that you define next steps for all your projects .
Make them small , but ensure you make progress every single day .
Forget New Year ’s Resolutions .
Plan , review and adjust your steps every day and every week .
Ask “ How can I take a step so small that it is impossible to fail ? ”
This is one of my favorite questions ever ( I got it from the book One Small Step Can Change Your Life — summary here ) .
I ask it every single day when reviewing my projects and task lists .
It melts resistance away and , when asked frequently , keeps you on track and energetic to keep going .
Principle 1 : Feel Good .
Now .
“ Being productive ” only makes sense if you ’re enjoying yourself as you work on the stuff that ’s relevant .
If you ’re not , none of the things we discussed here really matters .
Personal productivity is a state of mind : a feeling that you ’re doing what you believe is important and that you ’re happy about it — not that you ’re making sacrifices day in , day out .
For me , a good rule of thumb is that we should feel tired at the end of the day .
Yes , tired , but in a good way : that ’s very different from feeling spent or drained : it ’s feeling that we poured our energy into the stuff we care the most .
The feeling that our energy was put to good use .
Going to sleep looking forward to the next day is , in my opinion , the ultimate measure of personal productivity .
How to Apply this Principle
Take a one - minute self - assessment at the end of the day .
How was your day ?
Did you invest your time and energy doing what really matters ?
Forget for a minute about your goals , focus on your journey .
After all , if you ’re only making sacrifices and not enjoying your days , what ’s the point of being productive ?
What about You ?
What do you think of these principles ?
Anything missing ?
Do you have your own productivity principles ?
Please share in the comments !
I ’m eager to know about what works for you !

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration on Monday laid out a human rights agenda that recognized the limits of American authority : emphasizing the need for change within countries , defending engagement with adversaries like Myanmar and Iran and asserting that differences with big countries like China and Russia are best hashed out behind closed doors .
“ We must be pragmatic and agile in pursuit of our human rights agenda , not compromising on our principles , but doing what is most likely to make them real , ” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a wide - ranging address at Georgetown University .
Mrs. Clinton ’s remarks came a week after President Obama , in accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo , warned that there would be consequences for countries that brutalize their own people .
Together , the speeches appeared to be an attempt to answer critics who say the Obama administration has not staked out a forceful position on human rights .
But while Mr. Obama ’s tone was soaring , Mrs. Clinton ’s was more earthbound .
She offered a list of examples of how the United States could affect change in countries by working with democracy groups , multilateral organizations and socially responsible corporations .
Apparently , the anticipated increase in the number of mortgage resets in 2010 has a number of people worried , although none of them seem to be named Bernanke , Geithner , or Summers .
I did a little searching on Google News today and found lots of people are noticing .
Too bad the major media have n't noticed .
Jim Nelson at istockanalyst.com writes that he expects the dollar to skyrocket in value in 2010 .
Why ?
Mortgage resets will cause this to happen .
As I previously discussed , 2010 should be a year when mortgage resets increase after the 2009 lull , setting us up for another peak in 2011 ( like the sub - primes in 2008 which led to the initial crisis ) .
However , Nelson thinks it 's going to be even worse than that .
He wrote Wednesday , “ Instead of resetting as expected after the first five years , many option ARMs are so negatively amortized that they are hitting their automatic reset cap . ”
Thus , because the dollar rose in 2008 when the crisis hit ( as investors sought protection in the world 's foundational currency ) , Nelson thinks it will happen again in 2010 .
His short - term analysis is probably correct , since the immediate impact of such a scenario is deflationary , although the longer the Fed keeps us at near - zero interest rates , and the more bad mortgage portfolios the Fed buys up , the more that the high risk of inflation will face us in the longer term .
“ When this next domino tips too far , ” he wrote , “ we 'll have quite a mess on our hands . ”
Contrast Nelson 's analysis with Fannie Mae 's predictions for 2010 .
According to UPI :
“ The mortgage giant predicts that home sales and new residential construction will boast double digit gains in 2010 compared to a disappointing performance in 2009 .
According to the forecast , existing home sales are expected to rise by 10 percent next year , compared to an estimated 3.1 percent gain this year , while new home sales are projected to rise by 26 percent in 2010 compared to an estimated 19 percent drop in sales this year .
Similarly , new residential construction is expected to increase 35 percent in the New Year compared with a 38 percent drop in starts in 2009 . ”
Yet , within the same report , Fannie Mae also predicts that mortgage originations ( new contracts ) will decrease by 33 percent because of an anticipated 52 percent decrease in refinancing .
In other words , Fannie Mae does n't expect consumers hit by the mortgage resets to successfully refinance before they get the bad news .
Mortgage default servicing industry magazine DSNews reports that the mortgage resets of 2010 will create a second mortgage crisis .
The magazine also projects massive bank failures in 2010 , saying that the FDIC will be twice as big as in 2009 .
The article notes that 133 banks failed in 2009 and another 552 currently appear on the FDIC 's watch list of problem banks .
Jeff Nielsen writing at Seeking Alpha points out that all this is playing out under some enormously stressful condition which include :
U.S. mortgage defaults and delinquencies are at all - time record levels U.S. banks are holding millions of foreclosed properties off the market Millions more homes are already in the “ foreclosure pipeline ” U.S. unemployment continues to worsen ( even the phony numbers ) U.S. banks are still starving the economy of credit Record numbers of homeowners are already “ underwater ” A second , larger , worse spike in U.S. mortgage resets is about to begin Retiring baby - boomers need to sell at least $ 1 trillion in real estate
One disgruntled reader commented under Nielsen 's article , “ I hate this chart .
I have seen the same damn one for years and years now .
Provide me an updated charge reflecting which of those mortgages also were refi'd and then I 'll read your article critically . ”
The chart he refers to , which Nielsen included in his article , is the Credit Suisse chart first published in 2007 showing two coming waves of mortgage resets peaking in 2008 and 2011 .
Since Credit Suisse has n't updated the chart to reflect mortgage refinancing , no one has a more up - to - date chart to show .
However , here 's what we do know .
Shelby Bateson at examiner.com reports that as of September 30 , 2009 , only 116,677 loans have been refinanced under President Obama 's HARP ( Home Affordable Refinance Program ) program .
This was a program which was supposed to help millions of families avoid foreclosure ( at taxpayer expense ) .
Bateson points out that there has been no lack of applicants , but rather the banks themselves are unwilling to rewrite the loans .
It 's likely that the banks do n't want to rewrite these loans because to do so would force the banks to write down the loans ' values as well , putting the banks themselves into jeopardy of FDIC takeover .
I have n't seen anyone state this as a fact anywhere , but given the precarious health of the banking industry , this seems to me the likeliest scenario .
I 'm glad that people are finally beginning to take notice of the mortgage resets .
Unfortunately , with the financial leaders , the politicians , and the media all but ignoring the warning signs , this last - minute waking up is likely to be a case of too little , too late .
Walt Thiessen is the author of The Money Suckers , his new novel about the financial crisis .
Snow means spin for the ski industry .
Mountain folk long have chided ski companies for overestimating accumulations and hyping snowfall .
Take , for example , the October storm on the Front Range when Vail Resorts eagerly announced that it shut down its headquarters because the heavy snow was so terrific .
What the company did n’t mention is that its offices are in low country in Broomfield , 75 miles from its closest slopes , where it was warm and sunny that day .
“ I sometimes wonder whether the ski industry would n’t benefit more from being completely transparent about weather and snowfall with its customers , ” wrote veteran mountain reporter Bob Berwyn in a Nov. 19 column in the Summit Daily News .
“ But when snow = money , perhaps that ’s expecting too much . ”
The controversy since has snowballed .
As Berwyn tells it , Vail Resorts chief executive Rob Katz phoned immediately to complain .
As a major advertiser , the company went on to cancel ads for its resorts at Keystone and Breckenridge , at least temporarily .
Berwyn says publisher Jim Morgan told him he had “ a lot of groveling to do . ”
Berwyn — who ’s no groveler — stood by his column , even though he says his bosses told him his job was at risk .
“ I ’m a skier .
I love snow , ” he says .
“ I think people should tell the truth about snowfall . ”
Within two weeks , Morgan had fired him after 12 years intermittently with the paper .
That decision is chilling not only for journalism in Colorado , but also for Summit County readers .
“ It ’s unfortunate but , especially in this economy , some advertisers feel like they can flex their muscles when there ’s commentary that they do n’t like , ” says Ed Otte of the Colorado Press Association .
“ Newspapers need to withstand these kinds of threats . ”
“ It ’s hugely damaging for the credibility of a paper that ’s the single source of local news in this community , ” adds Breckenridge Councilman Dave Rossi .
“ It also makes us wonder — is Vail Resorts really that sensitive that it can’t handle any kind of informed criticism ? ”
The company counters that publications often print “ things we do n’t like , but that in no way affects our advertising policy with them . ”
It adds that Katz had no part in Berwyn ’s firing but “ simply expressed disappointment in how the paper handled the issue , ” and took umbrage with allegations that the company misleads customers about snowfall .
Vail Resorts also refutes a New York Times report this week that it threatened to pull its advertising in Ski Magazine after the publication posted that a teenager died last month while skiing at Breckenridge .
As the Times ’ story goes , the editor “ advised the staff that they might want to avoid stories about fatal skiing accidents , ” as if such postings somehow are n’t newsworthy in a journal about skiing .
“ It would have been completely tasteless and disrespectful to the family of the victim for us to run an ad about one of our season pass products or resorts adjacent to the story , ” the company says about why it pulled its ad .
Berwyn , who has freelanced for The Denver Post , is now looking for a full - time reporting gig .
Meanwhile , back at the spineless Summit Daily , Morgan and editor Alex Miller — who edited Berwyn ’s column — refused to comment about his firing and their apparent willingness to let an advertiser make editorial and staffing decisions .
“ Are you really doing a story on this ? ” Miller asked .
I suppose his paper ’s piece on raccoon encounters Wednesday was worthier of newsprint .

After the Palin - McCain ticket lost , conservative pundits admonished her to start studying the issues .
If “ Going Rogue ” and its promotional interviews are any indication , she has ignored their entreaties during her months at liberty .
Last week , Greta Van Susteren chastised Oprah for not asking Palin “ one policy question , ” but when Barbara Walters did ask some , Palin either recycled Dick Cheney verbatim ( Obama is “ dithering ” ) or ran aground .
Her argument for why “ Jewish settlements ” should be expanded on the West Bank was that “ more and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead . ”
It was unclear what she was talking about  unless it was the “ rapture ” theology that requires the mass return of Jews to settle the Holy Land as a precondition for the return of Christ .

The discredited neocon hacks who have latched on to Palin as a potential ticket back into power have their work cut out for them .
But it ’s better for Palin ’s purposes to remain as blank a slate as possible anyway .
Some of her most ardent supporters realize that she ’ll drive still more independent voters away if she fills in too many details .
And so Matthew Continetti , the author of the just - published “ Persecution of Sarah Palin ” and her most persistent cheerleader after William Kristol , wrote in The Wall Street Journal that her role model for 2012 should be Bob McDonnell , the new Republican governor - elect of Virginia , who won on “ a bipartisan , center - right approach . ”
What Continetti means is that Palin could still somehow fudge her history as McDonnell did ; his campaign kept his career - long history as a political acolyte and financial beneficiary of Pat Robertson on the down - low .
Even the far right has figured out that homophobia is a turnoff to swing voters , which is why Palin goes out of her way in “ Going Rogue ” to remind us she has her very own lesbian friend .
( What ’s left unsaid is that the book ’s credited ghost writer , Lynn Vincent , labeled homosexuality as “ deviance ” in her own writings for World , the evangelical magazine . )
But no matter how much Palin tries to pass for “ center - right , ” she ’s unlikely to fool that vast pool of voters left , right and center who have already written her off as unqualified for the White House .
The G.O.P. establishment knows this , and is frightened .
The demographic that Palin attracts is in decline ; there ’s no way the math of her fan base adds up to an Electoral College victory .
Yet among Republicans she still ties Mitt Romney in the latest USA Today / Gallup survey , with 65 percent giving her serious presidential consideration , just behind the 71 for her evangelical rival , Mike Huckabee .
The crowds lining up in the cold for her book tour are likely to be the most motivated to line up at the polls in G.O.P. primaries .
They do n’t speak the same language as Romney , Tim Pawlenty , Michael Steele , Mitch McConnell , John Boehner or , for that matter , McCain .
They are more likely to heed Palin salesmen like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh than baffled Bush administration grandees like Peter Wehner , who last week called Palin “ a cultural figure much more than a political one ” on the Web site of the establishment conservative organ Commentary .
Culture is politics .
Palin is at the red - hot center of age - old American resentments that have boiled up both from the ascent of our first black president and from the intractability of the Great Recession for those Americans who have n’t benefited from bailouts .
As Palin thrives on the ire of the left , so she does from the disdain of Republican leaders who , with a condescension rivaling the sexism they decry in liberals , belittle her as a lightweight or instruct her to eat think - tank spinach .
The only person who can derail Palin is Palin herself .
Should she not self - destruct , she will doom G.O.P. hopes of a 2012 comeback .
But the rest of the country cannot rest easy .
The rage out there is larger than Palin and defies partisan labeling .
Her ever - present booster Continetti , writing in The Weekly Standard , suggested that she recast the century - old populist outrage of William Jennings Bryan by adopting the message “ You shall not crucify mankind upon the cross of Goldman Sachs . ”
If Obama ca n’t tamp down that rage across the political map , Palin will at the very least pave the way for a demagogue with less baggage to pick up her torch .
She does a dead on impression of chicken sounds and incorporates them in to a freestyle beatboxing performance .
The US government is now so totally under the thumbs of organized interest groups that " our " government can no longer respond to the concerns of the American people who elect the president and the members of the House and Senate .
Voters will vent their frustrations over their impotence on the president , which implies a future of one - term presidents .
Soon our presidents will be as ineffective as Roman emperors in the final days of that empire .
Obama is already set on the course to a one - term presidency .
He promised change , but has delivered none .
His health care bill is held hostage by the private insurance companies seeking greater profits .
The most likely outcome will be cuts in Medicare and Medicaid in order to help fund wars that enrich the military / security complex and the many companies created by privatizing services that the military once provided for itself at far lower costs .
It would be interesting to know the percentage of the $ 700 + billion " defense " spending that goes to private companies .
In American " capitalism , " an amazing amount of taxpayers ’ earnings go to private firms via the government .
Yet , Republicans scream about " socializing " health care .
Republicans and Democrats saw opportunities to create new sources of campaign contributions by privatizing as many military functions as possible .
There are now a large number of private companies that have never made a dollar in the market , feeding instead at the public trough that drains taxpayers of dollars while loading Americans with debt service obligations .
Obama inherited an excellent opportunity to bring US soldiers home from the Bush regime ’s illegal wars of aggression .
In its final days , the Bush regime realized that it could " win " in Iraq by putting the Sunni insurgents on the US military payroll .
Once Bush had 80,000 insurgents collecting US military pay , violence , although still high , dropped in half .
All Obama had to do was to declare victory and bring our boys home ,
thanking Bush for winning the war .
It would have shut up the Republicans .
But this sensible course would have impaired the profits and share prices of those firms that comprise the military / security complex .
So instead of doing what Obama said he would do and what the voters elected him to do , Obama restarted the war in Afghanistan and launched a new one in Pakistan .
Soon Obama was echoing Bush and Cheney ’s threats to attack Iran .
In place of health care for Americans , there will be more profits for private insurance companies .
In place of peace there will be more war .
Voters are already recognizing the writing on the wall and are falling away from Obama and the Democrats .
Independents who gave Obama his comfortable victory have now swung against him , recently electing Republican governors in New Jersey and Virginia to succeed Democrats .
This is a protest vote , not a confidence vote in Republicans .
Obama ’s credibility is shot .
And so is Congress ’s , assuming it ever had any .
The US House of Representatives has just voted to show the entire world that the US House of Representatives is nothing but the servile , venal , puppet of the Israel Lobby .
The House of Representatives of the American " superpower " did the bidding of its master , AIPAC , and voted 344 to 36 to condemn the Goldstone Report .
In case you do n’t know , the Goldstone Report is the Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict .
The " Gaza Conflict " is the Israeli military attack on the Gaza ghetto , where 1.5 million dispossessed Palestinians , whose lands , villages , and homes were stolen by Israel , are housed .
The attack was on civilians and civilian infrastructure .
It was without any doubt a war crime under the Nuremberg standard that the US established in order to execute Nazis .
Goldstone is not only a very distinguished Jewish jurist who has given his life to bringing people to accountability for their crimes against humanity , but also a Zionist .
However , the Israelis have demonized him as a " self - hating Jew " because he wrote the truth instead of Israeli propaganda .
US Representative Dennis Kucinich , who is now without a doubt a marked man on AIPAC ’s political extermination list , asked the House if the members had any realization of the shame that the vote condemning Goldstone would bring on the House and the US government .
The entire rest of the world accepts the Goldstone report .
The House answered with its lopsided vote that the rest of the world does n’t count as it does n’t give campaign contributions to members of Congress .
This shameful , servile act of " the world ’s greatest democracy " occurred the very week that a court in Italy convicted 23 US CIA officers for kidnapping a person in Italy .
The CIA agents are now considered " fugitives from justice " in Italy , and indeed they are .
The kidnapped person was renditioned to the American puppet state of Egypt , where the victim was held for years and repeatedly tortured .
The case against him was so absurd that even an Egyptian judge order his release .
One of the convicted CIA operatives , Sabrina deSousa , an attractive young woman , says that the US broke the law by kidnapping a person and sending him to another country to be tortured in order to manufacture another " terrorist " in order to keep the terrorist hoax going at home .
Without the terrorist hoax , America ’s wars for special interest reasons would become transparent even to Fox " News " junkies .
Ms. deSousa says that " everything I did was approved back in Washington , " yet the government , which continually berates us to " support the troops , " did nothing to protect her when she carried out the Bush regime ’s illegal orders .
Clearly , this means that the crime that Bush , Cheney , the Pentagon , and the CIA ordered is too heinous and beyond the pale to be justified , even by memos from the despicable John Yoo and the Republican Federalist Society .
Ms. deSousa is clearly worried about herself .
But where is her concern for the innocent person that she sent into an Egyptian hell to be tortured until death or admission of being a terrorist ?
The remorse deSousa expresses is only for herself .
She did her evil government ’s bidding and her evil government that she so faithfully served turned its back on her .
She has no remorse for the evil she committed against an innocent person .
Perhaps deSousa and her 22 colleagues grew up on video games .
It was great fun to plot to kidnap a real person and fly him on a CIA plane to Egypt .
Was it like a fisherman catching a fish or a deer hunter killing a beautiful 8 - point buck ?
Clearly , they got their jollies at the expense of their renditioned victim .
The finding of the Italian court , and keep in mind that Italy is a bought - and - paid - for US puppet state , indicates that even our bought puppets are finding the US too much to stomach .
Moving from the tip of the iceberg down , we have Ambassador Craig Murray , rector of the University of Dundee and until 2004 the UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan , which he describes as a Stalinist totalitarian state courted and supported by the Americans .
As ambassador , Murray saw the MI5 intelligence reports from the CIA that described the most horrible torture procedures .
" People were raped with broken bottles , children were tortured in front of their parents until they [ the parents ] signed a confession , people were boiled alive . "
" Intelligence " from these torture sessions was passed on by the CIA to MI5 and to Washington as proof of the vast al Qaeda conspiracy .
Amb .
Murray reports that the people delivered by CIA flights to Uzbekistan ’s torture prisons " were told to confess to membership in Al Qaeda .
They were told to confess they ’d been in training camps in Afghanistan .
They were told to confess they had met Osama bin Laden in person .
And the CIA intelligence constantly echoed these themes . "
" I was absolutely stunned , " says the British ambassador , who thought that he served a moral country that , along with its American ally , had moral integrity .
The great Anglo - American bastion of democracy and human rights , the homes of the Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights , the great moral democracies that defeated Nazism and stood up to Stalin ’s gulags , were prepared to commit any crime in order to maximize profits .
Amb .
Murray learned too much and was fired when he vomited it all up .
He saw the documents that proved that the motivation for US and UK military aggression in Afghanistan had to do with the natural gas deposits in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan .
The Americans wanted a pipeline that bypassed Russia and Iran and went through Afghanistan .
To insure this , an invasion was necessary .
The idiot American public could be told that the invasion was necessary because of 9/11 and to save them from " terrorism , " and the utter fools would believe the lie .
" If you look at the deployment of US forces in Afghanistan , as against other NATO country forces in Afghanistan , you ’ll see that undoubtedly the US forces are positioned to guard the pipeline route .
It ’s what it ’s about .
It ’s about money , its about energy , it ’s not about democracy . "
Guess who the consultant was who arranged with then Texas governor George W. Bush the agreements that would give to Enron the rights to Uzbekistan ’s and Turkmenistan ’s natural gas deposits and to Unocal to develop the trans -Afghanistan pipeline .
It was Karzai , the US - imposed " president " of Afghanistan , who has no support in the country except for American bayonets .
Amb .
Murray was dismissed from the UK Foreign Service for his revelations .
No doubt on orders from Washington to our British puppet .

Prison was a ‘ breeding ground ’ for Al - Qaeda , ex-inmate says
Extremists at the US ’s largest prison in Iraq , shut down this fall , were allowed to give training courses to inmates on how to use explosives and how to become suicide bombers , according to a report at Al - Jazeera English .
Adel Jasim Mohammed , a former inmate at Camp Bucca who spent four years there without ever facing charges , told the news network that “ US officials did nothing to stop radicals from indoctrinating young detainees at the camp , ” AJE reports .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Extremists had freedom to educate the young detainees .
I saw them giving courses using classroom boards on how to use explosives , weapons and how to become suicide bombers , ” Mohammed said .
“ In 2005 , an extremist was sent to our camp .
At first , Sunnis and Shias rejected his teachings .
But we were told that he was imposed by the prison authority , ” he said .
“ He stayed for a week and recruited 25 of the 34 detainees – they became extremists like him . ”
This is not the first time that such allegations about Camp Bucca have been made , but a growing number of witnesses coming forward makes the allegations more credible .
Last month , ex-inmate Abu Mohammed told the Pakistan Tribune that the prison was a “ breeding ground ” for Al - Qaeda .
“ The illiterate and straight - forward people were the easiest prey for indoctrination , ” Mohammed said .
Earlier this year Iraqi police described US - run prisons as “ factories for terrorists ” after stating that two suicide bombers who attacked government ministries and killed 100 people on August 19 had once been incarcerated at Camp Bucca .
But Brig. - Gen. David Quantock , the US military official in charge of detention centers in Iraq , rejected the charge .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ What frustrates me is the idea that there was a lot of radicalization going on inside the facilities of which I completely disagree , ” said Quantock .
“ A lot of these guys were radicals even before they got into our facilities and we spent a lot of time and resources separating the extremists from the moderates . ”
The Obama administration announced in September that it was shuttering the prison facility .
It is estimated that some 100,000 Iraqis spent time at Camp Bucca from 2003 to 2009 , the years it was operational .
US officials note that only four percent of those incarcerated returned to the jail after being freed .
But , as AJE notes , it ’s impossible to determine the actual recidivism rate because many of those imprisoned were never convicted in court of any crimes , so it ’s unclear how many were insurgents to begin with .

We 're going to teach them climbing , canoeing , archery , and shooting .
<FEMALE INTERVIEWER >: Shooting !
That 's a bit irresponsible , is n't it ?

Guest post by Mauri Pelto
It is popularly understood that glaciologists consider West Antarctica the biggest source of uncertainty in sea level projections .
The base of the 3000 -m thick West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS ) – unlike the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet – lies below sea level , and it has been recognized for a long time that this means it has the potential to change very rapidly .
Most of the grounded West Antarctic ice sheet drains into the floating Ross and Ronne - Filchner ice shelves , but a significant fraction also drains into the much smaller Pine Island Glacier .
Glaciologists are paying very close attention to Pine Island Glacier ( “ PIG ” on map , right ) and nearby Thwaites Glacier .
In the following guest post , Mauri Pelto explains why .
In science there are instances when a specific mechanism is understood and a hypothesis posed based on an understanding of the processes involved , prior to the initiation or observation of the those processes .
An excellent example is the determination by Molina and Rowland ( 1974 ) that CFC ’s will lead to losses in stratospheric ozone .
The full truth of their understanding of the process was not revealed until the Antarctic ozone hole was reported in 1985 by Farman et al .
A different example , from the same time period , was the 1978 publication by the late John Mercer , Ohio State U. , who argued that a major deglaciation of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS ) may be in progress within 50 years .
This conclusion was based on the fact that the WAIS margin was ringed with stabilizing ice shelves , and that much of the ice sheet is grounded below sea level .
The loss of ice shelves — Mercer proposed — would allow the ice sheet to thin , grounding lines to retreat and the ice sheet to disintegrate via calving .
This is a much faster means of losing mass than melting in place .
Mercer further commented that the loss of ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula , as has since been observed , would be an indicator that this process of ice sheet loss due to global warming was underway .
Mercer ’s ideas led Terry Hughes ( 1981 ) ( my doctoral advisor at U. of Maine ) to propose that the WAIS had a “ weak underbelly ” in Pine Island Bay .
This bay in the Amundsen Sea is where the Pine Island Glacier ( PIG ) and Thwaites Glacier reach the sea .
These are the only two significant outlet glaciers draining the north side of the WAIS .
Together they drain 20 % of the WAIS .
Hughes called this area the “ weak underbelly ” because these glaciers lack the really huge ice shelves Ross Ice Shelf and the Ronne - Filchner Ice Shelf in which most other large WAIS outlet glaciers terminate .
Both glaciers have a relatively rapid flow from the WAIS interior to the calving margin .
Further the low surface slopes and smooth flow patterns of PIG suggested to Hughes that there was no indication of a landward rise in the elevation of the glacier bed ; such a rise would help stabilize the glacier .
Without a rise in the bed , glacier thinning and retreat could result in continual grounding line retreat .
The grounding line is where the bottom of the glacier comes in contact with the ground below the ice sheet , in this case the sea bottom .
The grounding line is an anchoring point for the outlet glaciers .
The length of the glacier that is grounded is both slowed and stabilized by resulting basal friction .
Beyond the grounding line toward the margin , the floating ice shelf is susceptible to rapid calving retreat and as the grounding line retreats , so would the calving front .
Note in the image below that the situation is even less stable than Hughes speculated .
The current grounding line is at a higher elevation than the bed of the glacier for the next 200 km inland of this grounding line .
( Note , inland is to the left in the figure , below . )
The deeper the basin , the thicker the ice must be to maintain grounding .
This makes it tough to slow grounding line retreat once it begins in a deepening basin .
Basal topography profile of Pine Island Glacier ( from Shepherd et al. , 2001 )
The weak underbelly idea was forgotten for some time .
While I was attending a conference on rapid glacier flow in Vancouver BC in 1986 , data were presented that showed no acceleration of Pine Island Glacier .
This was further noted for the entire 1970 ’s to early 1990 ’s period by Lucchita and others ( 1995 ) .
Then , in 1998 , Rignot ( 1998 ) used satellite imagery to identify that the grounding line of Pine Island Glacier had retreated 5 km from 1992 to 1996 .
In the same year , Wingham and others ( 1998 ) observed a 10 cm per year thinning in the drainage basins for Thwaites and PIG during the 1990’s .
Shepherd and others ( 2001 ) noted thinning in the fast flow areas of the glacier of 1.6 m/ year between 1992 and 1999 .
This led them to conclude that the observed inland thinning and acceleration of PIG was a response to enhanced glacier bed lubrication .
Not from surface melting of course as there is next to none on this glacier .
Rignot and others ( 2002 ) noted that the glacier had accelerated 18 % over a 150 km long section of the glacier in the fast flow area between 1992 and 2000 .
Change was afoot : after 50 years of apparent stability , the glacier calving front was retreating , and the grounding line was retreating indicating reduced bedrock anchoring .
The reduction in basal friction would then lead to faster flow and more thinning .
Was this just a short - term increase ?
In 2006 and 2007 , instruments were placed directly on PIG for the first time by the British Antarctic Survey .
Four GPS receivers monitored ice flow from 55 to 171 km inland of the calving front at the center of the glacier ( Scott and others , 2009 ) .
Glacier velocities had been noted at each site in 1996 ; by 2007 the respective increase in velocity was 42 % , 36 % , 34 % and 26 % respectively , an approximately 2 to 3 % annual increase .
The increase from 2006 to 2007 was 6.4 % at 55 km from the terminus and 4.1 % at 171 km inland .
The extent of the fast flowing portion of PIG is seen in the figure below .
A separate data set , radar based was used by Rignot ( 2008 ) to identify a 42 % acceleration of PIG between 1996 and 2007 accompanied by most of its ice plain becoming ungrounded .
Velocity map of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers .
Rignot , 2008
Scott and others ( 2009 ) pointed out that the greater thinning toward the grounding line and terminus increased the surface slope and the gravitational driving stress , further promoting acceleration .
Then Wingham and others ( 2009 ) reported that the 5400 km2 central trunk of the glacier had experienced a quadrupling in the average rate of volume loss quadrupled from 2.6 km3 a year in 1995 to 10.1 km3 a year in 2006 .
PIG had an annual volume flux at the front of 28 km3 a year , so this increase is a marked change .
Their observations were that the region of lightly grounded ice at the glacier terminus is extending upstream , and the changes inland are consistent with the effects of a prolonged disturbance to the ice flow , such as the effects of ocean - driven melting .
Further examination of the bed topography by Vaughan and others ( 2006 ) indicates that most of the bed of the drainage basin of PIG is more than 500 meters below sea level , and there is a particularly deep basin in the eastern section of the upper basin .
The observed acceleration , retreat of the grounding line , thinning of the lower section of the glacier and the observed elevation of the basal topography provide no indication that this is not a weak underbelly of WAIS .
The evidence does indicate that one of the basic underlying principles , proposed by Mercer and Hughes , of what can stabilize or destabilize WAIS was right on the money .
The evidence reviewed does not fully confirm the weak underbelly hypothesis , but it provides enough evidence that we had best monitor the situation and expand our attempts to understand it .
That is just what the glaciological and scientific community are doing .
A number of projects from the British Antarctic Survey , NASA and NSF will continue to expand the research in the area .
In January 2008 Robert Bindschadler ( NASA ) landed on the floating ice shelf of PIG .
They found the situation hazardous for plane landing but did leave behind several instruments .
NSF has decided to fund establishment of a helicopter camp to safely study the ice - ocean interaction during the 2010 - 11 summer field season in Antarctica .
In 2009 a team of British and American scientists deployed an autonomous robot submarine on six missions beneath the PIG ice shelf using sonar scanners to map the seabed and the ice shelf bottom .
This fall NASA ’s Operation Ice Bridge has focused much of its energy on the Pine Island Glacier .
Seelye Martin of the University of Washington notes that “ Pine Island Glacier is a major focus for our mission .
We have four flights planned for this glacier .
One of our hopes with these flights is to understand the detailed topography under the floating ice tongue .
That topography controls the rate of melting there . ”

Even Mr. Granger , who spends part of each year in London , said he always kept a supply of Vegemite on hand for his children .
Image Kraft originally chose the name iSnack2.0 from almost 50,000 entries in a competition to name its new Vegemite product , but then bowed to public anger and agreed to call the product Cheesybite .
Credit ... Kraft Foods / Agence France - Presse — Getty Images
Simon Talbot , the head of corporate affairs at Kraft Foods Australia , said the company had taken only 72 hours to decide that the iSnack 2.0 name was “ not worth defending , ” given the level of outrage .
But the furor was already paying dividends : Sales of iSnack 2.0 rose 47 percent during its first two weeks with the name , while sales of the original Vegemite were largely unaffected .
( Jars with the Cheesybite name will appear on shelves only after Kraft unloads about 500,000 jars printed with the iSnack 2.0 name — in two or three months ) .
“ In the first week , we were in 15 percent of Australian households , which is unheard of .
It usually takes many months to get that sort of impact , ” Mr. Talbot said .
“ Time will tell the success of the product , but to date , the lack of cannibalization of the core product and the level of new uptake indicates that we ’re onto a very , very successful winner for us . ”
The executives at Kraft chose iSnack 2.0 to reflect the fact that the product had been developed using information gleaned from thousands of online surveys indicating that customers wanted a more portable , spreadable , snack - able version of Vegemite .
But a marketing concept that lives by the Internet can also die by the Internet .
“ We asked people to vote on a name , and then we left the room and picked a name that was n’t the most popular , and that ’s where we lost the online consumer in particular , ” Mr. Talbot said of the iSnack name .
“ The underlying success is that we got the mix right :
We got the taste right , we got the insights right .
The sales data proves that . ”
... they fell into the vats ; and when they were fished out , there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting , — sometimes they would be overlooked for days , till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham 's Pure Leaf Lard !
— Upton Sinclair , The Jungle , 1906
Exactly what constitutes cannibalism is less clear than it might seem .
Everyone would agree that eating a human finger is cannibalism .
But what about the tip of a finger ?
If you eat food cooked with lard which includes fragments of a slaughterhouse worker , is that cannibalism ?
The problem of inserting human genes into food destined for human consumption is not so different .
Is it cannibalism to eat food with one human gene ?
What about 50 human genes or an entire human chromosome ?
How much human material spliced into a living organism would make a product " essentially human ? "
Just as people are unlikely to agree on how much genetic material constitutes " humanness , " they are likely to differ on the conditions under which it is moral or immoral to consume food with human components .
Given such a lack of consensus , we might expect that there would be a national discussion of using human genes in food .
Eating food with human genetic components would certainly run counter to the moral or religious beliefs of more than a few people ...
Food corporations and government agencies have acted as though there are no moral issues involved in the decisions they have made concerning what reaches consumers .
Eating food with human genetic components would certainly run counter to the moral or religious beliefs of more than a few people .
Even those who do not agree with their values are likely to defend their right to practice their beliefs .
This would suggest that , even if there was no debate on whether or not to produce food with human genes , if it were done , such food should be labeled so that those who choose not to consume it could do so .
While these might seem to be reasonable expectations , food corporations and government agencies have acted as though there are no moral issues involved in the decisions they have made concerning what reaches consumers .
Experimentation with introducing human genes into the food supply is already well advanced .
There is good reason to suspect that the number of human genes in food will increase during the next few years .
As this happens , industry is developing rationalizations of why human genes in food is not an issue deserving attention and governments are making it increasingly difficult for people to find out exactly what they are eating .
Human genes into animals
Genetic engineering ( GE ) researchers have been putting human genes into animals for years for medical purposes , such as trying to make pig hearts human - compatible .
Biotechnology companies have also investigated putting human genes into animals for food production .
Gen Pharm bioengineered Herman , the first transgenic dairy bull , for producing milk with a human protein .
By identifying which proteins are most important for infants , laboratories will be able to produce formula more similar to mother 's milk by inserting human genes .
( It would not be surprising if companies then promoted their genetically engineered formula as being just like human milk but having less dioxin . )
Scientists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture put human growth hormone genes into pig embryos to produce faster growing hogs .
The project was abandoned , partly because the resulting pigs were so deformed that some could not support their own weight .
Putting human genes into plants would go beyond crossing the species barrier .
It would cross the kingdom barrier .
Could another research team overcome these problems and successfully implant human genes into pigs or cattle or goats or chickens ?
If one gene worked pretty well , could 20 , 100 or 1000 genes work even better ?
In 1997 , Japanese researchers reported inserting a complete human chromosome into mice to produce human antibodies .
This transplanted 50 times as much human genetic information as had previously been accomplished .
Transplanting human genes into animals destined for human consumption is not a fantasy of a hypothetical future — it is history which can be expanded .
One gene which could be put into human food with current technology is human growth hormone ( hGH ) .
Genetech received a patent for a genetically engineered hGH in the 1980s in order to treat children with dwarfism .
By the 1990s , sales of the synthetic hGH were booming as parents bought it for kids they thought were too short .
There is nothing to prohibit a milk producer or hamburger chain from using hGH and advertising that using its products will guarantee that your kids will grow .
Human genes into plants ?
Putting human genes into plants would go beyond crossing the species barrier ( plant to plant or animal to animal ) .
It would cross the kingdom barrier ( animal to plant ) .
This barrier has already been broken , with transfers of firefly genes to corn , hamster genes to tobacco and flounder genes to tomatoes .
An article in the December 18 , 1998 Science magazine discusses the possibility of producing edible insulin using transgenic plants .
The author cites research which used a cholera toxin to implant human insulin into potatoes .
Eating the potatoes with GE insulin delayed the onset of symptoms in diabetes - prone mice .
Human genes may also be put into plants as part of the " functional food " fad of biotech companies .
Such foods would be designed for specific health problems .
In early 1998 , I heard Monsanto Senior Executive Arnold Donald describe such foods .
The corporate visionary shared his dream that one day Americans could go into McDonald 's and order food specially engineered for their health needs .
If scientists put human genes into bovine embryos to produce milk for easy digestion by human infants , why not investigate whether human genes put into plants could be a real or imagined solution to dietary problems ?
If human genes were successfully introduced into plants , their transgenic pollen could contaminate neighboring fields .
Despite industry propaganda denying the likelihood of such " genetic pollution , " it has happened repeatedly .
In one celebrated case , the October 25 Daily News reported that the British government expects to charge Monsanto that pollen from its Roundup - resistant canola test site in Lincolnshire spread to an adjoining non-GE canola plot .
Unlike cars with exploding gas tanks , genetic alterations cannot be recalled .
Human genes introduced into potatoes or any other crop could become a permanent part of that species .
Who decides ?
When I presented this issue to the St. Louis Ethical Society in November , 1998 , one person commented , " I work for the Human Genome Diversity Project and I cannot understand the problem with using human genes in food for people .
Genes are just molecules .
Human genes are no different from other genes . "
The view that moving genes around is just a technical problem with no moral implications is central to the " reductionist " ideology of biotech .
Reductionism maintains that all activity can be explained by ( or reduced to ) the movement of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen and a few other atoms and therefore human activity and consciousness are not unique .
Variants of the reductionist view are so pervasive that many environmentalists fall prey to them .
Some have challenged my saying that " human genes are quite different from other genes " with the objection that over 99 % of human genes are shared with chimpanzees .
This ignores the fact that even if there were no more than 0.1 % of human genes which were not shared with other species , it is precisely this 0.1 % which the genetic engineers are targeting for transplantation .
A non-reductionist world view understands that genes interact with each other to produce activity which cannot be explained by analyzing them in isolation - only a tiny number of distinctly human genes may be necessary for interaction with other genes to produce the unique aspects of humanness .
Human genes introduced into ... any ... crop could become a permanent part of that species .
Ethical problems of splicing genes into food hinge on two questions :
1 . Who decides what material ( such as human genes ) is put into food ?
2 . Will consumers know what is in food so that they can make choices based on their personal and religious beliefs ?
The last thing the food industry wants is a national debate which suggests that society itself should determine uses of biotechnology .
They push the image of a masterful " Science of Biotechnology " marching inevitably forward .
They see no reason to discuss what should or should not be put in food because they intend to put anything in food which is technically feasible and economically profitable .
To them profit equals morality and everything else is a nuisance factor to be handled by a PR department .
Agribusiness has successfully persuaded the US Department of Agriculture to accept that genetically engineered products should only be labeled if there is a problem with safety or nutrition and that labels should not be required because of a " process of production , " such as introducing a human gene .
When a tomato with a flounder gene was introduced , the fact that consumers would not know that it had an animal gene was not treated as a problem .
The company recalled it because picking and packing equipment did not handle it well .
If a tomato which violated personal beliefs of vegetarians could be sold without being labeled , it is clear that food with human genes would not require labeling simply because it violated the moral or religious beliefs of many consumers .
Industry spokespersons argue that it should be illegal to require labeling of food sold internationally " merely " because it is genetically engineered .
They reason that requiring labeling for other than safety reasons could cater to anti-GE biases prevalent in some countries .
In the language of trade agreements , this would be a " non-tariff barrier to trade . "
At the beginning of this century , image control by the food industry was crude and unsophisticated .
They simply covered up everything they did .
When Upton Sinclair exposed their practices , the Pure Food and Drug Act followed the same year .
Agribusiness not only is introducing human genes into food without a national discussion — they are moving to make sure that people do not know enough about what they are eating for such a discussion to occur .
The massive explosion of public relations during the twentieth century has resulted in a food industry which is smooth and slick in its ability to rationalize its activity and manipulate international law .
This could make it more difficult to restrict food contamination now .
Agribusiness not only is introducing human genes into food without a national discussion - they are moving to make sure that people do not know enough about what they are eating for such a discussion to occur .

Reporting from Islamabad , Pakistan , and Peshawar , Pakistan -- A suicide bombing at a crowded courthouse in Peshawar killed 19 people Thursday , the 10th such attack in six weeks for a city bearing the brunt of retaliation from Taliban militants battling Pakistani troops along the Afghan border .
Now in its fifth week , Pakistan ’s military offensive has succeeded in retaking much of the ground held by Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in South Waziristan , for years the militants ’ primary stronghold .
That success , however , has been tempered by a wave of militant attacks since early October that has claimed more than 300 lives across Pakistan .
Peshawar , a city of 3 million people on the fringe of Pakistan ’s largely ungoverned tribal areas , has been hardest hit by the violence .
Suicide bombers have struck bustling markets , police stations and checkpoints , and even the regional headquarters of the country ’s vaunted intelligence agency .
With Thursday ’s strike , the death toll from the attacks around the city since early October has reached at least 247 .

Authorities said the attacker tried to push his way into the city ’s judicial complex but was stopped by police officers at the courthouse ’s main gate .
When they tried to search him , he detonated a jacket filled with explosives , said Sahibzada Muhammad Anees , a Peshawar city official .
At least three of those killed were police officers .
The blast occurred about 10:30 a.m. , when the building was filled with people shuttling between courtrooms .
Doctors said several lawyers were among the critically injured taken to the city ’s Lady Reading Hospital .
At least 51 people were injured .
Authorities said the toll would have been far higher if the police officers at the gate had not stopped the attacker .
It was the third time in five days that police in the Peshawar region kept an attacker from causing far greater loss of life .
Suicide car bomb attacks Saturday and Monday occurred at police checkpoints on the outskirts of the city , which authorities believe were not the intended targets .
Nevertheless , the wave of attacks has cast a pall on Peshawar , where residents are limiting their trips to markets and many parents are keeping their children home from school .
Dozens of streets have been closed off with barricades .

Local officials blame much of the violence in Peshawar on the national government ’s decision to announce its intent to launch an offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan weeks before sending troops into the region .
That gave militants ample time to escape and seek refuge in places such as Peshawar ’s suburbs .
Many of the attacks in the city are being launched from those suburbs .
“ If you look at Peshawar , it ’s a hub for dozens of smaller towns , ” said Imtiaz Gul , a security analyst based in Islamabad , the Pakistani capital .
“ To create a scare , the easiest place to hit is Peshawar .
What you need is penetration into the militants ’ networks in the suburbs , and that ’s missing right now .
We do n’t have the required intelligence resources .
There have been arrests , but that ’s not enough . ”
Authorities have beefed up security throughout the northwestern city and have begun using sophisticated explosives - detection equipment at checkpoints , but the large number of entry points to the city -- at least 110 -- makes it extremely difficult to thwart every potential bomb attack .
“ We are facing an extraordinary situation , ” said Anees , the city official .
“ Police are there , but it ’s not humanly possible to check each and every person . ”

Ali is a special correspondent .
Published in September 2009 , an analysis of nationalism , where it comes from , and why anarchists fundamentally oppose it .
Preface
This pamphlet has its origins in a particular time and place , with the impetus behind it coming from the Israeli state ’s military campaign in the Gaza strip in late 2008 and early 2009 .
As the record of atrocities and the death toll mounted , coming to a final stop at around 1,500 dead , large protests took place around the world , with a significant protest movement developing in Britain .
This movement took the form of regular street protests in cities , a wave of 28 university occupations around the country and occasional attacks against companies supposedly implicated in the war .
There were also , depressingly , actions with clear anti-Semitic overtones .
Anarchist Federation members were involved in a range of ways , being present on street demonstrations and involved in a number of occupations .
As anarchists , we are opposed to war , militarism and imperialism , and see a powerful movement against these forces as a vital part of internationalism in action and the process of building the confidence necessary for a social movement against the state and capitalism .
However , we were unimpressed by the way in which support for the ‘ Palestinian resistance ’ – in other words Hamas , Islamic Jihad , Al - Aqsa Martyrs brigade and the other proto - state forces in the region - became mixed in with the legitimate revulsion felt as the bombs and shells fell onto the heads of ordinary Gazans .
These groups - which called on ordinary Palestinians to ‘ martyr ’ themselves for the nation - have a clear history of repressing workers ’ struggles at gunpoint , oppressing women , gays and lesbians , and spreading the virulently reactionary doctrines of nationalism and Islamism .
As the war ground on , they showed their true colours by attempting to indiscriminately kill Israelis , settling scores with their rivals through summary executions , and making political capital out of refugees by preventing them from accessing medical aid over the border .
As ordinary Palestinians fled in droves , ignoring the calls from militant groups and their Western cheerleaders to throw themselves upon the pyre and join the ‘ resistance ’ , the true face of that ‘ resistance ’ became apparent .
As anarchist communists , we have always opposed nationalism , and have always marked our distance from the left through vocally opposing all nationalism – including that of ‘ oppressed nations ’ .
While we oppose oppression , exploitation and dispossession on national grounds , and oppose imperialism and imperialist warfare , we refuse to fall into the trap so common on the left of identifying with the underdog side and glorifying ‘ the resistance ’ – however ‘ critically ’ – which is readily observable within Leninist / Trotskyist circles .
We took this stance on Northern Ireland in the past , and take it on Israel / Palestine today .
Therefore , in order to give context to the text that follows and show our analysis in a practical context , we reproduce as appendices two texts which AF groups circulated as leaflets during the campaign , and which were utilised by other anarchist comrades in the UK , such as locals of the anarcho - syndicalist Solidarity Federation and Organise ! in Northern Ireland .
We hope that this text will circulate as widely as our original leaflets did , which were translated into Spanish and Polish and reproduced as far away as Central America , and open debate within the wider anti-state communist movement .

Against Nationalism
The nation and nationalism
Whenever we involve ourselves in everyday life , we find ourselves defined in national terms .
When we use our passports , when we apply for a job , when we go to hospital or when we claim benefits , we come up against our national status and the possibilities or handicaps that follow .
When we travel , turn on the television , open the paper or make conversation , the categorisation of people into one of several hundred varieties of human being looms in the background , often taking centre stage .
We are all assumed to belong to a national group , and even those people who can claim multiple national identities are still assumed to be defined by them .
The division of the world ’s population into distinct nations and its governance accordingly is a given , and seems as straightforward as anything occurring in nature .
When we say , for example , that we are British , Polish , Korean or Somalian we feel that we are describing an important part of ourselves and how we relate to the world around us , giving us commonality with some people and setting us apart from others
Bureaucracy makes this intuition more solid .
Nationality is its most fundamental category – determining what rights and privileges we have access to , whether we are inside or outside the community of citizenship which nationalism presumes , and ultimately whether we are a valid , ‘ legal ’ , person .
When we come across bureaucracy , the various definitions assigned to us by it loom large : gender , nationality and race in particular .
These things seem to be as obvious a part of ourselves as eye colour or blood type , and more often than not go unquestioned .
But despite appearing a fundamental attribute of ourselves and others , the principle of nationality is also fundamentally problematic .
On one level , it defines itself .
To a bureaucracy nationality just is .
You have the right passport , the right entitlements , or you do n’t .
However , as with all social questions , we are dealing not with some ‘ natural ’ aspect of the human condition , but with a form of social organisation which has both an origin and a rationale .
So we come up against the question , ‘ what is a nation ? ’
Common sense seems to provide the usual answer : a ‘ people ’ share a culture , a history , an origin , a community , a set of values , and , usually , a language which make them a nation .
People within the nation share a commonality with one another which they lack with foreigners .
From this point of view , the world is made up of such nations ; it always has been and always will be .
But the ideology of nationalism , regardless of which ‘ nation ’ we are discussing , is a political one , describing the relationship between ‘ the people ’ and the state .
The nation - state is seen as the outgrowth of the national community , its means of conducting its business and the instrument of its collective will and wellbeing ; at the very least a one - on - one correspondence between nation and state is seen as the usual , natural and desirable state of affairs , with any international co-operation , business and organisation progressing from this starting point .
This rhetoric is assumed even in states which do not bother to claim legitimacy through representative democracy .
But when we attempt to uncover the qualities which make some collectivities of people a nation and others not , we encounter problems .
When we attempt to articulate what ‘ Britishness ’ , ‘ Gambianess ’ or ‘ Thainess ’ might be about , we are in trouble .
Nationalist partisans will offer suggestions , but these are always fashionable banalities , whether they are ‘ honour ’ , ‘ loyalty ’ , ‘ liberty ’ , ‘ fairness ’ , or whatever else is current .
A handful of iconic national institutions will be pointed to , and a great many more ignored .
Nationalisms on this level are unlike political ideologies , there is no definite model for the organisation of society , and there is no unity of principle or program ; the unity assumed is an arbitrary one .
There are no observable rules to clearly define what makes a national ‘ people ’ , as opposed to other forms of commonality .
The usual prerequisites are a shared language and culture .
But this shared , culture is difficult to define , and we often find as much cultural variation across populations within nations as between them .
Two Han Chinese are assumed to share a commonality as ‘ Chinese ’ and a natural solidarity on this basis even if they speak mutually incomprehensible ‘ dialects ’ .
Likewise , understanding continuity between the historical ‘ national culture ’ and what actually exists requires some dubious reasoning – for example , how is someone in Athens who speaks modern , Attic - derived official Greek expressing the same culture which built the Acropolis , ( itself a Greek culture which lacked a Greek nation ) ?
This ‘ nation ’ must often incl¬ude many who do not meet its supposedly defining attributes ; regional , linguistic , cultural , religious and sometimes ‘ national ’ minorities .
This fact that nation - states often exhibit as much variation within their geographic bounds as across them is obvious in many postcolonial African states or in Indonesia for instance , and even in less exotic locales such as Switzerland .
Nonetheless , nationalists often reduce the question down to a narrative of ‘ human nature ’ , in which ‘ peoples ’ simply cannot mix without conflict , making the natural state of affairs the ‘ self - determination ’ of nations through their sovereign states .
Such thinking is usually mired in the pseudo - science of race , making an appeal to historical just - so stories and misplaced naturalistic myths .
To assume that ‘ peoples ’ are defined by their antagonism to other ‘ peoples ’ , but that they are antagonistic because they are different ‘ peoples ’ is circular thinking .
There is still no clear reason why certain groups deserve national status and others do n’t .
Antagonism between particular metropolitan areas has a longer pedigree than supposed national antagonism does , but the population of such areas are not assumed to have access to national status on these grounds .
Moreover , there are countries , such as Madagascar , and areas , such as large swathes of Latin America , where the ‘ race ’ of the population is a mixed one .
In Madagascar , the ‘ Madagascan people ’ is in fact a localised mix of populations of African and Austronesian settlers .
The same applies to less exotic locations too .
The ‘ English people ’ are a mix of waves of conquest and settlement , their supposed ‘ national culture ’ even more mongrelised than their genetic ‘ race ’ .
Nationalism , then , is a strange thing that is everywhere , intuitively ‘ common sense ’ but impossible to precisely describe , a basic principle of structuring the entire population of the world but a principle which does n’t stand up to much scrutiny .
However , things were n’t always this way .
For most of history people did n’t have a particular nationality , or overlapping claims on them , which defined their person in such fundamental but elusive ways , let alone any nationalism to accompany it .
Though ‘ common sense ’ tells us that national divisions are a thing as old as humanity , the reality is rather different .
Nationalism is a creation of the modern world , and is bound up with the development of a certain kind of society , which today is worldwide and total in its reach – capitalism .
The origins of nationalism
Capitalism and the modern nation - state developed at the same time in the same place , in Europe in the 16th to 19th centuries .
The evolution of the nation - state and capitalism were bound up , each catalysing the development of the other .
Capitalism took hold in a certain time and place not by accident but because the conditions were right to breed it ; it required a fragmented arena of competing states with embedded mercantilist interests ( though they were not for a good time the ‘ nations ’ we ’d recognise ) , and for that reason evolved in Europe rather than in the Ottoman Empire , Manchu China or any of the other land empires that dominated much of the world .
Like capitalism itself , the idea of the modern nation - state did n’t appear from nowhere , but developed out of pre-existing conditions .
However , capitalism as a total economic system and the world of sovereign nation - states are historical novelties , standing in contrast to a long history of feudal and imperial state forms .
The modern nation - state is a product of the revolutions of the Eighteenth century which marked the decline of the feudal period and the rise of capitalism as a world system .
But the phenomenon did not fall from the sky upon the storming of the Bastille [ 1 ] , it was nurtured and developed as capitalism itself evolved and matured .
The technological innovations associated with the earliest developments of capitalism laid the foundation for the subsequent evolution of nationalism .
The production and circulation of printed books was one of the very earliest capitalist industries .
Once the initial market of Latin - speaking Europeans was glutted , the production of books in localised languages oriented towards the small but growing literate strata in Europe would have an important role in creating a language of administration and high culture , and the foundations of what could be claimed as a ‘ national culture ’ in later centuries - with significant nation - building implications in the cases of what would become Germany and Italy .
The reformation [ 2 ] ( its own success deeply associated with that of the printing industry ) combined with the rising power of the merchant class in imperial states - whose own success at exchanging commodities acted as a beachhead for the capitalist social relations in Europe - would lead to the establishment of several states which were neither dynastic monarchies nor city - states .
They were not the nation - states of developed capitalism , but were significant steps towards them .
The merchants , traders and bankers which had previously operated at the fringes of feudal economies played an increasingly central role as European empires spread around the world .
Their trade in the plunder of the colonies – both riches and slaves – would make them vital to the workings of their economies , and the progressive dominance of European imperialism swelled their numbers , wealth , and political significance .
Their density in the Seventeen Provinces in the Low Countries would spur the rebellion there , and the subsequent creation of the Dutch republic in 1581 was a portent of what would follow .
The commercial successes of the merchants of the empires would lead to their influence redoubling into the societies that launched them .
In Britain the enclosure of common land [ 3 ] , the development of industry under the pressures of commerce and the outcompeting of small producers by industrial capitalist pioneers would create a dispossessed working class with no choice but to labour for private employers – in other words it would lead to the establishment of capitalism proper .
The industrial capitalist would replace the merchant as the leading player of the bourgeois class .
Concurrently , with the beginning of the end of the feudal world , and the transition to a world centred on the interests of the ascendant capitalist class , the state was redefined .
The era of monarchs and subjects was replaced by the era of ‘ citizens ’ .
A period of competing dynasties gave way to the modern period of competing nations .
Following the revolutions in France and America , the liberal conception of the state which laid the basis for nationalism solidified .
It was n’t programmatic , and did n’t need to be , as it was n’t conjured into reality from the minds of intellectuals but from the needs of a developing class society to create the conditions for its own perpetuation .
The idea was articulated in French Declaration of Rights [ 4 ] of 1795 as follows :
“ Each people is independent and sovereign , whatever the number of individuals who compose it and the extent of the territory it occupies .
This sovereignty is inalienable ” .
This understanding of the role of the state stood in contrast to the absolutism of earlier periods .
Now it was the ‘ people ’ who were sovereign , not the person of the divinely ordained ruler .
But during this period there was no clear definition of what made a ‘ people ’ .
It was circular , and relied on the territory and population of existing states , as at this point there was little in the way of attempts to define national citizenship or ‘ peoples ’ on linguistic , cultural or racial grounds .
It was nearly always a question of practicality .
The ‘ science ’ and library on national definition would not explode until a century later .
When attempts at definition did occur at this stage , such as during the second half of the Eighteenth century , nations were understood on the basis of their domination by specific states .
The French Encyclopédie , a work usually understood as encapsulating enlightenment thought prior to the revolution and published in volumes in the 1750s and 60s , defined nations in such a way .
There was no assumption of ethnic , linguistic or cultural homogeneity – to the enlightenment theorists , a nation was nothing more than a great number of people defined by proper borders and all subject to the same regime of law .
The revolution would build on this nation of subjects to create the nation of citizens ; the nation became those capable and willing of the conditions of citizenship , expressed through the state .
This understanding is still preserved in the rhetoric - if not the practice - of the nationalism of one of the nations created in the revolutions of the late 1700s : Americans are those who sign up to ‘ Americanism ’ and aspire to be Americans .
For the bourgeois revolutionaries , the theoretical community of ‘ citizens ’ - however it was defined - represented the sovereignty of the common interest against the narrow interests of the crown , though of course this was not the reality of the class society they presided over .
The understanding of nationality in terms of ethnic , cultural and linguistic distinctiveness came later , in the course of intellectual debates about what made a nation , and what ‘ nations ’ , however defined , deserved expression through a nation - state .
Once the principle of the state as the expression of the sovereign ‘ people ’ was established , the process of definition of ‘ peoples ’ intensified throughout the Nineteenth Century .
The political theorist John Stuart Mill mulled over the criteria of common ethnicity , language , religion , territory and history .
But even as thinkers were debating where the ‘ people ’ came from , the issue was mostly understood in terms of practicability .
Which ‘ peoples ’ should make nations was a question of viability , and the nations which were viable were often actually existing ones .
Eligible new nations needed the economic or cultural basis to make them sustainable , as was the case with the creation of Italy and Germany in the second half of the Nineteenth century .
The difficult question of turning populations into peoples , and peoples into nations only produced vague answers , but largely relied on the size of the population , association with a prior state , having a viable cultural elite ( as with the Germans and Italians ) and most importantly , a history of expansion and warfare , which has the virtue of creating an outside to unite against .
Ireland was exceptional in possessing a national movement of the kind that would appear later much earlier on – indeed it would provide the archetypal model to nationalisms manufactured in later years , such as those of the Indians and Basques .
However the viability of this movement was regularly dismissed on practical grounds .
Nonetheless most of the ‘ peoples ’ who would come to form ‘ nations ’ later on still did not see themselves in national terms , and did not see a moral aberration in rule by elites who spoke a different language , for the main reason that there were no unified national languages in a world of local dialects and widespread illiteracy .
Even the role of the ‘ official ’ languages had little in common with the status of modern national languages .
They were the product of expediency , and had nothing to do with any ‘ national consciousness ’ .
This had been the case for some time .
In England , for instance , the elite language progressed from Anglo - Saxon , to Latin , to Norman , to the hybrid product of Norman French and Anglo - Saxon that was early English .
The language spoken by elites remained an irrelevance to an illiterate subject population .
Even in later periods the picture was the same – in 1789 only 12 % of the French population spoke ‘ proper ’ French , with half speaking no form of French at all .
Though a shared Italian - speaking elite culture was essential to the formation of an Italian state in the Nineteenth Century , the Italian language was only spoken by about 2.5 % of ‘ Italians ’ on unification ; the population at large spoke a variety of dialects which were often mutually incomprehensible .
There had been occasional and limited attempts at telling national origin stories in earlier centuries – such as the stories circulating in Sixteenth century France about the descent of the French ( i.e. its elite ) from the Franks and from Troy .
However , these were limited to small literate circles and functioned to rationalise royal and / or aristocratic rights , rights which were defended much more frequently , effectively and popularly by claims to divine orders or to Roman precedent .
These stories were the consequence of a small literate elite sharing the same language and institutional privileges communicating with each other , a starting point for the nationalism of later centuries .
They in no way indicated a modern , popular ‘ national consciousness ’ .
They lacked the popular motive force of nationalism , the understanding that the state should express the wellbeing of the nation as a whole , and the constitution of this nation on a popular level .
When the old dynasties attempted to reconcile themselves with modern nationalism in the age of its dominance they did so at their own peril : Kaiser Wilhelm II , though increasingly marginalised during the First World War , positioned himself as the nation ’s leading German , therefore implying some form of responsibility to the German people and national interest - and thus the conclusion that he had failed in this responsibility , the very conclusion which led to his abdication .
Such ideas would have been unthinkable in earlier years where the right of the Kaiser was inviolable and accountable to no-one .
As the Nineteenth century progressed , so too did the idea that all peoples had a right to self - determination , irrespective of questions of viability .
The Italian Nationalist and philosopher Giuseppe Mazzini would pose the formula ‘ every nation a state , and only one state for each nation ’ to resolve ‘ the national question ’ .
This way of thinking consolidated towards the end of the century , at the same time that nationalism had gained a common currency amongst the masses .
The proliferation of nationalist and ‘ national liberation ’ movements in the late 1800s is striking – the birth of Zionism alongside Indian , Armenian , Macedonian , Georgian , Belgian , Catalan movements , along with many others occurred in this period , though whether these specific movements had any traction among the wider population is another matter .
Though in earlier periods there had been some ethnic or linguistic groups which understood themselves as in some way distinct from their neighbours , the translation of this into the need to have a nation - state of each and every grouping was a new phenomenon .
And even prior to this , the ‘ commonality ’ which was used to define the nation , however it was understood , was something produced by the modern period – modern printing , education , transport and communications led to the erosion of local linguistic variation and a public culture which would allow for the idea of the nation to take hold .
This would n’t have been possible in earlier periods where this infrastructure for breaking down cultures which could be specific from one village to the next did n’t exist .
The national language , often a prerequisite for functioning nationalism , was a contemporary invention , requiring increased literacy , circulation of people and the erosion of parochial , feudal social relations , as we have seen .
Contrary to the fantasies of nationalists , who see the shared language as the basic bond on which the nation - state is based , a common national language was the creation of the developing modern state .
By the last decades of the Nineteenth Century , the idea that each ‘ people ’ had a moral right to their own nation - state was solidly established .
The concerns about viability which defined earlier debates had disappeared .
It was now a right of ‘ peoples ’ , defined in whichever way , to a state of their own .
To be ruled by another nation or its representatives was abhorrent ( in theory at least – imperialism had its own logic ) .
It was during this period that the ethnic and linguistic definition of the ‘ nation ’ came to dominance over earlier forms .
The competing imperialist nation - states of contemporary capitalism were fully - formed , and movements advocating resistance to and secession from them understood their activity and ultimate aims in terms of creating new nation - states .
The development of modern nationalism was bound up with the fact that the modern capitalist state , with an exploited population educated to a higher level than its feudal predecessors , required more from its citizens than the passive peasantry of earlier periods .
It required a socially unifying force , and to integrate the working class into the state regime – it needed the active allegiance of the population , rather than the immiserated passivity of the peasants .
The invention of patriotism filled this need .
A consciousness of and allegiance to the ‘ fatherland ’ or ‘ motherland ’ was developed became commonplace through the European nation - states of the final third of the Nineteenth century .
The development of the term ‘ patriotism ’ tells us all we need to know .
The ‘ Patrie ’ , the ‘ homeland ’ which forms the basis of the term , was defined prior to the French revolution as simply being a local area of origin , without national implications .
By the late Nineteenth century , it was the imagined community of the nation , which demanded mass participation .
Combined with the new pseudoscience of race , which had become so important in replacing paganism as the justification for imperial dispossession of various local populations , the ideology of national supremacy was born .
This principle reached its apogee in the First World War and the period following it .
Late nineteenth century jingoism was transformed into an ideology of total war , of mechanised slaughter between militarised national blocs .
Every aspect of life was subsumed under the ‘ national interest ’ ; internal disputes had to be suspended for the sake of the nation ’s supremacy and - given every combatant state claimed the war was a defensive one - survival .
Following the end of this capitalist bloodbath , the European map was redrawn on national lines .
An attempt was made to put the ideal of ‘ every nation a state ’ into practice , and the ‘ Wilsonian idealism ’ [ 5 ] of ‘ national self - determination ’ was made a geopolitical reality .
The break - up of the Austro - Hungarian Empire into new nation - states was an attempt to solve the problem of ‘ oppressed nations ’ .
It did n’t work , for reasons which are integral to nationalism – these new states were not homogenous , and were themselves were full of new minorities .
The principle of ‘ self - determination ’ of ‘ peoples ’ once accepted , has no end , hence the rapid diffusion of antagonistic minority nationalisms throughout the world , with few countries untouched by them .
The fundamental principle of nationalism is that national collectives of human beings have a right to self - determination in and through ‘ their ’ nation , but when it comes down to it , it is impossible to define exactly which groups of people are ‘ nations ’ and which are n’t , and there are always smaller and smaller groups claiming this mantle .
Nationalism , then , is something with a very real history and origin .
Its power lies in the way it is presented as a natural state of things , and the assumption that national divisions and national determination are a natural part of human life , always have been and always will be .
Anarchists take a very different view .
The same period of history which created the nation - state and capitalism also created something left out of nationalist accounts – the dispossessed class of wage - workers whose interests stand in opposition to those of the capitalist nation state : the working class .
This class which is obliged to fight in their interests against capital are not a ‘ people ’ , but a condition of existence within capitalism , and as such transcend national borders .
This antagonism led to the development of revolutionary perspectives challenging the world of capitalism , and posing a different world entirely .
Our perspective , anarchist communism , is one of these .
Why do anarchists oppose nationalism ?
Anarchists in the class struggle ( or communist ) tradition , such as the anarchist federation , do not see the world in terms of competing national peoples , but in terms of class .
We do not see a world of nations in struggle , but of classes in struggle .
The nation is a smokescreen , a fantasy which hides the struggle between classes which exists within and across them .
Though there are no real nations , there are real classes with their own interests , and these classes must be differentiated .
Consequently , there is no single ‘ people ’ within the ‘ nation ’ , and there is no shared ‘ national interest ’ which unifies them .
Anarchist communists do not simply oppose nationalism because it is bound up in racism and parochial bigotry .
It undoubtedly fosters these things , and mobilised them through history .
Organising against them is a key part of anarchist politics .
But nationalism does not require them to function .
Nationalism can be liberal , cosmopolitan and tolerant , defining the ‘ common interest ’ of ‘ the people ’ in ways which do not require a single ‘ race ’ .
Even the most extreme nationalist ideologies , such as fascism , can co-exist with the acceptance of a multiracial society , as was the case with the Brazilian Integralist movement [ 6 ] .
Nationalism uses what works – it utilises whatever superficial attribute is effective to bind society together behind it .
In some cases it utilises crude racism , in other cases it is more sophisticated .
It manipulates what is in place to its own ends .
In many western countries , official multiculturalism is a key part of civic policy and a corresponding multicultural nationalism has developed alongside it .
The shared ‘ national culture ’ comes to be official multiculturalism itself , allowing for the integration of ‘ citizens ’ into the state without recourse to crude monoculturalism .
If the nationalist rhetoric of the capitalist state was of the most open , tolerant and anti-racist kind , anarchists would still oppose it .
This is because , at heart , nationalism is an ideology of class collaboration .
It functions to create an imagined community of shared interests and in doing so to hide the real , material interests of the classes which comprise the population .
The ‘ national interest ’ is a weapon against the working class , and an attempt to rally the ruled behind the interests of their rulers .
The ideological and sometimes physical mobilisation of the population on a mass scale in the name of some shared and central national trait have marked the wars of the Twentieth and Twenty - First centuries – the bloodbath in Iraq rationalised in the name of Western democratic culture and the strengthening of the domestic state in the name of defending the British or American traditions of freedom and democracy against Islamic terror are recent examples .
Ultimately , the anarchist opposition to nationalism follows a simple principle .
The working class and the employing class have nothing in common .
This is not just a slogan , but the reality of the world we live in .
Class antagonism is an inherent part of capitalism , and will exist irrespective of whether intellectuals and political groups theorise about its existence or non-existence .
Class is not about your accent , your consumption habits , or whether your collar is blue or white .
The working class – what is sometimes called the proletariat - is the dispossessed class , the class who have no capital , no control over the overall conditions of their lives and nothing to live off but their ability to work for a wage .
They may well have a house and a car , but they still need to sell their ability to work to an employer in return for the money they need to live on .
Their interests are specific , objective and material : to get more money from their employers for less work , and to get better living and working conditions .
The interests of capital are directly opposed : to get more work out of us for less , and to cut corners and costs , in order to return a higher rate of profit and allow their money to become more money more quickly and efficiently .
Class struggle is the competition between these interests .
Even non-productive workplaces are shaped by these rules , as they are the fundamental principles of capitalist society .
The interests of capital are expressed through those with power , who are likewise obliged to maintain these interests in order to keep their own power – owners of private capital , the bosses who make decisions on its behalf , and the state which is required to enshrine and defend private property and ownership rights .
The ‘ national interest ’ is simply the interest of capital within the country in question .
It is the interest of the owners of society , who in turn can only express the fundamental needs of capital – accumulate or die .
At home , its function is to domesticate those within a society who can pose antagonism with it – the working class .
This antagonism , which is inherent to capitalism , is one which anarchists see as being capable of moving beyond capitalism .
We have to struggle in our interests to get the things we need as concessions from capital .
This dynamic takes place regardless of whether elaborate theories are constructed around it .
Workers in China or Bangladesh occupying factories and rioting against the forces of the state are not necessarily doing it because they have encountered revolutionary theory , but because the conditions of their lives mean they have to .
Similarly class solidarity exists not because people are charitable but because solidarity is in their interests .
The capitalists have the state - the law , the courts and prisons .
We only have each other .
Alone we can achieve very little , but together we can cause disruption to the everyday functioning of capitalism , a powerful weapon .
Of course , class struggles are rarely pure and unsullied things , and they can be overlaid with bigotries and factional interests of various kinds .
It is the job of revolutionary groups and anarchist organisation in the workplace to combat these tendencies , to contribute to the development of class consciousness and militancy and to complement the process by which divisions are challenged through joint struggle which takes place within struggles of significant magnitude .
The ruling class are fully aware of these issues , and are conscious in acting in their interests .
Solidarity is the only thing we can hold over their heads , and for that reason the state takes great care to get us to act against our own interests .
Nationalism is one of their greatest weapons in this regard , and has consequently served an important historical purpose .
It lines us up behind our enemies , and demands we ignore our own interests as members of the working class in deference to those of the nation .
It leads to the domestication of the working class , leading working class people to identify themselves in and through the nation and to see solutions to the problems they face in terms of it .
This is not terminal as we already know ; circumstances can force people to act in their interests , and through this process ideas develop and change .
To take a dramatic example from history , workers across the world marched off to war to butcher one another in 1914 , only to take up arms against their masters in an international wave of strikes , mutinies , uprisings and revolutions from 1917 onwards .
Nonetheless , nationalism is a poison to be resisted tooth and nail .
It is an ideology of domestication .
It is a weapon against us .
It is an organised parochialism , designed to split the working class - which as a position within the economic system is international - along national lines .
Ultimately , even if we lay aside our principled and theoretical opposition to nationalism , the idea of any kind of meaningful national self - determination in the modern world is idealism .
Nations cannot self - determine when subject to a world capitalist market , and those who frame their politics in terms of regaining national sovereignty against world capitalism , such as contemporary fascists and their fellow travellers , seek an unattainable golden age before modern capitalism .
The modern world is an integrated one , one where international ‘ co- operation ’ and conflict cannot be readily separated , and which are expressed through international institutions and organisations like the UN , WTO , World Bank , EU , NATO , and so on .
The nationalist fantasy is an empty one as much as it is a reactionary one .
Anarchists recognise as much in their opposition .
We will return to this point later .
Before we go further , it is necessary to pre-empt a common and fallacious ‘ criticism ’ .
We do not stand for monoculture .
We do not seek to see the rich diversity of human cultural expression standardised in an anarchist society .
How could we ?
The natural mixing of culture stands against the fantasies of nationalists .
National blocs are never impervious to cultural influence , and culture spreads and mingles with time .
The idea of self - contained national cultures , which nationalists are partisans of , is a myth .
Against this we pose the free interchange of cultural expression in a free , stateless communist society as a natural consequence of the struggle against the state and capitalism .
The anarchist communist opposition to nationalism must be vocal and clear .
We do not fudge internationalism .
Internationalism does not mean the co-operation of capitalist nations , or national working classes , but the fundamental critique of the idea of the nation and nationality .
The left and the ‘ national question ’
The contemporary sight of leftist groups supporting reactionary organisations and states is something frequently criticised by a number of voices for a number of reasons .
The revulsion at the sight of self - proclaimed socialists cheerleading organisations like Hamas , chanting “ we are all Hezbollah ” at ‘ anti - war ’ demonstrations , and supporting regimes which repress workers ’ struggles , imprison and execute working class activists , oppress women and persecute gays and lesbians is entirely justified .
But the manner of thinking which allows for this to happen has a long pedigree .
The way in which Marxist movements accommodated to nationalism , and in many cases functioned as the midwives of nationalist movements and nation - states every bit as objectionable as their western counterparts is the foundation of contemporary ‘ anti- imperialist ’ nationalism , and understanding the relationship between the workers ’ movement and nationalism is vital to understanding modern ‘ wars of national liberation ’ and the response to them .
Marx himself , as on so many questions , did not provide any one clear position which we can accurately attribute as categorically ‘ his ’ .
The Communist Manifesto , despite comprising a patently non-communist program , concluded with the famous call , ‘ workers of the world , unite ! ’ , expressing the internationalist opposition to the domestication of the working class by nationalism .
At the same time , Marx and Engels shared the standard liberal - nationalist view of the time that the principle of nation - building was consolidation , not disintegration .
Engels famously remarked that he did not see the Czechs surviving as an independent people for this reason .
For some time Marx and Engels supported the ‘ national liberation ’ of Poland ( and consequently a movement for independence led by aristocrats ) for strategic reasons – striking a blow against autocratic Russia and , in their view , defending capitalist development and therefore the preconditions for socialism in Western Europe .
His attitude to Ireland was marked by similar tactical considerations .
Discussing the rights and wrongs of this approach in a period of developed world capitalism is academic , and beyond the remit of this pamphlet .
But it is clear that in many ways Marx was reflecting the widespread views of the early to mid 19th century liberal nationalism as it has been outlined above .
The leftist demand for national self - determination as a right was current at the same time it became so more generally and debates over the ‘ national question ’ animated the second international , with the conflict on the question between Lenin and the Polish - born Marxist Rosa Luxembourg becoming notorious .
Lenin ’s positions were typically contradictory , though in the main he argued on similar grounds to Marx on the matter – national liberation should be supported in as far as it advanced the development of the working class cause and the preconditions for socialism .
Nonetheless , the Bolsheviks were vocal in their support of ‘ the right of nations to self - determination ’ , following the passing of a resolution by the second international supporting the ‘ complete right of all nations to self - determination ’ .
This view was opposed by Rosa Luxemburg .
Luxemburg recognised that the matter of ‘ national independence ’ was a question of force , not ‘ rights ’ .
For her , the discussion of the ‘ rights ’ of ‘ self - determination ’ was utopian , idealist and metaphysical ; its reference point was the not the material opposition of classes but the world of bourgeois nationalist myths .
She was particularly vocal on this point when arguing against the Polish socialists , who used Marx ’s earlier ( tactical ) position as a permanent blessing for their own nationalism .
Nonetheless , it was the Bolsheviks who seized power in Russia , leading the counter - revolution in that country .
Following the civil war , their support for the ‘ right of nations to self - determination ’ led to some curious experiments in ‘ nation - building ’ which stood in parallel with the efforts of Woodrow Wilson and the Versailles Treaty in Europe a few years previously .
[ 7 ]
The creation of ‘ national administrative units ’ for various non-Russian ‘ nations ’ within the newly proclaimed USSR was a result of the assumptions of Soviet bureaucrats , not due to some will to nationhood of the Uzbeks , Turkmen and Kazakhs .
Of course , with the crushing of the Russian revolution by the state - capitalist regime under the control of the Bolsheviks , who systematically destroyed or co-opted both the organs of self - management the working class had developed for themselves and the revolutionaries who defended them ( such as the anarchists ) , the question was rendered null , as the Bolsheviks ’ sole consideration was their own power .
Like its Western rival , the USSR used the rhetoric of ‘ self - determination ’ and ‘ independence ’ to expand its own sphere of dominance .
Still , the principle that nations had an inherent right to self - determination against ‘ national oppression ’ had gained a commonsensical dominance amongst the workers ’ movement , as it had amongst the wider population .
National Liberation Struggles
Following their consolidation of power during the civil war , Bolshevik policy swiftly took on the nationalist character that could be expected .
In 1920 , the Bolsheviks granted support to the bourgeois nationalist movement in Turkey under Kemal Pasha for the blow its victory would strike to British imperialism .
This was the first stage in the use of support for ‘ anti- imperialist ’ ‘ national liberation struggles ’ as Bolshevik geopolitical strategy .
For the working class in Turkey , it was disastrous , resulting in the vigorous crushing of strikes and demonstrations by the new Turkish republic .
Similarly the Kuomintang – the Chinese nationalist movement - were extended Soviet support , leading to the slaughter of insurrectionary workers in Shanghai .
The new ruling class in Russia extended their support to such anti-working class forces in the name of defending the revolution .
Some of these forces would paint their nationalist state - capitalism in the colours of communism , but nonetheless represented movements to establish a viable nation - state with an exploited working class and a commodity producing ( state - ) capitalist economy .
The influence of this development on the left throughout the world was profound , compounding the place of support for ‘ national liberation struggle ’ as a basic part of the ‘ common sense ’ of the workers ’ movement .
This did not just apply to the various breeds of state - socialists – the Trotskyists , Maoists and Stalinists , but also had its effect on some anarchists .
For the Stalinists , whose politics in any case had nationalism in its blood , ‘ national liberation struggles ’ were seen to undermine US machinations , to the benefit of the USSR - which supported such struggles materially or politically in pursuance of its own imperialist objectives .
For the Maoists and those influenced by the Cuban revolution , smashing western imperialism through national liberation was necessary to allow the peasant - worker movements of those countries to rapidly develop their economies to ( in their claims ) the benefit of the population .
For the Trotskyists , various historical schemes were developed explaining why imperialism was , as described by Lenin , the highest form of capitalism , and why the defeat of imperialism by national liberation forces was in the interests of the socialist cause .
This was joined and compounded by the wave of Third - Worldism in the 1960s which was in many ways a reflection on the failure of the unrest of that period to materialise into a revolutionary movement , happening as it did at the same time as the decomposition of Western colonialism .
Building on the ground laid by Lenin ’s writings , the Western working class was seen as dominated by a ‘ labour aristocracy ’ based on the extraction of wealth from the victims of imperialism , and the hope for socialism lay with the ‘ self - determination ’ of non-Western peoples .
The relativistic support of exotic movements for their opposition to ‘ imperialism ’ , reduced down to US imperialism , continues to this day , and can be seen in the enthusiasm of Western leftists for reactionary Islamists .
This view is of course fallacious and reactionary , placing national antagonism before class antagonism .
But in the post - war period , the international , postcolonial left had an effective monopoly over national liberation movements .
Stalinism had long since accommodated itself to flag - waving nationalism , in many instances being indistinguishable in its rhetoric from fascism proper .
The left had taken a leading role in the anti-fascist resistance movements in Europe during the war , allowing for these groups to claim the nationalist mantle upon liberation and to act as the leading representatives of the liberated ‘ will ’ of the nation .
A striking example is the leading role in the Greek resistance during the second world war of the Stalinist and patriotic EAM - ELAS , who were not above publicly decapitating anarchist militants and murdering rivals in the resistance and workers ’ movements [ 8 ] .
In the post - war period , this consolidation of leftism with patriotism determined the left character of various colonial national liberation movements , making nationalism a key component of the left internationally , and the left the midwife of nationalist movements around the world .
Unfortunately , anarchists are not impervious to such views .
Many anarchists have managed to defend struggles for ‘ national liberation ’ - that is , struggles for one form of the state against another - in terms of the struggle against oppression , the basic currency of anarchist politics .
By their reasoning , as anarchists oppose the various oppressions of the contemporary world ; the exploitation of the working class , the oppression of women and sexual and ethnic minorities , we must also oppose the oppression of one nation by another .
There is some basis for this in the classical anarchist tradition , such as in Bakunin ’s notorious statement : “ every nationality , great or small , has the incontestable right to be itself , to live according to its own nature .
This right is simply the corollary of the general principal of freedom ” .
More recently , Murray Bookchin claimed in Society and Nature that “ no left libertarian ... can oppose the right of a subjugated people to establish itself as an autonomous entity -- be it in a confederation . . . or as a nation - state based in hierarchical and class inequities . "
Similarly , leftists often conflate opposition to imperialist war with support for national liberation , or at least muddy the waters of conversation enough to make the confusion inevitable .
This is to turn the justified horror felt against such wars on its head , and to move from a position against war to a position for war – as waged by the underdog side .
History is replete with examples , from some anti-Vietnam war protestors chanting the name of North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh to some leftists proclaiming ‘ we are all Hezbollah now ’ during the protests against the bombing of Lebanon by the Israeli state .
This support of the underdog state or state in waiting must be opposed .
There is no essence of national resistance , no essential oppressed national spirit which is being channelled by the national liberation forces .
They are real organised forces with their own aims and goals – to set up a particular form of exploiting state , with particular factions in control of it .
The nation is not something primordial to be repressed , but a narrative constructed by the capitalist state in the course of its development .
Though the imperial structure comes to be part of the apparatus of exploitation over the working class in the territory affected , the rearrangement of this exploiting apparatus in favour of a ‘ native ’ state is a reactionary goal .
As we have seen , the logic of nationalism is an inherently reactionary one , in that it functions to binds together classes into one national collectivity .
Moreover , simply in practical terms , the principle of nationalism has no end ; the new , ‘ independent ’ states always contain minorities whose own ‘ national self - determination ’ is denied .
Secondly , the forms of exploitation set up by ‘ native ’ rulers after struggles of national liberation are in concrete terms in no way preferable to the methods of the ‘ foreigners ’ .
Workers in North Korea are oppressed by a native ‘ communist ’ state comparable in brutality to the European fascist dictatorships of the 20th century , workers in Vietnam are exploited by an capitalist export - led economy , workers in Zimbabwe , free of British imperialism , are now preyed on by a gangsterish ‘ native ’ regime .
Many more examples are not difficult to find .
All these countries experience class struggle of a greater or lesser intensity .
Class struggle is part of the fabric of capitalism , including despotic state - capitalism of the Bolshevik model , and this will be the case irrespective of whether the ruling class faced at any particular time are drawn from ‘ native ’ ranks or not .
Moreover , these ‘ liberated ’ states , once freed from the national oppression of Western colonialism , have proven to be fully capable of launching brutal wars of their own .
The case of Vietnam is instructive .
Immediately after re-unification in 1976 , which came following the withdrawal of US troops in 1973 , Vietnam was embroiled in a series of wars across the Indochinese subcontinent .
This started with a brutal territorial war with the Khmer Rouge , who had come to power following the savage US bombing of Cambodia , resulting in the occupation of that country by Vietnamese troops .
This led to Vietnam ’s domination of the region , supported by Soviet imperialism .
Laos was effectively a client state of Vietnam , which maintained military bases in the country and forced the Lao government to cut its ties with China .
In 1979 , as a consequence of Vietnam ’s war with its Cambodian client , and various border incidents and conflicting territorial claims , China invaded the country , leading to tens of thousands of deaths and the devastation of Northern Vietnam .
The ‘ liberation ’ of nations from the yoke of imperialism has led to further cycles of war in other parts of the world , with many 20th century national movements being directed against new , post - colonial states rather than Western powers .
Sri Lanka is an example of the lingering scars of Western imperialism conjoining with the power plays of communalist ruling classes , leading to a downward spiral of war and ethnic - nationalist violence as competing national movements throw ‘ their ’ working classes into conflict with one another .
The British imperial administration in Sri Lanka instituted a system of communalist representation on the Island ’s legislative council from the mid-19th century , establishing antagonism between the minority Tamils and majority Sinhalese which continues to this day .
After the introduction of universal suffrage , and eventually the granting of independence after WW2 , the access of Tamils – who before this point had been over - represented in government - to privileged positions was squeezed , deepening separatist sentiment alongside increasing discrimination against the Tamil minority .
The colonisation of Tamil - speaking areas by the Sinhala government , the establishment of Sinhalese as the official language , and the banning of Tamil books , newspapers and magazines imported from Indian Tamil regions all lay the foundations for the rise of Tamil militant groups and the Sri Lankan civil war .
The growth in size of militant groups such as the notorious Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) was fuelled by the real grievances faced by Tamils , especially after the Black July pogroms in 1983 in which hundreds of Tamils were massacred .
However , the idea that the LTTE is the guardian of Tamil national self - defence fades when it is remembered that among their earliest targets were rival Tamil nationalist and Communist groups , such as Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation , which was effectively wiped out by the LTTE in 1986 .
After the LTTE became the de-facto government in a number of Tamil areas , it turned on the new minorities – Sri Lankan Muslims , who were ethnically cleansed from the region through evictions , intimidations and eventually massacres , including the machine - gunning of men , women and children who had been locked inside a mosque .
Significant numbers of Sinhalese workers who remained in LTTE - controlled areas suffered similar fates .
Nationalism , even that of ‘ oppressed nations ’ offers nothing but further rounds of violence and conflict , the division of the working class on national lines , and their sacrifice to the ‘ national interest ’ , whether that of the existing state or those of states in waiting .
The absence of Western imperialism does not bring peace , and national liberation does not lead to self - determination , an impossibility in the capitalist world .
This is due to the very nature of the nation - state , which is imperialist by nature .
All nation - states are imperialist
‘ Imperialism ’ has a long history , with its forms and varieties stretching back as far as the forms and varieties of the state and class society .
As the word describes many different projects by many different states in various periods , we have to clarify what it means in the context of advanced capitalist society .
The Roman Empire was different to the British Empire ; contemporary imperialism is different still .
This does not mean imperialism is n’t something we can identify .
Still , we have to define more precisely the phenomenon we are describing .
The power of the classical empires of the ancient world stemmed from the conquest of land and the mobilisation of its resources .
The continuity between state control of land and Imperial power made their imperialism the archetype ; its most basic and transparent form .
The ‘ foreign policy ’ of contemporary capitalist nation states seems a world away .
But in the modern world , imperialism is as embedded in the working of states as at any time in history .
The functioning and nature of imperialism changed along with the economic organisation of the society it was part of .
As the form of the state in an agrarian slave society is different to that of a developed capitalist society , so too is the imperialism of that state .
But despite the multitude of changes the world has since undergone , the state remains the actor of contemporary imperialism .
This may seem a strange comment in a world where the leading powers are liberal democracies which send innumerable functionaries to innumerable meetings , summits , forums and international organisations .
Nonetheless , imperialism is absolutely vital to the functioning of capitalist societies , and its success is inseparable from the success of leading powers .
The pressures of capitalism transformed the imperialism which preceded and nurtured it .
The wave of speculative investments which flooded out of Europe from the 1850s as capital sought profitable investment led to an intensification of imperialist activity , with states impelled to protect and regulate the interests of capital within their national bounds .
This would intensify after the 1870s .
The direct British government of India after the mutiny put its interests in jeopardy is one early example ( previously it had been ruled by a British company ) , and the ‘ scramble for Africa ’ from the 1880s to the First World War represented the definitive transformation of the ‘ informal Imperialism ’ of earlier decades to a system of direct rule in which Imperialist powers carved up the world between them .
As we know , this system broke apart following the Second World War and during the period of decolonisation through the second half of the Twentieth century .
However , the essential dynamic by which states act to the benefit of capital within the country in question by the manipulation of geopolitical inequalities remains as an essential part of the makeup of the capitalist world .
The state must act to further the interests of the capital – what is often called the ‘ business interests ’ – of the country over which it has jurisdiction .
Within the country in question it nurtures capitalism , it enshrines the property laws it requires in order to exist , it opens spaces of accumulation for capital , it rescues capital from its own destructive tendencies ( sometimes against the protests of particular capitalists ) and manages class struggle through the combination of coercion and co-option : it can and does smash strikes , but it also grants unions a role in managing the workforce and thus creates a pressure - valve for class struggle .
The state is the ‘ collective capitalist ’ ; it is the guarantor and underwriter of the capitalist system .
This function also extends to ‘ foreign policy ’ .
The state negotiates access for domestic companies to resources , investment , trading and expansion abroad .
The success of this process brings profits flowing back into the country in question and by enriching its business and the ‘ national economy ’ , the state secures the material basis of its own power : it increases its own resources , wealth and ability to project itself .
It is therefore not simply a puppet of ‘ corporate interests ’ , but is an interested party in its own right .
At the same time the state must seek to avoid its own domination , it must marshal its resources – military , diplomatic , cultural and economic – to maintain its own international position .
There is constant struggle - whether at the roundtable with ‘ international partners ’ discussing trade policy or at arms in international ‘ hotspots ’ and ‘ flashpoints ’ – to ensure that the ‘ national interest ’ is advanced abroad and defended at home .
These interests are furthered by maintaining , defending and manipulating inequalities which exist within capitalism across geographical space .
For example , these asymmetries are today often expressed through phenomena such as regional monopolies , unequal exchange , restricted capital flows , and the manipulation of monopoly rents .
Imperialism is about the mobilisation of these differences to the benefit of the economy of the state in question – meaning the capital within it .
This is the normal functioning of the world economy , and is visible for example in US mobilisation of the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organisation to the benefit of US financial industries or in Chinese manoeuvres in sub-Saharan Africa .
States must participate in this system of constantly shifting balances of power irrespective of intentions , as those unable to ward off or manage these pressures will be totally dominated by them .
War comes to have an obvious function .
Imperialist interventions can occasionally be motivated by specific quantitative gains , such as the exploitation of a specific resource .
More often , however , the question is one of geopolitical strategy and outflanking other power blocs in order to maintain regional or international power .
Resources are usually seen in strategic terms , not in terms of simple exploitation .
If exploitation of Iraqi oil had been the US ’ sole aim in the Persian Gulf , it would have been far cheaper and easier to leave Saddam in power and negotiate access .
The question was one of militarily controlling this strategic resource , hence the invasion of Iraq .
Control of Middle Eastern oil , which has a continued shelf - life beyond that of rival reserves , would grant the US effective control over the world economy , and specifically the economies of China , Russia , Japan and Europe , with their rival financial and manufacturing industries .
Similarly , the occupation of Afghanistan had little to do with exploiting particular resources , and everything to do with controlling a strategic point in the Caucasus and projecting into the spheres of influence of Russia and China .
Afghanistan was occupied by the British and Russians for similar strategic reasons .
The war in Vietnam ran the risk of damaging short – term capital accumulation , but nonetheless formed part of a grander imperial strategy which stood to benefit the interests of US capital by securing the leading global role of the US and making the ‘ free world ’ safe for investment and exploitation .
However , when faced with these practices , leftists often draw questionable conclusions .
Following the logic of support for national liberation struggles , and the need to discover a proxy to support , leftists will often cheer - lead the regimes of states which are subject to the machinations of Western Imperialism .
However , ‘ national oppression ’ has nothing to do with class struggle , and the support for regimes which are active in the suppression of ‘ their ’ workers and the persecution of minorities in the pursuit of ‘ anti- imperialist ’ politics is completely reactionary .
It also fails to understand imperialism , which is a consequence of a world capitalist system .
States and national capitals which have an uneven relationship with larger powers will also have different asymmetric relations with other powers .
The ‘ victims ’ of Western Imperialism have their own agendas , and imperialist policies of their own .
Iran and Venezuela , for instance , certainly do ; Venezuela in advancing its interest by expanding its sphere of influence around Latin America , and Iran in doing the same in Iraq , Lebanon , Africa and elsewhere .
Imperialism does not simply emanate from a handful of big powers , oppressing smaller countries and extending their reach across the world .
Undoubtedly there are imperialist policies that are much more successful than others .
But the nation - state has imperialism in its very blood .
Even if a state wished to stay ‘ civilised ’ and avoid the dynamics of imperialist competition and conflict , it would be forced to defend itself against attempts to prey on this weakness by other powers , using methods of greater or lesser directness .
As a result , states with less capacity to project themselves align with those with more , using a logic that a child could understand .
After nationalism
A common question remains however .
If anarchists do not line up alongside the left in supporting national liberation struggles , and in demanding national self - determination , what is it that we support ?
What is our alternative ?
On one level , the question itself should be rejected .
There are many things we do not support on principle , and are never required to offer an alternative to .
Refusing to support something actively reactionary in its aims is preferable to ‘ doing something ’ which stands against our fundamental principles .
Nationalism can offer nothing except further rounds of conflict , which look set to increase in number and severity as national competition over the world ’s dwindling energy resources increases .
When conflict is framed in national terms – understood as the conflict between an oppressed and an oppressor nation – the working class necessarily loses out .
Internationalists are familiar with the hysterical response with which interventions can be met .
To many , ‘ Resistance ’ to Imperialist warmongering is beyond question and criticism – antagonists to specific imperialist projects cease to have agency , aims or objectives as the capitalist faction they are ; they are simply ‘ the resistance ’ and as such are beyond criticism .
Leftist support for the ‘ Palestinian resistance ’ , for instance , follows such a logic – it extends even to groups such as Hamas , which repress workers ’ struggles , break up pickets at gun point , oppress women and brutalise and kill gays and lesbians .
But all this is forgotten once Hamas are subsumed into ‘ the resistance ’ , and to criticise ‘ the resistance ’ is beyond the pale .
To bring a class perspective to the issue , to publicise the fact that the forces of national liberation act exactly like the capitalist forces they are and defend the interests of capitalism , the state or the state in waiting against any independent working class struggles , or even the threat of them , is tantamount to siding with imperialism .
Refusing to side with one faction by this logic is effectively the same as siding with the other .
The problem is that the tendency to see the world in national rather than class terms is deeply engrained in the psychology of the left , as much as it is in wider society .
Though leftists may be capable of criticising nationalism in their own back yard , they are incapable of doing it when faced with exotic foreign movements .
This reflects the powerlessness of the left .
When faced with brutal war and the slaughter of populations in distant parts of the world , a proxy is sought in response to their own lack of agency .
Supporting the underdog side - the ‘ resistance ’ - forms a substitute .
However , when faced with wars in other parts of the world , we must face the reality that there is little we can do to stop this or that particular war .
Boycotts of the goods of one of the antagonist nations ( for example in the repeated calls for the boycotting of Israeli goods ) have little effect , despite the positive feelings that ‘ doing something ’ might entail .
Class struggle , in the arena of war and in the antagonist nations is the only strategy we can support if we seek a world without wars – of national liberation or otherwise .
Struggling from a class position – advancing the material interests of the working class , rather than fighting on the terrain of nationalism , is what stands to break free of the binds of nationalism .
All national forces share an interest in preventing independent workers movements , and ‘ national liberation ’ forces share a history of suppressing independent workers action – the IRA for example acted to maintain cross-class unity behind Irish republicanism by breaking strikes during the class struggles of the 1920s .
More recently Hamas has broken up strikes by teachers and government employees .
Nationalism is to be opposed because it binds workers together behind it ; class struggles are supported because they pose the possibility of severing this bind , and the risk of this severance strikes terror into nationalist movements .
The principle of taking a class line , rather than a national line , must also inform our politics in the countries we reside in .
Nationalism is a powerful force , and it holds a strong influence over the working class around the world .
In Britain , where identity and communalism are constantly marketed and mobilised in official discourse , the need to belong to a people , community or cultural group fills a powerful function , and offers dispossessed , powerless people something important to belong to , something above and beyond the dreary monotony of daily life .
Nationalism is packaged and sold as another commodity , it is a spectacle of participation in a society that is defined the separation between our needs and desires and the reasons for our day - to - day activity .
The idea of being part of a community , having a heritage to claim and something above and beyond immediate reality to take pride in is very powerful .
As a result , nationalism can overlay and distort class struggles ; material struggles can become struggles in the defence of the national interest , struggles for the reorganisation of the nation through the application of a different form of government and against other sections of the working class defined on national , racial or sectarian grounds .
There are plenty of historical examples of racist strikes against black workers , against immigrants or to other reactionary ends , from dock workers striking in defence of Enoch Powell to the loyalist Ulster workers ’ council strike against power - sharing in Northern Ireland .
Even day to day struggles can be infused with nationalism , through the deployment of nationalist myths in discourse , and through the nationalism of the unions .
The appearance of national flags at demonstrations , pickets and rallies around the world is not uncommon .
However , consciousness develops in the course of struggle .
Revolutionary consciousness does not gain a leading position in society as a result of the conversion of the entire population to anarchist positions – it does not come about as a result of winning the ‘ war of ideas ’ in the arena of democratic debate .
Propaganda is useful and necessary , but its purpose is to build political minorities which can join in struggles , winning respect for anarchist ideas and applying them in practice .
Revolutionary consciousness comes about as a result of mass struggle , and class struggle is immanent to capitalism .
It is through mass struggle that consciousness develops .
Under capitalism , ‘ pure ’ struggles rarely exist .
It is through struggle in the defence of material working class interests , related to material demands – more pay , less hours , access to services , eventually against work and capitalism altogether – that the bonds of nationalism can be severed by posing the incompatibility of our needs with the needs of capitalism to stay profitable .
The separate interests of classes become apparent in such struggles , and the ability to draw the conclusion that the capitalist system itself must be destroyed can and has spread like wildfire .
Internationalist political groups and organisations have an important role to play in agitating against nationalism , and in countering nationalist tendencies in struggles as they develop .
We must stand staunchly against militarism , nationalism and war , and agitate on a practical basis accordingly .
We must counter nationalism within the working class , offering solidarity around class interests as the practical course through which working class people can defend their own interests .
Against the left , and its proposed reorganisation the capitalist world of nation - states , we stand firmly for a world without borders , without nations and without states , for a world based on free access to the products of human activity , for the satisfaction of human needs and desires ; a co-operative , stateless world in which human beings can realise their full potential as creative beings .
In the struggle towards that ultimate aim , we are firm in our stance that workers have no country , that the working class must unite across all divides , and that solidarity of all workers is the principle on which any future victories rely .
To conclude , we here make some suggestions for the activities of anarchists when faced with nationalism in the countries they operate , and when faced with nationalism when engaging in anti-war activities .
Firstly , class struggle anarchists should be organising in the workplace wherever possible , and engaging in the support of strikes and other actions which aid the development of class consciousness .
Anarchists should network with other libertarian militants , and in the workplace they should be arguing for libertarian tactics such as mass meetings and direct action .
Anarchists in the workplace in the course of maintaining a class perspective should also argue against the division of the working class along lines of race or nationality , and should advocate solidarity across all boundaries , a solidarity which has the tendency to develop as workers of different backgrounds come together in struggle .
Similarly , anarchists should counter the nationalist myths which hinder practical working class solidarity ; lies about immigrants stealing jobs and housing should be opposed with the reality of the situation , that the reasons for our day - to - day problems lie in the fact that the capitalist system does not function to meet our needs , and is n’t supposed to .
Secondly , anarchists have always been involved in anti-militarist and anti-war activism .
This is no different today , and anarchists are to be found on the street in protests against the wars which imperialism entails .
When faced with national liberationist arguments and nationalist responses to war , we should be engaging with the justified revulsion felt when faced with war , but opposing nationalist analysis with an internationalist , class perspective .
These are not small tasks , but they are vital ones , and must be central to the activity of the anarchist movement in the here and now .
Appendices : Statements on the Gaza War
NO STATE SOLUTION IN GAZA ( 20th January 2009 )
One thing is absolutely clear about the current situation in Gaza : the Israeli state is committing atrocities which must end immediately .
With hundreds dead and thousands wounded , it has become increasingly clear that the aim of the military operation , which has been in the planning stages since the signing of the original ceasefire in June , is to break Hamas completely .
The attack follows the crippling blockade throughout the supposed ‘ ceasefire ’ , which has destroyed the livelihoods of Gazans , ruined the civilian infrastructure and created a humanitarian disaster which anyone with an ounce of humanity would seek an end to .
But that ’s not all there is to say about the situation .
On both sides of the conflict , the idea that opposing Israel has to mean supporting Hamas and its ‘ resistance ’ movement is worryingly common .
We totally reject this argument .
Just like any other set of rulers , Hamas , like all the other major Palestinian factions , are happy and willing to sacrifice ordinary Palestinians to increase their power .
This is n’t some vague theoretical point – for a period recently most deaths in Gaza were a result of fighting between Hamas and Fatah .
The ‘ choices ’ offered to ordinary Palestinian people are between Islamist gangsters ( Hamas , Islamic Jihad ) or nationalist gangsters ( Fatah , Al - Aqsa Martyrs brigades ) .
These groups have shown their willingness to attack working class attempts to improve their living conditions , seizing union offices , kidnapping prominent trade unionists , and breaking strikes .
One spectacular example is the attack on Palestine Workers Radio by Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , for ‘ stoking internal conflicts ’ .
Clearly , a ‘ free Palestine ’ under the control of any of these groups would be nothing of the sort .
As anarchists , we are internationalists , opposing the idea that the rulers and ruled within a nation have any interests in common .
Therefore , anarchists reject Palestinian nationalism just as we reject Israeli nationalism ( Zionism ) .
Ethnicity does not grant “ rights ” to lands , which require the state to enforce them .
People , on the other hand , have a right to having their human needs met , and should be able to live where they choose , freely .
Therefore , against the divisions and false choices set up by nationalism , we fully support the ordinary inhabitants of Gaza and Israel against state warfare – not because of their nationality , ethnicity , or religion , but simply because they ’re real living , feeling , thinking , suffering , struggling human beings .
And this support has to mean total hostility to all those who would oppress and exploit them – the Israeli state and the Western governments and corporations that supply it with weapons , but also any other capitalist factions who seek to use ordinary working - class Palestinians as pawns in their power struggles .
The only real solution is one which is collective , based on the fact that as a class , globally , we ultimately have nothing but our ability to work for others , and everything to gain in ending this system – capitalism – and the states and wars it needs .
That this seems like a ‘ difficult ’ solution does not stop it from being the right one .
Any “ solution ” that means endless cycles of conflict , which is what nationalism represents , is no solution at all .
And if that is the case , the fact that it is “ easier ” is irrelevant .
There are sectors of Palestinian society which are not dominated by the would - be rulers – protests organised by village committees in the West Bank for instance .
These deserve our support .
As do those in Israel who refuse to fight , and who resist the war .
But not the groups who call on Palestinians to be slaughtered on their behalf by one of the most advanced armies in the world , and who wilfully attack civilians on the other side of the border .
That this seems like a ‘ difficult ’ solution does not stop it from being the right one .

WHOEVER DIES , HAMAS AND THE ISRAELI STATE WIN
SOLIDARITY WITH THE VICTIMS OF WAR ( 25th January 2009 )
The atrocity in Gaza
As the dust settles , the extent of the atrocities which the Israeli state has committed against the population of the Gaza strip has become clear .
Thousands are dead , killed in the savage bombing of one of the most densely populated places on earth .
Israel has used banned white phosphorous munitions in civilian areas , shelled aid convoys , schools , shelters and mosques full of people .
It has destroyed aid stockpiles with white phosphorous shells .
Over 90,000 people have been displaced .
Gaza ’s economy and infrastructure , already devastated by the blockade , have been destroyed .
With the ceasefire signed , the continued blockade will mean further war against the civilian population by other means .
A two state solution ?
As the bombs rained down every party and group put forward their vision for ‘ fixing ’ the problem and their vision of the future for Palestinians .
But understanding what we ca n’t do is the first step to understanding what we can .
We have to be clear about the ways we can stop such atrocities happening .
A ‘ two state solution ’ based on 1949 or 1967 borders is n’t going to come about except through a massive change in the global balance of power .
This will inevitably lead to more conflicts elsewhere .
Two states with borders as they currently stand would create a Palestine as dominated by Israel as the territories are now .
Even if the ‘ one state solution ’ became a reality , the Palestinian working class would remain an underclass of cheap labourers .
It would be like the end of Apartheid in South Africa .
The colour of those in charge changed but left the vast population in the same dreadful state of poverty and hopelessness as before .
It is also true that we can not call on ‘ our ’ state to reign in Israel .
Firstly , the state will not concede anything to us unless the working class – the vast majority of us who can only live off our ability to work for others – is in a confident enough position to force those concessions through collective action .
Secondly , it is madness to expect Britain to impose ‘ civilised ’ behaviour on an ally such as Israel .
Britain has taken part in the occupation in Iraq which has resulted in the deaths of 1,033,000 people .
The only state which has any ability to reign in Israel is the US .
The US will only do this when Israel ’s actions threaten its national interest .
Moral outrage will not win over dominating the region .
Solidarity with working class struggles
We must stand in firmly in solidarity with the victims of state warfare .
The terrorised population of Gaza did not heed Hamas ’ call to resist through ‘ martyrdom ’ , or to undertake suicide attacks .
They fled en masse .
They showed no willingness to carry out a ‘ resistance ’ on behalf of their masters which would have meant certain death .
Whilst Palestinians fled the onslaught , demonstrations were held in Israel by those refusing to serve the war machine .
These refusals to heed the call of the state or the ruling party to fight deserve our support and solidarity .
We cannot support Hamas , or any of the other factions in Gaza or the West Bank against Israel , however ‘ critically ’ .
Hamas ’ record of repressing the attempts of workers to improve their living conditions is well known .
They have escorted striking teachers back to work at gunpoint , and have closed down medical facilities where staff attempted to strike .
Both Hamas and Fatah have made kidnapping and assassination attempts on the same trade unionists .
Hamas execute those forced by necessity into sex work , and persecute gays and lesbians .
They offer as little to ordinary Palestinians as their rivals in secular nationalist groups , such as Al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade , who attacked the Palestine Workers Radio for ‘ stoking internal conflicts ’ .
Real internationalism means recognising that the rulers and ruled within a ‘ nation ’ have nothing in common .
In this case , this means supporting the efforts of ordinary Palestinians to improve their conditions .
We support them against either Israel , as in the struggles organised by village committees in the West Bank , or against the ‘ resistance ’ movements which police the population .
Our solidarity must be with the victims of war .
These are overwhelmingly Palestinian but also workers , Jewish , Arab and others , killed by mortars and rockets in Israel .
This can not be because of their race , nationality , or religion , but because they are living , thinking , feeling and struggling human beings .
And we must stand against all those who would sacrifice them to their own ends .
Ultimately the only solution to endless global conflict and war is for working class people , the dispossessed majority who must sell their time and energy to those who own and control society , to struggle in our interests collectively , against their exploitation , and against divisions such as gender and race .
This means struggle against the capitalist system which creates endemic war and which must exploit us to survive .
From this we can set about taking control of our own lives , and putting an end to a world of warring states and states - in - waiting which has produced atrocities such as those in Gaza .

For example , will residents of Montana be able to board planes in January 2010 with only a driver ’s license ( a state - supplied , technically non-compliant document ) and without a passport ( an identity document issued by the federal government ) ?
Past history strongly suggests that DHS will issue last - minute waivers to states that have not amped up their drivers licenses to adhere to Real ID .
Early in 2008 , states that actively opposed Real ID received waivers from DHS , nominally marking the states as " compliant " despite strongly - stated opposition to ever implementing Real ID .
But waiting in the wings is PASS ID , a bill that attempts to grease the wheels by offering money to the states to implement ID changes .
Despite having the appearances of reform , PASS ID essentially echoes Real ID in threatening citizens ' personal privacy without actually justifying its impact on improving security .
For this reason , PASS ID is not popular -- privacy advocates refuse to support the bill because it still creates a national ID system .
It still mandates the scanning and storage of applicants ' critical identity documents ( birth certificates , visas , etc. ) , which will be stored in databases that will become leaky honeypots of sensitive personal data -- prime targets for malicious identity thieves or otherwise accessible by individuals authorized to obtain documents from the database .
And on the other side , short - sighted surveillance hawks are unhappy with the bill because they support the privacy violations architected into the provisions of the original Real ID Act .
As such , advocates of PASS ID are publicly wringing their hands over the deadline in order to encourage Congress to approve the PASS ID
Act before the end of the year .
But the fracas over health reform is suffocating any chance for meaningful debate about the merits of PASS ID before the Dec. 31st deadline .
A pragmatic analysis should show that Real ID is dead .
To date , 24 states have enacted resolutions or binding legislation prohibiting participation in Real ID , and the varied , desperate efforts to reanimate it are misguided .
Whether the states or the federal government signs the invoice , the cost ultimately falls to taxpayers , who should be troubled that neither Real ID nor PASS ID is likely to fulfill the stated goal of stopping terrorists from obtaining identity documents .
( Just this week , noted security expert Bruce Schneier linked to a report about government investigators successfully using fake identity documents to obtain high - tech " e- passports , " which were then used to buy plane tickets , and board flights -- the point being that a fancy , " secure " identity document does n't stop individuals from exploiting a weak bureaucracy . )
On the other hand , the resulting databases filled with scanned identity documents will create tantalizing targets for identity thieves and headaches for people whose digital documents are pilfered ; and a national ID system will invite mission creep from the government as well as private entities like credit reporting agencies and advertisers .
It 's high time for reason to replace the reflexive defense of a failed scheme .
Congress should repeal Real ID for real and seek more inspired , protective solutions to identity document security .
Broadband Minister Stephen Conroy has hit back at opponents of his controversial internet filtering scheme , labelling them " frauds " that cannot accept the findings of the Enex Testlab report .
The Minister took time out of his schedule over the weekend to discuss the filter in great detail with iTnews , which is presented in a podcast ( below ) and features commentary from Crikey technology writer Stilgherrian and Internode network engineer Mark Newton ( who speaks on behalf of himself ) .
Among the issues discussed , Minister Conroy said that :
Opponents of the scheme were using misleading information to discredit it .
" Organisations that have run campaigns and circulated petitions [ and ] advertising that there is going to be an 87 percent degradation in speed on the net are frauds .
They have been exposed and they are scrambling to try and find new arguments at the moment . "
That the ISP filtering scheme would be " scalable " to 100 Mbps , despite the maximum speed tested in the trial being only 8 mbps .
" We have spoken to Enex [ TestLab ] and we are confident that this is scalable .
There is no argument that it is scalable . "
That independent tests by Telstra found that a filter could block up to 10,000 URL addresses with no over - blocking and that the impact on internet speeds was only ‘ one seventieth of the blink of an eye '.
That the only material blocked is Refused Classification ( RC ) material - which the Minister insists is only the most deviant and illegal content on the internet .
" What we 're proposing to mandatorily block is not the ACMA blacklist .
We 're only blocking material that is illegal in libraries , in news agents , you can't buy it in book stores , you can't buy a DVD of it , you can't watch it on television and you can't watch it on the cinema .
And importantly , it is currently illegal to have it on Australian ISPs . "
That a mechanism will be put in place for webmasters to rectify with the classification board should they feel their site has been blocked by mistake .
" We 're very conscious of wanting to ... greater transparency and accountability measures .
We put out a discussion paper and for all Australians who are concerned about the thin edge of the wedge argument , for all Australians that are concerned that Stephen Conroy or any future Minister might want to secretly slip things onto this list . "
That he does not see the filter as a ' silver bullet ' to protecting Australian children .
" We 're not suggesting for a moment that this is a full - proof guaranteed way to stop access to child pornography .
Nobody is suggesting that .
We need education programs - we need education for kids , for parents [ and ] for school teachers .
We need more research in this area .
We need more police in this area . "

The Pirate Party 's Christian Engstrom is already making waves in the European Parliament .
After his hard work on the Telecoms Package amendment he's now working to set up an Internet Bill of Rights , attempting to codify some of the core beliefs of the Pirate Party .
To achieve this he wants your help .
Together with Amelia Andersdotter , Christian Engstrom represents the Pirate Party in the European Parliament .
He worked hard last month on ensuring judicial review before disconnections or sanctions over file - sharing can take place , and now he ’s looking to do more with a proposed Bill of Internet Rights .
The Bill of Internet Rights would cover topics such as Net Neutrality , online privacy and freedom of information .
Where possible the bill will take existing legislation as the basis .
What makes this different though , is the process he ’s using to help develop the document – an “ Internet swarm ” .
Comments , suggestions and questions are all welcomed via his website , to contribute to the development of the document .
“ I do n’t think the problem is that there are a lot of politicians who actively want to dismount our civil liberties , ” Engstrom told Torrent Freak .
“ It ’s just that they have n’t realized that the Internet is an important part of our society , where the fundamental rights have to apply .
They think it ’s some kind of toy they can take away from the children if they ’ve been naughty .
The task is to explain to them that this is not an acceptable way of handling the net . ”
Pirate MEP Christian Engstrom
The idea for the bill came from the “ Internet Core Group ” inside the European Greens , where the proposal has strong support .
Engstrom also says that during the negotiations for the Telecom Package there was a lot of talk about the need to safeguard net neutrality , so he feels hopeful about this proposal .
“ When it comes to safeguarding the fundamental civil liberties , such as the right to privacy and information freedom – well , that ’s a fight we just have to win , ” Engstrom said .
According to the current planning , the Bill of Rights will be ready for proposal in the spring of 2010 .
Dubai : US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday defended Washington 's stance on Israeli colonies and said the US wants to see a permanent halt in colony construction in occupied Palestinian territories .
" We do not accept the legitimacy of settlement [ colony ] activity and we have a very firm belief that ending all settlement activity , current and future , would be preferable , " Clinton said after meeting President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo .
Only a few days earlier Clinton sparked Arab anger by hailing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's " unprecedented " move when he offered " restrained " colony construction .
" We can't resume negotiations while Israel is moving full - force ahead to change the reality on the ground in Occupied Jerusalem and increasing the colonies , " Palestinian Justice Minister Ali Khashan said .
" Our position will be weak in these negotiations , and Israel should stop all these measures , " Khashan told Gulf News .
Palestinians need to stand firm regarding some issues to improve their position , however , resuming peace talks is an ultimate necessity , Egyptian analyst Jamal Abdul Jawad said .
He described Clinton 's Cairo visit as " a mission to rescue US President Barack Obama 's strategy in the Middle East after the damage inflicted on it because of Clinton 's remarks in Israel " .
Natal launch details leak from secret Microsoft tour
The intriguing 3D interactive interface for XBox is going to be a hit with consumers when it launches late in 2010 .
Microsoft are making sure by leaking the price – less than $ 100 for the 3D camera and interface – and expected shipping rate of 5 million units .
From the demo , it looks like WII Plus .
Microsoft introduces spatial hands free controller – a revolution in computing
The real break through will occur when we can compute with our hands off a keyboard and mouse .
“ Our sources say the innovative controller - free 360 camera will be released worldwide in November 2010 .
This and other details have emerged following a behind - closed - doors Microsoft tour of UK publishers and studios – the format - holder has been demoing the tech and detailing its 2010 plans in order to spur more development support .
Microsoft is planning to manufacture 5 m units for day one release , with a mix of console and camera plus solus SKUs expected .
The device should cost under £ 50 when sold solo .
One publishing source says Microsoft is “ trying to get as close as possible to ‘ impulse buy ’ ” .
Another even says the camera could even retail for just £ 30 .
Natal was unveiled earlier this year at E3 in Los Angeles .
The device uses an array of cameras and microphones to track player movements .
Activision , Bethesda , Capcom , Disney , EA , Konami , MTV , Namco Bandai , Sega , Square Enix , THQ and Ubisoft all committed to make games for the device in an announcement made at last month ’s Tokyo Game Show .
It ’s expected a large chunk of launch games will be first - party offerings from studios such as Rare with third - party games to follow .
It is not known if Lionhead ’s widely - discussed Milo , which uses advanced AI to create realistic characters , will be in the mix .
Natal will arrive almost five years to the day after the Xbox 360 and is perceived by many , Microsoft included , as a way to lengthen the lifespan of the hardware without resorting to a new console launch .
The first Xbox was sold in the UK for only three years before 360 hit .
This summer Xbox studios boss Phil Spencer told MCV the 360 still ‘ has n’t peaked ’ .
“ When Natal arrives it will feel like a new generation has come , ” he said .
“ I see it like the launch of 360 in November ‘ 05 .
Consumers do n’t want another $ 400 box right now . ”
Sony has said it will launch PS3 ’s motion - sensing wand peripheral – movement of which is tracked by the already - available PlayStation Eye camera – before Microsoft ’s kit in spring 2010 .
However , so far the Japanese firm has kept details of the launch closely under wraps .

It does n’t take Jake long to feel the good vibes .
Like Neo , the savior - hero of the “ Matrix ” series played by Keanu Reeves , Jake is himself an avatar because he ’s both a special being and an embodiment of an idea , namely that of the hero ’s journey .
What initially makes
Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part - alien , part - human body that he controls , like a puppeteer , from its head to its prehensile tail .
Like the rest of the human visitors who ’ve made camp on Pandora , he has signed on with a corporation that ’s intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium , a great whatsit that is an emblem of humanity ’s greed and folly .
With his avatar , Jake will look just like one of the natives , the Na’vi , a new identity that gives the movie its plot turns and politics .
The first part of Jake ’s voyage  for this is , above all , a boy ’s rocking adventure , if one populated by the usual tough Cameron chicks  takes him from a wheelchair into a 10 - foot , blue - skinned Na’vi body .
At once familiar and pleasingly exotic , the humanoid Na’vi come with supermodel dimensions ( slender hips , a miniature - apple rear ) ; long articulated digits , the better to grip with ; and the slanted eyes and twitchy ears of a cat .
( The gently curved stripes that line their blue skin , the color of twilight , bring to mind the markings on mackerel tabby cats . )
For Jake his avatar , which he hooks into through sensors while lying in a remote pod in a semiconscious state , is at first a giddy novelty and then a means to liberation .
Plugging into the avatar gives
Jake an instant high , allowing him to run , leap and sift dirt through his toes , and freeing him from the constraints of his body .
Although physically emancipated , he remains bound , contractually and existentially , to the base camp , where he works for the corporation ’s top scientist , Dr. Grace Augustine ( Sigourney Weaver , amused and amusing ) , even while taking orders from its head of security , Col. Miles Quaritch ( Stephen Lang ) , a military man turned warrior for hire .
A cartoon of masculinity , Quaritch strides around barking orders like some intransigent representation of American military might ( or a bossy movie director ) .
It ’s a favorite Cameron type , and Mr. Lang , who until this year had long been grievously underemployed , tears into the role like a starved man gorging on steak .
Mr. Cameron lays out the fundamentals of the narrative efficiently , grabbing you at once with one eye - popping detail after another and on occasion almost losing you with some of the comically broad dialogue .
He ’s a masterly storyteller if a rather less nimble prose writer .
( He has sole script credit : this is personal filmmaking on an industrial scale . )
Some of the clunkier lines ( “ Yeah , who ’s bad , ” Jake taunts a rhinolike creature he encounters ) seem to have been written to placate those members of the Michael Bay demographic who might find themselves squirming at the story ’s touchier , feelier elements , its ardent environmentalism and sincere love story , all of which kick in once Jake meets Neytiri , a female Na’vi ( Zoë Saldana , seen only in slinky Na’vi form ) .
Mr. Cameron has said that he started thinking about the alien universe that became Pandora and its galactic environs in “ Avatar ” back in the 1970s .
He wrote a treatment in 1996 , but the technologies he needed to turn his ideas into images did n’t exist until recently .
New digital technologies gave him the necessary tools , including performance capture , which translates an actor ’s physical movements into a computer - generated image ( CGI ) .
Until now , by far the most plausible character created in this manner has been slithery Gollum from Peter Jackson ’s “ Lord of the Rings ” cycle .
The exotic creatures in “ Avatar , ” which include an astonishment of undulating , flying , twitching and galloping organisms , do n’t just crawl through the underbrush ; they thunder and shriek , yip and hiss , pointy teeth gleaming .
A new front for religious battles : Hotels and restaurants .
The " Lobby for Jewish values " this week began operating against restaurants and hotels that plan to put up Christmas trees and other Christian symbols ahead of Christmas and the civil New Year .
According to the lobby 's Chairman , Ofer Cohen , they have received backing by the rabbis , " and we are even considering publishing the names of the businesses that put up Christian symbols ahead of the Christian holiday and call for a boycott against them . "
Fliers and ads distributed among the public read , " The people of Israel have given their soul over the years in order to maintain the values of the Torah of Israel and the Jewish identity .
" You should also continue to follow this path of the Jewish people 's tradition and not give in to the clownish atmosphere of the end of the civil year .
And certainly not help those businesses that sell or put up the foolish symbols of Christianity . "
The Jerusalem Rabbinate also works each year to ensure restaurants and hotels receiving kosher certification from the Jerusalem Religious Council do not put up Christian symbols .
According to a senior official in the kashrut department , this is done each year consensually , but that businesses which do not meet this requirement may find their kashrut certificate revoked .
It should be noted that most of the hotels in Jerusalem and a significant part of the restaurants in the capital receive permanent kosher certification from the city 's religious council .
Four years ago this week I was kidnapped in Baghdad .
My trip to Iraq had been motivated by frustration at the government 's deafness to all voices of reasoned opposition to the war in Iraq .
I went to meet Iraqis to reassure them that most people in Britain did not regard them as enemies .
Today , the lead - up to that war is back in the spotlight with the Chilcot inquiry .
This is more than just an academic exercise to many .
Anyone – in Britain , Iraq or elsewhere – who had a relative killed in the conflict will feel an intense personal need to discover the truth .
They will be listening to testimony that appears to gravely undermine the official justification for going to war .
They will want to learn the reaction by the then government to the advice of Middle East diplomats who knew about the conflicts within Iraqi society , conflicts that Saddam had suppressed but were always likely to explode on his removal .
If you are going to war , ignorance of the probable effects on the country in the aftermath is inexcusable .
Why else do you have a large diplomatic and intelligence force in the area ?
I witnessed how much resentment was created by the revenge attacks of coalition forces on Iraqi towns and their apparent disregard for civilian lives .
All our captors had suffered the loss of relatives , homes or jobs in the onslaught on Falluja .
And , as they asked Jim Loney , the Canadian peaceworker who was also held hostage , " If the Americans had invaded and occupied your country , would you not have resisted them by all means at your disposal ? "
I am almost surprised that we were treated so moderately by our captors – apart , that is , from the tragic , largely unexplained , decision to kill Tom Fox , the American Quaker .
Their opinion was that the coalition forces had deliberately stirred up the antipathies between Shia , Sunni and Kurd peoples .
On our few visits around Baghdad before being kidnapped we witnessed the effects of the war on decaying radiotherapy treatment sources and of the " diversion " of funds away from a vital infrastructure facility – a power station .
Many Iraqis said life had been easier under Saddam because he had restored vital services within a few months of the end of the Gulf war .
At a Chaldean Catholic church we met the priest and a group of young people .
The church building had been damaged by a bomb earlier in the year .
He explained how many of his congregation had fled Baghdad or moved to neighbouring countries .
When I contacted him after our release he told me that most of the children had been sent away from Baghdad by their parents , to live in refuge .
The priest himself had been kidnapped and beaten before release .
Little wonder that one impact of a war carried out by " Christian " forces has been the severe depletion of the country 's Christian population .
Most of my recent contacts with Iraqis in Britain indicate that in their view the prolonged occupation is exacerbating the situation .
Although much liberal opinion among the British is that we have a duty to stay until the Iraqis have had a chance to put right the damage we have done to their country , these people feel that our continued presence reminds the population of the brutality of the invasion and occupation and that , as in the past , they can eventually solve their own problems .
I hope the Chilcot inquiry will listen to stories from British servicemen and their families .
But it would be a tragedy if the dreadful consequences of the war on the millions of men , women and children that make up the villages , towns and cities of Iraq go unheard .
As the evidence about the origins of the war emerges from the Whitehall mandarins it must cause even deeper resentment among those who lost relatives in Iraq – I only lost a few months of my life – and it is difficult to see why Tony Blair and George Bush are not as culpable for the killing of Iraqi citizens as many who have appeared for similar crimes before the court at The Hague .
We Are Change Chicago
November 30 , 2009
CHICAGO IL – On Tuesday , November 24th 2009 , We Are Change Chicago attended a book signing with former vice president Al Gore , at the Borders Bookstore on 150 N. State Street .
The previous Thursday , news had begun to circulate that hacked documents and communications from the University of East Anglia ’s Hadley Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) had been published to the internet .
The information revealed how top scientists conspired to falsify data in the face of declining global temperatures in order to prop up the premise that man-made factors are driving climate change .
Please review ClimateGate for Dummies .
To ensure the public that the media and Al Gore are aware of the facts that prove global warming to be a hoax , patriots from WAC Chicago marched to the book signing .
Scattered throughout a crowd of a few hundred were members of WAC Chicago ready to ask Al Gore what he thought about ‘ ClimateGate . ’
First up was Saad Ali .
As he approached Gore , he peacefully and respectably asked , “ Sir , can you comment on the emails and documents that were hacked [ ClimateGate ] that reveal … that the research was a fraud and that it was all manipulated ? ”
Gore , with an evil smirk , claimed that “ he never read them . ”
By the look on his face and his stutter , it became quite clear that Gore was extremely uncomfortable with the question , so he quickly glared towards his security .
The agents grabbed and assaulted Saad , escorting him away from Gore for merely asking a simple question .
The press took notice and started filming and snapping pictures of what was going on .
One of which appeared the next day in the Chicago Sun Times .
Following Saad ’s confrontation , Sati Word , a member of WAC Chicago , questioned Gore on why the IPCC has n’t released any reports on sunspot activity .
However , before he could get an answer from Gore , security grabbed Sati and escorted him out of the building .
A little while later , Anthony , an activist from We Are Change Ohio , approached Gore and handed him the petition of the 31,486 scientists who say that Global Warming is a complete hoax .
Anthony asked , “ What do you think about the science behind this sir ? ” Mr. Gore rolled his eyes , and security escorted him out of the building .
Steve ( swizzlesteve ) , was the last activist to question Gore .
Within seconds of asking , “ Any comments on ClimateGate ?
The emails that prove it ’s a scam , a farce , that global warming is a joke , any comment ? ” Mr. Gore is heard to utter a few “ uhhhhhhhs ” and security quickly steps in to remove him as well .
The press was waiting outside Borders .
They wanted to find out who this group was , that dared question what the elite had forced us to consume as truth .
WBBM news radio , 780 , ran a sound bite of WAC Chicago , WGN news ran footage , Medill Reports wrote an article , and blog posts were popping up all over the internet about the Al Gore confrontation in Chicago .
Many also asked about the footage of WAC Chicago chasing after Gore ’s SUV after the event .
You will find all of it in this video .
Al Gore was confronted multiple times in line , outside the event as he rushed to his waiting Mercedes SUV , ( were you expecting something electric ? ) , and once again in the streets of Chicago .
We Are Change had people outside with signs , banners , fliers , and DVDs .
Activists were inside asking questions and demanding answers ; the world is waking up , it ’s a great time to be alive .

It 's hard to have faith in ABC 's remake of alien - Trojan - horse show V. Paradoxically for a show about aliens who inspire unquestioning love and loyalty , it 's been questioned constantly .
But there 's still hope , and you should still tune in tonight .
Advertisement
The reason why I say that so emphatically is , there 's a tendency to avoid watching a television show if you think it 's already pre-cancelled .
Why give your heart to a piece of ephemeral pop culture that wo n't even last the five - to - seven years that a successful show lasts ?
Why become fixated on a story you know wo n't end ?
Part of the answer is that we are science - fiction fans , and having our hearts broken is part of the deal .
But you also have to keep the faith alive that it wo n't happen this time .
So in case you 've missed our grindingly depressing coverage ( mirroring everyone else 's ) of V's misfortunes , it 's had a troubled ramp - up .
First it was put on a production hiatus for a few weeks , then it was announced that showrunner Jeff Bell ( who was showrunner on Angel 's final season ) was being demoted — he 's still around as a writer , but he 's no longer in charge .
Then before the first hiatus was even over , a second hiatus was announced , and the show was on hold for at least a couple of months .
And then the network decided to air only four episodes , this month , and then put the show on hold until after the Olympics , in March .
Advertisement
And today , there 's the news that Scott Peters , the show 's creator who replaced Bell as showrunner , was himself ousted .
His replacement , luckily , will be Scott Rosenbaum , who 's been a producer on Chuck and The Shield .
Judging from the USA Today article , it sounds like the root of all these problems , including the production turnovers and delays , is the network 's discontent with the show 's creative direction .
Here 's USA Today 's succinct explanation :
[ T ]he series remake has run into roadblocks .
V's pilot episode was well - received by advertisers and critics , but ABC 's late - summer decision to start the show two months earlier than planned – in part to dodge American Idol and the broadcast of the Winter Olympics , also in Vancouver – led to script problems , which forced reshoots and a five - week production break .
The first of three planned story arcs was condensed from six to four fall episodes .
And the show will test viewers ' loyalty with a three - month hiatus ; remaining episodes wo n't surface until March .
A promotional campaign that called for planes to skywrite red V's over national landmarks was scuttled after publicity over potential environmental effects .
And Thursday , in a response to the show 's production problems , Peters ( USA Network 's The 4400 ) was replaced at the helm of the show by Scott Rosenbaum ( Chuck , The Shield ) , though he is expected to stay aboard as an executive producer .
" We had a great pilot , then a couple of great episodes , but we had a disconnect on where we were going from there , " says ABC Entertainment Group chief Stephen McPherson .
Though no stranger to tinkering ( he made extensive changes to the original Grey 's Anatomy pilot ) , " I had n't had the experience of that before . "
But McPherson accepts " a little blame for rushing them . "
Mitchell , who plays hero FBI agent Erica Evans , says the resulting changes merely speed the pace of storytelling to pack a bigger wallop , including big cliffhangers in the Nov. 24 episode .
Filming on that episode is set to wrap today , giving actors another unexpected 10 - week break as the show is retooled .
( Mitchell will trek to Hawaii to shoot new Lost episodes . )

So , yes .
A troubled show , even before its first episode airs — and this does remind me a bit of similar behind - the - scenes stories about Bionic Woman , Dollhouse , Life On Mars , and countless other shows that had difficult gestations leading to troubled runs .
But these things are n't fore - ordained , and a show can beat the odds .

Here are some reasons why I 'm still cautiously optimistic about V in spite of all of the negative buzz :
1 ) The pilot really is great .
From what I hear , the pilot that airs tonight is much the same one we all watched at Comic Con , and it 's truly impressive .
I went into the pilot expecting , at best , pleasant mediocrity or a watered - down tribute to the geek TV of our childhoods .
And instead , I was surprised by what a cracking great piece of television it is .
The story of the aliens who arrive promising great wonders , but quickly turn out to be a lot worse than we realize , is retold at a zippy pace and revamped for our wired , media - savvy culture .
And it 's provocative to have a show that says that despite all of our proud cynicism and air quotes , we 're still suckers for the first super - advanced civilization that shows up offering us small - pox - infested blankets .

2 ) The cast is terrific .
This matters a lot .
You know who they never replaced during Bionic Woman 's behind - the - scenes dickering ?
Michelle Ryan .
You could have swapped in a dozen different producers , and it would n't have made Ryan watchable .
In V , Elizabeth Mitchell is proving that her sparks of versatility on Lost were n't just illusions — she 's really great as the show 's heroine .
( And how great is it that we actually have a female lead on a network show , who 's not Michelle Ryan ? )
Given time , Mitchell could be as great as Lena Headey as Sarah Connor .
Also , Whedonverse alums Alan Tudyk and Morena Baccarin are also just as great as you 'd hope — and Baccarin is so natural as a smarmy alien leader , you 'll almost forget Inara .

3 ) Maybe all the tinkering really will make it a better show in the end .
Rosenbaum coming on as show - runner is actually great news — and if he can bring a bit of The Shield to V , then we 'll be doing great .
Also , I 'm not entirely sad to hear they 're tightening the pace .
When I hear that six episodes were compressed to four , or that a show is going to cut to the chase faster , I often secretly rejoice — the biggest pitfall with a show like V is that the mysteries will be sustained for too long , that characters wo n't figure stuff out until long after the audience has , and that we wo n't get to see people fighting aliens until season three .
As the SF Chronicle 's Tim Goodman points out , this sort of molasses - slow storytelling has already overtaken fellow ABC show FlashForward ( which might get renamed " inch forward " soon ) — so it would be a shame if it happened to V as well .

4 ) We sort of owe it to ourselves to support any show about alien invaders .
It 's not as if we have a bevy of alien - invasion shows to choose from , or really a bevy of shows about aliens period .
American television seems to have abdicated the territory it once owned , of first contact , alien attackers , galactic imperialists , and so on .
I am prepared to apologize for mocking the boring alien makeup on shows like Star Trek : Voyager , if it means that we 'll get aliens on TV once again .
But for now , if there 's even a hope of getting a show about meeting people unlike ourselves on television again , we need to grasp it with both hands .
5 ) I 'm hoping that the creative stew of influences will still yield something really subversive and interesting .
Peters , who created
The 4400 , is still on board as a producer according to USA Today , and Angel 's Bell still seems to be in the mix as well .
And the pilot definitely contains a huge dose of the paranoia and concerns about selling out that those earlier works were all about .
( There 's the journalist who 's willing to ask only softball questions of the alien leader , as well as the religious figures who hitch their wagon to the aliens ' star . )
So maybe if those things remain part of V's DNA , and they are n't part of what gets sacrificed in the network 's headlong dash to create soft and mushy enough for the general public to chew and swallow , then we 'll still get a show that challenges us and reminds us that science fiction , even on television , can be a thing of amazement .

So yes , it 's worth risking another disappointment .
V is on ABC tonight at 8 .
With more than 8 million users , Ubuntu Linux is among the most popular Linux distributions .
But what is its mission ?
What are Ubuntu and Canonical , its lead commercial sponsor , really all about ?
Ubuntu has desktop and server releases , and is gearing up both user and cloud services , all of which are set to be updated in the new Karmic Koala release due out later this week .
With all the different products and directions , Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth faces questions about the focus and definition of the distribution , as well as the profitability of its corporate backer .
In a press conference call today , Shuttleworth tried to explain .
" The mission of Canonical is to deliver all the benefit of free software to a variety of audiences , " Shuttleworth said .
" We started with desktop , because we thought that was place we could make the most distinctive splash .
The desktop was largely neglected and at the same time there were changes afoot in the core infrastructure of Linux at the kernel level that meant we were confident we could surprise people at how easy [ it was ] to install and use the desktop if someone was focused on it . "
Ubuntu competes against multiple Linux distributions , including those from Red Hat and Novell , as well as community - based distributions .
Both Red Hat and Novell offer enterprise Linux desktops , though specific efforts focused on the consumer segment are not currently the main thrust .
Shuttleworth said that Ubuntu to date has been successful in expanding the Linux desktop footprint , and is now interested in increasing the number of places where it can deliver the benefits of open source software .
" We 've already done a lot of work in developer ecosystem and we 're now increasingly interested in the non-developer consumer ecosystem , so that 's what all the OEM work is about , " Shuttleworth said , declaring that his focus was on " making sure that Ubuntu gets pre-installed and Ubuntu is available from Dell.com and others and making sure that Ubuntu is the default alternative to Windows . "
He added that Canonical has a similar vision for Ubuntu on servers and in the cloud .
He admitted that having different products for different market segments does represent some real challenges for Canonical as a small firm .
In terms of the company 's organizational structure , Shuttleworth said that there is a core Ubuntu platform team at Canonical , which is divided into desktop , server , mobile and netbook groups .
On the sales and marketing front , separate groups are tasked with focusing on OEM , enterprise and consumer efforts .
" It is a stretch and it is a challenge , " Shuttleworth said .
" But the real prize for us is to show that the free software ecosystem can be delivered as a platform which spans from the most lightweight devices right the way through to the most heavy - duty devices . "
He added that there are real benefits to having a complete platform , giving developers the opportunity to both develop and deploy applications using Ubuntu 's brand of Linux .
" The consistency of platform and ecosystem is highly valuable to us and to our users .
That 's why we 've given ourselves the harder job of delivering a complete platform rather than going for a specific niche market , " Shuttleworth said .
" Time will tell whether it 's achievable .
It 's wonderful to do the impossible so long as it's not actually impossible .
We 're certainly surfing close to the edge of that line . "
But the broad product mix poses a threat to Canonical 's profitability , at least in the short term .
It 's a concern that Shuttleworth recognizes , but he sees the silver lining in the longer - term picture .
" I have no concerns about our ability to be profitable , " Shuttleworth said .
" If necessary , we would have the option to focus on specific areas that are already self - sustainable .
My preference is to push the organization faster , to continue to invest in and to continue to create the feeling of a complete platform . "
Canonical is a privately - held company , and Shuttleworth does not disclose its financial performance .
Last year , he admitted that Canonical was not cash - flow positive .
" Profitability is a matter of choice as to how much we 're willing to invest , whether we see the appropriate returns on that investment and whether we see it as the right thing to be doing , " Shuttleworth said .
" Right now I 'm absolutely convinced that we want to be delivering Ubuntu as an end - to - end solution , and that requires us to invest in multiple theatres of battle at the same time . "

Media reports abound about the current health care debate .
Confusion reigns , and the future of legislation is uncertain .
I am , therefore , particularly pleased to offer some unmitigated good news on the health care front .
First , I 'd like to tell you how I ferreted out this valuable information .
It 's all my dog 's fault .
Poor Emma spent too much of the last year or so at Berglund Animal Hospital because of her urinary tract issues .
Four or five times in recent months , she has been on antibiotics to clear up the problem .
Like a two - year old in the midst of a temper tantrum , the condition has been impervious to reason .
Dr. Howes did not surrender .
He decided on a full - court press .
He prescribed a six - week regimen of the medication in order to totally annihilate those stubborn bacteria .
Now , I love my dog .
But , I 've already spent hundreds of dollars over the past months and was not rushing headlong to spend more , with absolutely no guarantee of success .
When I expressed my reservations , Dr. Howes told me about a program of free antibiotics offered at Meijer , a hypermarket in not - so nearby Rolling Meadows .
I expressed my amazement , looking for the catch .
He assured me that , if I presented myself at the pharmacy counter with the prescription that he would give me , I would walk out minutes later with a two - week supply of antibiotics .
Yes , I would have to trek back there at two week intervals to finish Emma 's six - week cycle .
But , I was more than willing to do that in order to save hundreds of dollars .
So , several weeks ago , Emma and I piled in the car to check out what seemed to be too good to be true .
I duly presented my prescription to Sue , the pharmacist on duty , and was rewarded with a two - week supply of one of the seven * free antibiotics that Meijer offers .
We chatted about the program .
We were both enthused .
It 's been in place for three years .
In that time , the 190 branches of Meijer have given away $ 33 million of antibiotics .
Here 's the clincher .
As long as you have a doctor 's prescription , anyone in your family - adult , child or family pet - can take advantage of this offer .
You do n't have to be sneaky about it .
They are delighted to help out pet owners as well as just plain , under - the - weather humans .
right there at their website .
Here is what Mark Murray , the president of the company , has to say :
" Rising health care costs are having a dramatic impact on families across the country , especially here in the Midwest .
Our free antibiotic program is the next step Meijer is taking to lead the industry toward improving the health of our customers .
It is all about delivering higher standards . "
Since I was n't able to connect with anyone higher - up at the company , I did a little research on my own .
Meijer is a large , family owned business , which started in Greenville , Michigan , in 1934 .
Hendryk Meijer was a barber who went into the grocery business during the Great Depression .
In 1962 , Meijer became the first hypermarket : combination supermarket and department store .
Over the years , it has expanded beyond Michigan .
Now , half of the branches are in four other states ( Illinois , Indiana , Ohio and Kentucky ) and they had combined sales of over $ 13 billion in 2006 .
Presently , two grandsons of Hendryk Meijer are at the helm .
I was familiar with the store from when my daughter Yael attended the University of Michigan .
Many a time , we headed to Meijer to stock up on groceries , school supplies , and to outfit her apartment .
I could also fill up my tank before heading back to Chicago , truly one - stop shopping .
I had no idea the store had come to Illinois .
The chain is quite philanthropic .
Over the years , they have given away millions of dollars to various local causes .
During Katrina , they loaded up trucks and headed to the Gulf Coast with bottled water , food , and supplies , arriving before the government did .
Considering that I 'm heading to New Orleans in a few hours on a Katrina mission , this warmed my heart .
Here 's even more good news .
Since June , 2008 , Meijer has also begun offering a similar program of free pre-natal vitamins for mothers - to - be .
And I think that 's simply terrific .
So , check it out and tell everyone you know .
They may not want to toot their own horn but there 's no reason we can't .
Who knows ?
Maybe Meijer 's generosity will be contagious and other pharmacies will follow suit .
That would be further cause for celebration .

Remember last year , when Chad Ochocinco lined up outside a Kentucky Best Buy on Black Friday to land his copy of Rock Band 2 ?
He was at it again this year , hitting a Best Buy , a furniture store , and a dollar store ( which probably can't mark prices down that much , even on the day after Thanksgiving ) .
Ochocinco 's rich .
He could hire someone to go to the store at 2:30 in the morning , which is when this shot was taken .
But then he never would have discovered the wonders of the Snuggie for himself .
Yes , the Snuggie , the wearable blanket beloved by Midwestern housewives and Brooklyn hipsters alive .

And if you 're worried about him losing sleep shopping in advance of today 's intra-Ohio showdown , do n't be : there 's no one on the Browns who can cover him as well as the Snuggie can .

When death is inevitable some people decide it is a good time to confess to things that have burdened them during their lifetime .
Perhaps it is in order to leave the world with a clear conscience or maybe to benefit the living ones they leave behind .
This list contains 10 deathbed confessions and the stories behind them of people who , for whatever reason , decided to reveal their darkest secrets .
10 Naomi Shemer 1930 - 2004
Confessed to : using a Basque lullaby melody for her song Jerusalem of Gold
Naomi Shemer is one of Israel ’s best loved songwriters .
The song Jerusalem of Gold was first performed in 1967 at an Israeli song festival shortly before the Arab - Israeli war and describes the Jewish people ’s 2000 - year longing to return to Jerusalem .
It continues to serve as an unofficial Israeli anthem and is often played at national ceremonies .
Shemer spent many years denying claims that she plagiarized a lullaby song and turned it into Jerusalem of Gold .
Then in 2004 after years of angry denials she made her confession to another composer Gil Aldema just days before dying of cancer writing to him , “ I consider the entire affair a regrettable work accident – so regrettable that it may be the reason for me taking ill , ” she also wrote that she heard a well - known Basque lullaby which “ went in one ear and out the other ” and the song must have crept into her unwittingly .
Aldema said that Shemer had agreed for her secret to be revealed after her death .
Interesting Fact :
In 2005 the lullaby Pello Joxepe became known worldwide when it was published that Jerusalem of Gold was based on its melody .
The Spanish singer Paco Ibáñez who performed the song in Israel in 1962 where Shemer first heard it was asked how he felt when he heard Naomi Shemer based most of the melody on the lullaby .
He replied by saying he was honored that she chose to use his melody to use for Jerusalem of Gold .
You can listen to the song here performed by Ofra Haza at an Israel concert in 1998 .
9 Naaman Diller 1935 - 2004
Confessed to : the legendary clock collection heist
In 1983 , the costliest theft in Israel ’s history saw 106 timepieces worth millions of dollars disappear from a Jerusalem museum .
Included in the timepieces was a pocket watch made for Marie Antoinette which is valued at more than £ 19 m ( $ 30 million ) .
The case remained unsolved for almost 25 years until 2006 when a Tel Aviv watchmaker told police that he had paid some $ 40,000 to an anonymous person to buy 40 items including Marie Antoinette ’s pocket watch ( pictured above ) .
Forensic experts examined the clocks and detectives questioned the lawyer who negotiated the sale .
The trail led to an Israeli woman in Los Angeles named Nili Shamrat who police identified as the widow of Naaman Diller who was a notorious criminal in the 1960s and 1970s .
When Israeli police and US officials arrived at her home to question her they found more stolen clocks .
Shamrat then told the police that her husband who she had recently married confessed to her just before he died that he had committed the heist .
He then advised his wife to try and sell his collection after his death .
Interesting Fact :
The Marie Antoinette watch was actually self winding and was ordered in 1783 by one of her admirers and was to be made by the famous Swiss watchmakers Abraham Louis Breguet .
The order specified that gold should be used wherever possible instead of other metals and to make it the most spectacular watch possible .
The watch was finally finished in 1827 , 34 years after Marie - Antoinette was guillotined and four years after Breguet ’s death .
8 Christian Spurling 1901 -1994
Confessed to : faking the famous Loch Ness Monster photo
In 1934 a doctor named Robert Kenneth Wilson offered a picture to the Daily Mail newspaper .
Wilson told the newspaper he noticed something moving in Loch Ness and stopped his car to take the photo .
Wilson refused to have his name associated with it so the photo became known simply as “ The Surgeon ’s Photo . ”
For decades this photo was considered to be the best evidence of the existence of the Loch Ness Monster .
In 1994 at the age of 93 and near death Christian Spurling confessed that the surgeon ’s photo taken 60 years ago was a hoax and the mastermind behind it was his Stepfather Marmaduke Wetherell .
In the early 1930s , sightings of the Loch Ness Monster became commonplace , so Spurling ’s stepfather who was a big game hunter was hired by the Daily Mail newspaper to investigate .
Wetherell found some huge tracks leading to the lake that he proudly displayed to the press .
When the Natural History Museum investigated they quickly discovered that the footprints were a hoax .
Wetherell was humiliated when the newspaper reported this and for being fooled by the prank .
For revenge he asked his stepson Chris Spurling who was a professional model - maker to make something that would fool the public .
Spurling started with a toy submarine and then added a long neck and small head .
The finished product was about 45 cm long , and about 30 cm high .
Wetherell then went down to the lake and took some pictures of the “ monster ” .
To add respectability to the hoax he convinced Dr. Wilson whom he knew through a mutual friend to develop the photo and sell it to the Daily Mail .
Interesting Fact :
This deathbed confession is often mistakenly attributed to Roger Patterson of big foot fame .
( The Paterson Film ) Paterson died of cancer in 1972 and in this case swore on his death bed that the footage was authentic and he had encountered and filmed a large bipedal animal unknown to science .
7 Geraldine Kelly 1950 - 2004
Confessed to : the murder of her husband John Kelly
In 1991 , after years of domestic violence , Geraldine Kelly shot and killed her husband and stored his body in a freezer at their home in Ventura , California .
She told her young children that their father died in a car accident .
Seven years later when she decided to move back home to Somerville Massachusetts she had the moving company move the freezer with the body inside and drive it across the country to a local storage facility in Somerville .
In 2004 , 13 years after the murder Kelly was gravely ill with breast cancer and confessed to her daughter that she had killed her father claiming he abused her for years and then told her where to find his body .
Authorities investigated and found human remains in a locked , unplugged freezer in the storage room .
The body was mummified but identified as John Kelly based on distinctive tattoos he was known to have including a panther , a Kewpie doll and a skull .
The cause of death was a gunshot to the back of the head .
Interesting Fact : The District Attorney of Somerville said it was n’t clear if Kelly wanted to unburden herself or if she wanted her children to know so if they found the body they would n’t be blamed for it .
6 Tor Hepso 1938 - 2005
Confessed to : the murder of Torunn Finstad and Sigrid Heggheim
In 1978 , Fritz Moen ( pictured center above ) was 36 when he was arrested for raping and killing 20 - year - old Torunn Finstad in Trondheim , Norway .
There was no physical or forensic evidence linking Moen to the crime and no witnesses saw him with Finstad .
Moen was deaf with a severe speech impediment and an interpreter was needed for him to communicate effectively .
Moen was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment .
Several years later police claimed that Moen had confessed to the 1976 murder of 20 - year - old Sigrid Heggheim .
During the seven interrogations his confession came during the one time in which he did not have the benefit an interpreter .
He was found guilty of this murder as well and sentenced to an additional 5 years in prison .
In 1996 after spending 18 years in prison he was released and placed under preventative supervision .
During the next several years
Moen ’s attorneys tried desperately to clear his name .
In 2004 he was acquitted for the murder of Sigrid Heggheim finding that reasonable doubt should have acquitted him in the first place .
Then in December 2005 a convicted felon Tor Hepso confessed at a hospital one day before he died to three nurses and later to the police that he had murdered two women and mentioned the names Heggheim and Finstad .
After Hepso ’s deathbed confession was thoroughly investigated Moen was finally exonerated of the murder .
Unfortunately Fritz Moen died of natural causes earlier that year in March and was not alive when he was declared completely innocent of the both crimes .
Interesting Fact :
This case was publicly criticized as one of Norway ’s most shameful miscarriages of justice .
There is even talk of erecting a bust or statue of Moen in front of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice as a symbol of the responsibilities of the criminal justice system .
5 Henry Alexander 1929 -1992
Confessed to : the murder of Willie Edwards
I think most would agree that this confession was too little too late and another example of a miscarriage of justice .
In 1957 the body of a 25 year old black man Willie Edwards was washed up on the shores of the Alabama River .
Although there was much suspicion surrounding his death officials stated that decomposition made it impossible to determine the cause of death .
In 1976 , an aggressive attorney re-opened the Edwards case and four Klansmen were arrested including Henry Alexander .
One of the men gave a sworn affidavit ( in exchange for immunity ) .
In the statement the man described how he and three other men beat and forced Willie Edwards to jump off the Tyler - Goodwin Bridge because he said something offensive to a white woman .
Even with one of the men ’s sworn testimony , Alabama Judge Frank Embry dismissed the charges because no cause of death was ever established .
He concluded that “ merely forcing a person to jump from a bridge does not naturally and probably lead to the death of such person . ”
In 1992 , Henry Alexander now 63 was near death from lung cancer and decided to confess to his wife .
He told her he had things bothering him and said Willie Edwards would not have died if he had not falsely identified him as the one who had offended the white woman .
He then said he and the other Klansmen gave Mr. Edwards a choice to run or jump and did n’t think he would jump .
He said .
“ If he ’d a run , they would never have shot him . ”
Interesting Fact : After her husband ’s confession Mrs. Alexander wrote a letter of apology to Mr. Edwards ’s widow .
In the letter she writes “ I hope maybe one day I can meet you to tell you face to face how sorry I am .
May God bless you and your family and I pray that this letter helps you somehow . ”
4 James Brewer 1951 -
Confessed to : Killing his Neighbor Jimmy Carroll
In 1977 James Brewer was arrested in Tennessee on suspicion of killing his neighbor in a fit of jealous rage .
Brewer jumped bail and fled to Oklahoma where he and his wife began a new life together under the names Michael and Dorothy Anderson .
They became active members of the local church where his wife established a Bible study group .
They also have a married daughter and are grandparents .
In 2009 , Brewer had a serious stroke and before dying he felt compelled to confess to the crime that had weighed on his conscience for over 3 decades .
His wife then called the Police Department to the hospital saying her husband wanted to confess to a murder .
Brewer confessed to his crime with the help of his wife who had to translate due to the effects of the stroke .
The only problem with this deathbed confession is that fortunately or unfortunately for Mr. Brewer he did n’t die .
When Brewer was released from the hospital he surrendered to Tennessee authorities and appeared in court with the same lawyer he had almost 32 years earlier when he jumped bail .
The picture above shows Mr. & Mrs. Brewer after their arrest .
Interesting Fact : The Pastor of the church where Mrs. Brewer set up a Bible study group , said : “ I do n’t know what their former life was but I do know they were both dedicated to the Lord .
They ’ve been in their own prison for 30 years .
I think they ’ve done their time . ”
3 Margaret Gibson 1894 -1964
Confessed to : the Murder of William Desmond Taylor
William Desmond Taylor was an actor and a top US film director of silent films in the early days of Hollywood .
When Taylor was shot to death in 1922 it became one of Hollywood ’s most famous scandals and mysteries .
In 1964 , 42 years after the murder a reclusive old woman living in the Hollywood hill was suffering from a heart attack and summoned her neighbor .
With her recent conversion to Catholicism she asked for a priest to confess but when no Priest was available she began to make her confession to her neighbor .
As she was dying on her kitchen floor she said she was a silent film actress by the name of Margaret Gibson and that she shot and killed a man named William Desmond Taylor .
She is alleged to have been involved romantically with Taylor but a motive as to why she killed him was never mentioned .
Taylor ’s murder remains officially unsolved however the one thing that stands out is that Gibson had absolutely nothing to gain by her confession .
Another revealing fact that should be mentioned is the neighbor that witnessed Gibson ’s confession said his mother ( who was a friend of Gibson ’s ) later said that when they were watching a TV piece on the Taylor murder she became hysterical and blurted out that she ’d killed him .
Interesting Fact :
In the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard , the name Norma Desmond is a reference to both Taylor ’s middle name and one of his actress friends Mabel Normand .
You can watch a silent movie called “ The Kiss ” Starring William Desmond Taylor and Margaret Gibson here .
2 Diane Crawford 1949 -2009
Confessed to : the murders of Constance Smootz Hevener and Carolyn Hevener Perry
In 1967 , 20 - year - old Carolyn Hevener Perry and 19 - year - old Constance Smootz Hevener were shot to death while working at an ice cream store in Staunton Virginia .
Each had been shot once in the head at closing time and about $ 138 was stolen from the store .
Over the years police worked the case but with no luck .
Then in November 2008 , police were led to Diane Crawford by new information revealed by a witness .
When police went to question Crawford she was at the end - stages of heart failure and suffered from chronic kidney disease and decided to confess in detail to the murders that she committed over 40 years ago .
On the night of the shooting , Crawford who was 19 at the time said she went to the store where she worked part time to tell the women she could not work the next day and ended up in a shoving match with them .
Crawford then took out a .25 caliber pistol and shot the two women because they had made fun of her for being a lesbian .
Perry was the first to be shot at near - point - blank range and when Hevener rushed to her aid Crawford shot her also from just a couple of inches away .
She then took money from the store as she fled which led the police to think it was a robbery .
Crawford died in January 2009 , 2 months after confessing to the murders .
The photo above shows Crawford in her 1966 high school year book picture and in her police mug shot .
Interesting Fact : Diane Crawford moved away after the killings for 20 years , got married and had two daughters .
She then returned to Staunton without her husband and moved in with a woman and lived with her new partner until her death .
1 Julian Altman 1916 - 1985
Confessed to : stealing a Stradivarius violin from Bronis?aw Huberman
I put this at the number one spot not because of the severity of the crime but for the overall story surrounding this deathbed confession .
In 1936 Polish virtuoso Hall Huberman was performing at Carnegie Hall and decided to switch the Stradivarius he was playing in the first half of his performance to his newly acquired Guarnerius violin .
After the intermission the Stradivarius was stolen out of his dressing room by 20 year old Julian Altman who was a New York nightclub musician .
Altman went on to become a violinist with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington , D.C. and performed for Presidents and politicians with the stolen Stradivarius for many years .
In 1985 , 49 years after the theft , Julian Altman who was in prison for child molestation and gravely ill confessed to his wife that he had stolen the violin .
He then instructed his wife where to find the Stradivarius at the couple ’s home .
Along with the Stradivarius she found newspaper clippings recounting the theft .
It was n’t until 1987 ( 2 years later ) that his wife returned the Stradivarius to Lloyds of London in exchange for a $ 263,000 finder ’s fee .
Interesting Fact :
This violin is now called the Gibson ex-Huberman Stradivarius named after its two previous owners ; George Alfred Gibson and Hall Huberman ( No love for Altman I guess ) .
It is now owned by violinist Joshua Bell who is pictured above playing the famous violin which he paid close to 4 million dollars for .

Die Ereignisse , die hier am Samstag stattgefunden haben , überschlugen sich förmlich .
Es gab so unglaublich viel zu organisieren und beachten .
Und ständig stand die Frage im Raum , wie das " Halloween - Shopping " wohl werden würde .
EntwederHammer oder der Flop des Jahres .
Um die Antwort vorweg zu nehmen :
Es war nicht nur ein Hammer , es war eine komplette Abbruchbirne , im übertragenden Sinne zumindest .
Im Laden ist nämlich trotz der Dunkelheit bis auf ein Weinglas einer Kundin erstaunlicherweise nichts kaputtgegangen .
Viele haben tatsächlich gedacht , dass wir hier im Laden ein bisschen Halloween - Plastikdeko aufstellen und vielleicht die Mitarbeiter ein wenig schminken und das dann großspurig als ein für Kinder nicht geeignetes " Halloween - Shopping " bezeichnen .
Nun : Dem war nicht so , absolut nicht .
Wenn man Leute mit ihren Handys vor dem Laden telefonieren sieht , die ihre Gesprächspartner regelrecht dazu auffordern , zum SPAR - Markt zu kommen , sollte das Beweis genug für eine gelungene Veranstaltung sein .
Zum Ablauf : Um 20:15
Uhr hatten wir die letzten Kunden in den Laden gelassen und ab 20:30 Uhr waren die Türen verschlossen .
Draußen hatten wir Sitzbänke und Fackeln aufgestellt und der ( kostenlose ) Glühwein wurde in der Kälte von den wartenden Kunden dankbar angenommen .
Dann hatten wir eine halbe Stunde Zeit , den Laden umzugestalten .
Vieles war zwar schon vorbereitet , aber da wir natürlich bis halb Neun einen reibungslosen Ablauf gewährleisten wollten , war noch nicht allzuviel möglich .
Die Deckenbeleuchtung wurde im Grunde komplett abgeschaltet .
Kühlmöbel blieben dunkel .
Die einzige Beleuchtung waren zwei kleine Scheinwerfer für die Kassenarbeitsplätze , fünf blaue ( kein Schwarzlicht ) Leuchtstoffröhren an der Decke , vier Schwarzlichtröhren im Kühlregal ( Wer hätte es gedacht ... ) , rot -gelbes Flackerlicht über / hinter dem Kühlregal , dass die " Hölle " darstellen sollte und ein RGB - Laser , der nur in einer Ebene arbeitete und so Farbfächer und ähnliche Muster projizierte .
Ob viel geklaut worden ist , kann ich nicht sagen .
Ich vermute sogar , dass sich das in Grenzen hielt .
Zum einen liefen ziemlich vieleMitarbeiter und ein paar Freunde von mir im Laden herum , zum anderen hatten die Leute einfach ganz andere Sorgen .
Eine kleine Gruppe Heranwachsender hatte es geschafft , am Türsteher vorbeizukommen und hat schließlich im Laden meine Leute provoziert und angepöbelt .
Ansonsten waren alle friedlich und gut gelaunt .
Wer einfach nur einkaufen wollte , wurde in Ruhe gelassen , alle anderen wurden erschreckt .
Buh !Die Reaktionen der Kunden waren durchgängig positiv .
Ich glaube , es wurden noch nie so viele Fotos hier im Laden gemacht .
Fast jeder rannte mit seiner Handykamera herum und hat Lichteffekte , Freunde oder Halloween - Fratzen fotografiert .
Der Abend hat einfach nur Spaß gemacht , allerdings haben wir für die drei Stunden auch beinahe drei Wochen intensiv geplant !
Diesmal gibt es ausnahmsweise größere Bilder .
Zurückblickend war das Ereignis zu schön , um es in 400 Pixel breite Bildchen zu drücken .
Bitte auf " Beitrag vollständig lesen " klicken , um die vielen Bilder und auch ein paar YouTube - Videos zu sehen .
The cost of excluding the Roma minority
WITH the Roma population in Slovakia growing the issue of how to involve Roma more in the society is becoming ever more urgent .
Offering Roma , who in parts of Slovakia live in separate settlements , the chance to improve their living conditions and increase their quality of life is not merely a moral imperative , but also an economic necessity , a new study has concluded .
WITH the Roma population in Slovakia growing the issue of how to involve Roma more in the society is becoming ever more urgent .
Offering Roma , who in parts of Slovakia live in separate settlements , the chance to improve their living conditions and increase their quality of life is not merely a moral imperative , but also an economic necessity , a new study has concluded .
According to the study , ‘ The Cost of Non-Inclusion ’ , carried out by Anton Marcinčin and Ľubica Marcinčinová and sponsored by the Open Society Foundation ( OSF ) , the costs of non-inclusion of the Roma minority in mainstream society are immense .
“ The main reason why the costs are so high is n’t the potential savings in social allowances , but the possibility of significantly increasing the size of the employed labour force in Slovakia and thus increasing GDP , ” Anton Marcinčin said .
In the study he estimates Slovakia could produce 7 to 11 percent higher GDP if Roma were included .
“ And for us that justifies the call for rather higher public investment in reform and programmes to help Roma in need , ” he added .
The OSF believes that the study is groundbreaking because it works with numbers in a way unique for Slovakia .
It is the first time such a study has approached the problems of Roma from an economic point of view , seeing Roma as a potential that has until now been unused .
According to Marcinčin , the numbers speak clearly for themselves .
By 2030 Roma will constitute as much as 16 percent of Slovakia ’s population in school or of productive age .
“ If 50 percent of them are left unemployed , and only 10 or 20 percent work , it would be a great loss that this society might not be able to bear , ” Marcinčin explained , adding that the regional aspect is crucial here , since in some villages or districts Roma children will soon outnumber non-Roma , and the development of the local labour market and economy will depend solely on the activity of Roma .
According to the study , estimates for future development are striking and imply that Roma issues need to be dealt with as soon as possible .
One of the most important points , also stressed in the study , is the education system and the classification of Roma children as mentally disabled .
The study criticises this as wrong and blames poor diagnostic tests .
“ From the available numbers , we have estimated that today in Slovakia there are more Roma children registered as mentally disabled than non-Roma children , ” Marcinčin said .
“ If that ’s not true – and I do n’t see why it should be true that every eighth Roma child is mentally disabled – they should n’t be placed in special schools . ”
According to Marcinčin special schools can by no means substitute for a well - functioning multicultural education system .
“ It ’s not only about Roma , but also about poorer Slovaks and their kids , who are n’t lucky enough to be born into families with great libraries and university - educated parents , ” Marcinčin said .
The authors of the study recommend removing the language barrier in education , in the light of the right of Roma children to education in their mother tongue , and allow them to switch to Slovak gradually .
They also recommend that Roma children who do n’t suffer from severe physical or mental disabilities be moved from special schools to normal primary schools , where they should get the chance to interact with their non-Roma peers .
“ Our conclusion is that one size does n’t fit all , and therefore it ’s necessary to tailor the programmes to the ‘ size ’ of the addressees , ” Marcinčin said .
In the study he suggests that programmes aimed at helping Roma usually fail to achieve the desired effects .
“ The results are far from the expectations , which also contributes to the increase in anti-Roma sentiments , ” he said .
Klára Orgovánová , former governmental plenipotentiary for Roma communities , disagrees that programmes to help Roma have not been successful .
“ Can we say so easily that the programmes of social workers , teaching assistants or the building of flats for Roma were n’t successful ? ” she asked .
“ It ’s more complicated than that . ”
However , she said the study is useful as it provides grounds on which to base other arguments .
“ If you want to influence the politics of government you need to argue , and the best way to do that is to argue with numbers , because we need to say how much it costs , ” Orgovánová said .
“ So we really do welcome this study . ”
A desire to prompt discussion and to provide a set of arguments for those who want to be active in the field of policies for Roma were the reasons why the OSF decided to carry out the study about the economic costs of non-inclusion of Roma .
The study was done within the framework of the international initiative the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005 – 2015 , currently presided over by Slovakia .
“ The [ Slovak ] presidency has set out three priorities , two out of which touch upon the topics the study discussed – the first is the education system and the second , very important , priority is the revision of action plans that were approved at the time when the Decade was launched , ” said Alena Pániková from the OSF .
“ This study , as well as all the non-governmental activities , aspire to contribute to the revision of the action plans . ”
The OSF now plans to turn to governments at local , regional and national level , in the hope that the economic arguments in the report can be used to address a wider spectrum of policy - makers .

* Union looks for legal avenue to overturn gov’t decision
* Says decision violates Canadian law
VANCOUVER , British Columbia , Dec 14 ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s biggest telecommunications union said on Monday it plans to take the federal government to court to force it to reverse its decision to allow foreign - backed cell phone company Globalive to operate a wireless service in this country .
The Communications Energy and Paperworkers Union said the government ’s action violates Canadian - ownership rules for telecoms companies and threatens jobs .
Union president Dave Coles said the union ’s lawyers are working on finding a legal avenue to get Ottawa ’s ruling , released last Friday , overturned .
“ We are going to take them to court ...
We have a minority government that changes the very nature of the law that protects Canada from these global monsters because we are a small country , ” Coles told Reuters .
Under Canadian federal regulations telecom companies must be majority - owned and controlled by Canadians .
In October , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission , the government 's regulatory arm , ruled Globalive was effectively controlled by Egyptian - based financial backer Orascom Telecom Holding ORTE.CA and therefore ran afoul of foreign ownership rules .
The minority Conservative government overturned that ruling last week saying that Globalive Wireless Management Corp is a Canadian company that meets the country ’s telecom ownership and control requirements laws .
Globalive said it will proceed with plans to launch a national mobile service in Canada .
Service could be launched in Toronto and Calgary as early as this week , it said .
Coles said the government ’s decision threatens Canadian jobs but also goes against Canadians ’ desire to have their telecommunications and broadcast industry owned locally .
The union represents more than 30,000 workers in Canada 's telecommunication sector , which is dominated by three companies , Rogers Communications Inc RCIb .
TO , BCE Inc BCE.TO and Telus Corp T.TO .

On Friday , October 30 , 2009 , Independent Senator from Vermont , Bernie Sanders , was on The Thom Hartmann Program , on his weekly “ Brunch with Bernie ” segment , and stated exactly what the American people are up against in achieving financial reform .
Starting at 5:31 , he states :
“ We need financial reform .
We need to put a cap on credit card interest rates .
We need to deal with this “ too big to fail , ” and we need to break up some of these large financial institutions , we need an audit of the Fed .
We need to do all of that , and more .
But most importantly , long term , this is a huge fight , because you ’re taking on the most powerful people in America .
They make the oil industries and the drug companies look like lightweights .
But essential , that ’s what this struggle is about .
Do we get capital out to the productive economy , while these guys continue to live in their own world , making huge sums of money . ”

As urban legends go , the one about unsuspecting trick - or - treaters having their Halloween loot spiked with razor blades is pretty chilling .
Spookier still is the " fact " that the only records of serious injury resulting from poisoned booty involved children booby - trapping the items themselves , or parents poisoning their own offspring .
I suspect those rumours , like the one about hospitals offering to X - ray trick - or - treat sweets , are also the stuff of legend – but none the less it 's enough to put us paranoid parents off altogether .
And yet my children have been at near coma-inducing levels of excitement about their plans for weeks .
Their outfits are ready , so too their plastic pumpkin buckets , and their last words before falling asleep each night are a variation of " How many more sleeps now , Mama ? "
This is one of those classic parenting moments in which I theoretically adhere to one school of thought while practising another entirely .
Some people call that hypocrisy ; I prefer to think of it as the inbuilt survival instinct of a parent .
Because , come tea - time today , I will be watching from a safe distance ( about two feet ) while my sons , aged three and four and a half , knock on the doors of our neighbours in a thinly - veiled attempt to beg strangers for items that are usually contraband except for on Fridays , special occasions , or when Mama needs to meet an urgent deadline .
You see ?
It makes no sense .
I spend all year instructing them never to talk to strangers but , for one night only , I 'll actively encourage them to dress up as flesh - eating zombies and demand sugar - laden treats from people they do n't know .
Why ?
Well , why not ?
I 've heard all the arguments against trick - or - treating , from legitimate safety concerns , to the idea that it 's just plain rude to let children knock on doors to demand treats .
But I 've still yet to hear an argument that counters the wonderment and excited glee that trick - or - treating elicits .

I would n't have considered trick - or - treating before we moved to a sleepy coastal town in Northern Ireland .
In London we were unlikely to knock on a neighbour 's door except to ask them to turn the music down but here , Halloween is huge and it seems churlish not to join in the fun , which culminates with a street parade and a fireworks display over the harbour .
It surprised me to learn that Halloween originated in Ireland , and only became big in America in the mid-19th century when the potato famine drove more than one million Irish immigrants across the water .
So it 's not just a tacky US import after all , and we get to indulge in trick - or - treating in the name of embracing our Irish cultural heritage .
Halloween , or All Hallows Eve , is said to have its roots in the Celtic festival of Samhain , a celebration of the end of the harvest season in Gaelic culture , sometimes regarded as the Celtic New Year .
The tradition of trick - or - treating is an adaptation of the medieval practice of souling , where people would offer to sing and say prayers for the dead in return for food .
In recent times the " trick " element has made headlines , with feverish talk of knife - wielding hooligans using the opportunity to terrorise the elderly and vulnerable , and rumours that some London boroughs had attempted to ban trick - or - treating altogether .
That is precisely why I 'm inclined to indulge my little zombies in their Halloween excitement .
If we 're too afraid of our own shadows to exchange pleasantries with our neighbours , then something 's up with society .
Trick - or - treating might afford my children a unique opportunity to understand giving , sharing and neighbourliness .
The best maths lesson I 've ever had ?
Dividing up the Halloween spoils with my brother and our cousins .
Far from banging on doors rudely demanding treats , trick - or - treating strikes me as a jolly good excuse to strike up conversations with the strangers we live next door to .
What 's more , it 's good for the economy .
Halloween is now a multi-million pound industry in the UK , with some retailers seeing 31 October emerging as the second most lucrative trading period of the year after Christmas ( and overtaking Easter , too ) .
Last year , sales of Halloween items , including costumes , themed food and drink , sweets and decorations , were expected to top £ 195 m , rising from an estimated £ 12 m in 2001 .
According to analysts , British Halloween spending is catching up with the US , where an average family spends approximately £ 65 on Halloween paraphernalia in a nationwide industry said to be worth £ 4.7 billion .
While the economic downturn has sunk its teeth into UK spending , Halloween is biting back .
Not even a recession can dampen Halloween spirit , it seems .
A leading UK Halloween fancy dress and party manufacturer ( smiffys.com ) says more customers than ever have placed their orders early this year , with an increase of 124 per cent in the amount spent by customers by May of this year , compared to the same time in 2008 .
" Over the three months that we ship the Halloween stock to our retailers – August , September and October – we have seen a 15 per cent increase in sales compared to last year , and we expect this figure to grow by the end of the month , " reports Smiffy 's spokeswoman , Anouska Sawyer .
" During this three - month period we 've sold just under 124,000 Halloween costumes ( that 's 206 every hour ) and 33,975 units of our white face paint ( that 's nearly one every minute ) .
Recession ?
What recession ! "
That 's a view shared by many retailers , including Pure Party , part of the Clinton Cards group , which has more than 40 stores around the UK and has just launched an online shop to coincide with Halloween ( purepartyonline.co.uk ) .
Pure Party saw a 41 per cent increase in sales of Halloween home decoration packs , and attributes this partly to the fact that Halloween falls on a Saturday this year , which may have prompted more people to host Halloween parties at home .
Kim Einhorn of the party planning company Theme Traders ( themetraders.co.uk ) agrees that the recession has had an impact on Halloween spending .
" Companies do n't want to pay for full Halloween party planning and installation services this year but they 're doing it themselves , imaginatively .
We 're hiring out far more props than ever before – everything from life - size Dracula statues to tables that resemble coffins , " she says .
" Recession sparks an appetite in people for an escape to a fantasy world , and that 's what Halloween is all about . "

Ashvina Lockmum , buyer of false eyelashes for high - street beauty retailer Superdrug , agrees .
" Lashes are big business .
Brits now spend over £ 10 m a year on boosting their lashes with falsies , " she reports .
Superdrug expects to sell around 50,000 pairs of false eyelashes during Halloween week .
If Halloween gives consumers an opportunity to escape their recessionary woes , it 's also a chance to indulge a dark sense of humour in dark times .
According to retailers in the UK and the US , Michael Jackson and the convicted Ponzi fraudster Bernard Madoff are among the most popular costume choices for 2009 .
Analysts IBIS
World report that last year , when the financial outlook was much bleaker , the Halloween spirit remained unaffected and US sales grew 5.1 per cent from 2007 .
Liverpool 's Alma de Cuba is a former church converted into a bar and restaurant which hosts one of the most popular Halloween events in the country .
Last year 's event attracted more than 500 revellers and this year 's party theme is the " Battle of Angels and Demons " .
Marketing director Tekla Simo ( who fittingly hails from Transylvania , the home of Dracula ) says : " We 're increasingly seeing people make a huge effort at Halloween to dress up and hit the town , which is very positive for the economy . "
Greggs , the UK bakery retailer , took the Halloween spirit a step further this year by inviting a local coven of witches into its new £ 16.5 m bakery in Manchester .
Amethyst , Amber and Aquamarine blessed the recipes for a range of Halloween treats including bat biscuits , toffee apple lattices and creepy cupcakes before they were dispatched to 1,400 outlets across the UK .
" We were delighted to be invited by Greggs to cast a positive blessing on the bakery and the goodies they 're making , " says Amethyst .
" The traditional blessing we use brings protection and prosperity during an important and ancient British festival and it's great to think we 're passing on some positivity to Greggs ' customers around the country and at the same time dispelling some of the myths and stereotypes that surround our Craft . "
That 's a controversial move , given that Halloween is also traditionally connected to the Christian celebration of All Saints ; a link that has largely been swept aside by growing commercial influences .
In recent years the Bishop of Bolton , the Right Rev David Gillett , has challenged supermarkets to offer alternatives to the scary masks and costumes that are on sale .
Halloween Choice ( halloweenchoice.org ) exists in partnership with The Children 's Society and the Church of England and campaigns for retailers to offer a wider range of goods to mark the occasion .
A spokesman said : " Our concern is not with the fact that people are making money out of the event , as clearly the celebration has a positive impact on the UK economy , but with the type of products being stocked and the emphasis on goods designed to scare and shock .
Not everyone want to see children dressed as monsters and murderers . "
It turns out that flesh - eating zombies are n't actually all that popular with little boys either , so we 've compromised on Spiderman costumes this year .
Much less scary – and somehow so much more in keeping with the spirit in which we 're going trick - or - treating .
Where 's the harm in a neighbourly visit from a pint - sized Spidey - duo on a dark and wintry night ?

Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly backstage at the 28th Annual Academy Awards on March 21 , 1956 .
Neither Grace Kelly nor Audrey Hepburn were nominees at the event in RKO Pantages Theatre .
Grace Kelly presented Best Actor Oscar to Ernest Borgnine for Marty , and Audrey Hepburn presented the Best Picture to the same film .
That year , Anna Magnani won the best actress award for The Rose Tattoo , and Jo Van Fleet won the award for best supporting actress for East of Eden .
Grace Kelly had won the best actress
Oscar the previous year for her role in The Country Girl , and the year before that Audrey Hepburn had won the Oscar for best actress in Roman Holiday ( 1954 ) .
Although you can feel the tension in the above photograph by Allan Grant , two leading ladies got along perfectly in real life .
In a month ’s time , Kelly will marry Monaco ’s Prince Rainier and become Princess Grace .
Allan Grant ( 1919 - 2008 ) was a Life magazine photographer –the last photographer to photographer Marilyn Monroe before she died on August 5 , 1962 , and the first to photograph Marina Oswald after the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 .
Narwhal Mating Habits
The male narwhal reaches sexual maturity at eight to nine years old , and the female narwhal reaches that stage of its life at four to seven years old .
Based on the data available the female narwhal is able to give to one calf once every three years .
The narwhal gives birth after a 15 - month gestation period .
The breeding time for a narwhal whale is in the spring , and it usually takes place in mid-April , with the calf being born in the July of the following year .
The narwhal tusk is thought to play a strong role in the mating activity of the whale .
Narwhals have been seen with their tusks crossed .
And the tusks have also been seen used as weapons when males battle over a female for the right to mate .
Additionally the tusk is known to experience a growth - spurt at sexual maturity in males ; this has been interpreted as suggesting that there is a possible breeding function tied into the narwhal tusk .
Fewer women than men pursue scientific education , and fewer still pursue a scientific career — this may be well known , but it 's far from well understood .
Researchers from Northern Illinois University have released preliminary results from a recent study of high school science classes , when students first have the opportunity to pursue science in earnest .
The research looks at the relationships among classroom activities , gender , and instructors to pin down exactly what is turning girls off science .
One of the goals of the project was to study whether males and females experience and respond differently to science content and instructional approaches .
While the findings come from a preliminary data analysis , they do show a marked difference in the way the two genders experience the same science class .
The researchers collected data from 244 students in 12 science classrooms during two five - day periods .
The classes included 4 different subjects — General Science , Biology , Chemistry , and Physics — each taught in 3 rooms .
All of the students received vibrating pagers and were paged twice during the course of each class and asked to record what they were doing at that moment , as well as their thoughts and feelings about it .
The researchers also surveyed students and teachers , conducted interviews with teachers , and collected demographic information and grades from the students ' school records .
The study found that males generally had a more positive attitude towards science than females .
Female students reported higher levels of stress and boredom during science class , though they reported finding the topic less challenging than males did .
Despite finding it more challenging , males reported feeling more skilled at science than females did and , when the material became more challenging , they reported that their engagement increased .
When females felt challenged , or the task at hand was perceived to be " important " ( like taking a test as opposed to listening to a lecture ) , they reported feeling less engaged with the material at hand .
Males and females also found different varieties of activities engaging .
Both enjoy discussions in class , but females prefer seatwork and lectures and particularly disliked presentations , while males preferred the more " public " activities like labs and presentation .
The study also found that classrooms were more likely to be dominated by male participation — 33 percent of the classes had mostly male participation , while only 9 percent were dominated by females ; the remainder had equal participation .
In addition to the students ' experience in class , the project also looked at how teachers shaped and responded to their science classes .
All teachers were quick to say there were no gender difference in aptitude for science but , when prompted to identify a student who was likely to pursue a science career , only 3 out of 13 picked a female student .
They generally described the high - achieving males in their class as having significant intellectual capacity , calling them " smart " or " a natural , " while females were usually described as being hard workers in pursuit of good grades .
Although the study is preliminary , its primary result — girls are not enjoying their science classes — is not terribly surprising .
The more important question to answer is why girls are n't as engaged as boys .
During their research , the team took extensive video footage of several class sessions .
These captured the interactions of the students and teachers , and provide a record of what exactly the class was engaged in when the students ' pagers went off .
That may ultimately provide some indication of how scientific instruction might be re-centered to encourage female engagement .
The authors estimate that the video will take about a year to analyze fully .

Two Argentine men have become the first same - sex couple to marry legally in Latin America .
Alejandro Freyre , 39 , and Jose Maria Di Bello , 41 , tied the knot in a civil ceremony in the southern city of Ushuaia , in Tierra del Fuego province .
Gay marriage is illegal in Argentina .
However , the Tierra del Fuego governor issued a special decree allowing the couple to wed there .
Roman Catholic leaders in the country expressed alarm at the move .
A judge in the capital , Buenos Aires , prevented the couple from marrying there earlier this month .
Church anger
The men , who are both HIV - positive , had planned to get married on 1 December , World Aids day .
They eventually travelled to Tierra del Fuego , where they received the support of provincial governor Fabiana Rios .
Although Argentina 's civil code bans gay marriage , the constitution is silent on the matter .
Correspondents say Ms Rios exploited this grey area and gave the two men a special dispensation .
She said in a statement that gay marriage was " an important advance in human rights and social inclusion " .
After Monday 's ceremony Mr di Bello said : " We 're extremely excited and happy about what this means for all gays and lesbians in Argentina . "
However Bishop Juan Carlos , of the southern Argentine city of Rio Gallegos , called the marriage " an attack against the survival of the human species " .
Other Catholic leaders have argued that civil union , which is legal in four Argentine cities , should be sufficient .
The Supreme Court is expected to rule on gay marriage next year .
Why did the Prophet Elisha curse the “ youths ” for making fun of his baldness ( 2 Kings 2:23 - 24 ) ?
Question : " Why did the Prophet Elisha curse the “ youths ” for making fun of his baldness ( 2 Kings 2:23 - 24 ) ? "
Answer :
There are a few key issues we must understand in regards to this account of the youths cursing Elisha .
The text reads , “ From there Elisha went up to Bethel .
As he was walking along the road , some youths came out of the town and jeered at him .
‘ Go on up , you baldhead ! ’ they said .
‘ Go on up , you baldhead ! ’
He turned around , looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD .
Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty - two of the youths . ”
It seems unbelievable that God would cause two bears to maul a group of children for making fun of a man for being bald .
First , the King James Version has done us a disservice by translated the term as “ children . ”
The Hebrew word can refer to children , but rather more specifically means " young men . "
The NIV , quoted here , uses the word “ youths . ”
Second , the fact that the bears mauled 42 of the youths indicates that there were more than 42 youths involved .
This was not a small group of children making fun of a bald man .
Rather , it was a large demonstration of young men who assembled for the purpose of mocking a prophet of God .
Third , the mocking of “ go on up , you baldhead , ” is more than making fun of baldness .
The baldness of Elisha referred to here may be : 1 ) natural loss of hair ; 2 ) a shaved head denoting his separation to the prophetic office ; or more likely , 3 ) an epithet of scorn and contempt , Elisha not being literally bald .
The phrase “ go up ” likely was a reference to Elijah , Elisha ’s mentor , being taken up to Heaven earlier in 2 Kings chapter 2:11 - 12 .
These youths were sarcastically taunting and insulting the Lord ’s prophet by telling him to repeat Elijah ’s translation .
In summary , 2 Kings 2:23 - 24 is not an account of God mauling young children for making fun of a bald man .
Rather , it is a record of an insulting demonstration against God ’s prophet by a large group of young men .
Because these young people of about 20 years of age or older ( the same term is used of Solomon in 1 Kings 3:7 ) so despised the prophet of the Lord , Elisha called upon the Lord to deal with the rebels as He saw fit .
The Lord ’s punishment was the mauling of 42 of them by two female bears .
The penalty was clearly justified , for to ridicule Elisha was to ridicule the Lord Himself .
The seriousness of the crime was indicated by the seriousness of the punishment .
The appalling judgment was God ’s warning to all who would scorn the prophets of the Lord .

GOLDSBORO , N.C. - A middle school in North Carolina is selling test scores to students in a bid to raise money .
The News & Observer of Raleigh reported Wednesday that a parent advisory council at Rosewood Middle School in Goldsboro come up with the fundraising plan after last year 's chocolate sale flopped .
The school will sell 20 test points to students for $ 20 .
Students can add 10 extra points to each of two tests of their choice .
The extra points could take a student from a " B " to an " A " on those tests or from a failing grade to a passing grade .
Principal Susie Shepherd says it 's not enough of an impact to change a student 's overall grades .
Officials at the state Department of Public Instruction say exchanging grades for money teaches children the wrong lessons .

Most people should be well aware that a diet rich in assorted fruits and vegetables is vital to maintaining health and preventing disease .
Available in a rich variety of colors and flavors that benefit health in different but unique ways , fruits and vegetables are vitamin , mineral , and phytonutrient storehouses .
According to a recent80 percent of Americans do not eat an adequate amount and variety of fruits and vegetables , resulting in a " phytonutrient gap " that is causing serious , widespread health problems .
When it comes to fruits and vegetables , there are generally five color categories that are recognized .
These include red , blue and purple , yellow and orange , white , and green .
Each color category is said to play a different role in health .
White , for instance , tends to inhibits cancer and high cholesterol levels while bolstering heart health .
The yellow and orange category contributes to healthy eyes as do greens , which also stem cancer growth .
All fruits and vegetables contain various levels and types of phytonutrients that are designed to fend off diseases like cancer and to prevent premature aging .
Experts recommend ingesting a diverse selection of fruits and vegetables from all color categories in order to obtain the maximum benefits from each , which work synergistically to fortify the body .
According to the report , Americans are phytonutrient deficit in every color category .
The worst deficiency is in the blue and purple category where 88 percent of Americans are deficient .
In the white category , 86 percent are deficient while 79 percent are deficient in the orange and yellow category , 78 percent are deficient in reds , and 69 percent are deficient in greens .
In lieu of recommended guidelines for phytonutrient intake , the report identified " prudent intake " levels for 14 different phytonutrients and compared those with average American intake levels in order to determine the gap .
These included EGCG , isothiocyanate , lutein and zeaxanthin , isoflavones for greens , lycopene and ellagic acid for reds , allicin and quercetin for whites , anthocyanidins and resveratrol for purples and blues , and alpha - carotene , beta - carotene , hesperitin , and beta - cryptoxanthin for yellows and oranges .
Amy Hendel , a registered physician assistant and health and wellness expert who is working to educate people about phytonutrients , recommends trying to eat at least two fruits or vegetables from each color category every day .
As always , clean , organic produce is the best option as it will be free from pesticides and higher in vitamin and mineral content .
Home - grown fruits and vegetables are another choice as they typically have the best flavor , can be grown organically to personal standards , and offer the rewarding experience of harvesting the fruits of one 's own labor .
An excellent way to maintain high intake of varied fruits and vegetables is to juice them .
A high - quality juicer will not only extract the valuable nutrients , including some of the fiber , but will allow for combining different varieties in a single , great - tasting juice .
Carrots , for instance , can be juiced along with beets , celery , apples , and ginger to create a delicious , healthy beverage .
High - quality food blenders offer similar options with smoothies , soups , and purees that can be fortified with vegetables not normally present in recipes .
For soups and purees , these powerful food machines will gently heat the contents through rapid , sustained blending while maintaining nutritional and enzymatic integrity .
Sundry experimentation and creative thinking are sure to help anyone incorporate diverse nutritional fare into practical snacks and meals .

Cuba Flies Lone Flag for Sustainability international | environment | other press Thursday October 11 , 2007 23:10 Thursday October 11 , 2007 23:10 by Tech1.0 by Tech1.0 According to a new study on ecological sustainablity published in New Scientist , Cuba is showing the way on life in a post - oil world .

Yet , if that is our goal , we are heading in the wrong direction - with the exception of Cuba .
So says the first study to examine the ecological impact of changing lifestyles around the globe .
We dont need environmental evangelicals to tell us that sustainable development is a good idea .
Yet , if that is our goal , we are heading in the wrong direction - with the exception of Cuba .
So says the first study to examine the ecological impact of changing lifestyles around the globe .
An international team led by Mathis Wackernagel of the Global Footprint Network looked at how the living conditions and ecological footprints of 93 nations have changed in the last 30 years .
They used the ecological footprint ( EF ) index , a tool devised in 1993 by Wackernagel and William Rees , his PhD supervisor at the University of British Columbia , Canada .
EF quantifies the area of land required to provide the infrastructure used by a person or a nation , the food and goods they consume , and to reabsorb the waste they produce , using available technology .
This value can then be compared with the resources that are actually available to people on a regional or global scale .
EF has become a popular index , and was used recently , for example , by conservation group WWF to calculate that two more planets would be needed to support everyone in the world in the manner of the average UK citizen .
However , rather than just measure consumption , Wackernagel and his colleagues wanted to measure how close countries are to developing in a sustainable way .
The problem is that sustainability  is an elusive concept .
 Nobody dares to say what it actually means ,  Wackernagel told New Scientist .
 We believe we provided a robust measurement . 
For each nation with reliable data , they calculated how many planets would be needed to support the global population if everybody adopted that nations lifestyle as it was in 1978 , and in 2003 .
They then expressed each figure as an Earth - equivalent ratio ( EER ) and plotted each value against the nations corresponding UN Human Development Index .
The index is a score of between 0 and 1 , and is a function of a countrys average life expectancy , adult literacy , level of schooling and per capita GDP .
To develop sustainably , the researchers assume a country must have an HDI of at least 0.8 and a maximum EER of 1 ( see Diagram ) .
A lower HDI would mean a nation is not developing adequately , while a higher EER means it is gobbling up too many resources .
By looking at each countrys historical trajectory , a clear pattern emerges .
People everywhere have a better lifestyle , but their footprint is growing at a rate proportional to their wealth .
Developed countries in particular have done very little to reduce their impact .
Only one nation , Cuba , is developing sustainably , and probably not for long ( Ecological Economics , DOI : 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.08.017 ) .
 Cubans have high life expectancy and literacy , and were forced into a smaller footprint because of the oil embargo ,  says Wackernagel .
 But they are now economically more successful , and will tend to use more resources . 
Critics point out that EF calculations do not take into account issues such as pollution from certain toxic chemicals , and place too much reliance on others , such as carbon footprints , which may be alleviated by the invention of new technologies .
Even so , its a broad indicator of the direction things are moving , and its an excellent tool for communicating to the public and decision makers ,  says Jan Vernon , who reviewed the validity of EF for the UK government .
The study , therefore , carries a credible message : we have all moved away from sustainability , and the world has entered ecological overshoot .
 We have not taken sustainable development seriously ,  Wackernagel concludes .

BP Agrees To Class Settlement – Partner Wesley Farrell 's Letter To Clients
On March 2 , 2012 , the eve of a federal trial , BP agreed to a class action settlement of certain BP Oil Spill related claims with the Plaintiffs ’ Steering Committee , which represented the interests of affected individuals and businesses throughout the Gulf Region in pending litigation .
Although the settlement does not resolve all claims , it is a major “ first step ” towards that objective .
Very few people in the USofA have ever worried about currency exchange , at least once they returned from a vacation in another nation .
The US Dollar has been a stable rock in the world that simply has not been subject to the ups and downs of foreign commerce as much as other currencies .
That may be about to change dramatically , so it ’s worth thinking about how currencies move in the mysterious world known as Foreign Exchange ( ForEx ) .
ForEx traders are some of the smartest generalists when it comes to understanding entire economies , but we have the great luxury of treating them as obscure specialists .
The reason for this is that the US Dollar is the standard currency of the world .
Many commodities , especially oil , are priced in Dollars .
People all around the world who buy oil , grain , and a large number of other standard items need to reliably protect themselves against changes in the value of the Dollar versus the Pounds , Kroner , Yen , or other currencies that they use in their daily life .
Futures contracts , or the right to buy commodities at a price determined today , tend to lock the Buck into a narrow trading range .
Money , as we know it today , is nothing more than a unit of exchange backed by the central bank of a nation .
Our Buck is only as good as the “ Full faith and credit of the United States ” , which may seem a bit thin to us but is about as good as gold around the world .
We ’ve had a stable political system and a reliable Federal Reserve that keeps it all keepin ’ on .
Recently , however , the tremendous amount of “ Stimulus ” that has been pumped into the economy has brought this into question as we acquire a lot of new debt and the excess Dollars hit the hard realities of supply and demand .
How can we evaluate what will happen ?
With every major commodity traded around the world , it all tends to even out to a steady state pretty easily .
What is needed is a commodity , known everywhere , that is not traded in a way that evens out the price .
This would reflect the “ Purchasing Power Parity ” ( PPP ) or ability to get what you need to live .
The Economist magazine proposed that one such standard which exists around the world is the Big Mac .
The sandwich , invented in Pittsburgh , is crafted with meticulous precision to be as precisely the same everywhere in the world as MacDonald ’s can possibly make it .
The price , however , has to reflect what people locally will pay .
By comparing the price that their local currency is worth on the world trading markets to what it buys on the ground , we can get a measure of what kind of pressure the world markets for currencies are under .
If this sounds silly , it was always meant to be a bit of fun .
The real hoot is that it does , at least partially , predict what ’s going to happen in currency markets 6 months to a year down the road .
The last time the index was calculated , in February 2009 , the currencies of South Asia and Australia were shown to buy Big Macs for a lot less than the currency markets would have predicted .
Since that time , these currencies have all gotten stronger .
As a measure of PPP , the Big Mac Index is far from perfect .
It did n’t , for example , predict the strength of the Euro in 2009 .
This August , Swiss bank UBS offered an alternative measure that was based on how many minutes a worker making the median wage has to work to afford a Big Mac in major cities .
In Chicago , Toronto , and Tokyo , that is only 12 minutes .
In Paris it ’s 21 minutes , Moscow 22 .
Singapore clocks in at the global average of 38 minutes .
By this measure , the US workers are getting a great bargain compared to other workers around the world .
If you assume that it all evens out in the end , the Dollar can only go down from here .
It ’s still just a lot of fun in the end , but the Big Mac index highlights something that has been true about as long as I ’ve been alive – our Dollar buys us a lot more stuff than people around the world get for their currencies .
This is why we have run a massive trade deficit with the rest of the world , which is to say that we find it cheaper to send Dollars abroad for things made in elsewhere than to make them here .
We ’ve been able to sustain that for a long time because people want and need Dollars .
Our Dollar is only as good as we are .
By the Big Mac standard , we get a lot for it .
If you think that can continue forever , there ’s nothing to worry about .
Most of us who follow this do n’t think that is reasonable , so we keep an eye on it .
The Big Mac Index is one indication that things are about to change .
It was an unusual field trip for the nearly 1,000 high school girls who spilled from yellow school buses in front of a Westwood theater one recent October morning .
They came from all over the county : the tony enclaves of San Marino , Pasadena and Beverly Hills and the grittier reaches of Boyle Heights and South L.A .
The movie they had come to see , " South Dakota : A Woman ’s Right to Choose , ” had already been vetted by a handful of their administrators , who were satisfied with the film ’s depiction of teen pregnancy and abortion .
Afterward , they would have a rowdy town - hall discussion , moderated by Dolores O’Riordan , lead singer of the Cranberries , whose songs are used in the soundtrack .
With no boys present , went the theory , girls would be more comfortable opening up .
“ Do you think women should have the right to terminate a pregnancy ? ” O’Riordan asked the girls .
In the past , the singer has harshly criticized abortion but said in an interview she prefers not to disclose how she feels .
“ Do n’t be shy , totally say what you think .
It ’s your life , it ’s your future . ”
The girls , from four Catholic schools and 11 public schools , would need little prodding .
A handful spoke in favor of choice and a few were ambivalent .
But the majority , including one who said she was the mother of a toddler , spoke passionately against abortion .
One girl , from St. Monica Academy , led a cheer thanking her mother “ for having me . ”
Fact and fiction
The movie , a blend of feature and documentary -- which its 60 - year - old neophyte director Bruce Isacson calls a “ dramumentary ” -- follows the stories of two pregnant teenagers .
One is based on the true story of a girl named Barb ( Ralph Lauren model Piper Ferrone ) , a white , 14 - year - old track star in South Dakota with a loving , long - term boyfriend .
The second girl , Chris ( “ Veronica Mars ” actress Tessa Thompson ) , is a composite character , an African American runaway from Philadelphia who was raped .
She is taken in by Cat Megill ( Emma Bates ) , a real woman who started the New York City group Haven Coalition , which finds beds in private homes for indigent pregnant women seeking abortions .
The action is punctuated by historical footage as well as interviews with advocates and scientists on both sides of the debate .
Though legal abortion has been enshrined in law since 1973 , the issue is certainly back in the news .
In May , the Gallup Poll found that a slim majority of Americans now describe themselves as “ pro-life . ”
The month , Kansas abortion doctor George Tiller was slain at a church , allegedly by an anti-abortion activist .
In Washington , abortion is a focus of the clamorous healthcare debate .
And while unplanned pregnancy is a well - worn subject in popular culture , abortion is usually avoided .
The protagonists of recent hit films such as “ Juno ” and “ Knocked Up ” opt against abortion .
“ People have n’t been discussing this issue properly , ” said Isacson , who described himself as a Hollywood deal maker who worked on the “ Ellery Queen ” TV series in the 1970s , someone who only recently became aware of the country ’s great abortion divide .
“ Both sides do n’t express themselves well .
Where is the information ?
Where is the intelligent discussion ? ”
( Advocates might say he simply has n’t been paying attention . )
Isacson said his movie ’s purpose is to edify , inform and not take sides , but some may view “ South Dakota , ” intentionally or not , as subtly weighted against abortion .
The film ’s emotional highlight , after all , is the rescue of 14 - year - old Barb by her boyfriend from an abortion clinic exam room and its grossly insensitive nurses .
As for Chris , even the staunchest abortion foes usually concede that abortion is acceptable in the case of rape .
The movie was funded by private investors , said Isacson , who would not disclose the budget .
( Iowa , where part of it was filmed , kicked in $ 1.67 million .
That state ’s film program has since been suspended and is now the subject of a criminal investigation ; Isacson , who purchased a new Land Rover with Iowa funds , said his expenditures were appropriate . )
It is promoted by Motive Entertainment , which handled the grass - roots marketing for Mel Gibson ’s 2004 hit “ The Passion of the Christ ” and last year ’s “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , ” a documentary by Ben Stein exploring claims that science teachers who discuss intelligent design face academic discrimination .
The Westwood screening and discussion was “ a guinea pig for something we may do all across the country , ” said Motive Chief Executive Paul Lauer , whose website boasts of “ targeted strategies ” to reach “ niche audiences ” that include “ 350,000 churches and pastors . . . and thousands of organizations in the underserved ‘ faith market . ’ ” Lauer , says the site , is “ one of the most well connected entrepreneurs in the family , values , and faith - based markets . ”
If the town halls generate enough press and word of mouth , the hope is that a distributor will become interested .
But the film ’s executive producer conceded that may never happen .
“ I ’m not interested in making money , ” said Howard Kazanjian , a Hollywood veteran ( “ Raiders of the Lost Ark , ” " Star Wars : Episode VI Return of the Jedi ” ) who in 2007 was named one of “ Hollywood ’s most powerful Christians ” by Christianity Today magazine .
The movie has already been shown to a handful of high - profile abortion foes , including James Dobson of Focus on the Family and Elisabeth Hasselbeck of “ The View . ”
But Lauer said his marketing plan will focus equally on groups that support abortion rights .
“ In each market where we do the town - hall screenings , ” he said , “ we will be inviting leaders , organizations and individuals who represent both sides of the debate . ”
The documentary elements that punctuate the drama include evocative videos of 16 - to 22 - week - old fetuses floating in utero , clips of impassioned speeches ( Bill Clinton insisting that abortion be “ safe , legal and rare ” ; Mother Teresa telling the United Nations that abortion is a “ threat to peace ” ) and interviews with a variety of thinkers and activists on both sides of the debate .
Scientists offer divergent views on when a fetus is able to feel pain .
In one scene , feminist attorney Gloria Allred speaks of her own rape at gunpoint , subsequent abortion and lifelong commitment to abortion rights .
She also describes the fetus as “ a parasite ” because it requires the mother ’s body to survive .
At another point , an abortion doctor tearfully describes the death of her friend from an illegal abortion in Africa and later unemotionally describes how she might wrap an aborted fetus and leave it to die , even if it showed signs of struggling to take a breath .
By contrast , a sandy - haired boy who is identified as the real - life son of Barb , says he is grateful his mother did not abort him .
While Isacson remained adamant that the film evenly portrays both sides of the debate , Kazanjian confessed that the film ’s images of fetuses floating in amniotic fluid gave him pause .
“ I think that seeing a baby at 22 weeks would tell me that that is a baby and not a virus or a parasite , ” Kazanjian said .
“ It ’s not living out of the womb , but it ’s a real baby .
. . .
That might pull me over to the pro-life side . ”
Eternal debate
Such imagery made USC associate religion professor Lori Meeks , who supports abortion rights , dubious about the moviemakers ’ claims of neutrality .
Meeks was invited by Isacson to co-moderate a town - hall discussion after a separate screening for adults that took place across the street from the teen screening .
It was attended by the school administrators , teachers and chaperons who had accompanied their students to Westwood .
Meeks ’ co-moderator was William Hurlbut , a Stanford medical ethicist who opposes abortion and is known for his embrace of a technique to create embryonic stem cells without destroying embryos .
Hurlbut , who appeared in the film , said he was prepared not to like it but was brought to tears and found it “ amazing . ”
He said later he liked its “ ambiguity . ”
Meeks , however , was uneasy .
“ I can not help but wonder if [ they ] may be trying to attract anti-abortion audiences who will like the film because it allows them to feel good about reaching out to the other side without forcing them to challenge their beliefs in a serious way , ” she said .
“ It ’ll be interesting to see how the pro-choice advocates interviewed in the film react . ”
Thus far , no high - profile abortion rights supporter has seen it .
Allred said she was eager to see the movie and has been promised an invitation .
In the town - hall - style discussion that followed the teen screening , two of the film ’s actresses , Bates and Thompson , joined O’Riordan .
The students , who were urged to ask questions , were more focused on making statements , mostly against abortion .
“ If you ’re not ready to have a baby , then you should n’t be having sex anyway , ” said Gianna Halpin of St. Monica Academy .
“ Yeah , that sounds like a good idea , ” O’Riordan said .
“ I just feel like if you are woman enough to open up your legs and let someone come in , you should be willing to let something come out , ” said Jamie Sooniers of Westchester High School .
“ Abortions are just not right . ”
Bates seemed taken aback .
“ Let ’s take a minute to acknowledge we are lucky enough to live in a country where women can gather to discuss this stuff without risk of being killed , ” she said .
“ I think it ’s OK to have an abortion , but only if you were raped or experienced something really traumatic , ” said Paige Baines of Crenshaw High .
“ But even then I think you still should take care of it because that baby could grow up to be someone important . ”
But , said Rose Kohn of Beverly Hills High , “ Every girl should have the right to choose .
. . .
It ’s their right , it ’s their body , it ’s their choice . ”
Days later , some were still stewing about what they ’d seen -- for very different reasons
“ I thought the movie was very balanced , ” said Madeleine Lessard , a sophomore at St. Monica Academy in Pasadena .
“ I am very pro-life , so when that lawyer referred to a baby as a parasite and she referred to having to go through pregnancy as the last legal form of slavery , that struck me as absurd .
The thing that ran through my mind is abortion is the last legal form of murder . ”
Liz Benichou , a Beverly Hills High School senior who favors abortion rights , said she thought the movie was “ more pro-life than pro-choice .
. . .
They made it seem negative when abortion was brought up .
When one girl had a baby , they made it seem so positive , but not every story works out that way . ”

When Saab's sale to Koenigsegg flamed out in late November , many presumed it was the end of the line for the brand , much as Penske 's withdrawal spelled the end for Saturn .
It now looks like those pessimists may not have been far from the mark but there is some hope for the brand in the form of China 's Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co. ( BAIC ) .
General Motors is still holding open the possibility that Saab might find another buyer , possibly in the form of Spyker , but if a new one is n't found by December 31 , the brand will be wound down just like Saturn and Pontiac .
In the mean time , some of Saab 's key assets are being sold to BAIC .
BAIC has now acquired the rights and tools for the current 9 - 3 ( pictured ) and 9 - 5 models .
The deal also gives BAIC access to certain powertrain technologies for use in its own models .
Saab boss Jan Ake Jonsson said in a statement : “ This arrangement is excellent for both parties , now and for the future .
We have developed a good relationship with BAIC and look forward to working with them to integrate this Saab technology into their future vehicles . ”
What is n't known is the price BAIC paid for the assets and whether or not it will be able to use the Saab name , be it in China or global markets .

The Federal Government will introduce laws to make ISP - level filtering mandatory for all refused - classification material hosted overseas .
It will amend the Broadcasting Services Act next August to enforce the filter , which it expects to be operational within a year of implementation .
Grants will be made to providers that wish to further filter X18 + sites .
Announcing the measure today , Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said that the legislation would require ISPs to block RC - rated material hosted on overseas servers .
He said it was an " additional measure to the existing take - down regime for Australia - hosted content " .
Senator Conroy justified the filter , saying that " most Australians acknowledge that there is some internet content which is not acceptable in any civilised society " .
" It is important that all Australians , particularly young children , are protected from this material , " he said .
Report released
Senator Conroy said a pilot conducted by Enex TestLabs in conjunction with Australia 's largest ISPs proved that such filtering was viable .
" The report into the pilot trial of ISP - level filtering demonstrates that blocking RC - rated material can be done with 100 percent accuracy and negligible impact on internet speed , " he said .
Transparency ?
The Government announced that the list of blocked RC content would be compiled " through a public complaints mechanism " .
But these public complaints will only form a subset of the total content blocked .
The Government will also add " specific internet addresses ( URLs ) of known child abuse material through sharing lists with highly regarded international agencies after an assessment of the rigour and accountability of classification processes used by these agencies " .
The Government said it was " also introducing new transparency measures to ensure the public can have absolute confidence in the process for material being placed on the RC Content list " but is yet to release details .
It is believed the mechanism for this process will be hammered out during the consultation phase over the next few months .

( CNN ) --
Once a fixture on the red carpet and a staple of the daily news cycle , Paris Hilton has recently all but disappeared from the American consciousness .
Has the socialite who became famous simply for being famous ceded her throne to a new set of up - and - coming reality stars and party fixtures , or has she gone purposely dark in order to resurrect her brand like a phoenix rising from the ashes ?
" She built the ultimate how - to guide on building a celebrity brand .
Now she is in the second phase of the program , the disappearing act , " said Samantha Yanks , editor - in - chief of Gotham and Hamptons magazines , two publications which often featured content about Hilton .
" Phase one was the ascension , seemingly out of nowhere , " Yanks said .
" That came with a media frenzy , the antics , the partying , the music , the babe - like status and of course , the fashion label .
Phase two , she disappears . "
Paris Hilton broke onto the New York City socialite scene in 2001 , more famous for her late - night partying than for the small modeling jobs she had started taking .
But her fame factor really began to take off when she starred in the Fox reality television series " The Simple Life , " with her childhood best friend Nicole Richie , in 2003 .
Hilton leveraged her fame from " The Simple Life " by pushing the Paris Hilton brand into books , perfumes , shoes and nightclubs .
She landed a minor role in the film " House of Wax " and a leading role in the straight - to - DVD movies , " National Lampoons ' Pledge This " and " Bottoms Up . "
Despite bad movie reviews , Hilton managed to make news whether it was for a leaked sex tape , a bad breakup with a slew of less famous boyfriends or for appearing in public without underwear .
She was so pervasive that in 2004 New York Daily News gossip columnist Lloyd Grove banned her from his page and in 2007 The Associated Press conducted an experiment to try not reporting on Hilton for a week .
Grove was successful for two years .
The AP made it through its weeklong blackout and then reported on Hilton 's arrest for driving with a suspended license nine days after the blackout began .
Now , two years later , most news outlets would be hard pressed to find a recent story about Hilton that they had to report .
The gossip and tabloid news cycle typically responds to what the public wants .
The absence of Hilton in public life could merely be a response to a new generation of tabloid consumers ' lack of interest in her .
" Paris just does n't nearly have the mass appeal she had a few years ago .
She shows up at events , but people are much more concerned with whether Robert Pattinson 's going to show up with his secret girlfriend Kristen Stewart , " explained Star magazine 's Suzanne Rozdeba , a senior editor .
" She 's not working on a scandalous reality show , or groundbreaking project , or starring in a horror movie , or dating hunky Taylor Lautner , so people are honestly just tired of hearing about her partying .
Maybe people are just simply tired of her . "
It is hard to believe that after years of honing her ability to exploit herself and her name , Hilton has simply let the media forget about her .
Perhaps dipping below the radar is exactly what Hilton is looking to do in order to rebuild her brand .
" Paris invented it all -- the whole famous - for - being - famous act , " said Jared Shapiro , executive editor of Life & Style magazine .
" And since then others have taken the torch .
But it 's not like she 's done .
She knows she hit oversaturation and she 's taking a breather , working on a second album and developing some TV .
I still firmly believe she 's one of the more famous people in ' Celebrity - ville . '
The second she 's pregnant , has a baby , or gets married , major interest will peak . "
Hilton , who has never been known to do anything discretely , did just that last week by quietly launching her line of hair styling products .
The line includes the " Celebrity Styler " and the " Ultimate Styling Brush , " in Hilton 's signature pink .
The launch at the Thompson Hotel in Beverly Hills , California , lacked the typical Hilton entourage of paparazzi , media scrum and celebrity friends .
The guest list was kept to Hilton 's friends and family , including her sister Nicky Hilton and her boyfriend Doug Reinhardt .
But in addition to her hair products , Hilton has also been in the studio recording her second album .
" It 's smart for Paris to keep a low profile until she is ready to come back with a more defined and sophisticated brand , " said branding expert Rebecca Brooks , president of The Brooks Group .
" Americans have proven to be extremely forgiving when it comes to stars and their shenanigans and I think they will be receptive . "

Omega - 3 fatty acids can be obtained from GM soybeans ( Image : Carroll & Carroll / Getty )
Editorial : A golden age for GM crops ?
Good news for fish stocks at last .
A genetically modified soybean that produces oil containing omega - 3 fatty acids – recommended for heart and brain health – could supplement fish as a source of these nutrients .
Last week , the US Food and Drug Administration made public its ruling that the oil produced by GM soybeans is safe to eat , meaning food companies can begin testing it in products such as margarine .
Advertisement
Developed by biotech giant Monsanto , the soybean is the first GM plant that has claimed health benefits for consumers , not just economic benefits to farmers .
Two other companies , BASF ( PDF ) and Du Pont , say they are not far behind .
BASF has developed GM canola plants that produce similar oils , while Du Pont makes them by fermenting micro-organisms , and says it plans to launch its first “ omega - 3 ” pill early next year .
Death watch
Omega - 3 fatty acids have been estimated to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by up to 26 per cent , and of sudden cardiac death by 45 per cent .
Earlier this year , a study by the Harvard School of Public Health concluded that a lack of omega - 3 in the diet is the sixth leading cause of preventable deaths in the US ( PLoS Medicine , DOI : 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000058 ) .
A review of 97 studies in 2005 concluded that omega - 3s are as effective at reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes as statins , the leading class of cholesterol - lowering drugs .
Some plants , such as linseed , naturally produce an omega - 3 called alpha- linolenic acid ( ALA ) , and one way to increase the amount of omega - 3 in our diet is to eat these plants or margarines and other foodstuffs that contain added ALA .
However , only a tiny amount of ALA is converted by the body into a fatty acid it can use , prompting some nutritionists to say the labelling on omega - 3 - enhanced margarines is misleading .
Fish oils are rich in two related omega - 3s , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , which is important for nerves and the brain , and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , which is vital for cardiovascular health .
Gene tricks
BASF has inserted five genes from algae that naturally make EPA and DHA into the canola genome .
Its product is still in development .
Monsanto has taken a different approach .
It inserted two genes into the soybean genome , one from a plant related to primrose and one from a fungus .
The modified soybean produces stearidonic acid , or SDA .
Like ALA , SDA is converted into EPA in the body , but in much higher proportions – about a third , Monsanto says .
“ To get 1 gram of EPA , you ’d have to eat about 3 to 4 grams of SDA , and about 14 to 20 grams of ALA , ” says David Stark of Monsanto .
However , Stark acknowledges that hardly any of the SDA is converted into the DHA needed for brain health .
Good for fish
The modified plant oils could ease the pressure on fish stocks , currently the principal source of omega - 3 fatty acids .
At present , there is no official recommended daily intake of omega - 3s .
According to GOED Omega - 3 , an umbrella group for manufacturers of omega - 3 - containing products , the optimal intake is only reached in fish - eating nations such as Japan and Iceland , with typical per-capita consumption in western nations a fifth of this level .
Monsanto claims that meeting GOED ’s recommended intake in western nations could require as little as 400,000 hectares of its soybean crops .
Less than half a hectare , it says , would provide the same amount of EPA as 10,000 servings of salmon .
One worry is that farmers may clear tropical rainforests to grow the oil - producing plants .
But Solae of St Louis , Missouri , which will be commercialising the GM soybean , says that the crops are more suited to the temperate climate of North America .
Jack Winkler , head of the Nutrition Policy Unit at London Metropolitan University , is enthusiastic about the prospect of plant - derived omega - 3s .
“ There are not enough fish in the sea to provide people with the EPA and DHA that we need .
[ This ] is a very positive way forward . ”
Daniel Pauly , a fisheries specialist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , also welcomes the move .
“ Our stressed marine ecosystem would benefit from an alternative to fish oil as a source of omega - 3s , ” he says .
However , in Europe at least , the new sources of omega - 3s may encounter public resistance .
Helen Wallace of GeneWatch UK , a lobby group in Buxton , Derbyshire , says : “ It will be interesting to see if people in the US believe the benefits exist . ”
Europeans have traditionally been wary of genetically modified crops and Wallace says they are also suspicious of medical claims about food .
All this makes the future uncertain for the products in Europe .

If you do n’t see things from the side of bigots , are you doing a disservice to the gay rights movement ?
Sure , we want marriage rights , and we want them now !
( along with the ability to serve openly in the military , visit our ailing loved ones in the hospital , and adopt kids if we so choose ) , but is it prohibitive to maintain a zero tolerance policy against anyone who disagrees with us ?
We might be willing to entertain the possibility that we need to be more understanding of folks who use God to defend their hatemongering , but too bad the argument is raised by the Dallas Morning News ‘s Rod Dreher , who says that not only should religious conservatives feel empathy toward us , but so should we toward them .
That ’s a big part of the gay marriage side ’s problem :
They cannot imagine why , aside from bigotry , anyone would disagree with them .
To be sure , anyone on the traditional marriage side who does n’t understand that denying marriage to same - sex couples imposes a serious burden on them is either willfully ignorant or hard - hearted .
The thing is , empathy should go both ways .
Okay , let ’s hear you out , Rod .
Leaving aside that there is undoubtedly a significant number of people who vote against gay marriage because they flat - out do n’t like gay people , there are serious and important reasons to vote against same - sex marriage – and these deserve to be taken seriously .
Like what ?
For starters , gay marriage represents a cultural revolution , a fundamental redefinition of what marriage means .
Until the past 10 or 20 years , no society had ever sanctioned marriage between same - sex partners .
It was unthinkable outside of a small radical fringe .
Now , in the twinkling of an eye , it ’s coming to pass in a few countries , though the vast majority of humankind still finds it unthinkable .
That ’s not an argument against gay marriage , but it is an explanation for why gay marriage remains unpopular in this country .
Culture precedes politics .
If you cannot change culture , you ’re reduced to arguing , as same - sex marriage supporter Linda Hirshman did in the wake of the Maine defeat , that people should n’t have the right to vote on the definition of marriage .
Well once upon a time , in this very country , the idea that black people were not somebody ’s property was a “ cultural revolution ” and a “ fundamental redefinition ” of what it means to be human , but we would n’t look back on that and say we should feel empathy toward slaveowners , would we ?
But maybe , Rod — seen here with his heterosexual family , who nobody is asking anyone to feel empathy towards — maybe you ’ve got a point .
Along those lines , gay marriage backers often say that civil rights should n’t be submitted to a popular vote .
If blacks in the Jim Crow South had depended on a majority vote to gain their civil rights , justice would have been a long time coming .
That makes sense to people who see no moral or philosophical difference between race and homosexuality .
But it is by no means clear that the two categories are interchangeable .
For traditionalists , it ’s a category mistake to say that they are .
And here ’s where we ’re about to give up on your thesis , Rod .
Because also , once upon a time , some people saw a huge “ moral or philosophical difference ” between whites and blacks , and at the time it was “ by no means clear that the two ” races were “ interchangeable . ”
One more shot , Rod .
We ’re getting tired here .
Which brings us to another reason majorities oppose gay marriage : the belief that its supporters are all too willing to force their own particular view of marriage and its meaning on an unwilling society .
It ’s simply not true that their viewpoint is neutral .
To believe that same - sex marriage is the equivalent of heterosexual marriage is to accept that the essence of marriage is fundamentally different from what it has always been .
The essence of marriage is “ fundamentally different from what it has always been . ”
It used to be a property transaction .
Now , it ’s argued , marriage is a union of love and a vessel for procreation .
Except plenty of heteros abuse that “ definition . ”
Final thoughts , Rob ?
[ T] houghtful traditionalists understand that legalizing same - sex marriage almost certainly would bring about serious restrictions on freedom of speech and association , particularly for churches and religious organizations .
Nobody is going to force pastors to marry same - sex couples , but legal scholars , including prominent gay - rights advocate and law professor Chai Feldblum , have plainly said that there is an irresolvable conflict between religious freedom and gay civil rights – and only one side can prevail .
You ca n’t expect gay folks to privilege religious liberties over their own interests , but likewise , why is it bigoted for religious traditionalists to stand up for what they believe to be bedrock rights – rights that will be curtailed by same - sex marriage ?
We love religious liberties .
Not just because we believe in the freedom to think and pray any way you choose , but because many “ gay folks ” are religious !
They believe in loving thy neighbor and all that jazz ; they do n’t believe in hating thy neighbor simply because he was born a certain way .
And then there ’s this :
Gay marriage opponents are not crazy to fear what may be done to them should same - sex marriage become the law of the land .
In California , supporters of Proposition 8 , which repealed same - sex marriage , have suffered vandalism , job and business loss , intimidation and harassment by activists .
One would have to be deeply naïve , indeed foolish , to trust that traditionalist dissent will be tolerated once these groups gain the legal upper hand .
We ’re not advocates of violence or vandalism by any means .
But we would n’t want to employ racists or anti-Semites — what employer would , beside racist and anti-Semitic ones ?
So why , then , should Americans be forced to “ accept ” your anti-gay hatred ?
We wo n’t .
And we ’re barely willing to tolerate it .

Selecting strings is a common thing especially if you want to ( a ) extract a constant representing it , ( b ) replace the string with a message bundle key or ( c ) use it as a search term to look for the same string across the codebase .
When refactoring , you ’ll sometimes want to delete a method or move it around , requiring you to select the entire method .
The problem is that selecting these can be slow .
To select a string you ’ll typically move the cursor to the start of the string then select the string using the arrow keys or Ctrl + Shift + Right ( select next word ) repeatedly until you reach the end of the string which can be slow depending on the number of words in the string .
The strategy for methods is similar , move to the start and select but using .
Eclipse has a keyboard shortcut called Select Enclosing Element to make this faster .
It allows you to select entire strings from anywhere within the string and methods from anywhere within the method .
A bonus is that you do the same thing no matter how big the string / method is .
Advertisement
How to select an entire string
To select an entire string , do the following :
Position the cursor anywhere inside the string or before or after the quotes .
Press Alt + Shift + Up .
This will select the entire string , regardless of how many words there are .
If the string spans multiple lines , press Alt + Shift +
Up once more to select the string across lines .
See the video below for an example of how this works .
How to select an entire method
To select an entire method , do the following :
Position the cursor anywhere inside or at the start / end of the method .
Press Alt + Shift + Up several times until the method is selected .
Each time you press this key , Eclipse will select the enclosing element of the current selection .
Often 4 - 5 times would be enough but sometimes you ’ll need up to 7 .
Not quite a single keystroke , but close enough since you ’re just repeating the same keystroke .
If you ’ve gone too far with the selection ( ie. selected too much ) , you can press Alt + Shift + Down to take the selection one element back .
Here ’s a video with an example of both string and method selection .
I select the string to extract a constant and select the method to move it down .
How does this make me work faster ?
There is no doubt that selecting strings is faster than the old way ( watch the video and see what I mean ) .
But you might ask how selecting methods is faster than the old way , considering that you have to press the key multiple times .
Well , using the Select Enclosing Element technique , you always do one action repeatedly whereas the old method requires different actions depending on the context , eg. where you are in the method , how big the method is , where does it end ( did you page down too far ? ) .
90 % of the time the former is faster than the latter .

110 countries have ratified the ICC's Rome statute US envoy for war crimes Stephen Rapp has announced that his country will for the first time attend a meeting of the International Criminal Court .
Speaking to reporters in Nairobi , Kenya , he said the US wanted to engage more with the court in The Hague .
The US has in the past refused to join the ICC , which was set up in 2002 to try individuals for war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
Mr Rapp said the US would attend the court 's annual meeting as an observer .
' Concerns remain '
" Our government has now made the decision that Americans will return to engagement with the ICC , " Mr Rapp said on Monday .
However , he said the US was still years away from joining the court .
" There remain concerns about the possibility that the United States , upon whom a great deal of the world relies for security , and its service members might be subject to politically inspired prosecutions , " he said .
The court can only try individuals from countries which have ratified the treaty .
At present , 110 countries have done so .
Mr Rapp said the court was a useful tool for trying suspects who may otherwise escape justice .
" We are certainly looking to engage with the ICC to ensure where there are no other avenues for accountability , that it will be an effective instrument for ensuring that individuals are brought to justice . "
Mr Rapp said he would be leading the US delegation attending the annual meeting of the ICC in The Hague from 18 to 26 November 2009 .

The government wants Britain to get on its bike .
The transport secretary , Andrew Adonis , will launch a scheme today to encourage companies to improve cycling facilities for their employees , part of a plan to make cycling one of the mainstream ways for getting people to and from work , school and college .
" If proper facilities were more widely available , I believe far more people would cycle to work , " Adonis said .
" At present , only 3 % do so .
We could double or treble that figure with proper bike storage and changing facilities and safe cycle routes – and that 's my aim . "
By signing up to the government 's " cycle to work guarantee " , companies will agree to provide staff with safe bike storage , changing rooms , cycling lessons and access to bike - repair facilities – as well as access to the government 's tax - free scheme to buy new bicycles .
Around 70 public and private sector employers have already signed up , including Whitehall departments , NHS hospitals and companies such as BSkyB , E.ON and GlaxoSmithKline .
Adonis cited Copenhagen – where 40 % of all journeys are made by bike – as a good example of what can be achieved with the right organisation and incentives .
The cycling guarantee forms part of a wider strategy to get people more active that will be published next month .
" We 're investing £ 140 m in improved facilities for cyclists over the next three years , " Adonis said .
" This includes more support for cycle lanes , dedicated cycle paths , and I 'm a strong supporter of the mayor of London 's plans for cycle highways . "
The health secretary , Andy Burnham , said : " We ca n't expect people to cycle to work if they can't have a shower or store their bike safely when they get there – that 's why we need a cycle - to - work guarantee from employers .
Lots of NHS organisations have already signed up and are helping their staff cycle their way to better health .
I 'm pleased they are leading by example and I hope it will become standard practice across the NHS . "
Richard Lambert , director of the Confederation of British Industry , welcomed the initiative .
" An estimated one in two journeys cover less than five miles , so there is huge opportunity for increasing cycle use .
This initiative shows how a number of small steps by employers can encourage employees to cycle to work . "
What do you think ?
There 's no public money behind the scheme as yet .
Is the government doing enough , or is it employers who should be doing more ?

As the national discussion of health care focuses on costs , a new study from North Carolina State University shows that it might be more accurate to think of health care spending as an investment that can spur economic growth .
The study also shows that government projections of health care costs and financing may be unduly pessimistic .
" Health care spending should be viewed as an investment in future capital , contributing to a productive workforce , rather than merely as an expenditure , " says Dr. Al Headen , associate professor of economics at NC State and a co-author of a paper appearing in the Dec. 15 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The paper was co-authored by researchers from Duke University , Brigham Young University and the National Council of Spinal Cord Injury Association .
People are living longer , Headen says , and are retaining their ability to be productive members of society - they are able to work , pay taxes , consume goods and go on vacation .
" But a lot of projections by the government of the future work force are not accounting for improved health and productivity of older Americans .
People will be paying into government programs , such as Medicare , for a longer time - while simultaneously delaying the point where they need to draw on those programs .
Our research suggests that if the government 's projections had accounted for this improved productivity , those projections would have been less pessimistic . "
For example , the researchers found the Congressional Budget Office 's ( CBO ) projected costs for Medicare and Medicaid from 1994 - 2004 to be substantially overestimated .
In 1994 , CBO projections of Medicare expenditures for 2004 for persons 65 and older were $ 361 billion , but the actual 2004 expenditure was only $ 268 billion - an error of 35 percent .
" Our projections adjust for improved quality of health and functioning , indicated by declines in disability among the 65 and older age group from 1994 to 2004 in data from the National Long Term Care Surveys linked to Medicare files , " Headen says .
" Our health quality adjusted Medicare expenditures projection over the same decade covered by the CBO projections is $ 253 billion , an error of 5.6 percent .
Thus , the projection error rate for the CBO , which did not adjust for improvement in the quality of health and functioning among elders , was over six times larger than the projection error rate that explicitly adjusted for improvement in the quality of health and functioning among elders . "
One implication of the study 's findings , Headen says , is that " some programs that the government has said will be in deficit in the near future may actually have a surplus , once you account for improved health and productivity .
For example , we project a $ 242 billion surplus for Medicare by 2020 , not a deficit .
" Spending on health care productivity , biomedical research and universal health care should be considered an investment that will eventually lead to increased economic growth , " Headen says .
" Improvements in human capital related to health are important , and need to be accounted for when doing projections of costs and benefits related to health care . "
###
The study , " Long - term economic growth stimulus of human capital preservation in the elderly , " was co-authored by Headen ; Kenneth Manton , Xi-Liang Gu and Gene Lowrimore of Duke University ; Arthur Ullian of the National Council of Spinal Cord Injury Association ; and H. Dennis Tolley of Brigham Young University .
Whatever the outcome of President O b ama ’s deli b erations , two things are certain .
One , the war in Afghanistan will continue , in whatever altered shape or form .
Two , it will still b e the wrong war , against the wrong enemy , and in the wrong place .
The dan ger that the United States and the West face in that region is not from a Tali b an victory in Afghanistan b ut from an Islamist takeover of Pakistan .
And every day that the war in Afghanistan continues b rings that takeover one day closer .
In Washington and other capitals this dan ger was seen as coming from the Pakistani Tali b an , and there is much relief that they were defeated b y the Pakistan army in Swat and are now b eing taken on in South Waziristan .
This is evidence of the ignorance ( and , possi b ly , even deli b erate disinformation ) that prevails regarding the situation in this area and the players involved .
There was never any dan ger of these Tali b an ( essentially religious Islamists ) taking over Pakistan , b ut that peril does arise from the political Islamists in that country .
However , while everyone seems to have a fairly good idea of who the religious Islamists are , most people are either unaware of the political variety or una b le to recognize them .
Political Islamists can b e thought of as Islamic nationalists or ultra-nationalists .
Instead of a nation - state providing the b asis for their feelings , their emotions are focussed on Islam ( as an idealized ‘ state ’ , rooted in the glory days of its storied past ) and on the ‘ nation ’ of the worldwide Muslim community , the ummah ( which is perceived as under threat and attack ) .
Ancient tales of the Crusades , recent memories of colonialism , current wounds such as Palestine , all these give an anti-West edge to Islamism .
In some Muslim countries this ‘ Islamic nationalism ’ competes with ordinary nationalism , in others they tend to meld .
Pakistan is one of those rare cases in which no other nationalism exists to cha llenge or modify the Islamic one .
Pakistan was created as an em b odiment of political Islam ‒ the concept given physical shape as a country .
This reality was b loodily driven home in the horrific trauma of its b irth , when millions of Muslims were killed or driven from their homes b ecause of their faith ( as , conversely , were Sikhs and Hindus ) .
This threat to its nascent existence was repeated ( at least in the national consciousness ) in the three wars that it has fought with India , in one of which half the country was “ lost ” .
Thus , during Pakistan ’s short 60 - year existence , what developed in the place of nationalism was ‘ anti- Indianism ’ , which is now lin ked to the original Islamism of its b irth .
As is usually the case in most countries , this nationalist fervour is most pronounced within the military and right wing groups ( while many in the intelligentsia have outgrown it ) .
Pakistan ( actually , the “ Islamic Repu b lic of Pakistan ” ) is a country of a b out 180 million people , most of whom are Muslims .
It has a modern , all - volunteer military of a b out one million active - duty personnel , the sixth largest in the world .
It possesses a stock of nuclear weapons and a range of missiles that can deliver them .
Even so , this large and powerful country is one of the most fragile states in the world .
Its economy is in dire straits ; outside assistance alone prevents the country from going b ankrupt .
There is a vast disparity in affluence and standard of living b etween a small upper class and the rest of the population .
Ordinary people face great hardship in their daily lives b ecause of the high costs of b asic essentials , rampant inflation , power and water shortages , and a deficit of law and order .
G overnance is mostly dysfunctional ; corruption is massive and all pervasive ; the b ureaucracy is paralysed due to constant political meddling .
The political system is in disarray with state institutions and functionaries at loggerheads , while politicians line their own pockets and undermine each other .
In addition to these systemic pro b lems the country has to deal with two insurgencies ( in its northern and southern tri b al areas ) plus terrorist attacks occurring frequently in its cities .
Making things worse , underlying all this are the ticking time b om b s of rapid population growth , a shrinking food supply b ase , a high proportion of young men with no prospect of gainful work , and increasing ur b anization , mostly in the form of huge slums in and around cities .
The current situation is further aggravated b y a critical disconnect b etween the government and the vast majority of the people , especially as regards the United States .
The government of President Zardari depends on the US for financial and other aid and is willing to align its policies fully with the US ’s requirements , especially in support of the war in Afghanistan .
The military also seeks assistance in funding and equipment from the US , and has gone along with US needs to a certain extent .
However , the b ulk of the people have a very different attitude towards the US ‒ as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently experienced for herself .
Ordinary Pakistanis b lame the US for most of the pro b lems their country is facing .
Many of these ( the rise of fundamentalism , the flood of weapons and drugs , large num b ers of Afghans settling in the country , the corruption in the military ) are b elieved to have started when Pakistan was used b y the US in its proxy war against the Soviets in Afghanistan .
That war won , the US a b andoned Pakistan ( and also Afghanistan ) , and later su b jected it to punitive sanctions and em b argoes , there b y accelerating the country ’s economic decline .
Then came the Bush - Cheney “ war on terror ” , and Pakistanis saw their government and military b ullied and b ri b ed into joining up .
The operations the military was pushed into carrying out in the tri b al areas created a serious security pro b lem through the rise of the Pakistani Tali b an , who not only fought the army in the b order areas b ut also carried out terrorist b om b ings and attacks in cities inside the country .
Concerns a b out its nuclear weapons add to these suspicions .
Existing as it does in a dan gerous part of the world , Pakistan considers its nuclear capa b ility the lynchpin of its security , and there is great sensitivity a b out any threat to it , especially within the military .
The concern expressed b y the US over the last few years regarding the “ security ” of Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons has created a great deal of suspicion as to its real motives .
Many , including within the military , b elieve that the US is deli b erately trying to desta b ilize Pakistan so as to take over its nuclear weapons .
Such suspicions , and the strained relations for many years prior to 2001 , deeply colour Pakistani attitudes towards the USA .
It is no surprise that , in a recent poll released b y a US polling organization , all of two percent of Pakistanis thought the US had good relations with Pakistan .
Since the commencement of the war in Afghanistan , Pakistan has b een seen b y the US mainly through the prism of that war ‒ as a necessary auxiliary whose role was to clean out the Tali b an and al - Qaeda b ases in its tri b al areas .
Pakistan ’s limited attempts at compliance did not meet US needs b ut did create an indigenous Tali b an insurgency .
After some initial hesitation the military cleared out these insurgents from Swat , and is now undertaking an operation to do the same in South Waziristan .
The US is hoping that this will b e the prelude to similar operations in the rest of the tri b al b elt .
This is just wishful thinking , as discussed b elow .
Similarly , the comfort the US derives from reports and poll num b ers regarding pu b lic opinion turning decisively against the Tali b an insurgents is misplaced .
People in Pakistan are opposed to the Tali b an who attack them or their country , b ut they do not support the US “ war on terror ” : the poll referred to a b ove found that 80 % of Pakistanis were against cooperating with the US in this war .
Whatever strategy President O b ama approves for the war in Afghanistan , it is likely to include an increased focus on the Tali b an and al - Qaeda b ases in Pakistan .
The resulting pressure on the Pakistanis to take effective military action to clean out and occupy the tri b al areas where they are located is likely to create a crisis in Pakistan .
Since its creation , Pakistan ’s defence policy has b een b ased on the major threat to its security coming from India , and the military has b een positioned accordingly .
Cleaning out and occupying all the tri b al areas would require the long - term redeployment of such large forces that it would result in the denuding of the defences of the eastern b order with India , and would effectively cha nge the defence policy of the country .
While President Zardari would b e happy to o b lige the USA , it is quite unlikely that the military command will agree to this ; nor will the people accept it .
Pakistani inaction will compel the US to intensify its own attacks in the tri b al areas using drones and , possi b ly , Special Forces .
Such attacks ( already resented as a violation of the country ’s sovereignty ) will trigger further retaliation b y the tri b es through increased b om b ings and attacks in Pakistan ’s cities ( since they hold Pakistan responsi b le for such US attacks ) .
In addition , the United States will apply pressure on Pakistan b y reducing or stopping the aid it gives to the country and the military .
The impact of these measures will further inflame anti-American and nationalistic sentiments , and the present government will either b e forced to cha nge its pro-American policies or it will itself b e cha nged .
The succeeding set - up , squeezed b y the US and the West , will b ecome increasingly responsive to the Islamist ( i.e. , anti-Indian , Islamic nationalist ) sentiment in the country .
As the situation in the country deteriorates , a direct Islamist takeover ( most likely through the military ) will b ecome a real possi b ility .
It would pro b a b ly happen in stages , with the generals first intervening to forestall action b y more radical elements in the military , b ut ultimately b eing una b le to stop the tide .
( Should the generals succum b to US pressure to move large forces to clear and occupy the rest of the tri b al b elt , the dan ger of such action b y mid-level Islamist officers will b ecome a much earlier possi b ility ) .
That is the peril that the United States and the West face in the region : not a ne b ulous al - Qaeda esta b lishing b ases in Tali b an areas in Afghanistan b ut a nuclear - armed Islamist state in Pakistan .
And the longer the inconclusive war in Afghanistan drags on , the closer it gets .
Considering the hoops the West has b een willing to jump through to prevent such a scenario b ecoming possi b le in Iran in the future , the very real possi b ility of this occurring in Pakistan is what President O b ama and his advisers should b e worrying a b out .
The pity of it is that it ’s all so unnecessary !
It is possi b le to engineer a political resolution in Afghanistan that would give the Tali b an their space in the country b ut exclude al - Qaeda .
It is possi b le to shore up Pakistan , and those institutions and elements in it that would b e a b ulwark against the Islamists .
With the war in Afghanistan ended , it would b e possi b le for Pakistan to re-esta b lish control over its tri b al areas , and prevent al - Qaeda from using them as a b ase .
And it would b e possi b le for the United States to spend the b illions and b illions of dollars saved on its own people instead of on military preparations and wars against other peoples .

[ What happens when developers lose control of a nearly - finished game soon before its planned release ?
After forming a new studio , Runic Games , many of the developers behind Mythos transitioned to Torchlight .
What follows is an examination of the decisions , steps , and key design elements that have shaped the look of Torchlight -- a title produced on an aggressive schedule and modest budget that still strives to for the production values of a big retail game . ]
Our Mythos
It is impossible to tell the story of Runic Games and Torchlight without covering what brought all of us here : a little network test that grew up into a game called Mythos .
It began as a one - man " team " of current Runic president and lead programmer , Travis Baldree , working with the Flagship Studios team to create a small hack - and - slash game as a network test for Hellgate : London .
Accelerated progress and increased interest in the test ( at the time labeled " Project Tugboat " ) allowed Travis to expand the team to three .
Eventually three became five , and then eight ( which is the point I joined . )
Ultimately , we had a small , focused group of 14 at Flagship Seattle working on Mythos .
The scope had changed from a simple test to plans for a free - to - play MMO with persistent areas , a cash shop for items , and a variety of features considered standards in the MMO space .
Mythos had a strange aura about it .
It was a fairly straightforward ARPG , very much in the Diablo mold , with a likeable look and easy - to - pick - up gameplay .
It was n't groundbreaking , it was n't a technological marvel , nor was it particularly shiny and beautiful -- but it absolutely was fun .
We opened it up to Alpha and Closed Beta testers and something clicked .
Testers and forum users were having fun , making suggestions , and behaving like -- dare I say it -- reasonable people , with nary a flame war or troll to be seen .
This atmosphere was a bit odd to us , as we knew all too well how the tone differed in the forums for the Hellgate : London team down south .
But we ran with it , and reciprocated with constant interaction -- and as thin a veil you could imagine between our testers and what we were working on , contemplating , or fixing .
This aura of being in synch with our game 's audience was something special ; they appreciated our openness and we appreciated the input , enthusiasm , and tone in the forums .
We were a few weeks from going to Public Beta and it was all going so well ...
Then , in July of 2008 , Flagship Studios closed and the Mythos IP was lost in the fallout .
One month later , the Seattle team , along with Max Schaefer , Erich Schaefer , and Peter Hu , formed what would become known as Runic Games .
Having been so close to releasing our game only to lose it all on the home stretch , we set forth with an eye to finish what we started ... by starting all over again .
The Elephant in the Room
Just as it's impossible to discuss where we are now without mention of Mythos , we 're likely also going to be linked by many with the benchmark for ARPGs : the Diablo series .
Comparisons to the upcoming Diablo III are inevitable -- so let 's get this out of the way .
Our founders , along with Runic 's composer Matt Uelman and QA Lead Ian Welke , were major contributers to Diablo and Diablo II .
Their expertise and enthusiasm for this type of game has been absolutely invaluable in creating Torchlight .
It 's one heck of a foundation to build a studio upon .
Any fan of ARPGs is aware that Diablo III was announced and is in production .
All of us here are fans of the genre , and are very excited to have a new Diablo game to play .
We 've also already heard comments that Torchlight is trying to " take on " D3 as direct competition -- or even that Torchlight is a " cartoony version of D3 " .
Both comments are actually quite incorrect .
If anything , we 've actively proceeded knowing full well that D3 is on the horizon and that it behooves us to be on a different train track when it comes roaring by .
Certainly the ARPG , hack - and - slash gameplay full of loot drops is absolutely a common ground , but we 're producing a single player game as a launchpad to a free - to - play , hack - and - slash MMO .
Gameplay similarities aside , the art controversy surrounding the announcement of D3 was somewhat fascinating to me and , in a small way , contributed towards Torchlight 's look .
My reaction to the first screenshots was that Blizzard had created a beautiful , living painting .
To me , it was absolutely gorgeous , and a style that I would have loved to have pursued .
But knowing the direction Blizzard went with the game helped inform our decision to go in a different direction .
We did n't want the inevitable comparisons , so in a way ... it helped us define which artistic choices were now off limits .

WORSHIPPERS at one York church got a shock when their parish priest used the last Sunday before Christmas to advocate shoplifting .
Father Tim Jones , parish priest of St Lawrence and St Hilda , broke off from the traditional Nativity story yesterday , and said stealing from large national chains was sometimes the best option many vulnerable people had .
He told the congregation : “ My advice , as a Christian priest , is to shoplift .
I do not offer such advice because I think that stealing is a good thing , or because I think it is harmless , for it is neither .
“ I would ask that they do not steal from small , family businesses , but from large national businesses , knowing that the costs are ultimately passed on to the rest of us in the form of higher prices .
I would ask them not to take any more than they need , for any longer than they need . ”
He said he offered the advice “ with a heavy heart ” , and wished society would recognise that bureaucratic ineptitude and systemic delay had created an “ invitation and incentive to crime for people struggling to cope ” .
Father Jones said society had failed many needy people , and said it was far better that they shoplift than turn to more degrading or violent options such as prostitution , mugging or burglary .
He cited an example of an ex-prisoner who had received less than £ 100 , including a crisis loan , in the six weeks since his release .
He said his advice did not contradict the Bible ’s eighth commandment , not to steal , saying God ’s love for the poor and despised outweighed the property rights of the rich .
He added : “ Let my words not be misrepresented as a simplistic call for people to shoplift .
The observation that shoplifting is the best option that some people are left with is a grim indictment of who we are .
“ Rather , this is a call for our society no longer to treat its most vulnerable people with indifference and contempt . ”
He said providing “ inadequate or clumsy social support ” was “ monumental , catastrophic folly ” .
Vale of York MP Anne McIntosh , who has campaigned in Parliament for stronger sentences for shoplifters , said there had been an “ over - commercialisation ” of Christmas , putting more pressure on people to spend , but said : “ I can not condone inciting anyone to commit a criminal offence . ”
She said shoplifting was “ a crime against the whole local community and society ” .
A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said : “ First and foremost , shoplifting is a criminal offence and to justify this course of action under any circumstances is highly irresponsible .
“ Turning or returning to crime will only make matters worse , that is a guarantee . ”
He said the force recognised that some people found themselves in difficult circumstances but said support was readily available and must be sought .
* Full transcript of the sermon given by Father Tim Jones >>
Clergyman caused a stir over logos
THIS is n’t the first time Father Tim Jones has courted controversy and caused a stir in the retail sector .
In May last year , he walked into Stationery Box in High Ousegate and started throwing items bearing the Playboy logo on to the floor .
He said he was protesting over the use of the porn empire ’s logo on products aimed at children .
He said the shop displayed Playboy products alongside Mickey Mouse and Winnie The Pooh stationery .
Father Jones encouraged shoppers in the store to sign a petition and staff removed the items from sale , while they reviewed their policy .
• Support is available to people in need , said City of York Council leader Andrew Waller .
“ We do provide support , through our own services and also the Citizens ’ Advice Bureau , the Credit Union and a whole host of agencies there to help the most vulnerable , ” he said .
He said times were tough for many people but said the council was doing all it could to keep people on the right side of the law .

Florida Democrat U.S. Rep .
Alan Grayson wants Americans to help him block Congress from confirming the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to his second term unless he hands over documents relating to the bailouts of financial institutions , including the rescue of Bear Stearns .
In the “ Unmask the Fed ” campaign , Grayson calls on constituents to sign petitions demanding that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke “ come clean ” before senators re-confirm his appointment to the helm of the Federal Reserve .

Grayson wants access to the Bear Stearns rescue paperwork as well as the details of which financial institutions received $ 1.2 trillion in bailout money , how much each institution received , and what was promised in return .
He ’s also seeking Fed documents that discuss the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch merger , transcripts of Open Market Meeting minutes , and the terms and conditions of Fed transactions not reflected in balance sheets from the past three years .
“ [ T ]he Senate should know who got the $ 2 trillion the Federal Reserve has lent out over the last two years , ” the petition reads .
“ Only then will the Senate be able to judge whether he should keep his job . ”
Grayson and Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul sent Sen. Chris Dodd , who chairs the Senate Banking Committee , a letter last week asking him to postpone Bernanke ’s re-confirmation hearings until the public has access to more information about the Federal Reserve .
“ Without such an understanding , it is impossible to know whether Chairman Bernanke is fit to serve another term and fulfill the Federal Reserve ’s dual mandate to ensure price stability and full employment , ” the letter to Dodd read .
It continued : “ Today , big banks are being bailed out and have a substantially lower cost of capital through an implicit government backstop even as Americans themselves are seeing their pay cut . ”

There are separate bills that would authorize an audit of the Federal Reserve that are picking up speed in both the House and the Senate , with bi-partisan support in both chambers .
Paul sponsors the House version of that legislation , and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is behind the Senate measure .
“ The Federal Reserve has got to understand that this money does not belong to the Federal Reserve .
It belongs to the American people , ” Sanders told Raw Story in an email from his spokesman .
“ As long as the Federal Reserve is allowed to keep the information on their loans secret , we will never know the true financial condition of the banking system . ”

Nov. 18 , 2009  --
The CIA built one of its secret European prisons inside an exclusive riding academy outside Vilnius , Lithuania , a current Lithuanian government official and a former U.S. intelligence official told ABC News this week .
Where affluent Lithuanians once rode show horses and sipped coffee at a café , the CIA installed a concrete structure where it could use harsh tactics to interrogate up to eight suspected al - Qaeda terrorists at a time .
" The activities in that prison were illegal , " said human rights researcher John Sifton .
" They included various forms of torture , including sleep deprivation , forced standing , painful stress positions . "
Lithuanian officials provided ABC News with the documents of what they called a CIA front company , Elite , LLC , which purchased the property and built the " black site " in 2004 .
Lithuania agreed to allow the CIA prison after President George W. Bush visited the country in 2002 and pledged support for Lithuania 's efforts to join NATO .
" The new members of NATO were so grateful for the U.S. role in getting them into that organization that they would do anything the U.S. asked for during that period , " said former White House counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke , now an ABC News consultant .
" They were eager to please and eager to be cooperative on security and on intelligence matters . "
Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaite declined ABC 's request for an interview .
ABC News first reported that Lithuania was one of three eastern European countries , along with Poland and Romania , where the CIA secretly interrogated suspected high - value al - Qaeda terrorists , but until now the precise site had not been confirmed .
Read that report here .
Until March 2004 , the site was a riding academy and café owned by a local family .
The facility is in the town of Antaviliai , in the forest 20 kilometers northeast of the city center of Vilnius , near an exclusive suburb where many government officials live .
A " Building Within A Building "
In March 2004 , the family sold the property to Elite , LLC , a now - defunct company registered in Delaware and Panama and Washington , D.C. That same month , Lithuania marked its formal admission to NATO .
The CIA constructed the prison over the next several months , apparently flying in prefabricated elements from outside Lithuania .
The prison opened in Sept. 2004 .
According to sources who saw the facility , the riding academy originally consisted of an indoor riding area with a red metallic roof , a stable and a cafe .
The CIA built a thick concrete wall inside the riding area .
Behind the wall , it built what one Lithuanian source called a " building within a building . "
On a series of thick concrete pads , it installed what a source called " prefabricated pods " to house prisoners , each separated from the other by five or six feet .
Each pod included a shower , a bed and a toilet .
Separate cells were constructed for interrogations .
The CIA converted much of the rest of the building into garage space .
Intelligence officers working at the prison were housed next door in the converted stable , raising the roof to add space .
Electrical power for both structures was provided by a 2003 Caterpillar autonomous generator .
All the electrical outlets in the renovated structure were 110 volts , meaning they were designed for American appliances .
European outlets and appliances typically use 220 volts .
The prison pods inside the barn were not visible to locals .
They describe seeing large amounts of earth being excavated during the summer of 2004 .
Locals who saw the activity at the prison and approached to ask for work were turned away by English - speaking guards .
The guards were replaced by new guards every 90 days .
Former CIA officials directly involved or briefed on the highly classified secret prison program tell ABC News that as many as eight suspects were held for more than a year in the Vilnius prison .
Flight logs viewed by ABC News confirm that CIA planes made repeated flights into Lithuania during that period .
In November 2005 , after public disclosures about the program , the prison was closed , as was another " black site " in Romania .
Lithuanian Prison One of Many Around Europe , Officials Said
The CIA moved the so - called High Value Detainees ( HVD ) out of Europe to " war zone " facilities , according to one of the former CIA officials , meaning they were moved to the Middle East .
Within nine months , President Bush announced the existence of the program and ordered the transfer of 14 of the detainees , including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad , Ramzi bin al Shihb and Abu Zubaydah , to Guantanamo .
In August 2009 , after ABC News reported the existence of the secret prison outside Vilnius , Lithuanian president Grybauskaite called for an investigation .
" If this is true , " Grybauskaite said , " Lithuania has to clean up , accept responsibility , apologize , and promise it will never happen again . "
At the time , a Lithuanian government official denied that his country had hosted a secret CIA facility .
The CIA told ABC News that reporting the existence of the Lithuanian prison was " irresponsible " and declined to discuss the location of the prison .
On Tuesday , the CIA again declined to talk about the prison .
" The CIA 's terrorist interrogation program is over , " said CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano .
" This agency does not discuss publicly where detention facilities may or may not have been . "
Former CIA officials told ABC News that the prison in Lithuania was one of eight facilities the CIA set - up after 9/11 to detain and interrogate top al - Qaeda operatives captured around the world .
Thailand , Romania , Poland , Morocco , and Afghanistan have also been identified as countries that housed secret prisons for the CIA .
President Barack Obama ordered all the sites closed shortly after taking office in January .
The Lithuanian prison was the last " black " site opened in Europe , after the CIA 's secret prison in Poland was closed down in late 2003 or early 2004 .
" It obviously took a lot of effort to keep [ the prison ] secret , " said John Sifton , whose firm One World Research investigates human rights abuses .
" There 's a reason this stuff gets kept secret . "
" It 's an embarrassment , and a crime . "

A Direct Tax On Fossil Fuel Is
What The World Needs Urgently
By Devinder Sharma
06 December , 2009
Devinder Sharma Blog
Too much is being said and written about the greenhouse gas emission cuts .
Newspapers are full of reports of figures of emission cuts .
Figures are being tossed around , and like the GDP figures about which people know nothing , the public tends to just believe in these emission cut figures simply because they do n't want to give an impression of how ignorant they are .
I wonder how many of us really understand the difference between greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity reduction .
But somehow we believe that the leaders who are likely to assemble at Copenhagen for the Climate Change conference will come up with a legally binding agreement that will slow down the global warming clock .
It is in this context that I was happy to read at least one distinguished scientist who had the courage to stand up and say that the climate talks in Copenhagen next week were based on flawed proposals .
James Hansen is the director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies since 1981 , and was quoted in the media as saying : " attempts to forge a global deal on cutting emissions after the Kyoto treaty expires were based on a ' fundamentally wrong ' approach . "
His point is that even if an agreement is arrived at , they 'll spend years trying to determine exactly what that means and what is the commitment , what are the mechanisms .
" the whole idea that you have goals which you are supposed to meet and that you have cuts , with offsets ( sold through the carbon market ) , means you know its an attempt to continue business as usual . "
How true ?
The Guardian reports that Hansen , who made headlines worldwide in 1988 with his US Congress testimony that climate change was already well underway , compared the current approach to the Catholic Church 's use of indulgences in the Middle Ages .
Sinners paid the bishops to give them redemption , a system that was patently absurd but suitated both sides .
This is exactly what the world has done in the case of cuts in agricultural subsidies under the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) .
Even after the trade treaty came in force in 1995 , the developed countries forming the richest trading block -- Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) -- have in reality not even reduced one dollar in their support to agriculture despite all kinds of figures being traded .
The WTO agreement on agriculture befooled the world , and it suited the rich countries as well as the developing country negotiators and business houses .
Climate Change agreement will merely repeat the WTO story .
I have little doubt about it .
What Hansen suggest therefore is a direct tax on fossil fuels as the only realistic way to achieve the necessary cuts .
Yes , he is absolutely right .
And this is almost what I have been asking .
If the climate change negotiators are willing to rise above the rhetoric of emission cuts what is need is to actually make annual cuts in international trade .
After all , how can the world aim to bring down greenhouse gas emissions when on the other it aims to push for increased international trade .
Trade does not happen on bullock carts .
It will need more burning of fossil fuels and thereby more greenhouse gas emissions .
A direct tax on fossil fuel will reduce the indiscriminate manner in which agricultural goods are being traded .
I do n't see any justification in importing Washington apples from America , while the US imports Chinese apples .
I do n't see any economic justification in importing oranges to India all the way from Chile , while the Indian oranges go rotting .
Food miles is what is adding on to global warming , and this unnecessary trade needs to be curbed .
All it does is to add on to GDP , and this is what the people do n't understand .
They think it is a sign of growth and development , whereas it leaves behind a trail of destruction to the environment and livelihoods .
This is happening because our economists and planners have managed to price the aircraft fuel in such a manner that it is actually cheaper than Coke .
All economic benefits of trade that are projected are therefore fundamentally flawed .
A correct price for fuel will therefore make a real difference .
We need to make an immediate correction to bring some sense to international trade , which otherwise will acerbate global warming .
A few weeks ago , Jack Black appeared at the MTV Video Music Awards dressed as Eddie Riggs , the character he voices in the new video game “ Brutal Legend ” where he introduced the nominees in the category of Best Rock Video and jokingly offered a prayer to “ dear Dark Lord , Satan ” asking him to grant the nominees continued success in the music industry .
Shockingly , the Religious Right does n’t see the humor but sees it , rather , as proof that Black and Hollywood are trying to lure kids into Satanism and warning that soon “ Satanists [ will be ] demanding and getting the same rights as any other religion ” :
The Lisbon Treaty , which came into full effect on December 1st , basically ended the national sovereignty for most European nations .
Most of the important decisions for the citizens of Europe will now be made by a small group of European elitists – many of them totally unelected .
But for the global elite , the consolidation of the EU is just one step towards a larger goal .
You see , the ultimate desire of these elitists is to merge regional alliances such as the EU into a world government .
In fact , in symbols used on official European coins , posters and artwork , the elite have sent us a message telling us exactly what they are planning to do to all of humanity – if anyone out there is willing to listen .
The picture at the top of this article is of a statue right outside EU headquarters in Brussels , Belgium .
It is a statue of the pagan goddess Europa riding a bull .
EU representatives openly acknowledge as much .
According to Greek tradition , Europa ( from which Europe takes it ’s name ) was a beautiful Phoenecian woman of high ranking who draws the attention of Zeus – the great Greek sky god .
Zeus becomes so enamored with Europa that he transforms himself into the most beautiful white bull that anyone has ever seen .
Europa spots this beautiful bull and climbs on top of it and suddenly the bull plunges into the sea and rapes her .
Zeus then takes Europa away to Crete where he finally reveals his true identity .
The following is a version of the story of the goddess Europa from the San Diego State University website …..
One night Europa had a dream .
In this dream two continents , which were in the forms of women were arguing over Europa .
Asia maintained that since Europa had been born in Asia she belonged to it .
The other continent , which was nameless , said that her birth was not important , that Zeus would give her to it .
It was early morning , disturbed by the dream Europa did not go back to sleep .
She summoned her companions , who were all daughters of nobility and of her age .
It was a beautiful day and they went off gathering flowers by the sea .
Zeus noticed this charming group , particularly Europa , who was the prettest [ sic ] of the maidens … Zeus appeared to the group as a white bull .
A white bull more beautiful then any other …
The bull laid down in front of Europa .
She slid on to its back .
Instantly , the bull charged off , plunging into the sea , and began to swim rapidly from the shore .
Europa saw that a procession had joined them , Nereids riding dolphins , Triton blowing his horn , even Poseidon .
From this she realized that the bull must be a god .
She pleaded with him to pity her .
Zeus spoke to her and explained his love .
He took her to Create , where he had been raised .
He promised that she would bear him many famous sons .
So what does all of this have to do with today ?
Well , you see , Zeus ( the bull ) is associated in the Scriptures with the true master of these elitists .
In Revelation 2:12 - 13 , we read the following ….
“ To the angel of the church in Pergamum write :
These are the words of him who has the sharp , double - edged sword .
I know where you live — where Satan has his throne . ”
So what was so special about Pergamum ?
That was where the Great Altar of Pergamum ( or Pergamon ) was .
Wikipedia tells us that following about this altar …..
The Great Altar of Pergamon , a massive stone podium about one hundred feet long and thirty - five feet high , was originally built in the 2nd century BC in the Ancient Greek city of Pergamon ( modern day Bergama in Turkey ) in north - western Anatolia , 25.74 kilometers ( 16 miles ) from the Aegean Sea .
The Great Altar of Pergamon has figured in lists of the Wonders of the World .
It has long been assumed that the magnificently - scaled and opulently decorated open - air altar ( it is not a temple ) was dedicated to Zeus .
You see , that is why in Revelation chapter 2 Jesus said that Satan ’s throne was there .
It was this gigantic altar of Zeus that He likely was referring to .
So by using this ancient legend as a symbol for the EU , the elitists are telling us that the plan of their master ( Zeus or Satan or Lucifer ) is to seduce Europe ( Europa ) and ultimately to dominate it .
We see this same legend promoted on coins , on posters and in artwork all throughout the EU .
Some examples are posted below …..
A 2 Euro coin was released in Greece that depicts a woman riding a beast …..
In 1996 , a 5 Euro Coin was released that depicted Europa riding the bull …..
To commemorate the second election of the European Parliament in 1984 , a stamp was released with this same symbology …..
A cover of Der Spiegel featured a picture of a woman riding a beast carrying the EU flag with the headline : “ Good Morning Europe ” …..
Here is a German phonecard made by the EU …..
Time Magazine published some artwork of a “ United Europe ” that featured Europa riding the beast …..
The photo below is a Europa statue in front of the Winston Churchill Building …..
Not only that , but other EU symbols send messages that have a very deep meaning .
According to tradition , Nimrod was the one who began the building of the Tower of Babel .
He also built the very first empire after Noah ’s flood and he tried to establish the very first world government .
With that in mind , check out the EU poster below .
This poster was the official poster promoting the EU Parliament before it was banned because of protests from numerous groups .
Note how clearly it connects the EU with the Tower of Babel …..
By using this symbology , the EU elitists were basically saying that they wanted to complete what Nimrod started – the building of a world government .
This ties in directly with the symbology of the woman riding a beast .
You see , not only does a woman riding a beast hearken back to the legend of Zeus and Europa , it also has a direct connection to the Bible .
In the book of Revelation we also read about a woman riding a beast .
In Revelation 17:3 it says this …..
Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert .
There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns .
That beast in the book of Revelation represents the world government led by the Antichrist .
By so prominently using the symbol of a woman riding the beast , the global elite are very clearly communicating that they are connected with this coming Beast system .
They know what the Bible says when they use symbols like this .
It seems like they are almost bragging about it .
You see , the elitists at the very top of the pyramid are hardcore Luciferians .
They also know that Antichrist is coming , and they plan to serve him .
They believe that they are actually going to win the end .
They have confidence in their “ god ” just as we have confidence in our God .
Satan has deceived himself into believing that he can win this thing in the end and he has deceived his followers into believing the same thing .
Such a thing seems inconceivable to Christians – but this is what hardcore Luciferians actually believe .
In fact , one thing that is common among the Luciferian global elite is a compulsion to tell us exactly what they are about to do .
In this case , they are very open about the fact that not only do they intend to deceive and subjugate Europe , but they intend to do the same to all of humanity .

I usually consider myself to be a bit of a tech head , but now and again something comes along which makes me realise how low I really rate on the universal scale of geekery .
The latest blow to my sense of nerdy self worth is SurfaceScapes , a project dreamt up by students at Carnegie Mellon University ’s Entertainment Technology Centre , which aims to create a proof - of - concept for playing tabletop role - playing games on Microsoft ’s Surface Table .
Basically , this provides players with a digital environment , which they can interact with using real objects ( such as painstakingly detailed miniatures ) , and also provides automated calculations and visual and audio feedback for actions performed by characters in the game .
If that takes your fancy , then watch the video and allow the nasal voiceover to explain things far better than I ever could .
So far , only Dungeons and Dragons is up and running on the prototype system , but fortunately for those whose proverbial boat is not floated by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson ’s magnum opus , the team say it could be expanded to other games in the future .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- President Barack Obama said Monday that his administration is doing " everything in our power " to protect Americans and that the government wo n't rest until it 's found all who were involved in an attempt to blow up a Detroit - bound airplane on Christmas Day .
" The American people should be assured that we are doing everything in our power to keep you and your family safe and secure during this busy holiday season , " Obama said in brief remarks to reporters in Hawaii , where he is vacationing with his family .
Obama 's remarks came after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano acknowledged that the U.S. air - security system failed when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was allowed to board the Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
" Our system did not work in this instance , " Napolitano said on NBC's " Today " show about the incident , a day after declaring that the system worked as it was supposed to .
Her remarks in that earlier interview were " taken out of context , " she said .
Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano .

Abdulmutallab , 23 , is in custody and faces federal charges in connection with allegedly hiding an explosive device on his body and trying to detonate it as a Northwest Airlines flight DAL , - 0.09 % approached Detroit .
The Associated Press , citing authorities , said the device instead burst into flames , and Abdulmutallab was subdued by passengers .
The plane landed safely .
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing , the AP reported .
Airline stocks traded broadly lower in the wake of the incident .
See more on the action in airline - sector shares .
Over the weekend , Obama ordered a review of the databases used to track terrorism suspects and keep them off of airplanes .
" I have ordered a thorough review , not only of how information related to the subject was handled , but of the overall watch list system and how it can be strengthened , " he said Monday .
Obama also demanded a review of screening policies , technologies and procedures related to air travel , he said .
" We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks , " said Obama .
Stewart Baker , former assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , said Obama 's review will find problems with the current system .
" But the bigger failure is one of design , " Baker said in an email .
" Our airline screening system is mostly focused on finding dangerous stuff [ and ] not dangerous people , and that approach is rapidly losing its effectiveness .
The president needs to ask for a review that allows his advisers to look at the second , bigger failure or we will simply be patching a threadbare suit . "
The Wall Street Journal reported that Harold Demuren , head of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority , said Abdulmutallab had paid cash on Dec. 16 for the $ 2,831 roundtrip ticket from Lagos , Nigeria , to Detroit via Amsterdam .
Demuren said Abdulmutallab's ticket came from a KLM office in Accra , Ghana .
The suspect checked in for his flight with only a small carry - on bag , the Journal reported .
On Sunday , Napolitano said , " One thing I 'd like to point out is that the system worked . "
But on Monday she said that that comment referenced the system of notifying other flights and law - enforcement officials on the ground quickly after the suspect tried to blow up the plane .
She said an extensive review of the system is underway per Obama 's instructions .
Rep. Bennie Thompson , chairman of House Homeland Security Committee , said the incident would be the focus of a hearing in January .
" The committee will get to the bottom of what did and did not happen with Mr. Abdulmutallab and what security precautions need to take place in the future , " said Thompson , D - Miss . , in a statement over the weekend .
Meanwhile , as 2010 approaches , more Americans believe that there will be another terrorist attack in the U.S. in the next year .
Seventy - nine percent of voters now think it 's likely that there will be another attack , up from 49 % who said the same thing at the end of August , according to a new Rasmussen Reports poll .

On the cusp of global greenhouse gas emission negotions which begin Monday in Copenhagen , the IPCC has issued a statement backing the science behind findings of climate change .
" ... IPCC WGI condemns the illegal act which led to private emails being posted on the Internet and firmly stands by the findings of the AR4 and by the community of researchers worldwide whose professional standards and careful scientific work over many years have provided the basis for these conclusions . "
The IPCC Working Group went on to say " ...
The body of evidence [ for climate change ] is the result of the careful and painstaking work of hundreds of scientists worldwide .
The internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community , including those individuals singled out in these email exchanges , many of whom have dedicated their time and effort to develop these findings in teams of Lead Authors within the production of the series of IPCC Assessment Reports during the past 20 years . "
While divisions between schools of thought on climate change have always existed , the emergence of climategate has given climate change skeptics fuel and presents a threat to the success of the Copenhagen negotiations .
The negotiations were already threatened by disagreement among world leaders on how to implement greenhouse gas emission controls , resulting in the coining of the moniker nopenhagen .
Skeptics claim that the Copenhagen conference is not much more than
There are two people who have been targeted by climategate , Professor Michael Mann who works at Penn State University in the United States , and Professor Phil Jones , who is based at the University of East Anglia .
Mann 's work , said Penn State in a Mann has responded to the leaking of emails " It 's an 11th hour smear campaign where they 've stolen personal e-mails from scientists , mined them for single words or phrases that can be taken out of context and misrepresent what scientists are saying . "
The controversy over climategate is now spilling over onto key environmental leaders , such as Al Gore .
Gore , who was to make a presentation on his new book , " ...
More interesting is what is not contained in the emails .
There is no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy , no mention of George Soros nefariously funding climate research , no grand plan to ‘ get rid of the MWP ’ , no admission that global warming is a hoax , no evidence of the falsifying of data , and no ‘ marching orders ’ from our socialist / communist / vegetarian overlords .
The truly paranoid will put this down to the hackers also being in on the plot though .
Instead , there is a peek into how scientists actually interact and the conflicts show that the community is a far cry from the monolith that is sometimes imagined .
People working constructively to improve joint publications ; scientists who are friendly and agree on many of the big picture issues , disagreeing at times about details and engaging in ‘ robust ’ discussions ; Scientists expressing frustration at the misrepresentation of their work in politicized arenas and complaining when media reports get it wrong ; Scientists resenting the time they have to take out of their research to deal with over - hyped nonsense .
None of this should be shocking ... "
Although the Copenhagen website does not refer to climategate , the latest news is that it is thought hackers from Russia were behind the release of the emails , with the implication that there was a sinister purpose behind the hack .
Professor Jean - Pascal van Ypersele , the Vice - Chairman of the IPCC told " This was not a job for amateurs . "
However , it is anticipated that some nations participating in the negotiations , such as Saudi Arabia , will use climategate to resist agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
The The IPCC was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 .
The rumours and speculation about climategate have brought the attention of the world to zero in on the Copenhagen climate change negotiations in a way that never would have happened three weeks ago .
In response to climategate , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , based in Geneva , Switzerland , has issued a statement assuring the world that the science behind IPCC conclusions on climate change is sound :
The IPCC Working Group went on to sayWhile divisions between schools of thought on climate change have always existed , the emergence of climategate has given climate change skeptics fuel and presents a threat to the success of the Copenhagen negotiations .

Skeptics claim that the Copenhagen conference is not much more than green washing Green washing normally refers to product or business promotions which claim the product / business is environmentally friendly , when this is not the fact .
Public opinion is now swinging against controlling greenhouse gas emissions , even going so far as to claim that science is at death 's door because of climategate .
There are two people who have been targeted by climategate , Professor Michael Mann who works at Penn State University in the United States , and Professor Phil Jones , who is based at the University of East Anglia .
Mann 's work , said Penn State in a release , underwent an investigation in 2005 - 2006 , which resulted in the finding that his methodology was sound .
Penn State is conducting a review into the matter , as is East Anglia .
Jones stepped down from his position while the investigation is conducted .
Both investigations are internal .
Mann has responded to the leaking of emails saying
The controversy over climategate is now spilling over onto key environmental leaders , such as Al Gore .
Gore , who was to make a presentation on his new book , Our Choice , at an appearance at the climate summit on December 16th , cancelled -- and not even the event organizers know why .
However , there are many who allege he has cancelled because of climategate .
Some 3,000 ticket - holders are affected by the cancellation .
There was no word if ticket holders would be reimbursed .
Some Hollywood glitteratti are now demanding that the two Oscars for An Inconvenient Truth be rescinded .
RealClimate , one of the websites which the illegally hacked emails were sent to , said , in part , Although the Copenhagen website does not refer to climategate , the latest news is that it is thought hackers from Russia were behind the release of the emails , with the implication that there was a sinister purpose behind the hack .

Shale development helped push total U.S. natural gas reserves higher last year even as production increased , according to the Energy Information Administration .
An EIA report yesterday charted U.S. proved reserves of oil and natural gas , a measure of what is recoverable from known reservoirs under current economic and operating conditions .
Proved natural gas reserves at the end of last year were 244.7 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , the highest level since EIA began reporting them in 1977 .
New discoveries outpaced production to provide a nearly 3 percent overall increase in reserves over the previous year .
Proved reserves of shale gas grew by 8.9 tcf to reach 32.8 tcf at year 's end , according to EIA .
" Today , increases in shale gas proved reserves reflect the industry 's rapidly maturing ability to apply two technologies to shale formations : horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing , " the report states .
And there is more to come , the report says , because development of the Marcellus Shale in the Northeast has only recently begun , and hence did not lead to substantial proved reserves increases last year .
Texas accounted for more than 70 percent of shale gas production last year , followed by Arkansas .
Production of shale gas last year , at slightly more than 2 tcf , was just slightly higher than production levels of another unconventional source , coalbed methane .
But discoveries of coalbed methane were below production , and total reserves fell slightly to 20.8 tcf .
Production of onshore conventional and tight gas in the lower 48 states was 13.9 tcf last year , and discoveries outpaced production , boosting proved reserves at year 's end to 169.9 tcf .
Oil
Turning to oil , the report shows that discoveries -- while increasing for the third consecutive year -- failed to outpace production .
Proved oil reserves at the end of 2008 were 19.1 billion barrels , compared to 21.3 billion barrels at the end of 2007 , a 10 percent drop .
Production was 1.7 billion barrels , and total discoveries were 1.1 billion barrels .
However , the report points out that much of the drop in proved reserves was due to so - called net revisions , which totaled 1.6 billion barrels of downward reserve estimates last year .
These revisions were based on changes in the price that companies use to estimate how much they can economically produce .
Current Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that operators use oil prices on the last trading day of the year to estimate proved reserves .
The report notes that in a volatile year like 2008 , this can have misleading effects .
Last year , the spot price for West Texas Intermediate was almost $ 100 per barrel at the beginning of the year , rose to more than $ 145 per barrel in July , then slid all the way to under $ 45 per barrel at year 's end .
New SEC reporting rules that will cover the 2009 and future reporting years are designed to make reserve estimates less vulnerable to the short - term price volatility , the report notes .
The new rules , if already in effect , would have yielded a smaller downward revision , or maybe even an increase , the report states .
" While the effect of the new methodology cannot be precisely estimated for past years , it seems certain that net revisions for 2008 would have been substantially less negative , or perhaps even positive , under the new reporting method , " it states .
" In any case , EIA 's 2009 proved reserves estimates will reflect operators ' reports based on the new regulations . "
its been suggested , maybe reddit can be used for that
What is it about politics that generates corrupt behaviour ?
Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian Prime Minister , is due to stand trial on 16 November to answer allegations of tax fraud and false accounting and then , just 11 days later , to explain the alleged payment of a £ 370,000 bribe to his British tax accountant , David Mills .
Signor Berlusconi would have to stand down if convicted , would n't he ?
Of course not .
This is politics .
He states : " If there is a conviction at trial , we would be confronted with such a subversion of the truth that I would all the more feel the duty to resist and stay at my post to defend democracy and the rule of law . "
Then there is former French president , Jacques Chirac , who has recently been ordered by an investigating judge to appear in court to answer charges of misuse of public funds dating back to his time as Mayor of Paris in the 1990s .
On Wednesday Mr Chirac declared he had " nothing to be ashamed of " and was ready to face trial for corruption .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Alain Juppé , the former prime minister and colleague of Mr Chirac , was tried some years ago on more or less the same grounds .
He was convicted and sentenced .
The court commented that it was regrettable that Mr Juppé , whose intellectual qualities were unanimously recognised , did not judge it appropriate to assume before the court his entire criminal responsibility and that he kept on denying established facts .
The fiddling of expenses by members of the House of Commons and the Lords is on a much smaller scale .
Nonetheless , some members of both Houses will probably be charged with criminal offences .
And the public 's broad view is that many MPs have in effect been stealing from the public purse .
Indeed , on a close reading of the facts , that is often the inescapable conclusion .
Or as Sir Christopher Kelly puts it in his report released earlier this week : " MPs have been able to misuse for personal gain an expenses regime which was intended simply to reimburse them for the additional costs necessarily incurred in performing their jobs . "
The explanation for the stink of dishonesty that pervades politics comes in three parts .
There is , first , the old adage that " power corrupts ; absolute power corrupts absolutely " .
This is because , once given responsibility for the conduct of the business of the state , it becomes easy to convince oneself that the needs of the state override all other considerations .
Illegal or unethical actions that might conceivably be excusable for short periods when the country is in great danger become a habit .
Indeed , politicians often persuade themselves that their own survival in office is itself in the interests of the state .
Gordon Brown , for instance , fills his speeches with boastful untruths , and in this he is no worse than his predecessors .
Second , politicians come to feel a powerful sense of entitlement .
This has been a major factor in the scandal of parliamentary expenses .
As one member of the public told Sir Christopher : " The root of the problem lies in one simple principle : the rules applied to MPs ' expenses are quite different to those applied to the taxpaying public . "
Many
MPs came to believe that they were in some fashion " owed " a lifestyle more luxurious or convenient than their bare parliamentary pay would provide .
MPs should be able to clean their moats , build themselves duck houses or create little property empires .
A coded expression of this sentiment is found in the argument that the strict rules proposed by Sir Christopher could have the effect of discouraging less wealthy people from becoming MPs .
To which Sir Christopher rightly said that this was a matter that had to be addressed through MP 's pay , not allowances .
Third , closed societies , such as the two Houses of Parliament themselves or , say , individual police forces , or members of certain specialised financial markets , can develop a form of institutional rot .
Once one or two members start to take advantages for themselves at the expense of those whom they are meant to serve , the malpractice quickly spreads and becomes viewed as normal – " everyone does it ! "
Then , when challenged from the outside , the members of the closed circle are incredulous and " do n't get it " .
This is why , as Sir Christopher notes in his report , " many MPs had failed to understand the urgent need for reform " .
Sir Christopher 's recommendations will undoubtedly do the job , but they are not the end of the matter , for the electorate has yet to give its judgment .
Many errant MPs will be booted out .
Only when this has happened can Parliament begin to regain the trust it has lost .

WASHINGTON — Malaria that is resistant to the best available drug is more widespread in Southeast Asia than previously reported , new research shows .
The worrisome finding poses a risk that travelers could carry this strain of the malaria parasite to other parts of the globe and unwittingly spread it , scientists reported Nov. 19 at a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene .
The frontline drug in question is called artemisinin , the most potent medication currently in use against malaria .
Signs of malarial resistance to artemisinin have surfaced over the past several years in Cambodia ( SN : 11/22/08 , p. 9 ) .
The new findings confirm that resistant malaria has now cropped up beyond a spot on the border of Thailand and Cambodia where it was initially detected .
Now it has appeared in Vietnam and in two spots along the Burma border with Thailand and China .
“ Things are changing .
There ’s no doubt the signs are concerning , ” said Robert Newman , director of the Global Malaria Programme at the World Health Organization in Geneva .
But he added that these signals are early and need further verification .
Patients in these areas take longer on average to overcome a malaria infection when given a standard combination of artemisinin and another antimalarial .
This lag results from slower clearance of the malaria parasites from the blood , said WHO ’s Pascal Ringwald , a medical officer who presented the update .
Patients who remain ill for longer stretches despite treatment need extra medication to recover from malaria and are also more likely to have severe or fatal cases , Ringwald said .
Malaria is caused by a single - celled parasite that infects the blood .
Symptoms include fever , headache , chills , anemia and a swollen spleen .
Of the more than 350 million people who come down with malaria worldwide each year , up to 1 million die .
Mosquitoes spread the parasite from person to person .
Malaria has a history of becoming resistant to drugs , and artemisinin now risks becoming the most recent addition to that list .
The new reports are disheartening to doctors because artemisinin normally packs a considerable wallop .
Although artemisinin is a short - acting drug that gets cleared from the body in a few hours , it makes the most of its time — driving down parasite levels dramatically .
Using artemisinin alone invites resistance .
So the standard therapy teams it with one of the longer - acting drugs , which perform mop - up duty on the remaining parasites , said Christopher King , a physician and epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland .
The new flashes of resistance may have arisen because combination treatment is n’t always available .
And since artemisinin can be bought over the counter in many parts of Asia , people seeking relief do n’t always follow the WHO guidelines of pairing artemisinin with another drug , King said .
Also , taking artemisinin for a fever that is n’t caused by malaria can allow resistant strains of the parasite to take hold , Newman said .
In the past , malaria ’s resistance to other drugs has been linked to specific genetic changes in the parasite .
The precise mechanism underlying resistance to artemisinin is still unsolved , King said .
Artemisinin is derived from extracts of the sweet wormwood bush .
The bush ’s leaves have been used as a folk remedy against fevers for roughly 2,000 years in Asia but fell out of use in the 20th century with the introduction of modern antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine .
During the Vietnam War , North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh appealed to China for traditional remedies for soldiers who had malaria .
Tea made from sweet wormwood leaves worked and ultimately became the basis for artemisinin drugs .
It ’s not clear whether parasites in Southeast Asia are the first to become resistant because they have had a long history with artemisinin , or if other factors are involved , Newman said .

Senators John Barrasso , Republican of Wyoming , and Jeff Bingaman , Democrat of New Mexico , have joined in introducing a bill that would establish awards for researchers who develop technologies that can economically extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stash it away .
In doing so , they are potentially upping the ante offered in 2007 by Richard Branson , the aviation and music magnate , for such an advance .
Various researchers studying the interface of climate and energy policy have said that such technology is well worth pursuing , particularly given that oil and other liquid fossil fuels are almost surely going to be burned — particularly in vehicles or other dispersed sources — for many years to come , according to many assessments .
The only way to retrieve the carbon dioxide produced this way is from the air , not tailpipes or smokestacks .
Others certainly disagree .
Nate Lewis , a Cal Tech professor focused on advancing solar technology , said this kind of option should be last in line .
When I sent him the senators ’ news release , this was his response :
It makes no sense to remove CO 2 from air when energy / electricity is not essentially fully decarbonized first ( i.e. , > 90 % and likely > 95 % ) .
Otherwise to generate the energy needed to capture the CO 2 from the air , one produces more CO 2 than is captured .
One way or the other , the huge scale , and cost , required to make a dent in the gigatons - per - year emissions of carbon dioxide this way ensures that any such approach is many years from being applied .
( One question is why the bill is focused only on permanent storage of the captured gas ; there are other proposals to harvest carbon dioxide and “ reprocess ” it , in a way , to create fuels . )
And there are plenty of heat - trapping emissions to capture in the meantime , particularly methane and soot , as well as cheap opportunities to avoid emissions altogether through improved energy efficiency .
But without also pursuing long - term options now , the thinking goes , the technical options may not be on hand once the low fruit is all picked .
Here is the news release :
Barrasso , Bingaman Introduce Bill
To Address Global Warming WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator John Barrasso , ( R - Wyo. ) and Senator Jeff Bingaman , ( D - N.M. ) , have introduced a bipartisan bill focusing on clean air technology .
The bill encourages technology that will remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequester it .
The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology Act , S.2744 , will establish an award system for scientists and researchers .
Historically , prizes have been used to spur all types of technological development to solve problems .
For example , Charles Lindbergh was competing for the Orteig Prize , when he flew in the Spirit of St. Louis , nonstop from New York to Paris in 1927 .
“ Our proposal takes a fresh look at climate change , ” Barrasso said .
“ We want to remove carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere .
The bill taps into American ingenuity and innovation .
It recognizes the need to develop the technological solutions needed to address climate change .
It makes sense that we explore alternative approaches for removing and permanently sequestering excess carbon dioxide .
With financial awards , we can encourage the extraordinary breakthroughs needed to tackle this problem . ”
Senator Barrasso introduced similar legislation last year .
The Carbon Dioxide Capture Technology
Act is a new , bi-partisan version of that legislation .
“ A bipartisan solution is needed to reduce carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere .
I commend Senator Bingaman ’s willingness to work across the aisle to find solutions . ”
Senator Bingaman is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , where the bill has been referred .
“ If we could capture carbon dioxide emitted by low - concentration sources , or even the atmosphere , it would be a major step toward a cleaner energy future , ” said Sen. Jeff Bingaman , chairman of the Senate Energy Committee .
“ A federal prize to inspire inventive solutions to this technical challenge could help us get there quicker .
That ’s why I ’m backing Senator Barrasso ’s bill . ”
The program would be established by a federal commission under the Department of Energy .
Commission members , appointed by the president , would be comprised of climate scientists , physicists , chemists , engineers , business managers and economists .
Awards will go to public and private entities that design technology to remove and permanently sequester carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere .
Once the technology is developed , the United States would share the intellectual property rights with the inventor .
After reading the release , Robert Mendelsohn , a economist at Yale studying climate and energy policy , sent this reaction : “ It is a great idea to tap American ingenuity .
However , the key to any competition is to determine the rules that will lead to the desired outcome .
We do not need technologies that can sequester carbon .
We need technologies that can do it cheaply .
The question is whether they will award higher prizes as the cost of the technology declines . ”

An Orange County man has been arrested and charged with bilking an elderly couple out of nearly $ 5 million in a phony gold mine scheme , federal prosecutors announced Monday .
John Arthur Walthall , 54 , of Laguna Beach was indicted in October on nine counts of wire fraud , money laundering and other charges for allegedly conning a couple in their 80s from Laguna Niguel into investing more than $ 4.7 million in a partnership to extract gold from old mines in the Imperial Valley , Nevada and Brazil .
He told the couple he had invested more than $ 3 million of his own money in more than a decade worth of researching the gold extraction process .
By investing in Advanced Recycling General Partners , Waltham told the couple they would receive a salary and get to approve expenses .
But prosecutors allege Walthall used the money for personal expenses , including alimony , child support payments , rent and an eHarmony.com account .
He also used the money to make a $ 10,000 payment to a film school for his son and to buy a hyperbaric oxygen chamber worth $ 60,000 .
FBI agents arrested Walthall last week at a friend 's home in La Habra , where he was staying .
They found $ 500,000 in gold coins under his bed and seized three vehicles he allegedly bought with the victims ' money : two Ford Excursions and a Ford 450 pickup truck .
If convicted on all charges , Walthall faces a maximum penalty of 150 years in federal prison , a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney 's office said .
He is being held without bond until Dec. 7 , when he is scheduled to be arraigned .

The origin of the mysterious Falkland Islands wolf , which was persecuted to extinction in the late 19th century , may finally have been solved – 175 years after Charles Darwin puzzled over the nature of this curious fox - like creature .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A DNA analysis of four stuffed museum specimens has revealed that the wolf did not , as previously thought , come to the Falklands as the pets of early South American natives who voyaged to the islands , but travelled there long before humans had populated the Americas .
The genetic study of tissue samples taken from the four stuffed specimens has revealed that they last shared a common ancestor more than 70,000 years ago , showing that the species must have come to the Falklands long before the end of the last ice age .
But even though the study has gone some way to clarifying the evolutionary origins of the Falklands wolf , the species still represents a great biogeographical conundrum because the Falklands have never been connected to the South American mainland and no other land mammals – not even small rodents – have managed to live there .
“ It is really strange that the only native mammal on an island would be a large canid .
There are no other native terrestrial mammals , not even a mouse , ” said Graham Slater of the University of California , Los Angeles , whose DNA analysis of the Falklands wolf is published in the journal Current Biology .
“ It ’s even stranger when you consider that the Falklands are 480 km [ 300 miles ] from the South American mainland .
The question is , how did they get there ? ”
When Darwin wrote about the wolf in 1834 during his travels on HMS Beagle , he noted how peculiar it was for such a large animal to be living on a remote archipelago .
He also commented on its unusually tame nature , which led others to speculate that the animals must be the descendents of escaped pets brought to the archipelago by natives .
The wolves grow to the size of coyotes or larges foxes , but are much stockier with thick , reddish fur and short muzzles , rather like grey wolves .
Little is known about their behaviour but they probably lived off nesting ground birds , seal pups , insects and other grubs .
The DNA study found that the closet living relative of the Falkland Islands wolf , Dusicyon australis , is the maned wolf , an unusually long - legged , fox - like canid that lives on the South American mainland .
But they last shared a common ancestor some 6 million years ago , Dr Slater said .
“ Canids do n’t show up in the South American fossil record until 2.5 million years ago , which means these lineages must have evolved in North America .
The problem is that there are no good fossils that can be assigned to the Falklands wolf lineages in North America , ” he said .
Another close relative of the Falklands wolf is likely to be a canid species , called Dusicyon avus , which lived in Patagonia but went exinct about 7,000 years ago , Dr Slater said .
The Falklands wolf quickly went extinct after Europeans arrived on the islands from the 17th century .
The last wolves are believed to have been killed in the 1870s by sheep farmers .
SALT LAKE CITY — Ben McAdams , a senior adviser for Salt Lake Mayor Ralph Becker , will become Utah 's newest state senator .
McAdams won on the first ballot , receiving more than 60 percent of the votes from the Democratic delegates from Senate District 2 at a special meeting Saturday .
He will complete the final year of Sen. Scott McCoy 's term .
He was one of four candidates vying for the post .
McAdams , 35 , said he had visited with most of the delegates over the past two weeks after McCoy announced in early December he was resigning from the Senate to focus on his law career .
He attributed the landslide win to that personal contact .
McAdams , who is married and the father of three children , told the delegates he would work for fairness and equality .
" I plan to be a visible ally for gay and transgendered Utahns , " he said .
" We are agents of change . "
He also told delegates he would fight against efforts to make Utah a dumping ground for nuclear waste , support education and support ethics reform .
" Our district has a legacy of sending strong voices to the Legislature , " he said .
" I will stand my ground as we work to achieve common ground . "
Other candidates vying for the post were Arlyn Bradshaw , Brian Moss and Mark Towner .
In my past five years of experience developing software , I 've come to the conclusion that a primary component of writing great software is managing risk effectively .
Risk ?
Suppose I want to bake a cake to take to a dinner party tomorrow night .
I could pick a recipe based on its deliciousness , but I review the ingredient list and instructions and equipment beforehand so that I wo n't have to stop in the middle and rush out and buy something I forgot , potentially ruining the cake .
I could base it on an ingredient I love , but Dave can't eat nuts .
I could choose a recipe beyond my skill level , but I might fail and have to choose between arriving empty handed or with a prepackaged dessert from the supermarket .
Yick .
Everyone makes similar judgments when writing software , even if we do so unconsciously .
Consider the risk of failure .
How do you know your program works ?
Me , I test software that matters .
If it 's a short program intended to explore an idea or a program I expect never to grow more than 30 lines , I might add debugging output or run a few manual tests .
Otherwise , I blatantly use testing to drive development , in design , implementation , and maintenance .
Testing ( and TDD ) not only allow me to build a suite of automated tests corresponding to expected behavior such that I can run those tests and verify that any change did or did not change expected behavior , the discipline of using testing to drive my development and design in the small changes the way I think .
Instead of thinking merely " This function has to return a particular type of value when it succeeds , " I think " What else can it return ? "
Because I write a test first , I think about how other people might call the function .
I think about how other people might abuse the function , on purpose or by accident .
Where possible , I make the API difficult to misuse .
When that 's not possible , I evaluate the risk of misuse -- its likelihood and consequences -- and consider the cost of preventing that misuse .
Perhaps TDD is n't the only way to do this .
It 's the most effective way I 've found , but it may not be the only way .
Even so , I believe that identifying and understanding the risk of failure will help novice programmers improve their skills .
The primacy of using an API over writing an API changes my state of mind .
It 's easier for me to consider these risks when I start from the question " How will people use this API ? " instead of " How do I implement this code ? "

So said Sir John Chilcot , chairman of the inquiry , in his opening statement .
He added that he was not there to determine the guilt or innocence of those responsible for the invasion of Iraq .
The object of the inquiry is simply to identify the lessons that should be learned from Iraq in order to help future UK governments who may face similar situations .
No doubt , Sir John 's inquiry will be both frank and impartial .
No doubt , where appropriate , some criticism will be made of politicians and officials alike .
But although these are worthy objectives , they fall scandalously short of the crucial issue which millions of people in this country - myself included - believe this inquiry should be about .
With respect to Sir John , there is really no point in holding a further inquiry unless it does apportion blame , unless it does hold to account those who led us into this unnecessary , unwinnable and costly war in Iraq .
The inquiry should be the first step in a judicial process that brings those responsible for the disasters of the Iraq war before the courts - and could , as I shall explain , ultimately result in Tony Blair being indicted for war crimes .
Already , the inquiry has provided us with devastating details of events in the run-up to Iraq .
Sir William Ehrman , former Director of Defence and Intelligence at the Foreign Office , told it this week that British spies reported ten days before the invasion that Iraq had ' disassembled ' what chemical weapons it had .
Yet Tony Blair nevertheless pressed ahead with the war .
Then came former Washington ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer 's claim that Tony Blair and George W. Bush had signed a secret deal ' in blood ' to topple Saddam Hussein almost a year before Iraq was invaded , and that officials found themselves scrabbling to find ' a smoking gun ' to justify going to war .
But , despite these compelling accounts of what happened , the truth is that we already know the main lessons of Iraq : Britain was taken unprepared into war on false grounds , and the inevitable result was the destruction of Iraq , enormous loss of life and continuing political turmoil in the Middle East .
Worse , the war has radicalised Muslim opinion against the West throughout the world , even spawning terrorism on the streets of London .
Evidence : Sir Christopher Meyer told the Iraq Inquiry that Blair and Bush signed a secret deal ' in blood ' to topple Saddam Hussein
Although it may be too early to assess the final cost of the war in human , political or economic terms , already the figures that have emerged are truly horrifying .
Over 100,000 Iraqi civilians and more than 4,500 soldiers from coalition forces have been killed during almost seven years of the occupation - and probably ten times that number have been injured .
Two million Iraqis have fled their country and another two million have been internally displaced .
Up to $ 3 trillion has been spent on the war by America - a staggering sum that is likely to have played a significant part in the collapse of the American banking system and helped create the present difficulties facing the world economy .
Today , so many destabilising political , economic and social issues remain in Iraq that despite victory having been declared , there is a serious danger the country will collapse into civil war when the American troops finally depart next year .
Added to all this is the effect on the war in Afghanistan .
War can never be an isolated act , and the West 's efforts in Afghanistan have been almost fatally damaged by the decision to concentrate on Iraq - with the resulting diversion of vital strategic resources .
If only a fraction of the military and economic resources that have been expended in Iraq over the past six years had been committed to Afghanistan in 2001 , the situation would certainly look very different today from the deeply worrying one that currently exists in that war - torn country .
Crucially , it would not have been possible for the Taliban to return to Afghanistan or mobilise the support of the Afghani people against the coalition forces by claiming that the West had failed to deliver its promise to rebuild the country .
As it is , the Taliban has been able to exploit the vacuum that was left when the West turned away - and we now have a situation which , at its worst , could spill over into Pakistan , raising the spectre of Al Qaeda gaining access to nuclear weapons .
Any military strategist will tell you it is never sensible to open a second front , as we did in Iraq , before completely defeating the enemy on the first front .
Domino effect : Pakistani soldiers outside a cave allegedly used by Taliban militants
As Blair walks off into our history books , without seemingly a scintilla of blame being attributed to him for his part in the Iraq war , no wonder there is such extreme fury and frustration with a political system that refuses to make him answer for his actions .
Recently , I heard an Oxford academic describe the Iraq war as ' stale cabbage ' , adding that the British people were no longer interested in how the Iraq war had come about .
But this dismissive attitude greatly underestimates the desire for justice that characterises most of us in this country .
Indeed , it is likely that much of the current anger over the issue of MPs ' expenses is actually an expression of deep disillusionment with the entire democratic process , which has been brought on by Blair 's decision to go to war against the clear will of the majority of the people .
Sadly , it was also a decision in which the majority of MPs , with a few honourable exceptions such as the late Robin Cook , were complicit .
For it is not just Blair who should be held to account .
In the run-up to the Iraq war , it is clear that MPs failed sufficiently to question the validity of the intelligence used by Blair to justify the war - choosing to believe what they were told and supinely accepting the conclusions of the infamous ' dodgy dossier ' which warned that Saddam could launch an attack on the West within 45 minutes .
During the debate on the dossier on September 24 , 2002 , they failed to challenge the Prime Minister even though it would have been a simple matter to determine whether the missiles that Saddam supposedly possessed were tactical or strategic weapons .
Tactical battlefield missiles - which are what they turned out to be - could only just reach the British sovereign base at Dhekelia in Cyprus , and they certainly did not constitute a strategic threat to the West as Blair claimed .
If one of my military students at the British Army Command and Staff College had produced such a sloppy and weak case for war as did Tony Blair before Parliament , I would have sacked him - for he would have revealed himself to be entirely without the strategic grasp or ruthless analytic quality that is necessary in any military leader , especially one in time of war .
Yet Blair 's misuse of intelligence in the run-up to war is but one of at least two vital issues where the Iraq inquiry should be seeking to determine whether he is guilty of deception .
First , the then Prime Minister clearly stated before the invasion that regime change would never be the reason for going to war - yet it is already beginning to emerge from the Iraq inquiry that this was almost certainly the real reason for invading Iraq .
On this issue , at least , it seems as if Blair misled Parliament and , indeed , the country .
Second , according to accepted international law of war , no country should go to war unless it is the action of last resort ; its actions are proportional to the threat ; and unless the end result is justified by the means used - in other words , that the situation in the country after the invasion will be an improvement , in human and security terms , on the original state of affairs .
Toppled : The Prime Minister had said before the invasion that regime change would never be the reason for going to war
The war in Iraq represents a clear breach of these three basic requirements : the UN believed there was no justification for going to war in March 2003 , as we had not reached the point of ' last resort ' ; there was no threat whatsoever from Iraq in the absence of chemical weapons ; and the woeful failure to commit proper resources to the post - war situation meant Iraq inevitably descended into a spiral of disorder , violence and chaos from which it has still not recovered .
Everyone - even a Prime Minister - must be presumed innocent until he is proven guilty .
However , it is not a sustainable defence for Blair to say that he felt he was doing the ' right thing ' when he committed this country to the invasion of Iraq , or that he was himself misled by the intelligence .
It is his obvious responsibility as the country 's leader to determine the validity and quality of the source of the intelligence before taking us to war .
And it seems more than probable , from the grotesque fiasco of the ' dodgy dossier ' , that Blair was quite happy to use any intelligence that suited his case - and ignore warnings about its quality .
Already , the inquiry seems to be confirming our worst fears about events leading up to the war against Iraq in 2003 .
Already , a prima facie case could be made that the invasion of Iraq was in significant breach of international law and might constitute a war crime .
Surely , if such a case does exist against Blair , then the people of this country could rightly demand that he be brought before a court of law .
The Chilcot Inquiry must not stop short of apportioning blame given the evidence building up against Blair .
In Britain , we have a good tradition of holding our leaders to account when they lead our country to disaster .
When Admiral John Byng lost the island of Minorca to the French in 1756 , he was shot by six Royal Marines as he knelt on the quarterdeck of HMS Monarch .
Subsequently , Voltaire claimed - probably correctly - that the British had done this to encourage other admirals never to repeat such mistakes .
When the British Army was defeated at Yorktown in 1781 at the end of the American War of Independence , the entire British Cabinet resigned .
George III , who had fervently supported the war , also tried to resign , but was not allowed to do so .
When Winston Churchill , who as First Sea Lord had been the main architect of the Empire 's Gallipoli campaign against the Turks , saw the scale of the disaster that happened there in 1915 , he immediately volunteered for the trenches in France - where , no doubt , he hoped to find death or redeem his honour .
In contrast , Blair today swans about the world making millions from business contracts and lectures .
And , to make matters still more distasteful , much of these earnings are only made possible because of the American and Middle Eastern contacts he made as a result of his unconditional support for Bush during the Iraq war .
In going to war , against the will of the people , Blair has gravely damaged democracy in this country .
Is it any surprise that only a minority of the voting public in Britain now turn out for general elections ?
That is why I believe that , if justice is to prevail , and faith in democracy is to be restored in this country , Tony Blair and those officials responsible for the disasters of the Iraq war should appear in a court of law which could lead to them being indicted for war crimes .
We owe this much at least to those many brave and courageous people who have died or been injured in Iraq as well as to their families .
As with the shooting of Admiral Byng , putting Blair before a court of law to answer for his actions would surely encourage future prime ministers not to wage costly and unnecessary wars in times to come .

It has been many weeks since the popular semi-private BitTorrent tracker Demonoid went offline .
The site 's owner claimed the downtime was due to hardware issues and warned of the loss of both torrents and user data .
Today , however , there is hope on the horizon , as Demonoid 's tracker is now up and running again .
Since Demonoid went down in September there has been a lot of speculation about what had caused it , and how long it would take for the site to recover .
As always , Demonoid staff kept quiet about the site ’s future and all its users could do is wait for a sign of life , which quietly arrived earlier today .
A few hours ago Demonoid ’s tracker started to respond again .
It appears that it ’s still hosted in Ukraine , and although the frontend of the site has n’t updated yet , this comeback might indicate that the site is preparing for a full return .
The current situation stirs memories of Demonoid ’s downtime back in 2007 .
At the time the tracker also returned before the site itself became accessible again , which took two more months .
Many Demonoid members are undoubtedly hoping that this chain of events will complete more quickly this time around .
Demonoid tracker is up and running
When the site returns , it ’s likely that members that joined the site more recently will have to sign up again , while others may have to resubmit their torrents .
“ A loss of some months worth of activity including registered users and torrent submissions is to be expected , ” Demonoid staff warned earlier .
The tracker ’s return in itself is already being welcomed by the thousands of users whose torrent clients are not supporting trackerless torrents .
Many of them might have been staring at several unfinished downloads for weeks , and now they are finally able to complete their downloads .
Nobel Peace Laureates : Urgent Action Needed On Climate Change
The 10TH world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates took place in Berlin last month .
It was in the context of the historical implications of the fall of the Berlin Wall , 20 years ago .
The Nobel Laureates called on the world to break down the national , international , personal , and institutional walls for a world with peace and justice .
In their ambitious proposal , the Nobel Peace Laureates urged world leaders to take down ; the walls that stand in the way of a nuclear - free world ; the walls that stand between the rich and the poor ; the walls between cultural , religious and ethnic communities ; the physical walls or barriers ; the walls that stand in the way of the crucial need to combat climate change , by ensuring the success of the upcoming Copenhagen conference in securing firm international commitment to effective global action , and by ensuring sustainable development that will enable mankind to live in harmony with the fragile global environment and with each other .
On the specific matter of the critical Copenhagen climate conference starting tomorrow , the Nobel Peace Laureates concluded their summit by the following powerful statement .
“ Climate change now poses an unacceptable risk of catastrophic and irreversible harm at a global scale , possibly even within the next decade , threatening global peace , human security and development , and putting the sustainability of human society in jeopardy .
Current negotiations are based on scientific information that is several years out - of - date .
The latest science indicate that , on the balance of probabilities , we have badly underestimated both the extent and speed of climate change , to the point that we now run a rapidly increasing risk of sudden failure of some part of the climatic system , possibly via tipping points which may prove irreversible .
Despite 20 years of negotiation , virtually nothing has been done so far to contain the problem , and there is no sign of that changing at the forthcoming Copenhagen meeting .
Excellent work is underway by concerned governments and organizations , but it is now clear that conventional processes will not deliver the speed and extent of change required to avert potentially catastrophic impacts .
New thinking is required to break through politics - as - usual .
We have run out of time to take a graduated response and we must now move to global emergency action .
This will require cooperation across the spectrum , involving civil society , public and private sectors , bipartisan political involvement , on an unprecedented scale .
As the world ’s poorest suffer most from but contribute least to climate change , and as we bear responsibility for future generations , climate justice must be a guiding principle .
Successful resolution of our climate and sustainability dilemma requires transformational change , not incrementalism .
It means almost complete de-carbonisation of the global economy by 2050 , a peaking of global emissions by 2015 and reduction of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere .
If an unsatisfactory compromise does materialize or no agreement is reach in Copenhagen , the danger is that the pressure for further change will evaporate , locking in potentially catastrophic outcomes as CO2 emissions continue to accelerate .
From a global peace and security perspective , let alone from moral and ethical considerations , that can not be allowed to happen . ”
The Nobel Peace Laureates summit took place before the so called “ climate - gate ” , which is a despicable effort to undermine the Copenhagen climate conference .
The forces behind this new wave of climate change deniers are obvious and have been exposed :
They are the government of Saudi Arabia , most Republicans in the US Congress and oil companies .
After the criminal neglect from the Bush administration on the issue , and despite his intention to act , President Obama will have to deal with the anti-science but powerful break represented by the deniers claiming that “ climate change is a hoax ” , GOP politicians in the back pocket of the oil companies and the populist mob supporting the like of Sarah Palin and chanting “ Drill , Baby Drill ” .
The time for all citizens of the world to act on this was yesterday .
But to prevent the certain climate nightmare that will be our tomorrow , we must act today .
You can do so by supporting and joining the action of organizations such as 350.org and Hopenhagen .

Scientists from the University of Zurich have discovered the physiological mechanisms in the brain that underlie broken promises .
Patterns of brain activity even enable predicting whether someone will break a promise .
The results of the study conducted by Dr. Thomas Baumgartner and Professor Ernst Fehr , both of the University of Zurich , and Professor Urs Fischbacher of the University of Konstanz , will be published in the journal Neuron on December 10 , 2009 .
The promise is one of the oldest human - specific behaviors promoting cooperation , trust , and partnership .
Although promises are generally not legally binding , they form the basis for a great many everyday social and economic exchange situations .
Promises , however , are not only kept , but also broken .
Material incentives to deceive are in fact ubiquitous in human society , and promises can thus also be misused in any social or economic exchange scenario in order to cheat one 's interaction partner .
Business people , politicians , diplomats , attorneys , and private persons do not always behave honestly , as recent financial scandals have dramatically demonstrated .
Despite the ubiquity of promises in human life , we know very little about the brain physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon .
In order to increase understanding in this area , neuroscientist Thomas Baumgartner ( University of Zurich ) and economists Ernst Fehr ( University of Zurich ) and Urs Fischbacher ( University of Konstanz ) carried out a social interaction experiment in a brain scanner where the breach of a promise led both to monetary benefits for the promise breaker and to monetary costs for the interaction partner .
The results of the study show that increased activity in areas of the brain playing an important role in processes of emotion and control accompany the breach of a promise .
This pattern of brain activity suggests that breaking a promise triggers an emotional conflict in the promise breaker due to the suppression of an honest response .
Furthermore , the most important finding of the study enabled the researchers to show that " perfidious " patterns of brain activity even allow the prediction of future behavior .
Indeed , experimental subjects who ultimately keep a promise and those who eventually break one act exactly the same at the time the promise is made -- both swear to keep their word .
Brain activity at this stage , however , often exposes the subsequent promise breakers .
Catching culprits
As neuroscientist Thomas Baumgartner elucidates , these findings indicate that brain activity measurements may already reveal malevolent intentions at a point in time prior to commitment of a dishonest or deceitful act .
" Such a finding thus permits the speculation that the measurement of brain activity could be applied in the ( distant ) future not only to catch culprits , but even beyond this perhaps to aid in the prevention of fraudulent and criminal intrigues -- a vision already made reality in the science fiction film ' Minority Report ' . "
" We 've discovered critical elements of the neuronal basis of broken promises , " economist Ernst Fehr explains .
" In light of the significance of promises in everyday , interpersonal cohabitation in society , these findings offer the prospect of being able to fathom and better understand the brain physiological basis of pro-social and especially of antisocial behavior in general . "
The IMF plans to sell more than 400 tonnes of gold
The price of gold has touched an all - time high after a large sale of the precious commodity by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to India .
Gold struck a high of $ 1,097.25 an ounce , against $ 1,084.50 late on Tuesday .
Buyers moved in after the IMF decision to sell 200 tonnes of gold to India 's central bank .
Gold and other commodity prices have surged recently as investors have moved away from the US dollar .
Spreading risk
The sale to India was nearly half the 403.3 tonnes of gold the IMF has targeted for sale over the coming years .
" The question now is , who buys the rest of the IMF gold ? "
Bart Melek at BMO Capital Markets said in a note to clients .
" We suspect it may be China , other Asian countries , Russia or even India again , as they hold relatively little gold relative to their very large foreign exchange reserves , and may want to diversify away from US dollars . "
The price of gold is typically strong in the October to December period because of the higher demand for jewellery in the run-up to Christmas and the Indian festival of Diwali .
The British grand prix , which it has recently been confirmed will be taking place at Silverstone , will go ahead on the same day as the World Cup final , Formula One organisers have confirmed .
There had been concerns that scheduling the race alongside such a major sporting event might lead to a decline in attendances .
The 2010 season will get under way in Bahrain , rather in Australia as has happened in the past , and the final race will take place in Brazil , as opposed to Abu Dhabi where the season ended this year .
There will be a first grand prix for South Korea too , where work is still taking place to complete the track .
Organisers have promised that the circuit , being built in the South Cholla province , will be ready by July in time for its October race .

Why Pakistan is winning ITS war against the Taliban
In Mingora , the city of 250,000 people that was until recently the headquarters of Pakistan ’s Swat valley Taliban , the shopping centre is heaving .
‘ Bloody Chowk ’ , the crossroads where the militants used to leave the butchered bodies of their victims every night , is once again merely a mini-roundabout , surrounded by camera and shoe shops .
Further up the valley , a scenically idyllic 100 - mile seam of fertility dividing the Northwest Frontier mountains , the girls ’ schools that were blown up by the Taliban are reopening , with lessons taking place in tents .
Success : Pakistani army soldiers with captured militants at Lower Dir in the Swat valley
The barbers ordered to stop shaving beards on pain of death are back in business , and Mullah FM , the radio station used by the Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah to broadcast his extremist sermons , is off the air .
Western leaders often insinuate that there is something half - hearted about Pakistan ’s struggle against those responsible not only for bringing terror to Swat but providing safe havens for the Taliban fighting in Afghanistan , to say nothing of the series of devastating bombings in the big Pakistani cities .
Last month , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that some in Pakistan ’s government must know the whereabouts of Al Qaeda leaders such as Osama Bin Laden , still said by some to be hiding in the frontier ’s tribal areas .
Gordon Brown has repeatedly urged the Pakistanis to ‘ do more ’ , claiming that three - quarters of terrorist plots in Britain have links to Pakistan .
Yet last week he also admitted that , across the Afghan border , some of the territory the British Army took at such terrible cost last summer is already back under Taliban control .
As I walked unmolested through the alleys of Mingora ’s bazaar , his comments provoked some uncomfortable thoughts .
First the good news : the Swat example shows that the Taliban are not invincible , and that it is possible to fight a counter - insurgency against them and win .
Unfortunately , however , the very reasons Pakistan appears to be doing quite well , both in Swat and in the current military operation further south in Waziristan , make the prospects of Nato success in Afghanistan more remote .
Moreover , one of the Pakistanis ’ evident strengths – a clear strategic focus with operations of limited scope that tackle the enemy one area at a time – is woefully lacking in Afghanistan .
‘ You have to recognise the limits of your power .
When you try to attain too many objectives simultaneously , you end up attaining nothing , ’ General Athar Abbas , the Pakistan army ’s chief spokesman , told me .
‘ If you do n’t have clarity from the beginning , especially about what to do after you capture somewhere , you will run into serious problems – and that is what ’s happening across the border .
‘ You have to retain your successes , and the only way to do that is with popular support . ’
Life in Mingora is n’t yet back to normal : the death and destruction have simply been too great .
Fazlullah used to be a chairlift operator and one of the first things the Taliban did was to blow up the Swat valley ’s ski facilities .
Skirmishes continue in outlying areas and there is still a curfew .
But the progress is unmistakable .
When I last visited Pakistan in June , at the height of the Swat campaign , there were more than two million internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) living on the scorching plains in camps and relatives ’ spare rooms .
But a remarkably efficient army - led transport and reconstruction effort has meant more than 95 per cent of them have been back home for weeks .
More impressive is the fact that despite having been IDPs , and in many cases having once been in favour of the Taliban , few Swat people appear to want them back .
‘ When Fazlullah started his broadcasts , he had a lot of support , ’ said Shiraz Khan , a local TV cameraman .
‘ Not now .
Their methods have been exposed . ’
One night , he said , he was woken by the shrieks of his next - door neighbour .
‘ The Taliban had come to her house and , in front of her and the rest of the family , they were murdering her oldest son and her husband by cutting their throats . ’
‘ When you see a dead body , its cut - off head lying on its chest , it ’s a truly terrible sight , ’ said a local professor , who asked not to be named .
‘ The people supported the Taliban because they felt the state was not giving them justice .
But now they are finished . ’
The army is still in Mingora , but responsibility for law and order is back with the police .
‘ The community is helping us with information , ’ said Qazi Farooq , the district chief .
He said that ‘ regular police work ’ had led to the capture of dozens of militants , 60 of whom have already been charged in the criminal courts with crimes including murder and blowing up bridges .
In the remoter areas , ‘ lashkars ’ – tribal militias – have been formed to root out the last Taliban .
If only the British Army had encountered similar reactions in Helmand , Afghanistan .
Last Friday , when I visited a new IDP centre established at a cricket ground in Dera Ismail Khan on the South Waziristan border , I heard the main reason why starkly expressed .
The IDPs there come from the same Pathan tribe , the Mehsuds , which is also the main source of the local Taliban .
But having been brutalised in a similar fashion to the people of Swat , several men told me they were ready to work with the army to ensure that its gains were maintained once they went home .
‘ The thing is this , ’ said Mohammed Qasar , a farmer from the district of Lada .
‘ If the army treat us well , we will co-exist with them , because ultimately we are Pakistanis .
The soldiers are our people , too . ’
And there , alas , is the rub .
The new counter - insurgency buzzword for Gordon Brown and Nato ’s commanding general in Afghanistan , Stanley McChrystal , is ‘ protecting the population ’ in order to consolidate gains .
But honorable as that intention may be , no Afghan Pathan will ever describe the British or US troops as ‘ our people ’ .
Whatever their avowed policy , Nato troops will always look like occupiers .
In Pakistan , the fact that the army is being deployed inside its own country is a possible source of weakness .
This imposes a delicacy that is often not appreciated : it is , in the words of one general , ‘ a pretty big deal ’ , and in order to rely on public support , it has had to wait until the Taliban ’s outrages have become manifest before launching operations .
But having got that backing , it has become a source of strength .
Meanwhile , General Abbas cited a further stupefying sign of Nato ’s apparent absence of strategic co-ordination .
In the name of the new ‘ protection ’ strategy , the US has this autumn been withdrawing from its posts on the Afghan side of the frontier , including those in Paktika , the province next to South Waziristan .
‘ It will create a vacuum , ’ he said , ‘ and if militants escape from Waziristan , what can we do ?
We cannot fire on them when they cross the border . ’
For years , Nato chiefs have accused Pakistan of failing to deal with the Taliban ’s safe havens in Pakistani territory .
Now , in one of the more bitter ironies of this ever - lengthening war , that role has been reversed .
CLEVELAND , Ohio —
Thirty - seven days passed between the time a woman told police Anthony Sowell choked and raped her in his house and when police went to Imperial Avenue to arrest him .
That time gap has raised the question -- among the crowds of neighbors gathered outside Sowell 's home , victims ' advocates and at least one city councilman -- if more could have been done to track Sowell , whom police charged Tuesday with five counts of aggravated murder for some of the people found dead at his home .
" I 'm not going to point fingers but at the end of the day , someone clearly dropped the ball , " Councilman Zack Reed said Tuesday .
Reed wants to hold hearings about how so many warning signs about Sowell -- from the foul odor coming from his house to calls to police about him -- were n't acted upon fast enough .
Police said they did all they could to bring Sowell to justice for the Sept. 22 attack , but were hampered by a victim who was difficult to track down and hesitant to meet with detectives .
Mayor Frank Jackson defended the work of the police .
" He believes the police did their job properly , " said Andrea Taylor , Jackson 's spokeswoman .
Sowell 's interactions with police and other safety forces underscore difficulty of striking a balance between the rights of criminals , victims and the general public .
Victims , some who distrusted police , are often reluctant to talk with detectives .
Deputies from the Cuyahoga County Sheriff 's Office made a surprise visit to Sowell on Sept. 22 in an effort to make sure he lived where he reported to authorities .
Sowell served 15 years in prison for rape and was classified as a sex offender , which required him to keep his address on file and check in with deputies quarterly .
Sowell was home when deputies arrived shortly before 9 a.m .
Reed wonders how deputies could have checked on Sowell but not smelled the decomposing bodies .
" Did they physically go to the house or walk up and say , ' Looks good , ' " Reed asked .
Deputies previously said Sowell opened the door but , as is standard for spot checks , they did not enter the house .
Later that evening , Sowell struck up a conversation with a woman and he offered to split his malt liquor with her , according to a police report .
She entered Sowell 's home and went to the second floor .
The woman told police that after drinking for a while , Sowell became upset , punched her in the face and began choking her with an extension cord .
He raped her and then she passed out , the woman said .
She got out of the home by promising Sowell she would bring him $ 50 and would not go to the police .
Then she called police and told them she had been attacked .
Detectives were assigned the case the next day and left messages with the woman .
They called her and then visited her home .
The woman 's mother told police her daughter was hard to reach .
A week passed , and she agreed to meet with detectives on Oct. 11 .
The woman did not show up for the interview and they later scheduled another interview .
The woman met with detectives Tuesday , Oct. 27 .
They obtained a search and arrest warrant the next day , records show .
Police discovered the bodies Thursday and Friday .
They had been to the house nine days earlier , but again nothing came of the case after the victim did not want to talk to police .
Trucks from the Fire Department and Emergency Medical Service were sent to Sowell 's home on Oct. 20 after neighbors called 9 - 1 - 1 and said they saw a naked woman fall or jump from a second - floor window .
EMS crews found the woman with cuts and scrapes .
Sowell came out of the home and told rescue workers they had been using cocaine and marijuana all day and the woman fell out of the window , Police Chief Michael McGrath said .
EMS took the woman to MetroHealth Medical Center and asked police to send a car to the home to investigate .
Police got there a few minutes later but no one was at the home , so the officer went to Metro .
That 's where the woman told police her fall out of the window was an accident and she was n't talking , McGrath said .

Spoilers Ahoy !:
The assumption is that everyone reading this review has seen Raiders of the Lost Ark .
The review discusses in frank detail things about the ending , so , if you have n't seen the film and do n't want its secrets spoiled , watch the movie before reading this review .
Despite what the DVD marketeers are currently claiming , the title of this movie was , is , and always shall be Raiders of the Lost Ark , not Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark .
There are times when revisionism can be taken too far , and this is one of those instances .
I do n't need all of my Indiana Jones titles next to each other in my DVD library .
I 'm perfectly capable of going to the " R " section for Raiders rather than having it alongside the sequels , Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade .
You have to love a movie that is so devilishly clever as to make the hero 's every effort , no matter how Herculean , irrelevant to the conclusion .
Had Dr. Jones elected to go on an extended vacation to Mozambique and never have anything to do with the Ark of the Covenant , nothing would have changed .
Jones does n't save the day .
In fact , he does n't come close to rescuing it , unless one considers his having failed as being the key to success .
( Although he does get the girl . )
Yes , the movie ends with melting faces , but , underneath all of that liquefying flesh and exploding heads , there 's an abundance of irony just waiting for the attentive movie - goer to unearth .
When was the last time that an action hero has been so utterly , completely inconsequential as Indiana Jones ?
But , in discussing the ending , I 'm getting ahead of myself .
Better , instead , to go back to the beginning .
Where that is , is anyone 's guess .
It could be back in the late ' 40s , when a young George Lucas was enthralled by the cliffhanger serials that would inspire this film .
It could be in 1975 , when Steven Spielberg made a little movie about a not - so - little shark and suddenly became a big name in Hollywood .
It could be in 1977 when Lucas ' Star Wars singlehandedly revived science fiction and solidified the concept of the summer blockbuster .
Or it could be later in that same year , when Lucas and Spielberg , while both vacationing in Hawaii , decided that they had to work together on a project .
That project would become Raiders of the Lost Ark .
Action movies were a different breed in the pre-1981 years than they are today , and one of the reasons for their transformation had to do with Raiders of the Lost Ark .
Before this movie , James Bond ruled the roost and the Bond formula was the accepted path that any self - respecting action movie would follow .
The first Indiana Jones outing changed that .
The film was constructed as a series of cliffhangers with narrow , death - defying escapes .
Not since the era of serials have audiences so often asked the question , " How 's he going to get out of this one ? "
It 's unfair to claim that the 007 outings were unexciting , but , compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark , they come across as sedate .
Raiders transformed the action movie landscape .
In the years that followed , nearly every action movie would try to generate the same sense of suspense and tension .
Even the Bond movies would catch on .
As played by Harrison Ford , Indiana Jones represents a different kind of action hero .
By hearkening back to the protagonist from those black - and - white serials , Lucas and Spielberg created the model for the future .
Jones is as close to an " everyman " as you 're likely to find in an action movie .
He 's tough , but not that tough ; he has women problems ; he wears natty , " lived - in " clothing ; he does n't drink martinis , regardless of whether they 're shaken or stirred ; he frequently gets bumped , beaten , and bruised ; and he does n't have biceps like a Mr. Universe .
One has to wonder if someone like John McClane ( Die Hard 's fly in the ointment ) could have existed if Ford had n't trailblazed this road .
Certainly , there would n't have been any Jack T. Colton ( Michael Douglas ' character in the best of the Raiders re-treads , Romancing the Stone ) or Rick O'Connell ( Brendan Fraser in The Mummy ) .
The film , which transpires in the late 1930s , opens with a wonderfully tense , pulp - inspired sequence inside a ruined temple as archeologist adventurer Indiana Jones seeks to avoid a number of pitfalls and traps on his way to recovering a priceless artifact .
Tarantulas , gaping pits , lethal spikes , arrows , and a huge rolling boulder are a few of the dangers he overcomes , only to lose possession of the statuette to his arch-rival , Rene Belloq ( Paul Freeman ) , once he emerges .
Indy escapes relatively unscathed , but returns home with his tail between his legs , disappointed at being unable to retrieve the prize .
His consolation , however , is that the U.S. government would like him to track down the Ark of the Covenant , and they are willing to pay handsomely for him to do so .
Indy 's journey in search of the Ark reunites him with an old flame , Marion Ravenwood ( Karen Allen ) , who holds a key piece of the puzzle necessary to pinpoint the artifact 's location .
Then it's on to Cairo , where he teams up with an old friend , Sallah ( John Rhys - Davies ) , who gives him information on the Nazi dig site , supervised by none other than Belloq .
It becomes a race between Indy and Belloq for the prize - a race that Indy wins before Belloq steals away the spoils , leaving Marion and him trapped in near - darkness surrounded by thousands of hissing snakes .
But Indy is n't finished , and , after escaping from Belloq 's trap , a chase ensues involving planes , trucks , ships , and a submarine .
In the end , the Nazis get the Ark , but learn that sometimes it 's better to lose than to win .
Certainly , Raiders of the Lost Ark is a breathless , white - knuckle experience of a movie .
It is also perfectly paced .
There 's enough time in between the frequent action scenes to provide the minimum of exposition and character development for us to understand what 's going on and to appreciate the relationships between the individuals who populate the screen .
There 's none of the frantic quick - cutting that has since become a staple of action movies ( thank you , editor Michael Kahn ! ) , and the production does not seem frenzied and out - of - control .
This is n't a case of cardboard figures running around in circles and blowing things up .
We care about Indy and Marion in ways that we rarely care about protagonists in this genre .
When Marion " dies , " it stings .
Which brings us to one of Raiders ' great strengths : the performances .
No Oscar nominations were awarded , but it's hard to imagine any group of actors doing a better job .
By the time Raiders of the Lost Ark was made , Harrison Ford had filed off the rough edges that were apparent in his first outing as Han Solo .
Ford is completely at home in Indy 's rough - and - tumble skin - a rogue , scoundrel , and mercenary with a heart of gold .
( Sound a little like his Star Wars alter ego , does n't it ? )
We know and like Indy from the start of the movie , primarily because he does n't seem like an indestructible superhero , does n't try to hide his many faults , and has a self - deprecating sense of humor .
A lot of that is Ford .
Then there 's his damsel - who 's - not - always - in - distress , Marion .
Sure , she screams from time - to - time , but she 's no wallflower .
The punch she delivers to Indy may be the hardest one thrown in the movie , and she 's no less gentle with the bad guys .
Karen
Allen plays the part with spirit and spunk , and the attraction between the two leads is palpable .
Marion is heads - and - shoulders above the other two women Indy flirted with , and her absence is one of the key missing ingredients from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade .
Here 's hoping she returns if there 's an Indiana Jones 4 , with just as much fire .
One of the great , underrated aspects of Raiders of the Lost Ark lies in the near - perfect casting of the supporting players .
Is there a better choice than the imposing , good - natured John Rhys - Davies as Sallah , Indy 's desert cohort ?
These days , Davies may be playing Gimli the dwarf , but this is the movie in which he first gained widespread international attention .
As Belloq , Paul Freeman is the cultured villain , cut from the mold of those who are used to getting their way but do n't like dirtying their lily - white hands .
The scene in which he and Indy engage in a verbal sparring match ( right after Marion 's supposed death ) is one of the movie 's highlights .
Ronald Lacey is deliciously creepy as the Nazi Toht , and he plays the part in full Peter Lorre form .
It 's impossible to forget the gag when he turns an apparent instrument of torture into a coat hanger .
Finally , other actors with minor parts include veteran Deholm Elliot as Indy 's mentor , Marcus Brody , and Alfred Molina as Indy 's companion on the temple heist .
One thing that makes Raiders of the Lost Ark so fresh is a sense of spontaneity , some of which is the result of on - set changes and ad - libs .
The action scenes were rigorously storyboarded and planned , but that was n't always the case with the less rigorous material .
One of Indy 's most frequently quoted lines , " It 's not the years , honey , it 's the mileage , " was added by Harrison Ford on the spot .
The famous shooting of the fearsome sword wielder in the Cairo bazaar was another last - minute change , replacing a lengthy fight sequence .
( That scene routinely got big laughs when the movie was played in theaters . )
Throughout filming of Raiders , Spielberg encouraged an atmosphere of collaboration and companionship , and it works to the film 's advantage .
Although there are plenty of special effects in the movie , Raiders of the Lost Ark was made in an era when stunt work was more critical than anything added in post production .
Ford did many of his own stunts , and ended up with the cuts and bruises to show for them ( not to mention a torn ACL ) .
The most intensive stunt sequence - the fight on the truck that ended up with Indy being dragged along the ground behind the vehicle - employed both the actor and his double , and remains a thrilling sequence because we recognize that this is n't the result of computer animation - it 's really happening .
For composer John Williams , who has long been favored by both Spielberg and Lucas , the chance to work on Raiders of the Lost Ark offered him an opportunity to collaborate with them both , and to add another memorable theme song to his list of credits .
In the five - year period from 1977 to 1982 , Williams created five of movie - dom 's most popular title tracks : Star Wars , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Superman , Raiders of the Lost Ark , and E.T .
The deserved popularity of Raiders of the Lost Ark resulted in a huge box office bonanza for Paramount Pictures .
This is the kind of movie that , even today , audiences immediately fall in love with .
It has all the right ingredients : a smart script , a likable hero , a dash of romance , more than a touch of comedy , and a lot of fast - paced action .
In 2003 , it 's a formula , but Spielberg and Lucas were the ones who established the recipe by using ingredients both old and new .
The two sequels are vastly inferior - Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is too ponderous and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is unforgivably fatuous .
Yet , because the first entry of the series leaves such an indelible imprint , the existence of lesser chapters to the Indiana Jones saga does nothing to dilute its impact .
Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie to be savored by viewers of all ages and all persuasions .

The government is ready to put evolution on the primary curriculum for the first time after years of lobbying by senior scientists .
The schools minister , Diana Johnson , has confirmed the plans will be included in a blueprint for a new curriculum to be published in the next few weeks .
It follows a letter signed by scientists and science educators calling on the government to make the change after draft versions of the new curriculum failed to mention evolution explicitly .
The open letter sent in July to Ed Balls , the children 's secretary , was signed by 25 leading figures from science and education , who urged the government to rewrite the curriculum before it was finalised .
Among the signatories were the Oxford University evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins , three Nobel laureates and Reverend Professor Michael Reiss , the professor of science education at the Institute of Education in London .
The letter expressed alarm that the theory of evolution through natural selection , which it describes as " one of the most important ideas underlying biological science " , was ignored in the revamped curriculum .
" We consider its inclusion vital , " the letter said .
In a letter to the British Humanist Association ( BHA ) , which has co-ordinated the campaign for evolution on the curriculum , Johnson confirmed it would be in the final draft .
Pupils will start with simple concepts of change , adaptation and natural selection illustrated by the evolution of fish to amphibians to mammals , for example .
Andrew Copson , director of education at the BHA , said : " Evolution is arguably the most important concept underlying the life sciences .
Providing children with an understanding of it an early age will help lay the foundations for a surer scientific understanding later on .
I congratulate the government for taking on board the contributions from so many supporters of science education . "
The government asked its primary school adviser , Sir Jim Rose , to overhaul the curriculum for four - to 11 - year - olds last year .
His report in the spring set out widespread reforms to the curriculum .
It recommended stripping away the 11 subjects primaries must cover by law , and replacing them with six " areas of learning " , including history , science and geography .
In the next few weeks , the results of the consultation on Rose 's plans will be published along with the government 's response .
Copson said the teaching of evolution was particularly important in the wake of a recent survey commissioned by the British Council , which found that 54 % of Britons agreed with the view that " evolutionary theories should be taught in science lessons in schools together with other possible perspectives , such as intelligent design and creationism " .
Johnson said : " Learning about evolution is an important part of science education , and pupils already learn about it at secondary school .
" The draft primary curriculum was designed to cover evolution as an implicit part of the new programme of learning for science and technology .
After a public consultation on the plans – which took in the views of parents , teachers , the public , subject experts and other interested parties – it is expected that evolution will be covered explicitly in the new primary curriculum .
The responses from the consultation will be published shortly . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Hooked on cocaine or cigarettes ?
The U.S. government wants drug companies to make a vaccine for that .

Convinced of the need for new and better treatments for addiction , the government is focusing its efforts on vaccine development as a new way to treat and possibly prevent addiction to a range of addictive substances .
“ It ’s a perspective that is very different from what we ’ve operated on in the past , ” Dr. Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse told reporters this week at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago .
Volkow said the agency intends to piggyback on the frenetic investment by drug companies in vaccine development , spurred by the need for new products and the runaway success of products like Merck ’s Gardasil vaccine to prevent the virus that causes cervical cancer .
“ There is an enormous amount of research and development in vaccines for cancers and a wide variety of disorders , ” she said .
“ We can take advantage of those developments . ”
But first Volkow has to tempt drug companies to develop the vaccines by funding costly clinical trials .
Earlier this month , her agency , part of the National Institutes of Health , awarded Nabi Biopharmaceuticals a $ 10 million grant -- the agency ’s largest ever -- for a late - stage clinical trial of Nabi ’s vaccine for nicotine addiction called NicVAX .
Volkow said she did her homework before backing the Nabi vaccine to ensure it was significantly different from other products .
“ Nonetheless , when you are investing in something at this level , it can be very risky , ” she said .
The vaccine is meant to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies against nicotine , blocking its rewarding effects and helping to prevent relapse in smokers trying to quit .
TOUGH MARKET
A similar anti-smoking vaccine by Cytos Biotechnology and Swiss drugmaker Novartis last week missed its main goal in a midstage study , leading some analysts to question whether it can make it to market .
“ They are still looking at it but it has been very problematic , ” said Robert Wasserman , director of investment research at the investment banking firm Dawson James in Florida .
“ Vaccines are really tough , ” he said .
“ It ’s not for the faint of heart . ”
Still , if it works , a nicotine vaccine could have a huge impact , Volkow said .
“ It ’s an international problem that kills 5 million individuals every year across the world , ” she said .
The global market for smoking cessation is expected to reach $ 4.6 billion by 2016 , and vaccines could account for $ 2 billion in sales , according to independent market research firm Datamonitor .
Volkow said the same methods for making a nicotine vaccine could be used for other illicit substances .
Her agency backed a study released this month of an anti-cocaine vaccine that helped block the high felt by 38 percent of addicts who took it .
The vaccine was developed by Dr. Thomas Kosten of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , who used a similar approach to make a nicotine vaccine now being tested in Europe by private equity firm Celtic Pharma .
Volkow said drumming up drug company interest in vaccines for illicit drugs is a harder sell because of liability concerns , and the fact that drug abusers are stigmatized .
“ Unfortunately , when it comes to treatments for drug addiction ... most of the investment goes to the government , ” she said .

The Wild has claimed Blackhawks forward and former Michigan standout Andrew Ebbett off waivers .
GM Chuck Fletcher and assistant GM Brent Flahr know him well from their days with Anaheim .
Ebbett is skilled but small .
Wild 's in a desperate situation with all the injuries .
After considering it , the Wild did n't put a claim in for Ebbett earlier this season when he was placed there by Anaheim .
More later .
At 8 am on Wednesday 7 October , a smartly dressed fiftysomething Filipino woman took the escalator to the first floor of the UN building in Bangkok and merged into a throng of diplomats , civil servants and environmentalists arriving for the eighth day of the ninth session of the global climate talks .
She was met with a few respectful nods .
Bernarditas de Castro Muller – " Ditas " to her chums – chatted to a journalist and a colleague , and then went to work in conference room 1 .
She spread her papers in front of her , stood up and began to belch fire , tearing the flesh off three Americans and chewing two Europeans .
After swallowing them whole , she sat back down .
She did n't , of course , but such is Bernarditas 's reputation as a " dragon woman " in the epic UN climate talks which should conclude next month in Copenhagen that if she had , no one ( least of all the US and British governments who seem to fear and loathe her ) would have been too surprised .
In the outwardly polite yet vicious world of UN climate change diplomacy , where negotiators use every trick to further national interests and where battles rage over commas , colons and semi-colons , Bernarditas is seen by most poor countries as a heroic defender of their rights .
But most rich countries paint her as a machiavellian , Soviet - style hardliner holding back an agreement to save the world .

Bernarditas is officially an environment adviser to the Filipino government , and lead negotiator and co-ordinator of the 130 developing countries in the umbrella group known as the G77 plus China .
She negotiates in what is called " the ad hoc working group on long - term co-operative action ( AWG - LCA ) process under the Bali action plan " .
In short , she represents the interests of nearly two - thirds of the poorest people of the world in the climate talks .
It 's her job – along with a few other G77 negotiators – to keep together the traditionally squabbling poor nations at least until the major power blocks like the US and EU inevitably split and outmanoeuvre them .
She must wrest the best possible financial deal for them by insisting that the rich countries commit to deep CO2 cuts .
She is a pivotal figure in the talks , a lightning rod for western distrust and for southern hopes .
But this sweaty Bangkok morning has started badly .
Manila , the capital of the Philippines , 1,000 miles east , is literally under water following back - to - back typhoons and floods , and in the last few days there have also been a tsunami in Samoa and an earthquake claiming over 1,000 lives in Sumatra .
Moreover , the climate talks on which UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has said " the future of this entire humanity " depends are deadlocked .
Environmentalists say the series of disasters should concentrate minds , but with just six full negotiating days before world leaders join the final conference of the parties in Copenhagen , the diplomats of 181 countries present in Bangkok have failed to agree on the big issues : what carbon cuts rich countries should make , how much money the poor should get to help them adapt to climate change , and where that money should come from .
A draft text has been hacked down by negotiators from 250 - odd pages to half that , leaving the UN bureaucracy optimistic – but everyone knows it has been painfully slow .
In these talks nobody moves until everybody moves , so most of the big issues will now only be resolved by politicians in late - night horse - trading sessions at very end of next month 's talks in Copenhagen .
But right now in Bangkok another matter is brewing that threatens to derail the negotiations and which illustrates the immense gulf that exists between rich and poor countries .
The UN's Kyoto protocol , which has been signed by 184 countries and commits all the word 's rich nations except the US to cut emissions , is the base of the present talks , but it has just come under massive attack .
The US negotiating team , led by the bearded former climate thinktank scientist Jonathan Pershing , is playing traditional hardball diplomacy , stating categorically that it will not join Kyoto .
There 's nothing new in US intransigence on climate change , but in a dramatic development , Europe and Australia have just sided for the first time publicly with the US , arguing that the Kyoto treaty should now be ditched in favour of a new one to get the Americans on board .
The poor , represented mostly by the G77 and China , are outraged .
Why should the whole world change , they ask , just to accommodate the US ?
This Bangkok meeting should have been spent negotiating how far rich countries were prepared to cut emissions after 2012 ; instead countries like India and China have been told they , too , must all come up with quantifiable plans to cut their emissions – something not agreed before – and the rich seem to be ducking their commitments .
If the climate talks are a game of diplomatic chess , the rich countries have just moved their white queen into the back row of the developing countries ' territory .
But have they underestimated the reaction this will get ?
Can the G77 and China now gain diplomatic advantage ?
Are the industrialised countries threatening the talks by wanting it all their own way ?
Or will their bold move lead to a genuinely global agreement ?
Bernarditas , who insists she does not represent the views of the G77 , is appalled .
For her , the US and EU are not just illegally abandoning an international treaty but they are now jeopardising the credibility of international law and the UN system itself .
She is contemptuous .
" Do the rich countries have any sense of life in the least - developed countries ? " she asks .
" I doubt it . "
" I say , are n't we all in this world together ?
Did n't we all sign this ? " she says to a small audience in the UN coffee bar that morning , brandishing a well - thumbed copy of the 20 - page Kyoto treaty .
She turns to page 7 where she has underlined paragraphs : " Look ! " she says , jabbing the text with her index finger .
" Article 4 .
It says ' shall ' .
That is legally binding .
There are obligations here .
The words are not there by chance .
And there 's the word ' fully ' .
We spent hours on that word .
We agreed on it .
Are they saying it no longer applies ?
These are very serious negotiations .
The Kyoto protocol is not a statement from a high - level meeting when they [ politicians ] go ' blah blah ' .
They are not bound by that .
Here they are bound .
It 's law !
Why do they now want to kill Kyoto ?
A new agreement means we will have to go through ratification all over again .
How long will that take ?
What if you do not ratify ?
What are we left with ?
If you throw this away … ?
Every word in it means something important because it binds us to legal obligations . "
To negotiate successfully at this level means you must understand your opponents and are able to argue all night .
Bernarditas does that , but friend and foe say she has a special advantage because she is not only a stickler for detail but she knows the UN climate change convention and the Kyoto protocol word for word .
And because her negotiating days go back to the Rio Earth summit in 1992 when the first climate change treaty was signed , woe betide any young pup of a rich country negotiator who strays from the precise words .
" She is the protector of the convention , " says a colleague ( in the world of diplomacy no one wants to be identified ) .
" I 'd hate to negotiate against her .
She reminds me of Humpty Dumpty when he said to Alice , ' When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less . ' "
A western friend , who also asks not to be named , says : " She is used by the G77 and China as the bad cop , the experienced negotiator past whom the inexperienced , naive and unsuspecting cannot pass .
She has an old style of Soviet negotiating .
She can go on for 45 minutes easily .
It 's a method .
It 's attrition .
Her start is from a stance of noncooperation .
Success is seen as how much the opposition gives in , and how much you can extract .
You have to start with something unbelievable and make concessions .
Even the Americans quake in fear of her .
She terrifies them . "
Bernaditas herself says : " Few people have dealt with the talks since the beginning [ like me ] and can still remember what we wrote .
The majority do n't see what we fought so hard for .
[ They say ] this or that sounds reasonable .
But I say that the words matter .
They do n't mean the same thing to everyone but they determine the levels of the relationship .
There are words that do not appear that we talk about for hours .
" I use their [ the rich countries ' ] language .
I spell it better .
I do n't make grammatical mistakes like they do .
It angers them .
I never get angry , I 'm not subservient , nor impressed .
They say , ' She can not be right , she 's only a woman and must be weak . ' "
" Clearly she is successful , " says a European observer .
" They would not employ her otherwise .
But it would please the annex 1 [ industrialised ] countries a lot if she were not there .
She is very dangerous to their interests .
She does n't hesitate to remind them all the time that they are in breach of their obligations .
They roll their eyes and say , ' There she goes again . ' "
" Actually , she 's really like my mum , " says a young Malaysian barrister .
" She is sweet but very authoritative . "
Bernarditas de Castro Muller is a grandmother who lives in Geneva with her Swiss economist husband and is known among her colleagues for her sense of humour and babysitting skills .
She has a house in Manila , and travels there regularly to see family , has lived in Kenya and worked as a full - time diplomat on just about every major global agreement on the environment of the last 20 years .
Now , when she is not negotiating climate , she travels the world teaching diplomats from other developing countries how to negotiate .
" I am only a housewife , actually , " she says .
" My husband does n't even trust me with the household budget .
My education was totally western and I have spent most of my life in Europe .
I am living in two worlds but I am at home in both .
I see poverty and how people must live in developing countries but I am fortunately not poor . "
Climate change is the most complex and satisfying of all the diplomacy she has done because it is science - based , it is about development , but mainly because there is so much at stake .
Get it right , she says , and the world has the chance to both halt catastrophic climate change and find a better path to develop .
Get it wrong and all the injustices and disadvantages that developing countries now face will be magnified 1,000 times in the coming years .
" Climate change is making the poor even more vulnerable and threatening to destroy their health and their homes , " she says .
She was persuaded to fight for climate justice when she went back to live in Manila after the downfall of President Marcos in the late 1980s .
" We happened to be chair of the G77 .
I listened to developing countries .
I saw so much disadvantage there .
The fact is they are very open and vulnerable .
[ It became clear ] that the rich countries are freely exploiting , stealing practically , their resources .
These countries do not have resources because they were so exploited in the past .
" I now see developing countries who have so little … they get peanuts .
They think if someone gives them anything they should be grateful .
[ But ] developed countries have taken on obligations to provide money .
This is not voluntary bilateral aid , or charity that we are negotiating from the annex 1 countries .
This is a commitment .
" When we were negotiating in the 1990s , all of us were caught up in environment and development .
We were full of ideals .
We said , ' Yes , we have to do something , because the world is getting lost . '
Now I tell the developing countries that I am not working for them but for their children 's children and what we will leave the world . "
Even seasoned diplomats find the talks surreal , with an arcane language , logic and a pace of their own .
In three years , they have gone well beyond being just about emission cuts and now embrace development , trade , finance , carbon markets , forestry , science and technology .
Because they are so complex , most nations belong to one or another of the negotiating blocs , like the G77 , the EU , the Alliance of small island states , or the African group .
Negotiators are mainly anonymous civil servants who have some freedom to set positions but can hide from their public , which is mostly denied access to the talks .
They admit to personal duels and tactical manoeuvres .
Phrases that might protect the world 's forests or condemn nuclear power may be there one day , but be removed the next , and no one can say why or who is responsible .
But as the talks have progressed , so the negotiators admit to becoming lost in their own verbiage .
There have been long debates over whether a comma , a colon or a semicolon should be used in the text ; arguments have raged about the meaning of " sustainable forest management " as opposed to " sustainable management of forests " ; and hours have been spent by nations debating the differences between " economic development " and " sustainable development " .
Now the talks have invented their own language .
There are Bingos ( business and industry non-governmental groups ) who discuss Mrvs ( measurable , reportable and verifiable ) , Namas ( nationally appropriate mitigation actions ) and Napas ( national adaptation programmes of action ) .
One important section is known as Redd ( reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation ) ; another is called Lulucf ( land-use , land - use change and forestry ) which probably only 50 people in the world half - understand .
Meanwhile , more than 100 " non-papers " have been issued which reflect nations ' points of view without being formal positions .
" It is easily the most complex piece of diplomacy ever devised , " says one British diplomat .
" A set of interlocking negotiations taking place on parallel tracks , ranging from aviation to trade and forests to adaptation , finance and science .
It 's quite possible it will all collapse under its own weight .
" There are many people who try to keep the language incomprehensible .
There 's a relationship between power and transparency – it's about keeping people out .
The only people who really understand the lingo are the people who wrote it .
It needs another industry of people to translate the words so they can be understood .
I remember my first experience in the negotiations .
I concluded after 25 minutes that I was in a madhouse .
It was one of the most professionally disconcerting experiences of my life , " he says .
He recalls seeing Bernarditas in action for the first time : " There was what was called the Gang of Four – Bernarditas , a Chinese negotiator we called Professor No because he said no to everything , an Indian and a Saudi .
They acted as the ' they shall not pass ' group .
Bernarditas was scary .
You could imagine her as one of the Gang of Four in the Chinese upheavals .
She and Professor
No were fighting a 1960s ideological war in which the rich were trying to screw the poor and vice versa . "
Several weeks later , this point was put to Bernarditas .
" What do they mean by ideological war ? " she thundered .
" What are they saying ?
They should specify .
What do they not like ?
What do they mean by 1960s ideology ?
Fidel [ Castro ] ?
The opening up of traditions ?
Opposition to the colonial mentality ?
They have to specify what !
No , I do n't live up to their prejudices of what is a third - world woman , that 's what they do n't like about me .
" But if they mean 1960s ideology in the sense of keeping economic gains , yes .
They just do not accept they have historical responsibility .
It 's like I burn down your house and you become rich but now they say you can pay for it yourself .
Well , you might be rich , but your brothers and sisters also lost their houses .
Are you free from responsibility because one member of your family becomes rich ? "
She says the dice are loaded against the poor .
Africa is experiencing climate change faster and deeper than almost anywhere else , and could be devastated within 30 years , yet its 55 countries have been offered no money by the rich to adapt and can afford to bring only 145 official delegates between them to Bangkok – just 8 % of the total .
Europe , however , has more than 450 delegates , with the UK , Denmark and US numbering 142 between them .
At least 50 countries have only one or two , but the WWF , a western conservation group , has a team of 50 to lobby , observe and advise delegations , as well as to brief the press .
In comparison with the EU or the US , the G77 has no offices , no permanent staff and no budget to meet in advance of conferences .
Moreover , while delegates from poor countries must grasp highly complex technical issues in their second or even third languages , big country delegations may bring legal advisers , interpreters and business consultants for each area of the talks , with many more experts held in reserve .
The US or Japan may fly in people to advise them on the precise wording of a single paragraph , and as the talks reach their climax , rich countries will have whole teams of people to take it in turns to be on the frontline of the negotiations , staying fresh while their less well resourced opponents are exhausted .
" Most developing countries do n't have enough people , they do n't even understand the text .
They are exhausted after a few days and cannot even get to the meetings , " says Meena Rahman from Third World Network , an NGO based in Geneva which has followed the talks for years .
" They complain that they are marginalised , but there is nothing they can do .
All the negotiations are in English and some just do not understand what is going on .
It 's accepted as a fact of life in the negotiations . "
From a poor country 's perspective , it is easy to suspect institutional bias .
The executive secretary of the talks is Yvo de Boer , a Dutch diplomat , who himself has succeeded another Dutchman .
His deputy is Canadian , and many of the senior secretariat and core groups are staffed by middle - aged white men .
The media at the talks is mostly western and the language throughout is English .
" Of course we complain all the time , " says an African diplomat .
" If you control the process , you control the discussion and the texts .
That 's how you manipulate the outcome .
It 's very easy really . "
Is this a sensible or fair way to go about re-ordering the world 's economies to counter something as important as climate change ?
" No , " says an exhausted Swedish diplomat in Bangkok .
" It 's quite mad . "
As the talks conclude , the tactics get dirtier and the road to Copenhagen becomes increasingly ugly .
Earlier this year , says Bernarditas , word was dropped by a British diplomat in a meeting with non-government groups that she was appearing overfriendly with the Saudi Arabian delegation because she had possibly accepted a house from them .
The veiled accusation of bribery sped along the diplomatic grapevine .
" It was outrageous , " says Bernarditas .
" I could not believe this . "
But while she suspected a crude attempt to smear her , she was unable to prove anything and last week the head of the UK negotiations , Jan Thompson , said categorically that no official complaint had been received .
" It 's quite inconceivable .
Bernarditas does not even need the money .
She is incorruptible .
That 's why they hate her , " says one of her colleagues .
" But she and the Saudis no longer sit near each other for fear that the rumours are restarted . "
" It 's an idiot putting that about .
It will backfire .
God , how stupid can you get ! " said a British observer .
" It 's below the belt … we should not think the Brits are immune [ from these tactics ] . "
Bernarditas herself stays aloof .
" Each one is looking for the weakness of the other .
It 's very vicious .
But there are big commercial interests at stake .
They exploit the weaknesses of people and exacerbate the differences between countries .
It 's part of the game , " she says .
So , too , is the rhetoric now being employed by leaders of rich countries in the last crucial weeks before Copenhagen .
In meeting after meeting , presidents and prime ministers have used apocalyptic language to insist that the future of the world is at stake and everyone must play their part .
It plays well in the north , but in many developing countries it rings hollow , where it is seen as a precursor to blaming the poor if no deal is struck .
The rhetoric is reciprocated with the poor : " Developed countries have overconsumed their share of the atmospheric space – they ate the pizza and left us the crumbs , " said ambassador Anjelica Navarro of Bolivia .
" They have a historical debt – a historical responsibility .
We want our atmosphere back , how you do that , developed countries , is your problem . "
In a few weeks ' time the talks will reconvene possibly for the last time in Copenhagen under the glare of the world 's media and with the extra ingredient of high emotion brought by thousands of environment , human rights and development groups from around the world .
But in diplomatic terms , the real talks are nearly over , having taken place behind closed doors between fewer and fewer countries .
In the last month , there have been high - level meetings in London , Beijing , Delhi and Washington , with the US , Europe , Japan and the EU all trying to work out their position and agree what offer they are prepared to make .
" They are now working together to split the developing countries , in order to weaken their political positions and isolate them before they make them offers and get their way , " says Rahman .
The way this is being done , she says , is via those countries who are most vulnerable to climate change .
The British in particular have worked with the Maldives to form a new grouping , known as the " group of vulnerable countries " , a set of small island states and least developed countries who stand to disappear beneath the waves or be most affected by drought and flood .
Next week , Bangladesh , Kenya and others will meet with British financial help in the Maldives , with rich countries invited to attend .
" They can expect tempting sweeteners to break away from the G77 , and threats if they do not play ball , " says Meena Rahman , who is also a former chair of Friends Of The Earth International .
" It looks brilliant in PR terms .
It looks like the British are helping the weakest but they are really peeling off the poorest and weakening Kyoto and the treaty . "
Robin Gwynn , UK special envoy for vulnerable countries , insists this is far too cynical a view , saying no country has done more than Britain to give the poor a real voice in the talks .
" The effort has been very genuine .
The moral case must be made to ensure a global deal . "
But another diplomat sees the tactical advantage in working with the poorest .
" If you can convince the most vulnerable countries that there is a serious funding offer on the table , then you can open up another front which helps a lot of third - party things .
Tactics ?
It 's never thought out before , it 's always [ negotiations ] by the seat of the pants .
There are too many events to react to .
It 's always chaotic .
It 's a weird game . "
In the end , exhausted ministers from the three great power blocks , the US , the EU and China , will probably make a deal of sorts between themselves in the small hours of 17 December in Copenhagen .
By then , the world 's really poor countries will have long been diplomatically blown away from the negotiations with promises of cash soon and greater reward later .
The G77 and its negotiators like Bernarditas will congratulate themselves for obtaining the best possible deal in the circumstances and the rich countries will insist the world is on a new , cleaner , greener development path .
There will be something for everyone because everyone wants something , and the politicians will be able to go home waving a communiqué that commits countries and industries to taking action to reduce emissions .
Whether it is anywhere like enough , fast enough , to prevent a climate catastrophe , or is just or equitable , is another matter .
Because in western diplomatic terms , if there is not complete failure , then there can be one of only two outcomes to these climate talks .
Copenhagen must be either a success or a great success .
It may clearly be a fudge , or even a cop-out , but for the politicians who must sell it back home , nothing else in the world can be countenanced .

Kristina Keneally , who will become the first female Premier of NSW after ousting Nathan Rees in a leadership challenge , says that her victory is " an opportunity for a new beginning " .
But in her first press conference as premier - elect tonight , Ms Keneally ruled out a return to Cabinet for Joe Tripodi .
She said the door was open for Frank Sartor to return , and that she would be discussing with Mr Rees a future in the government .
Ms Keneally thanked Mr Rees for his hard work and acknowledged that he had had a tough job .
" Today is an opportunity for a new beginning and a time for healing , " she said .
As a working mother , Ms Keneally said that she was familiar with the issues that all " working mums " faced .
Digital memory is getting smaller and smaller ( Image : Chung Sung - Jun / Getty )
Editorial : Writ small , huge recall
Once upon a time , not so long ago , the idea that you might store your entire music collection on a single hand - held device would have been greeted with disbelief .
Ditto backing up all your essential computer files using a memory stick key ring , or storing thousands of high - resolution holiday snaps in one pocket - sized camera .
What a difference a decade makes .
The impossible has become possible thanks to the lightning rise of a memory technology with the snazzy name of “ flash ” .
So where is the technology that can store our high - definition home cinema collection on a single chip ?
Or every book we would ever want to read or refer to ?
Flash ca n’t do that .
In labs across the world , though , an impressive array of technologies is lining up that could make such dreams achievable .
These “ supermemories ” are close to realising a vision set out by revered physicist Richard Feynman 50 years ago this month .
In a lecture to the American Physical Society entitled “ There ’s plenty of room at the bottom ” , he asked whether it might ever be possible to write all 24 volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on a pin head .
Each tiny ink dot used to print each letter would have to be reduced to the size of just 1000 atoms , he calculated – a square with sides of just 9 nanometres .
Feynman speculated that people looking back from the year 2000 would wonder why it took till 1960 before we began to explore this “ room at the bottom ” – what we now know as …
Following on from Keith 's PS3 festive top 10 comes the Xbox 360 list .
Remember these are suggestions on what to buy this Christmas so the list is mainly focused on recent - ish releases .
Anyway , let 's go .
In no particular order these are the Gamesblog Top 10 Xbox 360 games to buy this Christmas ...
Fifa 10 / PES 2010
Ah , the great football game debate .
I really could n't choose between them and which ever one you decide on your footy - loving 360 owner should be happy .
Having said that there are some differences .
Fifa is slower , more methodical and more realistic .
It also has all the right teams and players , even if the likenesses are still scarily off at times .
PES has better player likenesses and animations but more importantly plays a faster more fluid game on the pitch .
Fifa has more online options , PES has more exciting goalmouth scrambles .
I 'd still go with PES if I really had to choose but this one is too close to call .
Dragon Age : Origins
Again , this was on Keith 's PS3 list but it 's too good for 360 owners to miss out on .
This is an epic role - playing game that will appeal to patient gamers who want to get their teeth into something a little meatier than the normal shoot n' sport titles .
Patience is key though – Dragon
Age takes an , er , age to get going .
With a text overload and occasionally ugly visuals Dragon Age may not seem an instant winner on Christmas Day .
But give it a chance to get going – around 5 - 10 hours (! ) - and you 're likely get hooked and still be playing on New Years Day and beyond .
Forza Motorsport 3
One for the dads and uncles this .
Forza is a serious motor sim that lets you fiddle with engines and tweak just about everything a petrolhead would want .
The action is almost RPG like at times , with upgrades aplenty and even if you do n't want to paint or tune your car there is always a reward waiting just around the corner .
It looks fabulous too , while there are a host of excellent online features .
Probably one for the boys this , but for the motor sport lover there is no better game on the 360 .
Modern Warfare 2
The best selling game of the year and a must if you play online .
Be warned though , beginners should prepare for a frustrating learning curve as better equipped foes – usually teenagers with time , and you , to kill – constantly take you down .
Luckily then the advancement path is so finely honed that it is n't long until you are gaining both ranks and respect .
If this sounds like too much hard work then the single - player story is hugely entertaining – albeit relatively brief - on its own .
Such a shame about the airport level though .
And just when I thought gaming had got over its teenage growth pains too .
Xbox Live Subscription
Yes , it costs £ 40 - odd pounds for a year and yes the PS3 and Wii are free to play online .
But Live is streets ahead of them – although PS3 is catching up relatively quickly – and now offers Facebook , Twitter and live Sky TV content as well as a stack of downloadable games .
But it is the online play elements which really make this worth the cash .
Friends lists , cross - game chat , 1vs100 ( see below ) .
An offline 360 is only half a console .
Gyromancer
And if you do get online then this is one of the best new releases you can download .
Like the excellent Puzzle Quest before it , Gyromancer mixes " match 3 " gameplay – think Bejeweled – with a hefty slab of role - playing ( RPG ) depth .
This gives both context – there 's a typically hokum story – and strategy to the puzzling .
As you 'd expect of a game created by Popcap and Square Enix this a lovely polished game that will suck away those post - Christmas lunch hours .
Assassins Creed 2
The setting – renaissance Italy – makes this worth a look alone .
Luckily the game lives up to the premise .
It takes a while to get going though .
The controls – especially the combat – are occasionally clunky .
But give it an hour and you 're be sucked in by the roof leaping action and glorious visuals .
Again , probably not one for all the family but if you can wrest the TV free from kids / grans / Only Fools reruns then you 'll be hooked .
Left for Dead 2
Not one for the kids but this is an hilariously over - the - top online zombie - fest .
Again , like most 360 games , it really comes alive online as you team up with friends to chainsaw your undead – or living , depending on which side you take – assailants .
This sequel adds new weapons and levels but is not a huge advance on the original .
That aside any 360 owner will appreciate the surprisingly deep action and probably bore you senseless with their war stories after .
Borderlands
Again online online play is key here .
Grab some friends , create your character – disappointingly restricted to 4 preset templates – and hit the borderlands .
The action goes like this .
Get quest , shoot stuff , get new gun , cash in quest and repeat .
Tedious in singleplayer Borderlands comes alive with friends .
A confusing interface and repetitive action let things down but in short bursts this is fantastic .
1 vs 100
It 's a live quiz show on your Xbox that lets you compete against thousands of other players at the same time .
What could go wrong ?
Nothing really .
Ok , to actually win a prize involves luck , guesswork and worryingly quick reflexes .
But 1vs100 cleverly lets you compete against your friends too , which gives you an incentive to play on even if the prizes are seemingly unobtainable .
Again , you 'll need a Xbox Live subscription but this is perfect for all the family on Christmas Day .
What do you think then ?
Any other recent 360 game that deserves a mention or need adding to the Christmas list ?
You 've trained hard .
You 've worked on your moves and perfected your strut .
You 've got your gimmick down and you 're ready to thrill audiences all around the world ( or all around your backyard ) with your amazing array of death - defying moves .
But something 's missing .
You just do n't have that capper .
You do n't have a devastating finishing maneuver that will obliterate your opponent and bring the crowd to their feet .
In wrestling , captivating and brutal finishing maneuvers are a must .
Without them , an oiled - up man in tights is just …well , an oiled - up man in tights .
Like with most elements of athleticism , wrestling has evolved over time .
Long gone are the days of Ed " Strangler " Lewis making his opponent give up after holding him in a side - headlock for twenty minutes straight .
Now guys will practically kill themselves leaping off the top turnbuckle and performing flips and twists that you 'd only expect from Olympic gymnasts and divers .
A finisher can take many different forms .
It can be as simple as a knockout kick or punch , or as hokey and elaborate as TNA wrestler Suicide 's " Suicide Solution " which can be technically described as a pump - handle reverse flip over rocker dropper .
Sometimes a finisher can help define a wrestler and become that certain " X Factor " that really helps them achieve stardom .
Other times , a truly exceptional wrestler can take a basic move and turn it into an iconic trademark of badassery .
An important thing to note here and a crucial part of any finisher is its ability to end the match .
No one should be able to kick out of a finishing move , unless that wrestler happens to be way above the other guy in terms of their company 's star - o- meter .
When two Main Event - level wrestlers go nose to nose , it 's likely that you 'll see them kick out of each other 's finisher to create more drama .
On the independent circuit , however , and organizations like ROH , it 's very common to see wrestlers kick out of two or three " finishing " moves before the match actually concludes .
There are tons of basic , blueprint maneuvers out there , and even more variations on those maneuvers .
Springboard corkscrew tornado DDTs .
Inverted reverse sit - out piledrivers .
Hyper gonzo weasel bombs that result in explosive diarrhea .
In markets where pure athletic spectacle is the name of the game , finishing maneuvers can get quite dizzying .
Join us as we break down the 25 greatest and most effective finishing moves in wrestling .
From Rock Bottoms to Figure Fours !
It 's all over but the screaming …
Honorable Mention : GRAVEYARD SMASH
Alright , first off we just want to give a honorable shout - out to Hallowicked 's Graveyard Smash !
It 's one of the coolest moves around and it's essentially a variation of a sit - out driver ( D - Lo Brown / Tommy Dreamer 's " Sky High , " Lance Cade 's " Redneck Bomb " ) .
Except in this case , it 's starts out as a Fisherman 's Suplex ( suplex with one leg hooked ) .
Hallowicked has been a staple on the low - tier wrestling scene for years , competing in CHIKARA and Full Impact Pro .
He 'll most likely never cross paths with your TV screen , but it does n't stop his finishing move to be complicated enough to be interesting , and damaging enough to look outrageously awesome .
When we see this move we think of cool summer days with mint tea and grilled mozzarella sandwiches .
And spinal trauma .
# 25 : WARRIOR'S WAY
The Double Stomp was a sinister move in its own right .
The satanic Kevin Sullivan use to use it to knocked the wind ( and breakfast ) out of his opponents .
It was simple enough .
Your opponent lies on his back and you run up and just jump up and come down on his bread basket with the full force of both feet .
When we mentioned earlier that wrestling had taken various evolutionary steps , one of the ways that it 's heighted the stakes is that it 's taken basic moves and turned them into high - flying maneuvers .
Like doing suplexes ?
Well , why do n't you do them from the top rope ?
Dropkicks ?
Why not come flying off the third buckle like a crossbow bolt ?
The same applies to the double stomp , which ROH wrestler Low - Ki ( later becoming TNA wrestler , Senshi ) turned into a horrifying display of sadism .
Why not get some distance ?
Why not leap fifteen feet in the air and then land on your foe 's stomach with your feet ?
In - ring murder ?
Is n't that what we 're going for here ?
Hell , that 's what we expect when we pay $ 29.95 for the mezzanine .
# 24 : F -5
Brock Lesnar was so damn strong that his attempts to actually perform this move correctly became an exercise in futility .
Named after the Fujita scale of Tornado devastation , the F - 5 was a supposed to be a fireman 's carry into a flip over facebuster DDT .
The DDT part of it never actually caught on , as Lesnar was so mighty that he just usually wound up throwing his opponents up so hard that they just wound up pancaking on the ring .
Lesnar always brought an insane amount of intensity to the ring and the F - 5 was just the perfect move for a maniac like him to perform .
He used it to take out the likes of The Rock , The Undertaker and even Kurt Angle in the Main Event of WrestleMania XIX .
Lesnar also began to get creative with how quickly he was able to counter with this move .
Most famously , he turned Undertaker 's Tombstone into a match - winning F - 5 .
Just watch the video to see just how freakishly powerful this mastadon actually was , as he turns a flying cross body from Randy Orton into the F - 5 .
In what would could pass for Cohen & Steers ' worst nightmare , Wilbur Ross today said that he anticipates essentially an Armageddon for US commercial real estate .
What we fail to see is how this is news ...
What we fail to see even more is how the hell REITs are still trading where they are ?
It must be all those non-cash dividends , the staggering debt loads and the exploding cap rates which make them such an attractive proposition .
As Ross points out : " All of the components of real estate value are going in the wrong direction simultaneously .
Occupancy rates are going down .
Rent rates are going down and the capitalization rate -- the return that investors are demanding to buy a property -- are going up . "
Which begs the question : just because everyone knows the potential fall out associated with CRE , yet no proactive steps are taken to moderate these adverse developments , save a hope that the Fed will inflate debt sufficiently before 2012 when the refi crunch hits in earnest , does this make REITs a strong buy as BAC / ML has been claiming for months on end ?
Some more perspective from Bloomberg :
Billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross Jr. , said today the U.S. is in the beginning of a “ huge crash in commercial real estate . ”
U.S. commercial property sales are forecast to fall to the lowest in almost two decades as the industry endures its worst slump since the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s , according to property research firm Real Capital Analytics Inc .
The Moody ’s / REAL Commercial Property Price Indices already have fallen almost 41 percent since October 2007 , Moody ’s Investors Service said Oct. 19 .
Ross , the 71 - year - old chairman and chief executive officer of WL Ross & Co. LLC , said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio that he would use “ extreme caution ” before putting money into commercial real estate , especially office space , because properties are losing tenants .
“ I think it ’s going to take quite a while to work itself out , ” Ross said .
As of Oct. 15 , Ross said he had spent less than $ 100 million of at least $ 1.5 billion available to him under the Public - Private Investment Program , an investment pool of private and government money for purchasing distressed assets from financial institutions .
Ross is not alone in his CRE gloom , and was joined most recently by billionaire George Soros :
Billionaire George Soros , speaking today at a lecture organized by the Central European University in Budapest , said a “ bloodletting ” may be coming for leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate .
“ The American consumer will no longer be able to serve as the motor for the world economy , ” said Soros , 79 .
Yet every story has two sides .
And while we have beat the dead horse which is the avalanche of endless Merrill upgrades , which have led to the lone bright light in the firm 's investment banking / underwriting revenue , a different angle is provided by REIT manager Cohen and Steers which must be looking at today 's action with just a bit of trepidation .
We point you to their most recent investment commentary .
We also suggest you swallow the blue pill before reading this .
Do you really like your pod coffee maker , but wish you could use your favorite brand of coffee instead of paying a premium price for a mediocre blend — just because it is shaped like a pod ?
Why not make your own ?
What You ’ll Need
Most of what you ’ll need is probably already in your kitchen .
Look for a stainless steel measuring scoop that fits into the pod holder on your maker .
I have a Senseo brand maker and a 1/3 cup measure fits perfectly .
Next , look for a jar or a glass that fits nicely into the measuring scoop .
I found a vitamin jar that worked very well .
Finally , see if you have any Mr. Coffee style filters that fit the really small 4 to 5 cup machine .
Test Equipment
Set the jar into the scoop and the scoop into your pod holder , just to make sure everything fits together .
The better they fit , the better your finished pods will be .
Making the Pod
Next , take a single Mr. Coffee styled filter and shape it evenly over the end of your jar or glass or whatever you are using .
Try to center it pretty good — but it does n’t have to be perfect .
Next , invert the jar and filter and press it into the measuring scoop .
Press and spin the jar around a little bit to get nice tight edge in the filter paper at the bottom of the measuring cup .
Remove the jar , leaving a cup - shaped filter in the measuring scoop .
Add one scoop , or about 2 teaspoons of your favorite ground coffee to this paper - filter - cup — more or less to taste .
The typical coffee scoops that come with makers hold about 7 grams of coffee which is just about right .
Give the cup a slight shake to evenly spread the grounds across the bottom of the filter , and then use your finger to gently fold over the extra filter material , completely covering the ground coffee .
For a really well - formed pod , you can place the jar into the scoop one last time and press down really hard with the palm of your hand .
Be Sure To Place SMOOTH -SIDE -DOWN
In Your Machine
Finally , invert the scoop and pop out your home - made pod .
They cost a lot less , work just as well as the real thing and you can use your favorite coffee instead of the standard fare .
I found that the best coffee to use with this method is any of the Melitta variety because not only is the coffee excellent , but the powdery grind makes most other brands look quite coarse by comparison .
Please Note
Be careful not to use too big of filter or to make sloppy folds .
If you plug up your machine the pressure build up will either spray hot water all over the place or will engage the safety locks which prevent the lid from being re-opened .
If this happens you ’ll have to wait until the pressure subsides so that the locks release and you can remove the faulty pod .
Clean your pod holder frequently and check to make sure nothing is blocking the hole (s ) before each brewing cycle .
UPDATE 2012 : If you have a Senseo machine , you can now purchase an Ecopad , the Refillable Coffee Filter for the Classic Senseo or the Coffeeduck Classic : Permanent Refillable Coffee Filter for the Senseo models HD7810 - HD7812 to streamline making your own coffee pods .
UPDATE 2017 : From Mandy :
The update 2012 says you can use an Ecopad or a Coffeduck .
I have a Senso Quadrante .
The Ecopads and Coffeeduck wo n’t work in this new Senseo .
But the Ecopad can be hacked to work .
1 . Use an Ecopad .
2 . Discard the lid of the Ecopad .
( the lid just makes the pod too tall and the Senseo top wo n’t close ) 3 . Instead , use filter paper as the lid of Ecopad .
The coffee shops near me all sell AeroPress , and the circular filter papers used in the AeroPress are just the right size to become the lid of the refillable pod .
I enquire now as to the genesis of a philologist and assert the following : 1 . A young man cannot possibly know what Greeks and Romans are .
2 . He does not know whether he is suited for finding out about them .

Grand Prix legend Michael Schumacher has said " yes " to a Formula One comeback .
The 40 - year - old has finally been persuaded to come to the rescue of car giant Mercedes , who gave him his Grand Prix break 19 years ago .
Mercedes came up with £ 125,000 to hand Schumacher , then an unknown , his F1 debut for Jordan at Spa in 1991 .
Next season , he will fill the seat vacated by world champion Jenson Button 's McLaren switch , as revealed by Mirror Sport .
And contrary to reports that the sport 's most successful racer would be earning just £ 6 million , the German will actually rake in the biggest salary in F1 next season , totalling nearly £ 20 m .
Yet , even at that price he faces a cut from his £ 30 m price - tag during his days at Ferrari .
It means that having initially refused to meet Button 's demands for a minor pay hike , Mercedes are having to pay twice as much for this admittedly quality replacement .
But they are more than happy to do so when the name involved is Schumacher .
Mercedes bosses Norbert Haug , Nick Fry and Ross Brawn appear to have pulled off the coup of the century , after the car giant took over the World Champion Brawn operation last month .
They will also be breathing a huge sigh of relief as the star line - up they had promised for their new ' works ' team was looking decidedly threadbare after failing to land Button or Kimi Raikkonen .
While karting at Kerpen at the weekend Schumacher refused to comment , and the seven - time world champion has yet to sign on the dotted line , but sources in Germany say the deal has been done .
Schumacher has even cleared the path for the Mercedes move by negotiating his way out of a three - year agreement to be the ambassador to Ferrari 's road car division .
Although the pact between Schumacher and Ferrari boss Luca di Montezemolo was only verbal , the Italians , who made him champion five times , have been stunned by the U - turn .
But the chance of becoming the father figure and leader to what is effectively Germany 's answer to Ferrari was just too good to resist .
And Schumacher has got an extra boost thanks to an allclear from doctors on a neck injury he sustained motorcycle racing at the start of the year .
Mercedes ' insistence that they are not turning the British champions into Team Germany is now even harder to swallow .
They have two German drivers , a German boss in Haug and a German engine .
And Mercedes have already admitted the German national anthem will ring out over the circuit when they win a Grand Prix .
New team Lotus are expected to confirm ex-Toyota star Jarno Trulli as lead driver .
McLaren refugee Heikki Kovalainen is expected to land the other seat under design ace Mike Gascoyne as chief technical officer .
Authorities dismiss connection to H1N1 vaccine precisely as they conspired to do months before
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , November 12 , 2009
A high school athlete from Virginia was diagnosed with Guillain - Barre syndrome hours after receiving a swine flu shot , but health authorities are attempting to dismiss the connection as a coincidence , precisely as they resolved to do long before the H1N1 vaccination program even started .
14 - year - old Jordan McFarland developed severe headaches , muscle spasms and weakness in his legs following a swine flu shot .
He was diagnosed by doctors at Inova Fairfax Hospital as having Guillain - Barre syndrome , the nerve disorder that was prevalent in recipients of the vaccine during the last mass swine flu vaccination program in 1976 .
“ Connin and Jordan ’s father , Calvin McFarland , both 38 , believe the shot sparked the illness that came on 18 hours after the boy ’s vaccination , ” reports MSNBC .
Despite GBS ’s clear historical link with the swine flu shot , allied with the fact that health officials back in August warned neurologists that they needed to look out for increases in cases of the brain disorder following the launch of the immunization program , asked about the case of McFarland , the CDC’s Dr. Claudia J. Vellozzi claimed that there was “ no clear link between the new vaccine and the disease . ”
Efforts on behalf of health authorities to claim that debilitating side - effects and nerve disorders such as GBS have no connection to the vaccine , despite the fact that they are clearly listed on vaccine inserts as potential dangers , is unsurprising considering this is precisely what officials resolved to do before the swine flu mass vaccination program began .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Back In September , Reuters reported on how public health officials were expecting “ an avalanche of so - called adverse event reports , which are reports of death , illness or other health trauma , ” in the two weeks after people receive the vaccine .
“ We are going to be overwhelmed with potential events , ” said Mike Osterholm , a public health expert at the University of Minnesota .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Authorities therefore resolved to dismiss any connection to the swine flu shots a host of heart attacks , strokes and miscarriages that “ will be blamed on the H1N1 vaccine , ” effectively performing a blanket diagnosis months in advance .
Earlier this month , the U.S. government appointed what the media ludicrously billed as an “ independent ” group of health advisors who were tasked with whitewashing adverse reactions to the swine flu vaccine and ‘ explaining ’ them to the public as mere coincidence .
The group is headed up by none other than Dr. Marie McCormick of the Harvard School of Public Health .
McCormick and her affiliated organizations have routinely issued reports over the past 10 years supporting the government ’s position on the link between vaccines and autism , dismissing a correlation entirely despite overwhelming evidence that contradicts this notion .
McCormick has been widely criticized by other health experts for her dogged denial of the link between vaccines and autism .
So far from being “ independent , ” the group is in fact appointed by the government and lead by one of the government ’s chief whitewash proponents in the context of vaccine dangers and side - effects .
Pharmaceutical companies can be assured that they wo n’t face reprisals for injuries and deaths that will inevitably occur as a result of exposing millions to mercury and squalene additives that are contained in the H1N1 shot during a mass vaccination program , because the government has already acted to provide them with blanket immunity from lawsuits .
“ Vaccine makers and federal officials will be immune from lawsuits that result from any new swine flu vaccine , under a document signed by Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius , ” reported the Associated Press back in July .

The Democracy Foundation presents ...
( working title )
The National Initiative for Democracy ( NI4D ) is a great idea .
We all know that .
But too few people have heard about it .
We ’ve been contemplating the best way to introduce people to it , and we have decided that the best way is to make a feature - length documentary about the NI4D with interviews from historians and popular social commentators of today .
Short explanatory videos cannot adequately capture the breadth and historical relevance of the National Initiative .
Something bigger and better is needed .
Many things have converged to place us at a point of crisis .
There is extreme precarity in America , but also opportunity .
The technology to permit deliberative direct democracy on a national scale is upon us now .
Initiatives on a range of issues are being passed in states and cities all over the country ; from medical marijuana laws to new regulations protecting animal rights , and so much more , just about any issue you can think of .
All over the country , bloggers rant and rave about political dysfunction , a government neutered by an exclusive , pay - to - play representative system and have a near unawareness of the effects of popular initiative .
We are told to protest and petition , but few people see this as effective .
Switzerland , the Republic of the Philippines , and Uruguay all have more participatory democracies than we do , yet we still profess that , " we are the freest country in the world . "
You share the dream with us about the National Initiative .
You see why it ’s important .
We are a small group of Americans , but we can make big waves .
( Remember the rock ! )
We need all of those who have supported the NI4D up to now to rise to the occasion and fund this film .
If this is going to get done , it ’s going to be because of people like you recognizing a good thing , not passing the buck , but putting your foot down and saying , “ I ’m mad as hell , and I ’m not going to take it anymore ! ”
Donate to defray the cost of the film production .
Let ’s make waves .
Thank you .
New Hampshire Republican Senator Judd Gregg has circulated a letter to his Senate colleagues , instructing them on how to use the rules of Senate debate to delay and perhaps even defeat the health care bill being debated in the upper chamber .
The letter , obtained by The Hill ( PDF ) , TalkingPointsMemo and Politico ( PDF ) , among others , runs through numerous procedural rules that would allow the Republican minority to hold up progress on the health bill .
ADVERTISEMENT
It will likely add fuel to arguments by supporters of health care reform that the GOP ’s goal in the debate is to block Democrats from making progress on the issue .
Gregg ’s letter reminds senators that they can propose amendments to the bill that have nothing to do with health care reform :
Until cloture is invoked , Senators may offer an unlimited number of amendments — germane or non-germane — on any subject .
This is the fullest expression of a full , complete , and informed debate on a measure .
It has been necessary under past Democrat majorities to use the rules governing the amendment process aggressively to ensure that minority Senators get votes on their amendment as originally written .
The letter also suggests Republicans can delay debate by insisting on a roll call to ensure that quorum is met , even if it ’s obvious there are enough senators in the room to meet quorum .
The Republicans can then further delay things by raising procedural “ points of order ” that they can then appeal even if they are struck down :
A Senator may make a point of order at any point he or she believes that a Senate procedure is being violated , with or without cause .
After the presiding officer rules , any Senator who disagrees with such ruling may appeal the ruling of the chair — that appeal is fully debatable .
…
The Senate may dispose of a point of order or an appeal by tabling it ; however , delay is created by the two roll call votes in connection with each tabling motion ( motion to table and motion to reconsider that vote ) .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If Sen . Judd Gregg gets his way , the dilatory tactics that have marked the early days of the Senate health care debate will grow more and more severe , ” writes Brian Beutler at TalkingPointsMemo .
“ Just in time for the holidays , here it is in black and white , the Republicans ’ manual for stall , stop and delay , ” the Huffington Post quoted Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
“ And what do the American people get ?
Higher costs and less coverage .
What kind of present is that ? ”
It seems that on almost a weekly basis over the last couple months , there has been some rumors regarding an Apple tablet .
The latest one I ’ve heard had to do with the thousand dollar price tag .
A thousand dollars ?
Let ’s get real .
The concept of a tablet is a little lost on me .
Is it a phone ?
A computer ?
A media player ?
For a thousand dollars , it better do all three , and well .
I sit and think about why someone would need an tablet in the first place , and I just ca n’t find a reason .
Any one who would buy an applet already has a laptop and a cell phone that can access the internet .
What can a tablet do that both of these devices can’t ?
I ’ve read some articles about how an Apple tablet will also serve as an e-reader .
Honestly , we spend enough time staring at screens as it is , the last thing we need to do is read books on screens as well .
Who even has a Kindle ?
Whenever I get course readings assigned to me that are on the internet , I ’m thankful I do n’t have to go out and pay a hundred bucks for a book , but once I get down to doing the readings , after 10 minutes I ca n’t keep my eyes on the screen anymore .
So assuming the people in the target audience for a tablet already have a cell phone to make calls and access the web , a laptop to view their media and browse the web , and physical books to read , why would someone purchase tablet as anything else except as a novelty item ?
There have been reports that an Apple tablet would be able to function as a word processor , but I could n’t imagine trying to write an essay on a touch screen device .
I honestly do n’t see the need for an applet , there ’s nothing new about the technology that it will have , so why waste time and money doing the R&D ?
Chances are the product will come out sometime in the next six months or so , so i guess we can just sit and wait for more information before jumping to hasty conclusions .
A tablet draws similar comparisons to the launch of the Segway a few years back .
The company thought that it would have a massive market , but the product never took off ; nobody wants to look like a tool whipping around town on a futuristic scooter .
Come on Apple , you ’re better than that .

Mary Landrieu , D - La. , speaks to reporters following her news conference on the health care bill , Wednesday on Capitol Hill .
She is among the 10 senators negotiating a compromise on a government - run insurance program .
HEALTH CARE Q&A HEALTH CARE Q&A During the health care debate , USA TODAYanswers reader - submitted questions about the congressional bills .
Q : What is " age rating " and how much more will insurance companies be allowed to charge older people ?
A : The bills would change what insurance companies may consider about a person when they set the price of a policy .
For instance , insurers could no longer charge more if a policyholder has a pre-existing condition .
Two factors insurers would be allowed to consider : Tobacco use and age .
Age rating deals with how much more an insurance company would be allowed to charge an older person , who on average is more likely to need medical care , compared with a younger person .
The House and Senate bills set different rates meaning the issue must still be resolved .
The bill being debate in the Senate would let insurers charge older people three times more than younger ones .
Under the House bill , insurers could charge twice as much .
Under the House bill , for example , if a 20 year old paid $ 3,000 a year for a health plan someone who is 56 would pay up to $ 6,000 , or twice as much .
Younger people will also be affected because the less insurance companies charge older people the more they will make up that loss in premiums for younger adults .
America 's Health Insurance Plans , the insurance trade group , asked Congress to allow them to charge older Americans five times more , which is close to the current industry practice .
The AARP , the seniors ' lobbying group , favors the 2 to 1 ratio .

Blanche Lincoln , D - Ark. , right , wants to review a cost analysis from the Congressional Budget Office .
At left is Sen. Mary Landrieu .
WASHINGTON  Hospital and doctor groups that have generally supported the effort to revamp the nation 's health care system pushed back Wednesday against a new idea proposed by Democratic leaders to let younger Americans buy into Medicare .
The proposal , which would allow people 55 to 64 to enroll in the seniors health program , has emerged as a central part of an agreement struck between centrist and liberal Democrats sparring over the creation of a government - run insurance program .
Though the idea gained traction on Capitol Hill — and got a boost from President Obama — the outcry from the medical groups underscored the difficulty lawmakers are facing as they look for compromises that can win broad support for the Senate 's bill , which would cost $ 848 billion in the first 10 years .
INFLUENTIAL EIGHT : Key senators in health debate HEALTH COMPROMISE : Obama backs it ; others more cautious HIDDEN NUGGETS : Supporters add provisions to health bills " Bringing more people into a system that does n't work very well is not a good answer , " said Jeffrey Korsmo , executive director of the Mayo Clinic Health Policy Center .
" The current Medicare program is not sustainable . "
The Medicare proposal is one of several ideas included in a tentative agreement reached by a group of 10 Democrats — five centrists and five liberals — seeking alternatives to the government - run insurance program , or " public option . "
Though he has in the past supported the public option as a way to drive down health insurance costs by increasing competition , Obama said Wednesday that he supports the new Senate framework .
The president predicted it " will help pave the way for final passage of legislation . "
Still , some Democrats whose support will be needed to pass the bill said they are reserving judgment until they can review a pending cost analysis from the Congressional Budget Office .
Sen. Blanche Lincoln , D - Ark. , said there was only " consensus that we needed more information in order to move forward . "
The Senate is racing to approve the health care legislation by Christmas .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada needs to corral 60 votes , and he has focused mainly on Democrats because no Republicans have expressed support for the bill .
Nebraska Sen . Ben Nelson , who has been among the most vocal Democratic critics of the public option and who met privately with Reid on Wednesday , said he is n't leaning for or against the deal .
" I just want to know what the costs are , " he said .
Created in 1965 , Medicare had 45 million beneficiaries in 2008 , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , but rising health care costs have threatened the program 's viability .
According to the 2009 annual report by its trustees , the program is on track to run out of money in 2017 .
Many details have not been announced , but the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association , pounced on a proposal to expand the seniors program because doctors receive less from Medicare than from private insurance for the same procedures .
" If more people move into Medicare we'd … bear the financial brunt of this , " said Rich Umbdenstock , president and CEO of the hospital trade group .
The hospital group has not endorsed the legislation , crafted by Reid , but it has backed the broader effort .
In July , it agreed to forgo $ 155 billion in government reimbursements over 10 years to help pay for other changes to the health care system .
Sen. Mary Landrieu , D - La. , who along with Lincoln was among the 10 senators negotiating a compromise , said it would be a " very good idea " to allow people between 55 and 64 to buy into the Medicare program , but she said key provisions of how the program would work for the new enrollees are not yet clear .
For instance , Landrieu would like the buy - in to be available immediately but said the start date would ultimately depend on projected costs .
Lawmakers are also negotiating whether the government would initially subsidize the younger Medicare enrollees .
If not subsidized , Medicare can be costly .
Americans who are over 65 but do n't qualify for the program for other reasons pay a $ 461 monthly premium to buy into the portion of the program that covers hospitals stays , said Vicki Gottlich , a policy attorney with the non-partisan Center for Medicare Advocacy .
The group has supported the buy - in concept but is waiting to see details of the proposal , she said .

Medill Reports , Dec. 9 , 2009
He approves the swine flu vaccine , sings to his patients and said he may be one of few people to have been uninvited to the White House .
Dr. David Scheiner , President Barack Obama ’s former physician , has been serving the Hyde Park community for more than 20 years .
Scheiner ’s office sits along the side of a large parking lot on 52nd Street , also home to a McDonald ’s and a ribs restaurant .
An 81 - year - old woman sits in the corner of the doctor ’s examination room one recent morning and looks reverently at Scheiner .
Giving her a diligent and thorough exam , he shakes his head .
“ I am not happy with you , Ms. Robertson .
Not happy at all , ” the doctor says in a firm but gentle voice .
Back in his office , he explains that he fears she is starving to death .
With none of her family members willing to live with her and monitor her well - being , he is doubtful that she will be able to stay independent much longer .
Though the woman ’s case is one of the saddest he sees on a regular basis , her story is not unique .
With a wealthy stream of U.S. congressmen , University of Chicago faculty and clergymen as patients , physicians at Hyde Park Associates treat a predominantly elderly population who are on Medicare .
Scheiner shakes his head and stares out of his office window onto the battered buildings below with a furrowed brow .
It is not unusual for Scheiner to get this wrapped up in his patients , he said .
Coming from a small family himself , he refers to his patients as his family .
Scheiner grew up in New Jersey and attended medical school at Columbia University .
His subsequent residency at Michael Reese Hospital brought him to Chicago .
Over the next several years , he worked at a few practices on the South and West sides of Chicago , landing in Hyde Park and working with the charismatic Dr. Quentin Young .
He joined Young , a renowned physician and health care reform activist , in practice in 1979 .
He calls it “ the best decision I ever made . ”
Though Young retired years ago , Scheiner has remained at Hyde Park Associates , on - call 24 hours a day and seeing on average 20 to 25 patients a day .
“ David is extremely passionate about patient care , and extremely popular with his patients , ” Young said .
“ Deeply involved . ”
Young became a sort of mentor to Scheiner , though the two differed in behavior about how “ active ” a physician should be in pushing a health care agenda to patients .
Young had no qualms about insisting upon the importance of a national health care system to the politicians that came through his doors .
Scheiner on the other hand expressed more reserve in his opinions and felt that , if patients wanted to hear his political views , they would ask .
This became more important with one patient in particular , a rising star on Capitol Hill – Illinois ’ Sen. Barack Obama .
Scheiner had been President Obama ’s primary care physician for more than 20 years until he left Chicago for the White House .
Scheiner saw Obama ’s popularity with staff and other patients at Hyde Park Associates and said he knew instantly that the young politician would become a leader in national affairs .
Surprisingly , though , Scheiner said that he did not discuss views about health care reform with the future president .
“ David would say , ‘ That would be unethical , ’ ” Young said with a laugh .
“ I certainly did n’t think it was unethical . ”
In fact , Scheiner ’s seemingly valuable views from the perspective of a physician working within the system were never heard by Obama .
But , like Young , Scheiner has been a long - time advocate of health care reform .
And reporters flocked to him when he announced that he did not support Obama ’s proposed health care agenda earlier this year .
Scheiner supports a single - payer insurance system , which would create a single non-profit insurance institution for everyone , much different than the current free - market system .
He said that the government has a moral and social obligation to provide health care to the public , just as it provides libraries and sanitation .
But he takes the stance that the public option , where the government would provide health insurance coverage , will not be as effective as it is claimed to be .
“ The public option as it stands now , even if it gets through , is bad .
It ’s inadequate , ” he said .
It would offer one government plan among all of the current health insurance options .
“ It ’s not going to be competitive [ with insurance companies ] , and that ’s exactly the point .
It has become meaningless .
If the whole thing fails , it has the potential to set things way back , ” Scheiner said .
Critical of the insurance industry , he said industry giants “ profit from people ’s misery . ”
And if they exist in a new health care environment , strict and precise regulation should be enforced to keep them financially in check .
But Scheiner said he assumes his criticism of the President ’s public option for health care explains why he was recently “ disinvited ” from attending a White House event the day before it was scheduled .
The White House did not respond to questions regarding Scheiner ’s statements by the time of publication .
Scheiner ’s advice for Obama is not to worry about pleasing constituencies for a presidential run in 2012 but rather to tackle tough issues and be a “ one - term President , ” if necessary .
“ He does n’t need people to love him , he ’s being too timid .
And it ’s tough – this is a country that is basically conservative .
But he should lead us , ” Scheiner said .
Despite his already progressive tendencies , Scheiner said he is getting more radical as he ages .
After Scheiner became more vocal with his political opinions in the backdrop of U.S. health care reform , the National Review at one point called him a socialist , he said .
“ I consider that a badge of honor , ” he added , chuckling .
Scheiner also said he initially became a doctor for the idealism and romanticism of it all .
He recalled a defining moment in his career when he was called upon to save a man ’s life .
The man had collapsed due to a diabetic episode , and needed an injection to restore consciousness .
Scheiner began running down the street , medicine in hand , and injected the life - saving antidote in the patient ’s arm .
This dramatic and theatrical event is exactly what Scheiner meant by romanticism , he said .
Days later , Scheiner received the same call , and again had to run to the scene to save the same man ’s life .
Scheiner heroically injected the medication , though a bit more disenchanted .
Days later , Scheiner received another call about the same man , who had collapsed again .
However , the repetition had taken its toll on his enthusiasm for being a hero .
“ Even a fantasy can be overdone , I guess , ” he said .
And Scheiner is n’t making plans to retire any time soon .
Forever a competitor with his mentor , he jokingly said that he ’ll stay in practice longer than Young , who retired at 85 .
“ I ’ve done essentially everything you can possibly do in medicine , ” he said .
“ I walk around with a sandwich board that says ‘ I ’m a doctor . ’
Whenever someone calls me ‘ Mr. Scheiner , ’ I sort of get shivers .
My identity is as a physician , and that ’s part of it ’s going to be so hard for me to retire – I do n’t know if there ’s going to be anything left when they take away the ‘ Dr . ’ ”

“ Americans raise awareness with grass - roots action , but Japanese just wait for the government to take care of them , ” said Yoshitomo Takahashi , a professor of behavioral science who researches suicide at the National Defense Medical College in Tokorozawa , Japan .
Officials in Sakai , the small city in Fukui Prefecture , where Tojimbo is located , have installed outdoor lighting at the cliffs along with two pay phones and plenty of the 10 - yen coins needed to dial up the national suicide hot line .
Nevertheless , city officials call this the grimmest year on record , with the police saying they know of more than 140 people who came here intending to commit suicide , twice the average in recent years .
Most of them were stopped by the police or nearby tourists , or decided not to jump for other reasons , the police say .
The police figure does not include the 54 people this year whom Mr. Shige says he and his group have stopped .
City officials credit Mr. Shige with helping keep the number of deaths here down to 13 so far this year , about the same as the 15 suicides last year .
Mr. Shige says his approach to stopping suicides is quite simple : when he finds a likely person , he walks up and gently begins a conversation .
The person , usually a man , quickly breaks down in tears , happy to find someone to listen to his problems .

“ They are just sitting there , alone , hoping someone will talk to them , ” Mr. Shige said .
As an officer stationed at Tojimbo at the end of his 42 - year career , he said he was appalled by all the bodies he had to pluck out of the sea .
He said he once stopped an elderly couple from Tokyo from jumping and turned them over to city officials who he said gave them money and told them to buy a ticket to the next town .
Days later he received a letter from the couple , mailed just before they committed suicide in a neighboring prefecture .

SALT LAKE CITY --
A glitch in the FAA 's traffic control computer system , which caused widespread cancellations and delays , has been traced to Salt Lake City .
The Federal Aviation Administration said the problem , which lasted about four hours , was not a cyber attack .

FAA glitch causes widespread US air travel delays
For the second time in 15 months , a problem with the FAA system that collects airlines ' flight plans is causing widespread flight cancellations and delays nationwide .
In a statement from the FAA , Allen Kenitzer , manager of Communications and Media Relations FAA Northwest Mountain & Alaska Regions , said , " The failure was attributed to a software configuration problem within the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure ( FTI ) in Salt Lake City .
As a result FAA services used primarily for traffic flow and flight planning were unavailable electronically . "
The National Airspace Data Interchange Network ( NADIN ) , which processes flight planning , was affected because it relies on the FTI services .
It 's located right next to the airport .
It 's one of two centers like it in the nation ; the other is in Atlanta .
The failure happened about 5 a.m. Eastern time .
It meant that flight plan information for every flight in the nation was unavailable .
" The big impact we had was the possibility of delays , " said Troy Decker , vice president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association .
" Aircraft departing saying , ‘ Hey , I want to pick up my flight plan .
It 's not in the system . '
Air traffic controllers have to put it in the system .
It 's a right now thing , you need to get it in the system , get them going so you do n't incur delays . "
The delays mostly affected people on the East Coast .
The problem lasted for five hours but affected flights all day long .
Delays at Salt Lake International were minor since this happened so early in the morning .
Flights that were already in the air landed close to on time .
Rebecca Smith was at the Salt Lake airport waiting to pick up someone .
She said , " I have my BlackBerry , so I 've been checking on the Delta flight and so far , so good .
In fact , it just landed , so he 's only about 10 minutes late . "
The FAA says it 's investigating the situation , but for now it appears to be resolved .
This is the second widespread computer glitch the FAA has had in the last 15 months .
But this time , the agency says it was because of information received from outside the system , not a glitch from within the system .

PHILADELPHIA 
An appeals court on Friday overturned a rule that said a cable TV company could not serve more than 30 % of the nation 's subscribers .
The verdict was a victory for the largest cable company , Comcast , which has 26 % share and sued to block the rule .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the cap , imposed by the Federal Communications Commission , was " arbitrary and capricious , " and threw out the restriction .
Fearing a cable monopoly , Congress in 1992 directed the FCC to set limits on how many customers cable TV operators could reach nationwide .
The FCC set the 30 % limit , but that was thrown out twice before by the courts .
Two years ago the cap was reinstated , prompting the new challenge from Comcast .
FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell said he had disagreed with the commission 's decision to re-impose the cap in 2007 because he felt the rule was vulnerable to a challenge given that it was already overturned in 2001 .
He said that the commission 's cap was based on " aging data and questionable assumptions " that did n't adequately reflect the entry of new competitors to cable operators .
" In the future , outcomes in our proceedings should be driven by the facts and law , rather than the other way around , " McDowell said in a statement .

Editor ’s Note : Today we bust out a two - handed weapon for reviewing Runic Games ’ highly anticipated release “ Torchlight , ” one of the critical darlings from the last E3 Games Expo .
One opinion , in this case , just could n’t be enough , so check out the back - to - back first impressions below :
Torchlight – developed by Runic Games
Impressions –by Adam [ email protected ]
Torchlight is a single - player hack , slash and blast adventure that has already turned a few heads .
At E3 2009 people raved about its pick - up - and - go gameplay , and its slick and stylish graphics .
So how does the finished game play ?
All The Fabulous Looking Creepy Stuff !
The art design is easily one of the more appealing features of this game .
The town is colorful , yet heavily shaded and moody .
The dungeons ( randomly generated , I might add ) start off twisted , ragged and weird , only to get more bizarre as the secrets of the great mine start to unravel .
Even the title screen and character creation interfaces are highly sleek , with crisp , steampunk - esque artwork that seems to come from a place between World of Warcraft and Open Realms .
Torchlight Screenshots and Concept Art :
To Slam , To Scram , or To Alakazam ?
Players can select from three character classes at the start of the game .
Destroyers are large , brutish warriors who speak with their fists and weapons .
Vanquishers are quick and lithe , using ranged attacks and setting traps for their foes .
Alchemists use powerful magical blasts to strike from afar , and can summon creatures to fight alongside them .
I started my campaign into the world of Torchlight , selecting an Alchemist as my hero ( being a big fan of the Elric Brothers ) .
I selected a dog as my faithful companion ( because cats have their own agendas ) and ventured into the hapless burg .
Welcome !
Say , Did You Happen to Bring an Army ?
Torchlight is a mining town built over the largest deposit of Ember ( a magical and deadly substance ) ever to be found .
The town is aptly named , seemingly shrouded with a ghastly pall that never quite lets in the daylight .
It sets the mood of the game nicely .
You ’re not 10 steps in before you ’ve met with your first quest - giving NPC .
He wo n’t be the last either .
Torchlight is inhabited by numerous troubled denizens , each promising rewards for completing the tasks they ca n’t take on themselves .
The main quest will take you about 20 hours to complete , but there are side - quests galore , including “ Infinite Dungeon ” to tackle , for those who just ca n’t stop leveling .
Lemon Squeezy
Once you enter the mines , the fight is on .
You ’ll encounter enemies in almost no time .
You can root yourself in place by holding down the Shift key , and by moving the cursor over enemies , you can dispatch them with your weapons or skills ( by clicking the left or right mouse mutton , respectively ) .
It ’s deceptively easy ; the first few mobs are little threat , but before long you ’ll be surrounded by swarms of ghouls and spiders .
Throw in some gigantic baddies and some notorious monsters ( with notorious loot to boot ! ) and you ’d better make sure all of your many buckles are fastened , because this is going be a bumpy ride .
Familiarize yourself with the quick cast slots at the bottom of the interface .
Learn to heal yourself on the fly or you ’ll find yourself flat on your back before long .
Stuffing Your Stuff
The character menus are simple to use .
Switching equipment is a snap , and the ability to send your pet to town with excess items to sell at market is a nice touch that will save you from using too many Town Portal spells .
Just be cautious when you decide to send your pet off !
You could find yourself surrounded by goblins , and short two able sets of claws .
Take advantage of companion NPC ’s , but try to avoid opening menus until you ’re sure there are no nearby threats .
Companions like to run ahead to the next visible mob without provocation , and there ’s nothing worse than getting clubbed in the middle of allocating your latest skill point .
Even in my brief time with the game , I discovered a wealth of enchanted weapons , and even encountered a couple of rare items .
My one complaint is that the armor items all looked identical , although I imagine they will change up later in the adventure when more powerful items are discovered .
Socketed weapons and armor will allow you to add crystals , bestowing magical effects on the selected item .
If you find a fishing hole on your journey , take some time out from hacking and slashing to stock up on tasty fish .
Your catches will have buff effects for you and many for your pet as well .
What ’s Your Game ?
Torchlight will strike Diablo players as instantly familiar , and with good reason : Many of the developers and leads from Diablo and Diablo 2 have lent their talents to the single - player game .
Easy to jump into , with customization methods and challenges to satisfy the über - grinder for hours on end , Torchlight will prove to be a fun time - waster for some , and a richly rewarding challenge for more dedicated players .

A Second Opinion of Torchlight
By Indie - Game - Freak
Here to Please
From the outset it is is easy to see that the developers of Torchlight set out to create the ultimate fantasy action game , drawing on the three quarter top - down view of Baldur ’s Gate , Diablo or Heroes of Might and Magic to the familiar HUD from World of Warcraft , with spells assignable to a row of ten slots that can be triggered by their corresponding numbers on the keyboard .
They have added the idea of Fame to the mix – another word for renown – that accumulates as you complete certain quests and heroic deeds .
Also there is the ever - addictive option to visit Duran the Transmuter who will combine items and fashion them into a resultant new treat , something that from my memory recalls Oblivion ’s item combination scheme .
Although the increasingly ubiquitous Steampunk aesthetic can be felt in the character design , it is n’t clear why ; there are no references to mechanical men , or steam machines or even and Conan Doyle - ish society .
Here it probably makes an appearance because it just looks cool .
Take A Good Look Around , Or Not
The graphics are terrific , so much so that the constraints of the camera angle feel a bit claustrophobic at first as you crane your neck around in vain in order to see it all .
Eventually , as I suspected , you just get used to it and go with the flow , but not being able to circle the camera around to check into obscured corners is a bit of a letdown .
Instead the designers elected to created an X - Ray view of your character when back into an invisible section of the map .
Starting out the game at the normal difficulty level proves a little too easy .
A single hit from your character send pretty much anything it encounters within the first five levels of the dungeon into an explosion of red .
But when the monsters do start piling on the game starts to get fun , even if only for a moment .
Load times between zones feels a little slow , even on a Quad Core with 4 gigs of RAM .
Interestingly enough , there is a switch in the settings window for Netbook compatibility – a rather forward - thinking feature for which Runic gets brownie points .
The author wonders , however , what a such a graphics - loving game might look like on a three - hundred dollar Asus .
What Is All This Stuff ?
Dealing with inventory in Torchlight , is also a bit frustrating ; items with rather a broad range of stats too often use identical graphics and so it is hard to determine which is which .
The pathfinding for player NPCs can get a little squirrelly , and you companion NPCs , over which you have no control , like to barge into battle , when they are n’t getting stuck behind objects in an attempt to get back to you .
Similarly , line of sight issues can become a nuisance as you try to blast baddies only to find that your attacks are merely repainting the corner of a wall .
This could be solved by making enemies targetable , perhaps in the same way that you could TAB between targets in WoW , but here , the TAB key ( which is not customizable ) toggles between a selectable attack function .
Battles themselves are essentially point and click affairs , with the exception of selecting what spell to cast or what weapon to use .
But to be fair , this is an action game and not an RTS .
It will be very interesting to see how this feels as a multiplayer experience .
A nice touch , however , is that the distance to your target makes a notable difference in the amount of damage dealt .
You can also graze a target as opposed to always making a direct hit , and the closer you get , the bigger the bloodsplosion can be .
Fishing is another thing to do in the World of Torchlight , and feels very similar to doing the same in WoW – you cast your line , wait for a nibble and yank the line only to be rewarded with one of a wide variety of fish , each of which can be fed to your pet and grant it brief but powerful new abilities for example catching an electric eel gives your pet an Electric Elemental bump .
I wrote to the devs about a few small things that did n’t seem to work or be present .
For example , it is rumored that when your pet ’s inventory ( essentially your pet is a saddle bag with teeth ) is full , you can click a green arrow to send it back to town and dump your stuff .
I could never locate said green arrow , although apparently , my compatriot , who wrote the review above , found it without difficulty .
I even went back to double check it but could not find said feature .
Certain items , like magic and healing potions are stackable , but I could n’t find a way to split stacks .
Where Have I Heard That Before ?
Finally , I must talk about the music : Matt Uelmen ’s score is actually a standout in the game although at times I could swear I heard the theme song to the Batman series that starred Adam West and other times the main theme from Twin peaks by Angelo Badalamenti .
Not that either of these , especially when paired together , is a bad thing .
Ambient , eerie and seductive it is a strong point of the package .
Torchlight is a great looking game , with smooth gameplay that tries to take the best of the genre , but where it succeeds in design , it lacks in mythology .
Beyond the quest for Ember – the source of magic – there is no real telling why you are there nor why should you care .
The multiplayer experience could prove to be quite fun , but nothing really sets this world apart in any new way .
I would recommend it as a new - and - improved version of a very old trick that adds some of the cooler elements of other very successful games , but in so doing only reminds us , by virtue of going only part of the way , that it is a jack of all trades and master of none .

A few final words about the upcoming massively multiplayer online version of Torchlight , based on notes from the developer :
Key Additions
In the MMO Version of Torchlight :
Expansive World – Large overland areas and deep , randomly generated dungeons offer a
variety of exploration and adventuring opportunities .
Customization –
The level of character customization is upped significantly in the MMO , with more class choices , looks , and options which allow a truly personalized character .
Territory Wars – Torchlight will take advantage of precedent set by other Perfect World MMOs and offer weekly battles for territory , with winners receiving significant rewards .
Mounts – Large variety of mounts to assist in navigating the world .

The Monster
We do n't know how something like her comes to exist .
She has no more memory of her origins than I do of mine -- and she lacks the birth certificate , baby photos and parental accounts that fill in my backstory
The first thing she remembers is wandering out of the woods behind my house .
We know she 's not human ; this is n't just a case of an identical twin , somehow separated at birth .
When the Blossom of the West was caught in that firefight in Kryvyi Rih last month , my Brândușa fell down screaming in the kitchen , a bullet wound in her shoulder .
We took her to see Doc Harris , told him she 'd been rushing to shoot a Coyote in the chicken
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia admitted on Thursday another failed test of its much - touted Bulava intercontinental missile , after unusual lights were spotted in Norway across the border from the launch site .
The submarine - based Bulava ( Mace ) missile has been billed as Russia ’s newest technological breakthrough to support its nuclear deterrent , but the repeated test failures are an embarrassment for the Kremlin .
The missile failed in its 13th test on Wednesday morning , Russia ’s leading economic dailies Vedomosti and Kommersant reported on Thursday , quoting sources in the military - industrial complex .
Hours later , the Defense Ministry admitted the failure , saying the launch had been made by the Dmitry Donskoi nuclear submarine from a submerged position in the White Sea .
“ It has been established ... that the missile ’s first two stages worked as normal , but there was a technical malfunction at the next , third , stage of the trajectory , ” a Defense Ministry spokesman said .
Norwegian experts reported sighting of phenomena in the atmosphere near the White Sea , where earlier Bulava rockets were fired , the Kommersant and Vedomosti newspapers reported .
Russia ’s REN - TV showed footage of a spiral of white light , which it said was taken on Wednesday in Norway .
The footage also showed a bright white light with a long blue tail on the horizon .
A strange light phenomenon is sighted in the night sky above parts of northern Norway , early December 9 , 2009 .
Russia 's new submarine - based intercontinental missile suffered the latest in a series of test failures , newspapers reported on Thursday , as unusual lights were spotted in Norway across the border from the launch site .

MISTAKE OR CRIME ?
Staking heavily on the Bulava , the Kremlin also has overseen a costly project aimed at building a new class of nuclear submarines to carry the missile -- the Borei ( Arctic Wind ) .
The first submarine of the class -- Yuri Dolgoruky -- for months has been undergoing sea tests , while two others are being built .
The laying of the keel for a submarine of the more advanced Borei - A class is reported to be set by year ’s end .
“ This is a catastrophe ...
Huge funds were siphoned off from Russia ’s moribund navy for the Bulava project .
In fact , billions of dollars have been flushed down the drain , ” Alexander Khramchikhin , chief analyst at the Moscow - based Institute of Military and Political Analysis , said .
Of 11 previous reported tests , at least six have been unsuccessful , including one on July 15 when a Bulava self destructed after a malfunction during the first stage of its flight from the White Sea .
Later media reports said there also had been an attempt to launch the Bulava in October but it was put off at the last moment due to a technical glitch .
The 37 - tonne , 12 - meter ( 39 - ft ) intercontinental ballistic missile , known as the Bulava - 30 inside the Russian military , is capable of carrying multiple warheads to the distances of up to 8,000 km ( 5,000 miles ) .
Some sources say the Bulava can carry up to six warheads , others say 10 .
The Kremlin has touted the missile as a unique weapon capable of breaching any air defense and a way to bolster the country ’s once mighty submarine fleet .
Analysts criticize Moscow ’s hurry to build the Bulava , as it already has a highly reliable Soviet - built Sineva submarine - based ballistic missile .
They also question awarding the Bulava contract to the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology which has never before built missiles for submarines .

The Harold Wolpe Lecture , University of KwaZulu - Natal , 5 November 2009
In 1982 , I published a book , jointly with Samir Amin , Giovanni Arrighi , and Andre Gunder Frank , entitled Dynamics of Global Crisis .
This was not its original title .
We had proposed the title , Crisis , What Crisis ?
The U.S. publisher did not like that title , but we used it in the French translation .
The book consisted of a joint introduction and conclusion and a separate essay by each of us on the topic .
We opened the book with our observation that “ throughout the 1970s , ‘ crisis ’ became an increasingly familiar theme : first in obscure discussions among intellectuals , then in the popular press , and finally in political debates in many countries . ”
We noted that there were many different definitions of the so - called crisis as well as different explanations of its origin .
By the 1980s , the term “ crisis ” seemed to disappear from world discourse , to be replaced by another buzz word , one with a much more optimistic gloss — “ globalization . ”
It is only beginning in 2008 that the tone has turned dour again , and the word “ crisis ” has resurfaced , this time more sharply than in the 1970s , but just as loosely .
So the question , “ crisis , what crisis ? ” seems again very relevant .
Something did indeed happen to the world - system in the late 1960s , early 1970s .
This moment marked the beginning of the downturn in two absolutely normal cycles in the operation of the modern world - system .
It was the moment when both the hegemonic cycle and the overall economic cycle each began its downturn .
The period 1945 to circa 1970 had been the moment of the height of United States hegemony in the world - system and also the moment of the most expansive Kondratieff A - upturn that the capitalist world - economy had ever known in its history .
The French refer to that period as “ les trente glorieuses ” — a most apt expression .
I call these downturns absolutely normal .
To understand why , one must bear in mind two things .
All systems have cyclical rhythms .
It is the way they live , the way they deal with the inevitable fluctuations of their operations .
The second thing to bear in mind has to do with how capitalism as a world - system functions .
There are two key issues : how producers make profit ; how states guarantee the world order within which producers may make profit .
Let us take each in turn .
Capitalism is a system in which the endless accumulation of capital is the raison d’être .
To accumulate capital , producers must obtain profits from their operations .
However , truly significant profits are possible only if the producer can sell the product for considerably more than the cost of production .
In a situation of perfect competition , it is absolutely impossible to make significant profit .
If there is perfect competition ( that is , a multitude of sellers , a multitude of buyers , and universally available information about prices ) , any intelligent buyer will go from seller to seller until he finds one who will sell at a penny above the cost of production , if not indeed below the cost of production .
Obtaining significant profit requires a monopoly , or at least a quasi- monopoly of world - economic power .
If there is a monopoly , the seller can demand any price , as long as he does not go beyond what the elasticity of demand permits .
Any time the world - economy is expanding significantly , one will find that there are some “ leading ” products , which are relatively monopolized .
It is from these products that great profits are made and large amounts of capital can be accumulated .
The forward and backward linkages of these leading products are the basis of an overall expansion of the world - economy .
We call this the A - phase of a Kondratieff cycle .
The problem for capitalists is that all monopolies are self - liquidating .
This is because there exists a world market into which new producers can enter , however well politically defended is a given monopoly .
Of course , entry takes time .
But sooner or later , others are able to enter the market , and the degree of competition increases .
And when competition increases , prices go down , as the heralds of capitalism have always told us .
However , at the same time , profits go down .
When profits for the leading products go down sufficiently , the world - economy ceases to expand , and it enters into a period of stagnation .
We call this the B - phase of a Kondratieff cycle .
Empirically , the A - and B - phases together have tended to be 50 - 60 years in length , but the exact lengths have varied .
Of course , after a certain time in a B - phase , new monopolies can be created and a new A - phase can begin .
How this has been done is not our topic here .
The second condition for capitalist profit is that there exists some kind of relative world order .
While world wars offer the possibilities for some entrepreneurs to do very well , they also occasion enormous destruction of fixed capital and considerable interference with world trade .
The overall world - economic balance - sheet of world wars is not positive , a point Schumpeter repeatedly made .
A relatively stable situation is necessary for a positive overall balance - sheet .
Ensuring this relatively stable situation is the task of a hegemonic power , that is , a power strong enough to impose such relative stability on the world - system as a whole .
Hegemonic cycles have been much longer than Kondratieff cycles .
It is not so easy , in a world of multiple so - called sovereign states , for one state to establish itself as the hegemonic power .
It has in fact been done only three times in several hundred years : first by the United Provinces in the mid-seventeenth century , then by the United Kingdom in the mid-nineteenth century , and finally by the United States in the mid-twentieth century .
The rise of a hegemonic power is the result of a long struggle with other potential hegemonic powers .
It has been won each time up to now by that state which , for various reasons and by various methods , has been able to put together the most efficient productive machinery , and then to win a “ thirty years ’ war ” with its principal rival .
Again how this is done is not our topic here .
The key point is that once a given state finally achieves hegemony , it is able to set the rules by which the interstate system operates , seeking simultaneously to assure its smooth functioning and to maximize the flow of accumulated capital to its citizens and productive enterprises .
One could call this a quasi-monopoly of geopolitical power .
The problem for the hegemonic power is the same as the problem for a leading industry .
The monopoly is self - liquidating .
This is so for two reasons .
On the one hand , to maintain the order it imposes , the hegemonic power has to make use on occasion of its military power .
But potential military strength is always more intimidating than actually - used military strength .
Using the military strength is costly in money and lives .
It has a negative impact on the citizens of the hegemonic power , whose initial pride in victory tends to turn to distress as they pay the increasing costs of military action , and they begin to lose enthusiasm .
Furthermore , big military operations tend almost always to be less efficacious than both supporters and opponents of the hegemonic power had feared , and this strengthens the future resistance of others who wish to defy the hegemonic power .
There is a second reason .
Even if the hegemonic power ’s economic efficiency does not immediately falter , that of other countries begins to rise .
And as the others rise , they are less ready to accept the dictates of the hegemonic power .
The hegemonic power enters into a process of slow decline relative to the rising powers .
The decline may be slow but it is nonetheless essentially irreversible .
The conjoining circa 1965 - 1970 of the two kinds of decline — that marking the end of the historically most expansive Kondratieff - A phase and that marking the beginning of decline of the historically most powerful hegemonic power — is what made that turning point so remarkable .
It is no accident that the world revolution of 1968 ( actually 1966 - 1970 ) took place at that turning point , as an expression of the turning point .
The world revolution of 1968 marked a third downturn , one however that has occurred only once in the history of the modern world - system — the decline of the traditional antisystemic movements of the world - system , the so - called Old Left .
The Old Left — essentially the two varieties of world social movements , the Communists and the Social - Democrats ; plus the national liberation movements — arose slowly and laboriously across the world - system , primarily throughout the last third of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century .
The Old Left movements ascended from a position of political marginality and weakness as of say 1870 to one of political centrality and considerable strength as of say 1950 .
These movements reached the summit of their mobilizing power in the period from 1945 to 1968 — exactly the moment of both the extraordinary Kondratieff A - phase expansion and the height of U.S. hegemony .
I do not think this was fortuitous , although it might seem counter - intuitive .
The incredible world economic expansion led to a strong preference of entrepreneurs not to suffer interruptions of their production processes because of conflict with the workers .
It followed that they tended to believe that concessions to the material demands of their workers cost them less than such interruptions .
Of course , over time , this meant rising costs of production , one of the factors that led to the end of the quasi-monopolies of leading industries .
But most entrepreneurs make decisions that maximize short - term profits — let us say , profits over the succeeding three years — and leave the future to the gods .
Parallel considerations influenced the policies of the hegemonic power .
Maintaining relative stability in the world - system was an essential objective .
The United States had to weigh the cost of repressive activity on the world scene against the cost of concessions to the demands of national liberation movements .
And reluctantly at first , but later more deliberately , the United States began to favor a controlled “ decolonization ” and this had the effect of bringing such movements to power .
Hence , by the middle of the 1960s , one could say that the Old Left movements had achieved their historic goal of state power almost everywhere — at least on paper .
Communist parties ruled one - third of the world — the so - called socialist bloc .
Social - democratic parties were in power , at least alternating power , in most of another third of the world — the pan-European world .
One has to bear in mind in addition that , at that time , the principal policy of the social - democratic parties — the welfare state – was accepted and practiced as well by their conservative alternating parties .
And of course , the national liberation movements had come to power in most of the former colonial world ( as well as various versions of populist movements in Latin America ) .
To be sure , I have said “ at least on paper . ”
Most analysts and militants tend today to be very critical of the performance of all these movements , and doubt that their coming to power made much difference .
But this is a retrospective view and is historically anachronistic .
The critics forget the sense of worldwide triumphalism that pervaded the Old Left movements and their supporters at precisely that time , a triumphalism based precisely on their achievement of state power .
The critics forget as well the sense of deep fear that pervaded the world ’s wealthier and more conservative strata about what looked to them like a juggernaut of destructive egalitarianism .
The world revolution of 1968 changed all that .
Three themes pervaded the analyses and the rhetoric of those who engaged in the multiple uprisings .
All three themes bespoke a revised triumphalism .
The first theme was that the U.S. hegemonic power had overstretched and was vulnerable .
The Vietnam war was the model example , albeit not the only one .
The Tet offensive was taken to be the death knell of the U.S. military operation .
As part of the new atmosphere , the revolutionaries attacked the role of the Soviet Union which they saw as a collusive participant in U.S. hegemony , a feeling that had been growing everywhere , since at least 1956 .
The second theme was that the Old Left movements — of all three varieties — had failed to deliver their historic promises .
All three varieties had built their strategy on the so - called two - step strategy — first take state power , then change the world .
The militants said in effect that you have taken state power but have not at all changed the world .
If we wish to change the world , we must replace you with new movements and new strategies .
And we shall do this .
The Chinese Cultural Revolution was taken by many as the model example of this possibility .
The third theme was that the Old Left movements had ignored the forgotten peoples — those downtrodden because of their race , their gender , their ethnicity , their sexuality .
The militants insisted that the demands for equal treatment by all of these groups could no longer be deferred to some putative future time after the main Old Left parties had achieved their historic objectives .
These demands , they said , constituted part of the urgent present , not the deferred future .
In many ways , the Black Power movement in the United States was the model example .
The world revolution of 1968 was an enormous political success .
The world revolution of 1968 was an enormous political failure .
It rose like a phoenix , burned very bright indeed across the globe , and then by the mid-1970s seemed to be extinguished almost everywhere .
What had been accomplished by this wild brushfire ?
Actually , quite a bit .
Centrist liberalism had been dethroned as the governing ideology of the world - system .
It was reduced to being simply one alternative among others .
And the Old Left movements were destroyed as mobilizers of any kind of fundamental change .
But the immediate triumphalism of the revolutionaries of 1968 , liberated from any subordination to centrist liberalism , proved shallow and unsustainable .
The world right was equally liberated from any attachment to centrist liberalism .
It took advantage of the world economic stagnation and the collapse of the Old Left movements ( and their governments ) to launch a counter - offensive , which we call neoliberal ( actually quite conservative ) globalization .
The prime objectives were to reverse all the gains of the lower strata during the Kondratieff A - period .
The world right sought to reduce all the major costs of production , to destroy the welfare state in all its versions , and to slow down the decline of U.S. power in the world - system .
The onward march of the world right seemed to culminate in 1989 .
The ending of Soviet control over its East - Central European satellite states and the dismantling of the Soviet Union itself led to a sudden new triumphalism of the world right .
One more illusion !
The offensive of the world right was a great success .
The offensive of the world right was a great failure .
What was sustaining the accumulation of capital since the 1970s was the turning from seeking profits via productive efficiency to seeking profits via financial manipulations , more correctly called speculation .
The key mechanism of speculation is encouraging consumption via indebtedness .
This was of course what has happened in every Kondratieff B-period .
The difference this time has been the scale of the speculation and the indebtedness .
After the biggest A - period expansion in the history of the capitalist world - economy , there has followed the biggest speculative mania .
The bubbles moved through the whole world - system — from the national debts of the Third World countries and the socialist bloc in the 1970s , to the junk bonds of large corporations in the 1980s , to the consumer indebtedness of the 1990s to the U.S. government indebtedness of the Bush era .
The system has gone from bubble to bubble .
The world is currently trying one last bubble — the bailouts of the banks and the printing of dollars .
The depression into which the world has fallen will continue now for quite a while and go quite deep .
It will destroy the last small pillar of relative economic stability , the role of the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency of safeguarding wealth .
As this happens , the main concern of every government in the world — from the United States to China , from France to Russia to Brazil to South Africa , not to speak of all the weaker governments on the world scene — will be to avert the uprising of the unemployed workers and the middle strata whose savings and pensions disappear .
The governments are turning to protectionism and printing money as their first line of defense , as ways of dealing with popular anger .
Such measures may postpone the dangers the governments fear and may assuage momentarily the pain of ordinary people .
But they will eventually probably make the situation even worse .
We are entering a gridlock of the system , from which the world will find it extremely difficult to extract itself .
The gridlock will express itself in the form of a constant set of ever wilder fluctuations , which will make short - term predictions — both economic and political — virtually guesswork .
And this in turn will aggravate the popular fears and alienation .
Some are claiming that the greatly improved relative economic position of the Asian nations — especially first Japan , then South Korea and Taiwan , then China and to a lesser extent India — is allowing , will allow a resurgence of capitalist enterprise , with a simple geographical shift of location .
One more illusion !
The relative rise of Asia is a reality , but precisely one that undermines further the capitalist system .
It does so by overloading the numbers of persons to whom surplus - value is distributed .
The top end of the capitalist system can never be too large , for this reduces ( not increases ) the overall accumulation of capital .
China ’s economic expansion accelerates the structural profit squeeze of the capitalist world - economy .
Where do we go from here ?
It is at this point that we must put into the discussion the other element , the secular trends of the world - system , as opposed to its cyclical rhythms .
All kinds of systems function in the same formal fashion .
The cyclical rhythms are how they operate on a continuing basis , how they breathe if you will .
There are innumerable ups and downs , some more fundamental than others .
But the B - phases never end at the same point as where the preceding A - phases began .
There is always a systemic price to pay for renewing the upward phase of the cycles .
The system has always to move just a little further from equilibrium , even its moving equilibrium .
We may think of each upturn as contributions to slow - moving upward curves , each heading towards its asymptote .
In the capitalist world - economy , it is not all that difficult to discern which curves matter most .
Since capitalism is a system in which the endless accumulation of capital is paramount , and since one accumulates capital by making profits in the market , the key issue for all capitalists is how to produce products for prices that are lower , preferably far lower , than the prices for which they can be sold .
We therefore have to discern what goes into the costs of production and what determines the prices .
Logically , there are three different kinds of costs of production : the costs of personnel ( all personnel ) ; the costs of inputs ( all kinds of inputs ) ; and the costs of taxation ( all kinds of taxation ) .
I think it is not too hard to demonstrate that all three costs have been going up over time as a percentage of the actual prices for which products are sold .
And this is so despite the repeated efforts of capitalists to push them down , and despite the repeated technological and organizational improvements which have increased the so - called efficiency of production .
I shall resume briefly why this is so , and then resume briefly why there are limits to the elasticity of demand .
The costs of personnel may be divided into three categories — the relatively unskilled workforce , the intermediate cadres , and the top managers .
The costs of the unskilled tend to go up in A - periods as a result of some kind of syndical action .
When these costs go too high for given entrepreneurs and particularly for those in the leading industries , relocation to historically lower - wage areas in the B - period is the main remedy .
When there is later on similar syndical action in the new location , a new move occurs .
The moves are costly but effective .
But worldwide there is a ratchet effect .
The reductions never eliminate totally the increases .
Over 500 years , this repeated process has exhausted the loci into which to move .
This can be measured by the deruralization of the world - system .
The increase in the costs of cadres is the result of two different considerations .
One , the increased scale of productive units requires more intermediate personnel , whose salaries augment the personnel bill .
And two , the political dangers that result from the repeated syndical organization of the relatively low - skilled personnel is countered by the creation of a larger intermediate stratum who can be both political allies for the ruling stratum and models of a possible upward mobility for the unskilled majority , thereby blunting its political mobilization .
The increase in the costs of top managers is the direct result of the increased complexity of entrepreneurial structures — the famous separation of ownership and control .
This makes it possible for these top managers to appropriate ever larger portions of the firm ’s receipts as rent , thereby reducing what goes to the “ owners ” as profit or to reinvestment by the firm .
This last increase was spectacular in size during the last few decades .
The costs of inputs have been going up for analogous reasons .
The basic effort of capitalists is to externalize costs , that is , to not pay the full bill for the inputs they use .
There are three main costs one may externalize — handling toxic waste , renewing raw materials , and building infrastructure .
For a very long time , from the origins of the capitalist world - economy in the sixteenth century to the 1960s , such externalization of costs has been taken as absolutely normal .
It was basically unquestioned by political authorities .
In the twenty - first century , when climate change is widely debated , and “ green ” and “ organic ” have become universal buzz words , it is hard to remember that , for five centuries , toxic waste was normally and almost always simply dumped in the public domain .
What happened is that the world has been running out of such vacant public domains — the equivalent of deruralization of the world ’s work force .
Suddenly , the health consequences and costs have become so high and so close to home that a major political response has occurred , in the form of demands for environmental clean - up and control .
The second externalization , that of renewing resources , has also only recently become a major concern , the consequence of the sharp increase in world population .
Suddenly , there is a wide concern about shortages — of energy sources , of water , of forestation , of products of the soil , of fish and meat .
Suddenly , we are worried about who uses what , for what purposes , and who pays the bill .
The third externalization has been that of infrastructure .
Products produced for sale on the world market need transport and communication , the costs of which have gone up as they have become more efficient and faster .
Entrepreneurs have historically only paid a small part of the real bill for infrastructure .
The consequence of all of this has been a political thrust for governments to assume directly some of the necessary costs of detoxification , resource renewal , and further infrastructure expansion .
To do this , governments must increase taxes .
And , unless they wish to go bankrupt , governments have to insist on more internalization of costs by entrepreneurs , which of course cuts sharply into margins of profit of enterprises .
Finally , taxation has been going up .
There are multiple political levels of taxation .
There is also the private taxation of corruption and organized mafias .
For the entrepreneur , it does not really matter to whom the taxes go .
They are a cost .
The size of private taxation has risen as the extensiveness of world economic activity has gone up and the structuration of state bureaucracies has expanded .
However , the major impetus for increased taxation has been the impact of the world ’s antisytemic movements on political culture — what might be called the democratization of world politics .
Popular movements have pushed for three basic state guarantees — education , health , and life - long revenue flows .
Each of these has expanded in two ways over the past 200 years : in the levels of services demanded ; and the geographical locales in which the demands have been made .
The welfare state is good shorthand for such demands .
And there is no government today exempt from the pressure to maintain a welfare state , even if the levels vary , primarily according to the collective wealth of the country .
All three costs of production have risen steadily as a percentage of the real sales prices of products , albeit in the form of an A - B ratchet , over 500 years .
The most dramatic increases have been in the post - 1945 period .
Cannot the prices for which products are sold simply be raised , in order to maintain the margins of real profit ?
That is precisely what has been tried in the post - 1970 period .
This has taken the form of price rises sustained by expanded consumption sustained by indebtedness .
The economic collapse in the midst of which we find ourselves is nothing but the expression of the limits of elasticity of demand .
When everyone lives far beyond their real income , there comes a point where someone has to stop , and fairly quickly everyone feels they have to stop .
The coming together of the three elements — the magnitude of the “ normal ” crash , the real rise in costs of production , and the extra pressure on the system of Chinese ( and Asian ) growth — means that Humpty Dumpty has fallen off the wall , and the pieces can no longer be put together again .
The system is very , very far from equilibrium , and the fluctuations are enormous .
As a consequence , the short - term predictions have become impossible to make , and this tends to freeze consumption decisions .
This is what one calls structural crisis .
From here on in , we are living amidst the bifurcation of the systemic process .
The question is no longer , how will the capitalist system mend itself , and renew its forward thrust ?
The question is what will replace this system ?
What order will be chosen out of this chaos ?
Of course , not everyone is aware of this as yet .
Most people continue to operate as though somehow the system were continuing , using its old rules .
They are not really wrong .
The system does continue to operate , using its old rules .
But now , using the old rules only exacerbates the structural crisis .
However , some actors are quite aware that we are in a bifurcation .
And they know , perhaps only tacitly , that at some point in a bifurcation , the collectivity of all actors leans definitively in one direction or another .
One can say that a decision has been made , even if the use of the word “ decision ” sounds anthropomorphic .
We may think of this period of systemic crisis as the arena of a struggle for the successor system .
The outcome may be inherently unpredictable but the nature of the struggle is very clear .
We are before alternative choices .
They can not be spelled out in institutional detail , but they can be suggested in broad outline .
We can “ choose ” collectively a new stable system that essentially resembles the present system in some basic characteristics — a system that is hierarchical , exploitative , and polarizing .
There are , no doubt , many forms this could take , and some of these forms could be harsher than the capitalist world - system in which we have been living .
Alternatively we can “ choose ” collectively a radically different form of system , one that has never previously existed — a system that is relatively democratic and relatively egalitarian .
I have been calling the two alternatives “ the spirit of Davos ” and “ the spirit of Porto Alegre . ”
But the names are unimportant .
What is important is to see the possible organizational strategies on each side in this definitive struggle — a struggle that has been going on in some form since the world revolution of 1968 and may not be resolved before circa 2050 .
Before , however , one looks at strategies , one must note two crucial characteristics of a structural crisis .
Because the fluctuations are so wild , there is little pressure to return to equilibrium .
During the long , “ normal ” lifetime of the system , these pressures were the means by which extensive social mobilizations ( so - called “ revolutions ” ) had always been limited in their effects .
But when the system is far from equilibrium , exactly the opposite happens .
Small social mobilizations have very great effects .
This is what complexity science refers to as the “ butterfly ” effect .
We might also , in ancient philosophic discourse , call it the moment when free will prevails over determinism .
Prigogine calls this way of understanding complex systems the “ narrow path between two conceptions that both lead to alienation : a world ruled by deterministic laws , which leaves no place for novelty , and a world ruled by a dice - playing God , where everything is absurd , acausal , and incomprehensible . ”
1
The second crucial characteristic of a structural crisis is that neither of the two camps has , nor can have , a vertical structure with a small group at the top calling all the shots .
There is neither a functioning executive committee of the ruling class nor a politburo of the oppressed masses , nor can there be .
Even among those aware of and committed to the struggle for a successor system , there are multiple players , pushing different emphases , co-ordinating poorly with each other .
These two groups of aware militants on both sides are also finding it difficult to persuade the larger groups that form the potential base of their strength of the utility and possibility of organizing the transition .
In short , the chaos of the structural crisis is reflected as well in the relatively chaotic structures of the two camps struggling over the successor system .
What we can do , while in the very middle of this structural crisis , is to try to analyze the emerging strategies that each camp is developing , the better to orient our own political choices in the light of our own moral preferences .
We can start with the strategy of the camp of the “ spirit of Davos . ”
They are deeply divided .
There are those who wish to institute a highly repressive system which openly propagates a worldview that glorifies the role of skilled , secretive , highly privileged rulers and submissive subjects .
They not only propagate this worldview but propose to organize the network of armed enforcers to crush opposition .
There is a second group who believe that the road to control and privilege is via a highly meritocratic system that would co-opt the large number of cadres necessary to maintain the system with a minimum of force and a maximum of persuasion .
This group speaks a language of fundamental change , utilizing all the slogans that have emerged from the antisystemic movements — including a green universe , a multicultural utopia , and meritocratic opportunities for all — all this while maintaining a polarized and unequal system .
And on the side of the camp of the “ spirit of Porto Alegre , ” there is a parallel split .
There are those who envisage a highly decentralized world , one which privileges rational long - term allocations over economic growth , one which makes possible innovation without creating cocoons of expertise unanswerable to the larger society .
This group envisages a system in which a universal universalism will be built out of the never - ending piecing together of the multiple wisdoms that humans have created and will continue to create in their different cultural flowerings .
There is a second group who have been , and continue to be , more oriented to transformation from above , by cadres and specialists who believe they see more clearly than the rest .
Far from being decentralizing , they envisage an ever more coordinated and integrated world - system , a formal egalitarianism without real innovation and without the patience to construct a truly universal but multifaceted universalism .
So , far from a simple twofold battle for the successor system , I envisage a fourfold battle — one between the two great camps and a second one within each of the great camps .
This is a confusing situation — confusing intellectually , morally , and politically .
All the more reason to insist that the outcome is fundamentally unpredictable and uncertain .
What then can we say of the practical steps any of us , as individuals and as groups of diverse kinds and strengths , can and should take to further this process ?
There is no formulaic agenda of action .
There are only lines of emphasis .
I would put at the head of the list actions that we can take , in the short run , to minimize the pain — the pain that arises from the breakdown of the existing system , the pain that arises from the confusions of the transition .
Personally , I would not sneer at winning an election , at obtaining some more benefits within the states for those who have least materially .
I would not sneer at some protection of judicial and political rights .
I would not sneer at combating some further erosion of our planetary wealth and conditions for collective survival .
I would not sneer at any of these , even though I do not consider any of these achievements more than momentary palliatives for immediate pain .
They are not in themselves in any ways steps towards creating the new successor system that we want .
The second thing that we can do is engage in endless serious intellectual debate about the parameters of the kind of world - system we want , and the strategy of transition .
We not only need to do this ceaselessly , but we need to do it with a willingness to hear , as part of the debate , persons we deem of good will if not of our immediate viewpoint .
A constant open debate may bring more insight , will surely build greater camaraderie , and will keep us perhaps from falling into the sectarianism that has always defeated antisystemic movements .
The third thing we can is to construct , here and there and everywhere , on a small or large scale , alternative decommodified modes of production .
We can learn from doing this the limits of many particular methods .
We can demonstrate by doing this that there are other modes of ensuring sensible and sustainable production than reliance on the profit motive as the basis of our reward system .
The fourth thing we can do is to engage in moral debate , to sharpen our sense of the moral negatives of any and all particular modes of action , to realize that balances must be made between the realization of alternative good outcomes .
And through this all , we must put at the forefront of our consciousness and our action the struggle against the three fundamental inequalities of the world — gender , class , and race / ethnicity / religion .
This is the hardest task of all , since there are none of us guiltless and none of us pure .
And the entire world culture that we have all inherited militates against this .
Finally , we must run like the plague from any sense that history is on our side , that the good society is certain to come , if only x or y .
History is on no one ’s side .
A century from now , our descendants may regret all that we have done .
We have at best a 50 - 50 chance of creating a better world - system than the one in which we now live .
But 50 - 50 is a lot .
We must try to seize Fortuna , even if it escapes us .
What more useful thing can any of us do ?

Which is the greater folly :
To fancy that war offers an easy solution to vexing problems , or , knowing otherwise , to opt for war anyway ?
In the wake of 9/11 , American statecraft emphasized the first approach : President George W. Bush embarked on a “ global war ” to eliminate violent jihadism .
President Obama now seems intent on pursuing the second approach : Through military escalation in Afghanistan , he seeks to “ finish the job ” that Bush began there , then all but abandoned .
Through war , Bush set out to transform the greater Middle East .
Despite immense expenditures of blood and treasure , that effort failed .
In choosing Obama rather than John McCain to succeed Bush , the American people acknowledged that failure as definitive .
Obama ’s election was to mark a new beginning , an opportunity to “ reset ” America ’s approach to the world .
The president ’s chosen course of action for Afghanistan suggests he may well squander that opportunity .
Rather than renouncing Bush ’s legacy , Obama apparently aims to salvage something of value .
In Afghanistan , he will expend yet more blood and more treasure hoping to attenuate or at least paper over the wreckage left over from the Bush era .
Advertisement
However improbable , Obama thereby finds himself following in the footsteps of Richard Nixon .
Running for president in 1968 , Nixon promised to end the Vietnam War .
Once elected , he balked at doing so .
Obsessed with projecting an image of toughness and resolve -- U.S. credibility was supposedly on the line -- Nixon chose to extend and even to expand that war .
Apart from driving up the costs that Americans were called on to pay , this accomplished nothing .
If knowing when to cut your losses qualifies as a hallmark of statesmanship , Nixon flunked .
Vietnam proved irredeemable .
Obama ’s prospects of redeeming Afghanistan appear hardly more promising .
Achieving even a semblance of success , however modestly defined , will require an Afghan government that gets its act together , larger and more competent Afghan security forces , thousands of additional reinforcements from allies already heading toward the exits , patience from economically distressed Americans as the administration shovels hundreds of billions of dollars toward Central Asia , and even greater patience from U.S. troops shouldering the burdens of seemingly perpetual war .
Above all , success will require convincing Afghans that the tens of thousands of heavily armed strangers in their midst represent Western beneficence rather than foreign occupation .
The president seems to appreciate the odds .
The reluctance with which he contemplates the transformation of Afghanistan into “ Obama ’s war ” is palpable .
Gone are the days of White House gunslingers barking “ Bring ‘ em on ” and of officials in tailored suits and bright ties vowing to do whatever it takes .
The president has made clear his interest in “ offramps ” and “ exit strategies . ”

So if the most powerful man in the world wants out , why does n’t he simply get out ?
For someone who vows to change the way Washington works , Afghanistan seemingly offers a made - to - order opportunity to make good on that promise .
Why is Obama muffing the chance ?
What Afghanistan tells us is that rather than changing Washington , Obama has become its captive .
The president has succumbed to the twin illusions that have taken the political class by storm in recent months .
The first illusion , reflecting a self - serving interpretation of the origins of 9/11 , is that events in Afghanistan are crucial to the safety and well - being of the American people .
The second illusion , the product of a self - serving interpretation of the Iraq War , is that the U.S. possesses the wisdom and wherewithal to guide Afghanistan out of darkness and into the light .
According to the first illusion , 9/11 occurred because Americans ignored Afghanistan .
By implication , fixing the place is essential to preventing the recurrence of terrorist attacks on the U.S. In Washington , the appeal of this explanation is twofold .
It distracts attention from the manifest incompetence of the government agencies that failed on 9/11 , while also making it unnecessary to consider how U.S. policy toward the Middle East during the several preceding decades contributed to the emergence of violent anti-Western jihadism .
According to the second illusion , the war in Iraq is ending in a great American victory .
Forget the fact that the arguments advanced to justify the invasion of March 2003 have all turned out to be bogus : no Iraqi weapons of mass destruction found ; no substantive links between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda established ; no tide of democratic change triggered across the Islamic world .
Ignore the persistence of daily violence in Iraq even today .
Advertisement
The “ surge ” engineered by Army Gen. David H. Petraeus in Iraq enables proponents of that war to change the subject and to argue that the counterinsurgency techniques employed in Iraq can produce similar results in Afghanistan -- disregarding the fact that the two places bear about as much resemblance to one another as North Dakota does to Southern California .
So the war launched as a prequel to Iraq now becomes its sequel , with little of substance learned in the interim .
To double down in Afghanistan is to ignore the unmistakable lesson of Bush ’s thoroughly discredited “ global war on terror ” : Sending U.S. troops to fight interminable wars in distant countries does more to inflame than to extinguish the resentments giving rise to violent anti-Western jihadism .
There ’s always a temptation when heading in the wrong direction on the wrong highway to press on a bit further .
Perhaps down the road a piece some shortcut will appear : Grandma ’s house this way .
Yet as any navigationally challenged father who has ever taken his family on a road trip will tell you , to give in to that temptation is to err .
When lost , take the first offramp that presents itself and turn around .
That Obama -- by all accounts a thoughtful and conscientious father -- seems unable to grasp this basic rule is disturbing .
Advertisement
Under the guise of cleaning up Bush ’s mess , Obama has chosen to continue Bush ’s policies .
No doubt pulling the plug on an ill - advised enterprise involves risk and uncertainty .
It also entails acknowledging mistakes .
It requires courage .
Yet without these things , talk of change will remain so much hot air .

In 1879 , 15 townspeople in Knock , Co Mayo reported seeing an apparition of the Virgin Mary .
The site has now become a shrine to the event .
Thousands of people from all over Ireland make a pilgrimage to Knock , County Mayo , every year for the August 21 anniversary of the famed 1879 apparition of the Virgin Mary .
Read More : Knock
Shrine to close for what would be its busiest day of the year
The reported apparition began on the evening of August 21 , 1879 .
Mary McLoughlin , the housekeeper to the parish priest of Knock , Co Mayo , was astonished to see the outside south wall of the church bathed in a mysterious light ; there were three figures standing in front of the wall , which she mistook for replacements of the stone figures destroyed in a storm .
She rushed through the rain to her friend Margaret Byrne 's house .
After a half - hour , Mary decided to leave , and Margaret 's sister agreed to walk home with her .
As they passed the church they saw an amazing vision very clearly : standing out from the gable and to the west of it appeared the Virgin Mary , St. Joseph and St. John .
The figure of Mary was life - sized , while the others seemed to be neither as large nor as tall .
They stood a little away from the gable wall , about two feet from the ground .
The Virgin was erect with her eyes toward Heaven , and she was wearing a large white cloak hanging in full folds .
On her head was a large crown .

Mary Byrne ran to tell her family while Mary McLoughlin gazed at the apparition .
Soon a crowd of fifteen gathered , young and old , and all saw the apparition .
The parish priest , Archdeacon Cavanaugh , did not come out , however , and his absence was a disappointment to the devout villagers .
Among the witnesses were Patrick Hill and John Curry .
As Patrick later described the scene : “ The figures were fully rounded , as if they had a body and life .
They did not speak but , as we drew near , they retreated a little towards the wall . ”
Patrick reported that he got close enough to make out the words in the book held by the figure of St. John .
An old woman named Bridget Trench drew closer to embrace the feet of the Virgin , but the figure seemed always beyond reach .
Others out in the fields and some distance away saw a strange light around the church .
The vision lasted for about three hours and then faded .
The next day , a group of villagers went to see the priest , who accepted the report as genuine .
He wrote to the diocesan Bishop of Tuam , then the Church set up a commission to interview a number of the people claiming to witness the apparition .

The diocesan hierarchy was not convinced , and some members of the commission ridiculed the visionaries , alleging they were victims of a hoax perpetrated by the local Protestant constable .
But the ordinary people were not so skeptical , and the first pilgrimages to Knock began in 1880 .
Two years later Archbishop John Joseph Lynch of Toronto made a visit to the parish and claimed he had been healed by the Virgin of Knock .

THE needle on my irony meter leapt off the scale this morning when I read that Pope Ratzinger was praying for all young people who suffer .
He addressed the issue of children during his weekly general audience as he marked the 20th anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , the first legally binding and most widely ratified international treaty to affirm human rights for all children .
My thoughts go to all the children of the world , especially those who live in difficult conditions and suffer due to violence , abuses , sickness war or hunger .
While urging all to join him in prayer , Benedict appealed to world governments to commit themselves to ensuring the treaty ’s goals are met :
So that the rights of children be recognised and their dignity ever more respected .
The irony in this statement lies in the fact that the Vatican has , for years , pointedly evaded its responsibilities in regard to child abuse , and has desperately tried to distract attention from its crimes by accusing other faiths of having even WORSE records .
Although the Vatican has signed the the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which calls for all states to protect children from sexual abuse , it has signally failed to offer such protection .
Â
Indeed , according to this report , Â it has actively engaged in practices that put children at risk .
In a rebuttal to accusations levelled at it at the United Nations Human Rights Council , ( UNHRC ) the Vatican says that protestant churches and even Jewish synagogues have even worse records of child abuse than the Catholic Church .
Which is a blatant LIE !
The accusations were made by Keith Porteous Wood , of the National Secular Society who was speaking on behalf of the International Humanist and Ethical Union ( IHEU ) .
He alleged at a meeting of the Human Rights Council that the Vatican had failed to provide the mandatory reports to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child .
Its reports were now fifteen years overdue .
According to a report on the NSS website :
It [ the Vatican ] has now grudgingly offered to provide just one paragraph on abuse by priests which has led to compensation being paid all over the world running to billions of dollars .
Wood pointed out that the Catholic Church had an appalling record of cover-ups , evasions , moving around of offending priests and making counter accusations of lying against victims who spoke up .
He said :
The Vatican ’s record on this is truly shocking .
It has shown little remorse for the suffering inflicted on tens of thousands of innocent children over the years .
In fact , it has tried very hard to cover up and evade responsibility .
We have called on the international community to stop pussy - footing around the Vatican and to hold it to account for the misery it has inflicted on countless people .
We want the Vatican to be made to face up to its responsibility and accept its culpability .
He added that the Vatican had compounded the distress of victims by constantly trying to belittle their suffering or to evade responsibility for it altogether .
Victim groups around the world will tell you that closure is just about impossible when the abusers are protected by the church and the victims are made to feel that they are , in some way , responsible for their exploitation .
The Vatican really must be challenged to change its ways and to show some repentance not only for the deeds of its priests but for its own conspiracy to try to sweep the whole dreadful business under the carpet .
The complacency exhibited by this supposed rebuttal shows that the problem goes to the most senior level in the Church .
In an article entitled I Shot the Pope in this month ’s New Humanist , Wood describes in detail how he was given a rare opportunity to call the Vatican to account at the United Nations – and how badly the Vatican hierarchy reacted to his accusations .
Said Wood :
Clearly , the Vatican has shot itself in the foot , and I am very happy to have given them the bullet with which to do it .
The hundreds of thousands of victims of the Church ’s cruelty deserve no less .
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says children should enjoy a full range of human rights , including civil , cultural , economic , political and social ones .
It says they have the right to survival and protection from harmful influences , abuse and exploitation .
It says they have the right to develop to their fullest potential and to participate fully in family , cultural and social life .
A series of initiatives are planned for this week around the world to mark the anniversary .
COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - A Sri Lankan - born billionaire ’s arrest in the largest U.S. hedge fund insider trading case triggered new scrutiny on Monday in his native country over the possibility his money found its way to the Tamil Tiger rebels .

U.S. authorities on Friday charged Raj Rajaratnam , the 52 - year - old founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund , and others with making up to $ 20 million in illegal profits through a network of secret informants .
The arrest sent ripples through Rajaratnam ’s native Sri Lanka , where he is at once viewed with admiration for his success and suspicion because of at least $ 5 million U.S. records show he gave to the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization ( TRO ) .
Rajaratnam has not been charged with any crime in Sri Lanka , nor has the United States charged him in the case of the TRO .
The TRO ’s funds were frozen in both countries after they were found to have been channeled to the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , defeated by the army in May to end a 25 - year war .
But both the central bank , responsible for tracking financial crimes , and the Sri Lankan Securities and Exchange Commission said they were probing Rajaratnam and his dealings .
“ The TRO investigations are continuing .
It ’s not clear yet .
The involvement of the Galleon fund with funding the TRO is also being probed , ” Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal told Reuters in Jaffna .
In a sign of Rajaratnam 's influence on the Sri Lankan market , either as an investor or through Galleon Group , the Colombo Stock Exchange .CSE had its biggest intraday drop in five years before recovering to close down 1.56 percent .
Higher economic growth hopes , more market liquidity , a $ 2.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan , an upgraded rating outlook and foreign inflows have all boosted investor confidence since the end of the war .
FOREIGN MINISTRY PROVIDED INTELLIGENCE
DETAILS
The Sri Lankan foreign ministry had passed an intelligence dossier on Rajaratnam to U.S. authorities in 2007 , around the time the TRO was being investigated by the U.S. Treasury , two Sri Lankan officials familiar with the matter said .
The United States , Sri Lanka and Britain all have put the now - defeated LTTE on their banned terrorist organization lists .
The Sri Lankan stock market regulator said it had no suspicion of any untoward dealings by Rajaratnam in its market , but said it would investigate his trades nonetheless .
“ We are looking at his recent transactions closely .
Given what has unfolded in the U.S. , in light of that , we want to look at his positions here , ” Sri Lankan Securities and Exchange Commission Director - General Channa De Silva told Reuters .
The Galleon Group has had as much as $ 7 billion in assets under its control .
By comparison , the total value of outstanding shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange was $ 8.63 billion on Monday .
Rajaratnam ’s arrest in the insider trading case renewed earlier questions about possible links he may have had to the Tamil Tigers .
Rajaratnam has long denied any involvement with the LTTE , which operated extortion and fundraising networks that brought in an estimated $ 200 - 300 million annually at their peaks .
The Wall Street Journal this weekend reported that federal agents had identified Rajaratnam as “ Individual B ” in the indictment against the U.S. head of the LTTE .
The indictment quotes letters among LTTE officials saying “ Individual B ” had a long - lasting desire to meet and discuss with the national leader , ” in reference to LTTE founder Vellupillai Prabhakaran , killed in the final days of the war .
However , a Sri Lankan military intelligence official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Rajaratnam had a “ very cordial relationship ” with the present government .
Last month , he pledged $ 1 million to help rehabilitate former LTTE fighters .
Zembo is a perfect 12 m long day - cruiser , designed by Simon Gorski from Entwurfreich Design Studio ( Germany ) .
The hull of the yacht is made from the recyclable aluminum and has excellent gliding properties and light weight .
Zembo is powered by the energy from a fuel cell in combination with a wave generator and reaches an emission free top speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ) .
The new vessel can accommodate 4 - 6 persons .
The new way of defining the interior space in the day - cruiser is not only visualizing the advantages of material and manufacturing method , but also leads to the possibility of alternative utilization concepts .

Marijuana grows wild in the region , and local women approach foreigners with the greeting , “ Smoke ganja ? ” Until Mr. Solondz ’s arrest , residents said , several bars and hostels catering to foreigners allowed people to openly sell and smoke marijuana .

F.B.I. , 2002
Then , last winter , the authorities swept into the town , at first going undercover , before returning with a translator and encountering Mr. Solondz at the Sun Island bar , popular with Western backpackers .
His parents said the police discovered that he was carrying small amounts of opium and marijuana and he provided fake Canadian identification .
After learning his true identity weeks later , the authorities contacted American consular officials .
A spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing declined to comment on Mr. Solondz ’s case , citing privacy rules .
Phone calls to court officials in Dali and Mr. Solondz ’s lawyer were not answered on Friday .
Mr. Solondz ’s parents frantically tried to find a Chinese lawyer , contacting their representatives in Congress .
On the advice of the U.S. - Asia Law Institute at New York University , they hired Zeng Yuexing , dean of the law school at Kunming University of Science and Technology .
During the trial before three judges at Dali ’s Intermediate Court , Mr. Solondz apologized to the Chinese people and called Dali “ a paradise , ” his father said .
The elder Mr. Solondz said he and his son ’s mother , Bianca Franchi , traveled to China , but were not allowed to obtain a copy of the indictment until after the trial .
They were forbidden to take notes in the courtroom .
Mr. Solondz ’s parents , who never married , were later permitted to see him for an hour at a detention center .
“ After four years of not seeing Justin , there he was in shackles behind glass , ” his mother said .
About 40 Americans are serving time in Chinese prisons , according to the U.S. - Asia Law Institute .
A Chinese lawyer affiliated with the institute who helped Mr. Solondz ’s parents hire Mr. Zeng said the fact that Mr. Solondz is an American and a fugitive wanted by the United States might have played a role in his relatively light sentence .
“ China ’s central government is certainly aware of this case , ” said the lawyer , who asked not to be named for fear of antagonizing the authorities .
“ Diplomatic communication must have influenced the result . ”
( PhysOrg.com ) -- European space agencies and an aerospace giant are developing a new re-entry heat shield that will use superconductor magnets to generate a magnetic field strong enough to deflect the superhot plasma formed during re-entry of returning spacecraft .
They plan to test the new technology by attaching a test module to a missile and using a Russian submarine to fire it into space .
As spacecraft re-enter the Earth 's atmosphere at high speeds super - hot temperatures are produced through friction .
Traditional heat shields use temperature - resistant ablative coatings that burn off on re-entry , or tough insulating materials , such as the tiles used on the space shuttle .
If the new magnetic shielding is successful it could be more reliable and make the craft lighter and easier to re-use , since it would reduce or eliminate the need for other shielding materials .
The project is being run cooperatively by the European Space Agency , EADS Astrium , and the German aerospace center , DLR ( Deutschen Zentrums for Luft - und Raumfahrt ) .
The idea is to use a superconducting coil at front of the craft to generate a strong magnetic field projecting beyond the front of the craft .
The scientists are currently assessing the superconducting coil 's performance , and have not yet finalized the technical details of exactly how they will fit it into a Russian " Volan " escape capsule for the test .
Also uncertain at this stage are the modifications that will be needed to the trajectory to compensate for the deflected air .
Telemetry data recovery will also present challenges because the ionized gases that will form around the craft will block radio signals .
The Volan and its magnetic heat shield would be launched into a suborbital trajectory from a Russian submarine at sea .
The missile , a modified ballistic missile called Volna , would re-enter the Earth 's atmospher at Mach 21 and come back to Earth in the Kamchatka peninsula , a remote region of the Russian Far East .
Detlev Konigorski of EADS Astrim , speaking in Manchester last month at the 2009 European air and space conference , said he expected the test to take place three years after it is approved , and that should be some time in the next decade .

Last night Markos described Democratic losses as " a base problem " and said :
Tonight proved conclusively that we 're not going to turn out just because you have a ( D ) next to your name , or because Obama tells us to .
We 'll turn out if we feel it 's worth our time and effort to vote , and we 'll work hard to make sure others turn out if you inspire us with bold and decisive action .
The choice is yours .
Give us a reason to vote for you , or we sit home .
And you are n't going to make up the margins with conservative voters .
They already know exactly who they 're voting for , and it ai n't you .
And today , Think Progress expands on that point with a look at how Creigh Deeds failed to run as a progressive ... and failed miserably :
NOT PROGRESSIVE ON CLIMATE :
By the end of his campaign , Deeds was running ads attacking Obama ’s clean energy agenda , saying Obama ’s “ cap and trade bill ” would “ hurt the people of Virginia . ”
Other ads carried the same message : “ Creigh Deeds says no to any new energy taxes from Washington . ”
Instead of disputing his Republican opponent ’s false attacks on climate legislation , Deeds amplified them .
Deeds chose to run away from his past record on environment and climate issues . [...]

“ I do n’t think the public option is necessary in any plan ... I would certainly consider opting out if that were available to Virginia , ” he said . [...]

However , despite support from SEIU and the Teamsters , Deeds then proceeded to campaign on an anti-labor platform .
He opposed the Employee Free Choice Act ( EFCA ) — which would have created a fairer path toward unionization for workers — saying it would “ put us at a competitive disadvantage ” and reasserting the false right - wing claim that EFCA would eliminate the secret ballot in union elections . [...]

NOT PROGRESSIVE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM :
More than one in ten Virginians are immigrants .
The Immigration Policy Center also points out that Latinos comprised 2.0 % ( or 74,000 ) of Virginia voters in the 2008 elections — enough to make a difference in a tight race .
Creigh Deeds might regret repeatedly voting in favor of legislation that would hurt a large and growing part of his constituency .
And if you need further proof that running against progressive values is a losing proposition , consider this -- the Republican leadership , deeply concerned about the future of our party , are now urging Democrats to run to the center .
Enough said .
Asked about Doug Hampton 's tactics , John Ensign looked at a reporter , smiled and walked away .

One - man crusade taking toll on Ensign
Five months after Sen. John Ensign admitted to having an extramarital affair with a staffer , the scandal is still in the headlines — in large part because the husband of his onetime lover keeps making them .
Doug Hampton ’s latest stop : “ Nightline . ”
Advertisement
A month after sitting down for hours of interviews with The New York Times , the former Ensign aide — and husband of Ensign ’s mistress , Cynthia Hampton — has taped hours of additional interviews with the nationally televised ABC program , which will air a story based on them next week .
Republicans in Nevada and Washington say Hampton is on a crusade against Ensign — one aimed at weakening the Nevada Republican politically and ultimately forcing him out of office .
“ Usually , these types of things are handled directly with the investigative body , whether it is the Ethics Committee or the Department of Justice , and the protagonists do n’t speak until there ’s either a court date or testimony transcripts are released , ” said Eric Ueland , former chief of staff to then - Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R - Tenn . ) .
“ So this is certainly unprecedented . ”
“ He ’s got a strategy on this , ” said Ryan Erwin , a Las Vegas - based GOP strategist who is friends with both men .
“ I think every one of his moves is choreographed . ”
Hampton could not be reached for comment .
Asked about Hampton ’s tactics , Ensign looked at a reporter , smiled and walked away .
The Senate ethics committee has launched a preliminary investigation into Ensign ’s conduct .
Because the committee works in secret , the scope of the probe is not yet known .
The Justice Department has not yet decided whether to launch an investigation , sources said , and it remains unclear whether the department ultimately will pursue a criminal inquiry against the senator .
Hampton ’s interviews with the Times yielded a story that was full of damaging allegations about Ensign ’s conduct after the affair ended .
Those interviews followed an earlier public session in July , when Hampton spoke on the local Las Vegas show “ Face to Face , ” telling host Jon Ralston that Ensign gave Cynthia Hampton severance pay worth more than $ 25,000 — money that if left unreported to the Federal Election Commission could result in a felony charge for the senator .
Ensign ’s aides have said the money was not severance , and they subsequently revealed that the senator ’s parents gave a “ gift ” of $ 96,000 to the Hamptons once the couple left the senator ’s payroll .
Republicans are clearly worried about what Hampton will say this time around — and the next .
Asked about Hampton ’s anti-Ensign campaign , National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) said : “ I do n’t recall ever seeing one like this . ”
But even as Republicans in Nevada and Washington brace for the worst , Ensign may be able to ride out the storm , according to senior GOP officials in both states .
By pressuring Ensign to resign , the GOP could face a distracting intraparty squabble just as it prepares to challenge Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) in what will very likely be the most contested race of the 2010 midterm elections .
And after seeing the media frenzy from their unsuccessful efforts to push Sen.
Larry Craig ( R - Idaho ) from office after he was caught in a bathroom sex sting in 2007 , GOP leaders believe it ’s better to avoid commenting on the matter .
If Ensign were to resign , Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons , a Republican , would choose an interim replacement who would serve until a permanent replacement was elected next November — forcing Republicans to focus on two seats when they want to concentrate all their ability on Reid .
The GOP ’s silence - is - golden approach on Ensign is “ not a conscious strategy , ” said Robert List , a Republican National Committeeman and former governor of Nevada .
“ It ’s the evolution of where it fits in the matrix of what people are genuinely concerned about right now .
People are fired up at Sen.
Reid ; that ’s where the focus is . ”
Last weekend , List and about 200 other people attended a state Republican Party meeting in rural Nevada .
He said Ensign ’s name was barely mentioned .
Absent a damaging new revelation , List said , “ I think the essence of the whole story is pretty much out there . ”
Indeed , Erwin , the Nevada GOP strategist , said that even though Ensign continues to suffer “ another cut every few weeks , ” the question of whether Ensign can survive may depend on whether Hampton can continue to provide fresh material .
There seems to be no end of it .
The New York Times reported that Ensign and Hampton took an official congressional delegation to Iraq in February 2008 and that Ensign called Hampton ’s wife there by telephone .
POLITICO has learned that Hampton was brought on the trip , which also went to Afghanistan , despite the fact that he did not have a security clearance — and that Ensign was the only senator not to bring a military adviser on the trip .
After the trip , it became apparent to people who knew both men that they had feuded abroad , sources said .
Days later , there was a major confrontation at the Capitol Hill home where Ensign lived with several senators , including Sen .
Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , another trip attendee .
Ethics experts say the codel — which records show cost more than $ 10,000 per person — could cause additional ethical problems for Ensign if investigators look at how Ensign used his public office during the affair .
This is the future site of :
whaleoil.gotcha.co.nz
Unsigned British bands could reach the top of the charts , through a new music download site that has won approval from the Official Chart Company to register its tracks as sales .
Ooizit.com , which went live this week , costs £ 9.97 per month to bands , which can promote and sell their music direct to fans through links to Facebook and MySpace pages .
The artists keep all of the royalties .
The company was previously featured on the PDA blog in February .
At the time , it said it aimed to hit 250,000 users by the end of this year .
The full launch has apparently been delayed , as the company claims the same number of unsigned bands as members now - 1,000 - as it did them .
[ Update : a representative for Ooizit says " the site has been closed for much of this year to allow development which is why the number of users has n't dramatically increased since February .
However user numbers are now increasing every day . " ]
However one of its members , rapper Alex Blood , has already used it as a launch pad and gone on to tour with Mark Ronson and Jay - Z and attracted major label interest .
" There are a lot of elements to gaining a place in the Official Charts , from selling enough records through to ensuring your tracks meet the eligibility rules , " said Tom Fearn , the site 's founder .
" However , with OOiZiT.com we make this process simple , easy and ensure that all eligible sales count in the Official Charts . "
The 27 - year - old former DJ is a former digital marketing manager for Daily Mail & General Trust .
He says he was inspired to start OOiZiT.com when he saw how music sales shifted online over the past five years , and wanted to find a way to harness that trend to help new acts .
" I see myself as a thorn in the major labels ' side , a kind of David to their Goliath , rather than one of the horsemen of the digital apocalypse , " Fearn said .
" I think ultimately the labels will adapt and survive .
Realistically , many OOiZiT success stories will go on to be signed by majors .
But while that process is ongoing , it 's great to think we can wrest some of the control away from the EMIs and Sony BMGs of this world . "
Fearn said in February that in five years ' time his aim is " to be the number one resource for new , unsigned UK music artists .
We will have instigated a UK number one in the download charts and be embarking on other versions of the site for other countries and their local markets . "
Legal downloads were included in official singles and albums charts in 2005 , in the face of flagging physical sales .
It was agreed that the charts had to recognise new methods of delivery to the consumer in order to keep the charts relevant .
Downloads now far overshadow physical sales of CD singles , which have all but disappeared as a sales medium .
Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein --
his wife must be an exceptionally important person

GOLDMAN SACHS WIVES HATE TO WAIT
August 5 , 2009 --
GOLDMAN
Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has warned his employees to avoid high - profile spending , as The Post reported -- but his wife evidently did n't get the memo .
Laura Blankfein and her friend Susan Friedman , wife of another Goldman honcho , Richard Friedman , caused a huge scene at Super Saturday in the Hamptons last weekend when they arrived at the event before the noon start time and balked at waiting in line with the other ticket - holders .
" Their behavior was obnoxious .
They were screaming , " said one witness .
Blankfein said she would n't wait with " people who spend less money than me . "
Another observer said the women were so impatient , it was as if they were waiting on line for a kidney transplant instead of a charitable designer clothing sale .
Friedman shouted at the event organizer , " You have lost so much money because of this . . .
Why should we be treated like the $ 650 donors ? "
Sources said Blankfein and Friedman had bought tables with blocks of tickets going for $ 833 apiece , as did many of the women who were waiting patiently in line , happy to raise $ 3.4 million for the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund .
In the end , the hot - headed duo got in at 12:03 p.m. , three minutes after those who arrived before them .
No word on how much of their husbands ' money they spent .
But Lloyd Blankfein -- wary of bad publicity over the big bonuses he and his colleagues expect to collect at year 's end -- has called for an end to conspicuous consumption .
A Goldman Sachs executive was quoted in yesterday 's front - page Post story , " [ Blankfein ] wants to make sure we 're not being seen living high on the hog . "
A Goldman Sachs rep did not respond to requests for comment left at the offices of both Lloyd Blankfein and Richard Friedman .

As part of its " appeal to the common man " mission , Rupert Murdoch ' soccasionally practices a kind of crackpot populism that even more occasionally lands just right on just the right target .

Online newspapers are in deep trouble .
As newspaper owners install paywalls and charge readers for news , research puts the issue in perspective .
Statistics from NAA Nielsen show newspapers own less than one percent of the time US web users spend online .
Huge numbers of readers visit online newspaper sites , but few stay for long or read much .
Martin Langeveld who wrote the story for the Nieman Journalism Lab says this indicates online newspapers need to do more to build market share .
He thinks installing newspaper paywalls and attacking aggregators is only going to harm market share .
Newspapers could fade into irrelevance if publishers do n’t find ways to keep readers on - site for longer and read more pages .
Ironically making readers pay for content is likely to deepen reader relationships , although with far smaller audiences .
NAA / Nielsen stats show newspapers own less than 1 percent of U.S. online audience page views , time spent
Laggards trying to catch up
A recent issue of Science , the weekly journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , was devoted to research into â€ œArdiâ€ or Ardipithecus ramidus , a 4.4 m - year - old hominid species whose discovery deepens the understanding of human evolution .
These latest studies suggest , among other things , that rather than descending from a closely related species such as the chimpanzee , the hominid branch parted earlier than previously thought from the common ancestral tree .
In much of the Arab world , coverage of the research took a different spin .
â€ œAmerican Scientists Debunk Darwinâ€ , exclaimed the headline in al - Masry al - Youm , Egyptâ€™s leading independent daily .
â€ œArdi Refutes Darwinâ€™s
Theoryâ€ , chimed the website of al - Jazeera , the regionâ€™s most - watched television channel .
Scores of comments from readers celebrated this news as a blow to Western materialism and a triumph for Islam .
Two or three lonely readers wrote in to complain that the report had inaccurately presented the findings of the research .
The response to Ardiâ€™s unearthing was not surprising .
According to surveys , barely a third of Egyptian adults have ever heard of Charles Darwin and just 8 % think there is any evidence to back his famous theory .
Teachers , who might be expected to know better , seem equally sceptical .
In a survey of nine Egyptian state schools , where Darwinâ €™s ideas do form part of the curriculum for 15 - year - olds , not one of more than 30 science teachers interviewed believed them to be true .
At a private university in the United Arab Emirates , only 15 % of the faculty thought there was good evidence to support evolution .
The strength of religious belief among Arabs partly explains their reluctance to accept the facts of evolution .
Until recent reforms , state primary schools in Saudi Arabia devoted 31 % of classroom time to religion , compared with just 20 % for mathematics and science .
A quarter of the kingdomâ€™s university students devote the main part of their degree course to Islamic studies , more than in engineering , medicine and science put together .
And despite changes to Saudi curriculums , religious study remains obligatory every year from primary school through to university .
Such choices carry a cost that goes beyond ignorance of Darwin .
Arab countries now spend as much or more on education , as a share of GDP , than the world average .
They have made great strides in eradicating illiteracy , boosting university enrolment and reducing gaps in education between the sexes .
But the gap in the quality of education between Arabs and other people at a similar level of development is still frightening .
It is one reason why Arab countries suffer unusually high rates of youth unemployment .
According to a recent study by a team of Egyptian economists , the lack of skills in the workforce largely explains why a decade of fast economic growth has failed to lift more people out of poverty .
The most rigorous comparative study of education systems , a survey called Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) that comes out every four years , revealed in its latest report , in 2007 , that out of 48 countries tested , all 12 participating Arab countries fell below the average .
More disturbingly , less than 1 % of students aged 12 - 13 in ten Arab countries reached an advanced benchmark in science , compared with 32 % in Singapore and 10 % in the United States .
Only one Arab country , Jordan , scored above the international average , with 5 % of its 13 - year - olds reaching the advanced category .
Other comparative measures are equally alarming .
A listing of the worldâ€™s top 500 universities , compiled annually by Shanghai Jiao Tong University , includes three South African and six Israeli universities , but not a single Arab one .
The Swiss - based World Economic Forum ranks Egypt a modest 70th out of 133 countries in competitiveness , but in terms of the quality of its primary education system and its mathematics - and - science teaching , it slumps to 124th .
Libya , despite an income of $ 16,000 a head , ranks an even more dismal 128th in the quality of its higher education , lower than dirt - poor Burkina Faso , with an average income of $ 577 .
Well aware that their school systems are doing badly , Arab governments have been scrambling to improve .
In an attempt to leapfrog the slow process of curriculum reform and teacher training , many have taken the easy route of encouraging private schools .
In Qatar , for instance , the share of students in private education leapt from 30 % to more than 60 % between 1999 and 2006 , according to the UNâ€™s Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( UNESCO ) .
Syria has licensed some 20 private universities since 2001 ; 14 are up and running .
Yet their total enrolment is dwarfed by the 200,000 at state - run Damascus University alone .
Oil - rich monarchies in the Gulf have spent lavishly to lure Western academies to their shores , but these branch universities are struggling to find qualified students to fill their splendidly equipped classrooms .
Not to be outdone , Saudi Arabia has launched King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ( KAUST ) , a city - sized institution with an endowment of $ 20 billion .
Intended as an oasis of academic excellence , it enjoys an independent board and is the kingdomâ€™s only co-educational institution .
This augurs well for the Saudi elite , but one fancy new university will do little to lift the overall standard of Saudi education .
And it has been attacked by religious conservatives .
A senior cleric who decried the mixing of sexes at KAUST , declaring that its textbooks should be reviewed by religious scholars , was forced to resign from government office .

I do n’t think I need to comment on this , other than to point you to what I have previously written about our education , or lack thereof .
Sea rescue patrols are warning boats off the southern tip of South Australia 's Fleurieu Peninsula after a man was bitten by a shark this morning .
Witnesses say the 24 - year - old man was part of a group spearfishing at Second Valley , south of Adelaide .
He sustained bites to his hand and ankle , but is conscious and talking to paramedics .
He was treated at the scene before being taken to a local medical centre at Yankalilla .
SA Ambulance says he is now being transferred to the Flinders Medical Centre .
Witnesses report there have been a number of shark sightings in the area during the past three weeks , including one estimated to have measured nearly six metres .
The shark , which attacked today , is thought to have only been about two metres long .
The hi-tech equipment , red " On Air " light and the DJs ' patter are no different from those at any radio station .
But step out of the studio and you are greeted by sandstorms , attack helicopters and armoured vehicles bearing machine guns .
At a time when most of us were slumbering happily , at 6.30 am Helmand time today , the words " Good Morning , Afghanistan " boomed forth from the first British Forces radio station in the country .
More than 9,000 troops fighting in the southern province 's war zone were greeted with the upbeat sounds of The Boo Radleys '
Wake Up Boo ! – a track selected by British soldiers around the world to be the first broadcast from the new British Forces Broadcasting Service ( BFBS ) station at Camp Bastion .
" There may be a touch of irony in this choice : ' Wake up it 's a beautiful morning , ' " conceded Nicky Ness , the controller of BFBS .
DJ Dusty Miller , who mimicked Robin Williams 's greeting this morning , added : " Mindful of the very particular brand of humour among our listeners , we were worried what they might foist on us – but we were braced to play whatever they asked for .
The first song played on the ground in any operational theatre tends to get a bit of an iconic status . "

British Forces ' radio has been following the troops around the world since an experimental station was sent up in an Algiers harem during the Second World War .
It has been there through the Aden crisis , the Turkish invasion of Cyprus , the Falklands conflict , the fall of the Berlin Wall , the Balkans conflicts , the handover of Hong Kong and the two Iraq wars , with presenters as diverse as Sir Roger Moore and Kenny Everett .
In Iraq , the team prided itself that it continued to broadcast through mortar attacks and went off - air only once when the building had to be evacuated to clear a rocket that had landed nearby .
But the move to Afghanistan has been a long time coming .
BFBS originally built and shipped a radio studio to Afghanistan in 2007 but it took two years to finally get a site for the equipment and months more for engineers to restore it since it had been buffeted by the harsh desert conditions .
But it finally opened a new chapter in radio history this morning when Mr Miller and his fellow DJ , Dave Simon , began broadcasting across airwaves dedicated to the troops in Helmand and to their families back home .
The ironies the forces have to contend with during their tours of Afghanistan was more than evident in the tracks chosen when the broadcaster asked the forces community to vote for the song that should be the first broadcast .
The Boo Radleys track beat competition from such songs as The Sound of Music sung by Julie Andrews , which includes the famous line : " The hills are alive . "
Other favourites in the poll included Edwin Starr 's Stop The War Now , Razorlight 's Before I Fall To Pieces , Dire Straits ' Brothers in Arms , It Bites ' Calling All The Heroes .
Iron Maiden 's epic Run To The Hills , The Clash 's Rock The Casbah , Leaving On A Jet Plane by John Denver and Take That 's Patience were all in contention too .
The nomination that came in eighth on the list was the Coming Home debut album by three servicemen who have formed The Soldiers to raise funds for service charities including The Royal British Legion and Help for Heroes .
" Many came in with dedications and we will be playing those messages whether the tracks made the top 10 or not , " Mr Miller said .
" As a presenter , I intend to make sure that every single request gets played . "
To the servicemen and women on Helmand 's front line , any contact with home is priceless and that message , Mr Miller said , had come through loud and clear when troops were asked what they wanted from the new station .
While service personnel in Afghanistan have been able to tune into BFBS Radio shows from the UK over the past years , this is the first time they will have their own dedicated station and be able to choose the music , messages and shows that are broadcast .
They will be able to walk in to the station , use a dedicated military phone or online messaging service .
BFBS began broadcasting digitally in the UK six months ago so for the first time relatives will be able to hear soldiers talking live in Helmand as well as send their own messages out .
The mix of dedications with news and music will be broadcast from Afghanistan to the UK three times daily , while those serving in Helmand will hear broadcasts alternating between programmes from Helmand , the UK and bases in Germany .
Immer mehr Menschen entscheiden sich für eine Augenoperation um auf keine Brille oder Kontaktlinsen mehr angewiesen zu sein .
Am Häufigsten wird hierfür die Lasik Methode verwendet .
Doch was verbirgt sich hinter dieser Operations - Technik und welche Kosten entstehen ?
Wann empfiehlt sich die Lasik Methode ?
Eine Augenoperation wird meist durchgeführt , wenn der Patient unter Kurzsichtigkeit , Weitsichtigkeit , Altersweitsichtigkeit oder einer Hornhautverkrümmung leidet .
Hierbei gilt jedoch , dass der Erfolg größer ist , wenn die Dioptrienzahl niedriger ist .
Ob die Augen für die Lasik Methode geeignet sind , muss der Arzt mittels einer Voruntersuchung herausfinden .
Der Ablauf der Lasik Methode
Vor der eigentlichen Augenoperation findet eine gründliche Untersuchung , ein Beratungsgespräch und ein Sehtest statt .
Der Patient erhält wichtige Informationen über die Risiken , den Ablauf und die Kosten .
Um das Risiko von Komplikationen und Nebenwirkungen zu minimieren , ist es wichtig , dass alle Unverträglichkeiten und Allergien genannt werden .
Weiterhin untersucht der Arzt die Hornhaut um festzustellen ob sie sich für das Lasern eignet .
Vor der eigentlichen Operation werden dem Patient Augentropfen verabreicht , die ein leichtes Schmerzmittel enthalten und dafür sorgen , dass das Auge während des Eingriffs nicht austrocknet .
Anschließend werden die Augenlider auseinander gezogen und fixiert , damit nicht geblinzelt wird .
Das Auge wird nun gespült und die oberste Schicht , circa 1 cm breit , eingeritzt .
Diese Schicht wird nach oben geklappt und zur Seite gelegt .
Die Hornhaut liegt nun offen und das Auge wird mit dem Laser so bearbeitet , dass die Brechkraft wieder näher an den Normalwert gelangt .
Während bei einer Kurzsichtigkeit die Hornhaut direkt im Zentrum abgeflacht wird , werden bei einer Weitsichtigkeit die Außenbereiche des Zentrums abgetragen .
Bei der Altersweitsichtigkeit trägt der Arzt den unteren Teil ab und bei der Hornhautverkrümmung wird eine gleichmäßige Wölbung wiederhergestellt .
Anschließend wird das Auge sorgfältig gespült , damit keine Keime oder Fremdkörper zurück bleiben .
Die Hornhaut wird nun wieder zurück geklappt und wie ein Pflaster über die Wunde gelegt .
Meist wächst diese von allein wieder an und muss nicht vernäht werden .
Nach der Operation sind die Augen zwar meist leicht gereizt , doch es ist die volle Sehkraft vorhanden und es treten kaum Schmerzen auf .
Die Kosten einer Augenoperation
Die Kosten dieses Eingriffes belaufen sich auf circa 1500 bis 2000 Euro .
Leider werden diese von den gesetzlichen Krankenkasse meist nicht übernommen , da es sich um einen ästhetischen Eingriff handelt .
Bei den privaten Anbietern ist die Kostenübernahme vom Umfang der Leistungen abhängig , wird jedoch meist auch nicht übernommen .
Mittlerweile bieten viele Kliniken das Augen Lasern auch schon für 500 bis 600 Euro an , jedoch ist bei solchen Angeboten Vorsicht geboten .
Oftmals enthalten diese Verträge versteckte Kosten .
The public debt will likely pass $ 12 trillion this week , up another trillion since March .
With Obama ’s left flank calling for a second stimulus – which is really a third stimulus if you count George Bush ’s tax rebates – there ’s still no serious discussion about how to deal with debt .
The bond market is telling us not to worry .
But if history is any guide , the bond market is wrong .

I ’m referring to Treasury Inflation Protected Securities , TIPS for short , in particular those that reflect long - run inflation expectations .
The current spread tells us to expect annual inflation averaging a bit over 2 percent for the next 30 years .
That would be fairly benign .
And fairly wrong .
Why ?
Because it assumes U.S. political leadership will put the country on a sustainable fiscal path .
I highly doubt it will happen .
In a note to clients last month , Société Générale strategist Dylan Grice explained the connection between debt and inflation .
Turning Milton Friedman on his head , Grice argued that “ inflation is always and everywhere a fiscal phenomenon . ”
Money printing may be the vehicle , but the “ root cause ” of inflation tends to be “ a government unable to pay its way . ”
You see the real inflationary threat is n’t the $ 12 trillion public debt , which on its own is serviceable .
The problem is $ 63 trillion worth of unfunded obligations for healthcare and social security .
Putting these figures in context , the U.S. government ’s total liabilities are 19 times current tax receipts .
“ Bear in mind that the U.S. consumer is widely seen as dead in the water with debt at 1.3 times income , ” says Grice .
There are three ways to confront this mountain of debt .
Scenario 1 : We essentially default , like Argentina , refusing to pay our debts once they ’ve become too burdensome to service .
The dollar would crash as the United States loses access to capital markets .
The government would be forced to print money to pay expenses .
Unlike Argentina , however , we print the currency in which our debt is payable , so this scenario most likely wo n’t happen .
Scenario 2 : We default through inflation .
Policymakers are so desperate to avoid Japan - style deflation that the Fed will keep printing money to buy risky assets while Treasury pours on the stimulus to keep people employed .
The Fed says it wo n’t run the printing press to pay the debt , but if the only alternative is default , they ’ll have no choice .
Scenario 3 : We put Medicare and Social Security on a sustainable path , cutting benefits or raising taxes dramatically .
This would require a level of political will we ’ve never demonstrated .
Right now , TIPS are betting on Scenario 3 .
I hope they ’re right , but just in case , I ’m planning for Scenario 2 .
WASHINGTON --
The U.S. sharply criticized Israel 's decision to move ahead with a building expansion in East Jerusalem , underscoring the rift between the Obama administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to push forward the stalled Middle East peace process .
The U.S. has unsuccessfully lobbied Mr. Netanyahu over the past nine months to agree to a total Israeli construction freeze in the West Bank and East Jerusalem , to underpin negotiations aimed at creating an independent Palestinian state .
Mr. Netanyahu has committed to significantly limiting new settlement activity in the West Bank but has refused any curtailment of building in East Jerusalem , which Israel annexed following the 1967 Arab - Israeli war .
U.S. officials said Tuesday that Israel 's plans to build 900 new housing units in a disputed East Jerusalem neighborhood could further damage Washington 's efforts to revive the peace process .
" At a time when we are working to relaunch negotiations , these actions make it more difficult for our efforts to succeed , " White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
The Slanket , the Snuggie , the Freedom Blanket or the supremely expensive and extravagant Blankoat ?
This is the most important question of the millennium .
You 're about to know the answer .

Those who have n't seen the Snuggie ad or one of its many parodies and are n't aware of the blanket - with - sleeves phenomenon get no sympathy from us .
Unless , you 've just awoken from an eight - month coma , in which case : Welcome back !
To recap , the Snuggie is the most famous and widely marketed of the many blanket - with - sleeves .
The Freedom Blanket originated the idea , the Slanket followed up , and recently , the Blankoat decided to take it into a ridiculous dimension .
But which is the best for you ?
We tried each of them the way they were meant to be worn : on the sofa , lying down , with one fist buried in a bag of Doritos and the other cradling a bottle of beer .
We gained thirty - five pounds , but it was so worth it .

And for those of you who think that the whole blanket - with - sleeves product could just as easily be accomplished with a robe worn backwards ?
We tested that too .

Snuggie ( $ 15 ) : Do n't buy this .
Having the most ironic value contributes nothing to the final product when it 's constructed out of material that 's one step up from a papery hospital gown .
Not only are the sleeves too cramped , the bottom part — the part that keeps your feet warm when you 're lying down — is n't long enough for anyone of a decent height .
I 'm only 5 ' 10 " , and I have to bend my knees to keep all of my body covered .
Bend them !
This body was n't constructed for that .

The Snuggie is also the most static - prone of all the blankets , and comes in such neon colors that surely are not found in nature .
There 's a reason why this is the cheapest of the bunch , which means you should only consider this if you have a plus - sized dog you want to dress up as a radioactive Superman .
Krypto , if you will .
Nobody else should buy it .

Slanket ( $ 38 ) :
The most expensive of the major three , the Slanket is where you turn when you want to make sure you get the best for your blanket money .
It 's 60 inches x 95 inches , so it 's long enough even for people over 6 feet , and is made out of polyester microfibers , so it 's soft and thick .
Essentially , it 's everything the Snuggie is not .

When someone asks why a regular blanket wo n't do , the Slanket is the answer .
The sleeves are wizardy enough to keep you warm and allow enough space for maneuverability ( gaming is the most prominent example ) .
It has the most variety of colors choices — 11 at my count — and is an example of the concept done right .
If you 're serious about staying warm while also keeping your hands one extra layer of material away from being able to fondle your genitals , this is it .

Freedom Blanket ( $ 30 ) :
The original blanket with sleeves has become , unfortunately , lost between the media blitz of the Snuggie and the web - presence of the Slanket .
But it should n't be .
The price , $ 30 , reflects exactly how the Freedom Blanket performs : somewhere in - between the Snuggie and the Slanket .

The Freedom Blanket is n't quite as comfortable as the Slanket , but comparing it to the Snuggie would be like comparing rubbing your face with a cotton towel to rubbing your face with Joaquin Phoenix 's beard .
At 72 inches , it 's also longer than the Snuggie , but still falls slightly short of the Slanket 's 95 inches .
And that 's pretty much the whole story .
If you do n't want a piece of crap like the Snuggie but can't get over the fact that you 're paying a couple Hamiltons for a blanket with sleeves , the Freedom Blanket is a good compromise .
Plus , you 'll sleep well knowing that you 're supporting the people who actually invented the idea instead of someone who knows how to copy very well .

Sruli Recht Blankoat ( $ 330 ) : The Blankoat is to the other three blankets as getting a full service massage is to setting your showerhead into massage mode .
They may sound similar , but it 's an entirely alien concept .
If you have enough money to spend $ 330 on a gigantic 120 - inch long blanket made out of wool from Icelandic sheep , you have enough money to run your heater and walk around in your underwear instead .

But if your question is whether or not the Blankoat does its job , the answer is yes .
With this much material , you can wrap yourself entirely inside the thing — including your head — with only a small hole left for your face .
Having actually never lived in Iceland , or Boston , or anywhere where you actually have to physically move snow away so you can travel , I can't say whether the Blankoat would be worth the money in those situations .

In May , I wrote about how to negotiate your salary .
I argued that following the advice in Jack Chapman 's Negotiating Your Salary : How to Make $ 1,000 a Minute is one of the best ways to improve your financial well - being .
I still believe it .
If you 're looking for work or looking for a raise , you should absolutely read his book .
But negotiation is a skill you can use in other parts of your life , too .
In fact , in You Can Negotiate Anything , Herb Cohen says that we negotiate constantly with our spouses , our children , our parents , our co-workers , and our friends .
The Three Crucial Variables
In every negotiation , Cohen says , there are three crucial variables : power , time , and information .
You can hold the best hand at the table , but if you lack these three things , you 're still going to lose .
Power is the ability to get things done .
If you can generate competition , for example , you 'll have more power during negotiations .
Power also comes from perceived expertise or legitimacy ( “ she 's a famous financial guru , so she must be right ” ) , empathy ( understanding the other person 's side ) , precedence ( “ this is how it 's always been done ” ) , persistence , attitude , and persuasion .
Your side can gain negotiating power through unity — by having every participant committed to the same goal .
Most of all , you gain power when you 're willing to take calculated risks ( not stupid risks ) .

Most of all , you gain power when you 're willing to take risks ( not stupid risks ) .
Time also plays a role .
In negotiations , the side with the most time generally has an advantage .
Patience pays .
No matter how pressed you are , you should always keep your cool , maintaining an appearance of calm .
“ Your deadline is of your own making , ” Cohen writes .
Do n't ignore deadlines , but do n't follow them blindly , either .

“ Your deadline is of your own making , ” Cohen writes .
Do n't deadlines , but do n't follow them blindly , either .
Information is the third crucial variable in negotiations .
The more you know , the better your position .
Do your research before negotiations begin .
And during negotiations , act on whatever new info comes to light .
Cohen is especially keen on picking up unintentional cues from the other side .
Their responses , their questions , and their attitude all convey valuable information .
Power , time , and information are the three main factors during a negotiation .
But there are many subtleties , as well .
In You Can Negotiate Anything , Cohen gives dozens of examples and offers lots of tips .
Let 's look at a few .
Other Factors in Negotiation
The following are just a few of the many factors and tactics that can be used to negotiate effectively :
Detachment
Care — but not too much .
In every negotiation , the side that needs or wants the outcome least has an advantage .
Cohen writes : “ When you feel you have to have something , you always pay top dollar .
You put yourself in a position where the other party can manipulate you with ease . ”
Competition
When you 're negotiating , whether it's to buy a car or to choose where to eat with your spouse , you 'll have more leverage in the negotiation if you have other options .
If there 's competition for your attention , you 're less attached to one particular result .
Playing Dumb
Ah , my favorite negotiation technique .
If you 're negotiating with me , I always know more than I 'm letting on .
I play stupid .
Cohen writes , “ In negotiation , dumb is often better than smart , inarticulate frequently better than articulate , and many times weakness can be strength . ”
When you play dumb , you force the other side to give you more information .
That 's not to say you should be dumb .
On the contrary .
Remember : Information is one of the keys to successful negotiation .
But sometimes it 's better to pretend you know less than you really do .
Cohen says — and I believe this is crucial — you should “ learn to ask questions , even when you think you might know the answers . ”
Asking “ What if ? ”
Cohen says it can be extremely effective to ask the question “ what if ? ” .
What if I haul the lawnmower home myself instead of you delivering it ?
How will that affect the price ?
What if I buy two cases of this wine instead of one ?
What if I pay cash instead of using a credit card ?
Silence
In Negotiating Your Salary , Jack Chapman says that when you receive your salary offer , no matter what it is , your best response is to “ flinch ” — to follow the offer with a long silence .
Cohen would probably agree .
He writes , “ Oddly enough , silence , which is probably easier to carry out , can be just as effective as tears , anger , and aggression . ”
Silence is a powerful tool when negotiating .
Sunk Costs
As you negotiate , sunk costs can work for you or against you .
The reason the car salesman wastes 3 - 4 hours of your time instead of making it a 30 minute transaction is because he knows you 'll have a tendency to take the little $ 100 surprises he throws at you because you 're thinking , “ I 've already spend this long at it — I ca n't just leave . ”
But you can use the sunk - cost fallacy against salespeople when negotiating .
If you 're buying a new refrigerator , you can usually negotiate lower prices and additional concessions if the saleswoman feels she 's already invested so much time in you that she does n't want to lose the sale .
Cohen adds : “ If you have something difficult to negotiate — an emotional issue , or a concrete item that can be stated numerically , such as price , cost , interest rate , or salary — cope with it at the end of the negotiation , after the other side has made a hefty expenditure of energy and a substantial investment of time . ”
You Can Negotiate Anything has tons of other tips , from the effects of attitude to the importance of “ increments of concession ” .
Cohen is an experienced negotiator , and he 's happy to share everything he 's learned .
Thinking Win-Win
Most negotiations are adversarial or competitive : Each side is trying to get the better end of the deal .
But Cohen says this does n't have to be the case .
Many times , the two sides would be better off moving from a competitive mode to a cooperative one ; they should look for win -win scenarios .
This requires a different way of thinking and a different style of negotiation .
“ Successful collaborative negotiation lies in finding out what the other side really wants and showing them a way to get it , while you get what you want , ” Cohen says .
To get to win -win , you need to :
Establish trust .
Strive for cooperation from the start .
Gather information .
Be empathetic — learn what the other side wants and why .
Build on the other side 's needs .
Use them as a platform for constructing a solution .
Ask for help .
Get the other side 's involvement and commitment to create a solution they support .
Moving from competitive negotiation to cooperative negotiation is especially effective during conflict resolution ( as opposed to when you 're simply trying to buy something ) .
As I wrote last summer at my personal blog , too many times traditional approaches to conflict create lose - lose situations , but with creativity and patience , you can achieve wins for both sides .
Note :
This is why I hate the current state of American politics so much .
I 'm frustrated because our government could be collaborative and win-win — but it 's not .
Instead , it 's adversarial , and we end up with a government that 's lose - lose for everyone .
( This problem is just exacerbated by the idiots on radio and TV who insist on stirring the pot . )
Playing the Game
Whether you like it or not , your life is filled with negotiations .
You negotiate your salary , for the price of a car , for the cost of a couch .
You negotiate with your wife about where to spend your summer vacation , with your husband about what color to paint the baby 's bedroom , with your daughter about what time she should be home from the football game .
Cohen acknowledges that some people hate negotiating and do n't want to participate .
“ Certainly that 's your prerogative , ” he writes , “ but remember that in order to achieve a collaborative result in a competitive environment , you have to play the game . ”
[ Emphasis his . ]
If you do n't want to pay the game , your only options are to build complete trust ( which takes a lot of time ) or to just accept the terms you 're given .
By becoming a better negotiator , you 'll not only save ( and make ) more money , but you 'll also become better at conflict resolution .
Of all the books I 've recommended at Get Rich Slowly over the past four years , I think You Can Negotiate Anything and Negotiating Your Salary are two of the best .
Their lessons can have a huge impact on your life .
For more on this subject see :
I 'm a recent convert to the power of effective negotiation .
I 've learned a lot about it this year , and it 's paid off in a big way .
Perhaps that 's why I 'm so passionate about the subject .
I 've seen first - hand just how much money you can save — and earn — by taking the time to negotiate .
I think learning to negotiate could improve your life , too .
This set of stereoscopic pictures were taken by the industrious and artistic Enami , the Japan ’s greatest and most prolific stereo - photographer .
Most of the photos were taken between 1895 and 1910 , during the Meiji , Taisho , and early years of the Showa era .
He died in 1929 .
The stereoview consists in a pair of nearly identical images that appear three - dimensional when viewed through a stereoscope , because each eye sees a slightly different image .
This illusion of depth was be recreated with animated GIFs from Okinawa Soba .

It surprises me , from time to time , how much I still need to justify test - driven development to prospects and would - be course attendees .
Many feel that TDD has crossed the chasm , while others still see TDD as a cultish practice worth marginalizing .
I take some blame for those who find TDD cultish , because until now I have n’t had a strong , sensible , theoretical basis to justify TDD as an idea .
I could do no better than “ it works for me ” or “ my friends like it ” .
That has changed since I ’ve started giving my talk “ Introduction to Agile with the Theory of Constraints ” in which I use concepts from Theory of Constraints to motivate the practices of agile software development , notably those of extreme programming .
If you buy in to ideas from Theory of Constraints or Lean Manufacturing , then I think I now have a stronger argument to justify the core programming practices in extreme programming in particular and agile software development in general .
I do n’t even need all of the Theory of Constraints but rather a simple appeal to fundamental concepts in Queuing Theory .
Queuing Theory ?
Yes , Queueing Theory .
( And I do n’t plan to capitalize that any longer . )
I do n’t proclaim to have any particular expertise in this area , but I have already seen how to use queuing theory ideas in optimizing network - based systems , and I see no reason we could n’t extend that to software delivery systems .
Better , I only need to appeal to a single idea from queuing theory to make my point .
Given a process B , which follows a process A , sometimes in performing B we need to perform some of A again .
We can remove the need to rework by taking some portion of process B and performing it before process A .
This merits a diagram .
If we have this problem
then we can solve it by doing this
and the resulting system will work more efficiently by removing wasteful rework .
I assume here that we derive no significant benefit from the rework itself , which I suppose I must justify , but let ’s not ruin a good story with the truth .
Here I ’ve described the general problem , and by applying it to software development , I can … well , I find it more effective if I save the punchline for the end .
Winston Royce , 1970 , revisited
I imagine you know this diagram
and appreciate that Royce wrote in his now infamous paper that this single - phase waterfall is risky and invites failure .
If you do n’t appreciate that , then I cannot strongly recommend enough your reading the original paper in its entirety , rather than stopping after page 2 as most people have done .
We can apply the queuing theory result I ’ve just cited to this diagram and generate some interesting conclusions .
I ’ll start by focusing in on this portion of the system
We write code , then we test it .
Sadly , we occasionally find a bug which makes us change the code we wrote after we thought we ’d finished it .
That makes a loop of the type we can unravel with our queueing theory result .
Since “ coding ” is process A and “ testing ” is process B , we need to do some testing before we start coding .
It does n’t take long for this to become a virtuous loop where we write only the code we need to write in order to pass the tests we write .
I use the term test - first programming to describe this cycle .
When we practise test - first programming , we design as much detail as we can before writing the first test , then use the tests to help us type in our implementation correctly .
Most teams most of the time can use test - first programming to reduce their defect mistake count to near zero , which increases their productivity and improves their ability to deliver , by helping them waste less time agonizing over whether to fix mistakes late in a release .
I started this way in 2000 when I first discovered JUnit and stopped making silly mistakes in the code I wrote , which I found significantly beneficial in helping me code more confidently .
I still designed most of what I built mostly up front .
After a while , though , I recognized a new process loop : I found some parts of my design difficult to test , or I found some parts of my design did n’t fit together when I tried to type them in .
Returning to our queuing theory result , since “ designing ” is process A and “ doing test - first programming ” is process B , we need to do some test - first programming before we start designing .
It does n’t take long for this to become a virtuous loop where we check our design ideas as we think of them and implement only the parts of the design we can justify needing .
When we include refactoring in our practice , we can confidently “ under - design ” compared to the level of design we expect to need by the end of a task , which I believe amounts to designing appropriately for the code we need to implement right now .
This virtuous loop combines test - first programming and evolutionary design , including guiding principles like “ you are n’t gonna need it ” and the four elements of simple design into test - driven development , where we check our implementation by running tests and we check our design ideas by writing tests .
Where test - first programming helps most teams most of the time reduce their mistake count to near zero , test - driven development helps them reduce their design inventory — mostly code that gets in our way because it does n’t actively help us deliver a feature — to near zero .
This further increases productivity and improves their ability to deliver by helping them waste less time agonizing over design problems they find costly to fix .
I waited until I ’d spent an entire release practising test - first programming before doing more test - driven development .
My transition consisted of trying to do less and less up - front design for each task , letting myself feel comfortable with each new step .
Within two years I estimate I designed about 5 % as much up front as I did before I started practising test - first programming .
I ca n’t measure the corresponding improvement in my design , but I look back at projects that took 3 months before I practised test - driven development that I now feel confident I could complete — truly complete — in one week .
Of course , we ca n’t stop here !
Enter our friend analysis .
To simplify the discussion , I will treat analysis as “ discovering the features we want in our software ” without forcing myself to state too precisely how that happens .
Once again , we have our familiar situation .
Once again , we face the situation where in the process of implementing features we discover new features we need , current features we do n’t need , and learn new things about features we know we need to build .
This adds to our analysis , meaning that we should try test - driving some features before we try to implement others .
It does n’t take long for this to become a virtuous loop in which our desire to implement ( and deliver ! ) features drives them ever smaller , as we extract more concentrated value out of each one .
When we implement feature 12 we learn something about features 23 , 30 and 52 .
We might decide not to deliver feature 30 any more .
We might decide to expand feature 23 to encompass a few more key cases .
We might decide to rush feature 52 to the top of the pile .
Most teams most of the time find that this cycle helps them reduce the number of rarely - or infrequently - used features in their system .
This yet again increases productivity and improves their ability to deliver meaningful software to their stakeholders by eliminating the time wasted on delivering too much of a feature too soon , the time wasted on entire features we thought we needed but realized we do n’t , and the time wasted arguing about what a feature means , rather than writing examples together : business - oriented tests that describe how a feature works in enough detail for the business and technical project community to agree on the conditions of satisfaction for delivering the feature .
I call this behavior - driven development , and refuse to spell it with the u that provides as much value to the word as your appendix does to your body French u , since I ’m writing in English .
Once again , I did n’t coin the phrase , and some might argue against the way I use it , but I find it apt .
This cycle include practices like business and technical people writing examples together , feature injection , feature splitting , and value - based ( rather than cost - based ) planning .
At this point , I think I ’ve done my job .
I believe I ’ve justified not only test - first programming or test - driven development , but full - on behavior - driven development , using only a single result from fundamental queuing theory .
I ’ve made only a single assumption — that we agree on the appropriateness of applying queuing theory to a software development system .
I ’ve tried to add as little as possible to my reasoning in order to keep it as context - free as possible .
As a result I claim that most teams most of the time will benefit from moving along the path from code - and - fix to test - first programming to test - driven development to behavior - driven development .
Now , for homework , what happens when we consider these processes ?
Surely at least one you ’ve needed to deliver more features for software you ’d already deployed .
How well does that work ?
What problems do you encounter ?
What if you applied our new favorite queuing theory result to that rework loop ?
Dr. Oz bringing free medical care to Houston on Saturday Dr. Oz offers a day of help for uninsured
He 's bringing his show — and free medical care — here Saturday
When The Dr. Oz Show arrives in Houston on Saturday , hundreds of uninsured people will get more than advice from a television physician .
They 'll get to see a doctor in person — maybe even Dr. Mehmet Oz — during a day of free medical care at Reliant Center .
Oz , the National Association of Free Clinics and hundreds of volunteers will provide check - ups , tests and minor procedures at no cost to an expected 1,600 people in what may become the largest event of its kind held in the United States .
Video clips from the day will become an October episode of The Dr. Oz Show , a daily syndicated program that premiered last week .
With the nation 's highest uninsured rate , Texas is an ideal location for a day of free care .
This week , the U.S. Census Bureau announced that one in three Harris County adults lacks health insurance .
“ It 's putting a face on the uninsured in America , ” Oz said by phone from his New York City studio .
The ubiquitous cardiac surgeon is among the Oprah Winfrey protégées who have rocketed to fame .
No -cost medical care
While many without health coverage think they have nowhere to turn but the emergency room , the event shines a spotlight on places that offer no -cost medical care , said Nicole Lamoureux , executive director of the National Association of Free Clinics .
The 1,200 member clinics are federal nonprofits where volunteers provide care .
Patients are n't turned away for their inability to pay .
“ So many people who do not have insurance do n't go to the doctor , so they present with more and more illnesses , ” she said .
“ Free and charitable clinics in Texas can help you find a medical home and take care of yourself . ”
Association clinics treated 3.5 million patients in 2008 .
With the economic downturn and job losses that cut medical insurance for many , those same clinics expect to see 8 million patients this year , Lamoureux said .
Texas has more than 50 free clinics , including at least 10 in the Houston area .
“ It 's a big part of how we provide health care in America , ” Oz said .
“ You know the only reason the doctor is there is because he cares about you . ”
Oz added that he was motivated to celebrate the health professionals , including those from Houston 's “ rich supply of medical teaching facilities , ” who give their time and expertise to free clinics .
Lab work available
On Saturday , patients will be sent from triage to one of 150 medical pods .
There will be areas for basic lab work and minor procedures .
Ambulances will be available to take patients to hospitals , if needed .
Afterward , patients will be referred to free clinics in the Houston area for follow - up care .
“ It 's just a wonderful opportunity for people who do n't have insurance , ” said Stacie Cokinos , executive director of downtown Houston 's San Jose Clinic .
“ They 'll be able to see providers there and connect with one of several charity clinics that may be located in their neighborhood . ”
Cokinos said San Jose volunteer nurses , physicians and administrators will be working with patients on Saturday , which will give the clinic exposure to new patients , new volunteers and new donors .
Both Oz and the association have been involved in other mass free clinics , but this is the first time they will work together .
Oz also has a personal connection to Houston .
His wife , Lisa , spent part of her early childhood in Houston while her father and Oz 's mentor , Dr. Gerald Lemole , trained at Baylor College of Medicine with pioneering heart surgeons Dr. Michael DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley .

The TSA says you can't carry a snow - globe onto a plane , even if it fits in your freedom baggie , because they can't measure how much liquid it contains , and therefore it must contain more than three oz of potential explosive , um , water .
TSA , meet Archimedes .
He lived over 2,000 years ago and figured out how to calculate the volume of a object by measuring its displacement .
If you actually believe that 3 oz is a magical high - danger threshold , please consider adding a delightful , hallucinatory element of science to your pseudoscience by putting an Archimedes tank at the checkpoint .
It would be a lovely counterpoint to your other scientific tests , such as the ducking stool and the spirit - rattles .
" Snow globes are not permitted to be carried through security checkpoints , " said Transportation Security Administration spokesman Dwayne Baird .
The reason is that the globes contain liquids , and TSA rules say that only liquids , gels or aerosols in containers of three ounces or less are allowed through security in carry - on bags …
" I would think they would just say ' no , ' because they can't really determine how many ounces are in there , " Baird said .
Snow globes ?
TSA will likely just say ' no '

“ Everybody wants to go to heaven , but nobody wants to die . ” ~ Loretta Lynn
Loretta was singing about kicking the bucket .
Kicking the can is what people do before they kick the bucket .
It is also what Congress does before Treasury bills kick the bucket .
It has become clear to millions of voters around the world that their national governments have not offered statistically viable solutions to the looming budget deficits .
These deficits threaten to consume more than the future revenues available to the various national governments to fulfill their long - term promises and welfare programs for oldsters .
Central bankers can call this to a halt at any time by ceasing to purchase assets .
This would stabilize the monetary base , at least until banks started failing , thereby contracting M1 .
This would produce a depression .
Politicians say they want solutions to the budget deficit problem , but the political price is the replacement of incumbents by newly elected politicians who campaigned on a call for an end to the depression .
Everybody wants to go to heaven : stable money , rising employment , and economic growth .
But nobody wants to walk through the valley of the shadow of death : Great Depression 2 .
So , Congress refuses to face squarely the projected costs of these promises .
Economists tell us that there is still time to fund these programs , if we begin now .
They have told us this every year since the early 1970s .
All that needs to be done is for Congress to fund these future expenditures .
But Congress does nothing .
On the contrary , it increases the amount of unfunded liabilities .
These are now in the range of $ 80 trillion .
Rather than dealing with what are statistically inescapable deficits in an already massive Federal budget , politicians are seeking ways to increase the rate of government spending .
What of the funding of on - budget debt ?
This is now in the range of $ 12 trillion .
Congress does not examine the sources of the funding .
Members assume that the Treasury will be able to find buyers at 0 % interest .
Who , exactly ?
Asian central banks .
Oil - exporting nations , which are all running massive government deficits .
Foreign private investors .
The Federal Reserve System .
This thought is not publicly tolerated : the bankruptcy of the U.S. government .
This could be through hyperinflation above 50 % per annum : a collapse of the dollar .
It could also be done by selective defaults .
But it will be done .
The Treasury will either renege on its debt or else the government will pass laws cutting expected benefits .
Perhaps a combination of these will be the most politically acceptable approach .
There is no way that the Treasury ’s debt will be repaid .
Everyone knows this , including Chinese central bankers and politicians .
When Saturday Night Live opens with a skit on Obama ’s visit to China , where Obama keeps telling President Jintao that China will get its money back , and President Jintao asks him how , exactly , and Obama cannot say , we know that the world knows that America ’s debt is not going to be repaid .
The live SNL audience gets it .
The audience at home gets it .
Everyone gets it .
China is not going to get its money back .
While the skit utilizes some crude humor , the message is clear .
The economic data in the skit are factually accurate .
When the details of America ’s foreign trade disaster can be turned into an SNL skit , the word is out .
Nothing changes .
Nothing will change until China and other Asian nations cease playing kick the can .
MERCANTILISM FOR DUMMIES
Asian politicians have been committed ever since 1945 to a form of mercantilism .
They have exported goods to the West , especially the United States .
They have built up foreign currency reserves : debts issued by the national governments of the importing nations .
China holds over $ 2 trillion in total reserves — not all dollars .
India holds almost $ 300 billion .
These two nations were third - world basket cases as recently as 1990 .
Instead of building up gold reserves , as mercantilist nations sought to do in Adam Smith ’s day , they have accumulated IOUs issued mainly by Western national governments .
Asian central banks have inflated their domestic monetary bases in order to purchase foreign currency - denominated debt .
On the day that they cease buying American debt , other buyers must be found — buyers who think that 0 % per annum is a good rate of return for an asset — the dollar — that is declining in purchasing power .
Asian nations continue to give away their nation ’s goods in exchange for promises of repayment in foreign currencies that will decline in value .
Are they really this stupid ?
No .
They are merely ill - informed economically .
They do not believe Smith ’s Wealth of Nations .
They remain mercantilistic in their thinking .
They think that promises to pay no interest , long - term , is worth buying .
Why ?
Because they began subsidizing their export sectors as the pathway to wealth .
They began inflating in order to keep down the price of their currencies in international markets .
This made it cheaper for Western importers to buy their currencies , and in turn buy exported goods .
Once their domestic investors had invested capital in factories to produce goods for Western consumers , any reduction of the subsidies would threaten unemployment .
They have been riding the digital tiger .
This domestic monetary inflation has created capital market bubbles in their nations .
The governments fear a collapse of their stock markets and real estate markets .
They fear widespread unemployment even more .
So , they have instructed their central banks to inflate .
China has increased M2 by 30 % a year over the last year .
Before , the central bank had inflated at 16 % or so .
China is no longer buying Treasury debt .
It ceased in May 2009 , when holdings peaked at $ 801.5 billion .
This is now down to $ 799 billion .
Then who is buying this debt ?
The Federal Reserve .
It reversed course in June .
Since then , it has accelerated the rate of expansion .
Since August , the adjusted monetary base has risen at about 100 % per annum .
The U.S. Treasury has to roll over its debt every 50 months .
This is down from 70 months in 2000 .
At $ 12 trillion , this is $ 3 trillion a year .
To this must be added an additional $ 1 trillion a year .
This will repeat every fiscal year .
There should be no confusion about where this is heading .
The government ’s share of the economy will increase if the commercial banks refuse to lend , based on the increase in the monetary base .
When they do lend , this will be translated into an increase in M1 .
The money supply will rise unless the FED increases banks ’ legal reserve requirements .
At that point , the FED must decide which tiger to ride : the inflationary tiger or the depressionary tiger .
It can cease buying Treasury debt or keep buying and watch the dollar sink by 20 % , 30 % , or more per year .
Deflationists predict the former .
I predict the latter .
In either case , Asia ’s mercantilism will at long last hit the wall .
Their export industries will hit either the wall of a Great Depression 2 — few orders — or else mass inflation : orders in money not worth holding .
Asian mercantilism is going to fail sometime in the next five years .
From the looks of China ’s recent refusal to add to its holdings of dollars , the central bank may have begun this transition .
The government ’s adoption of a massive Keynesian stimulus package indicates that its economists have realized that mercantilism is for dummies .
So is Keynesianism .
China is playing kick the can .
It is inflating faster than ever .
It is riding the same inflationary tiger that the West is .
It can not get off without moving to the depressionary tiger .
It wants to delay the decision until rising prices for commodities choke off the economy .
TIME PERSPECTIVE
Long - term thinking is not characteristic of politicians .
Their time perspective is limited by the date of the next election .
The owner of a piece of property benefits from any price appreciation of the market value of that asset .
In contrast , a politician cannot legally capture the value of the price appreciation of assets owned by the government .
He is tempted — sorely tempted — to gain for his personal use the value of government assets .
He accomplishes this by performing the equivalent of alchemy : the transmutation of government capital into votes .
When I worked for Congressman Ron Paul in his first term in 1976 , I learned of a policy of agencies in the Executive branch of the Federal government .
When a Congressman voted in favor of some boondoggle that would spend money in his district , the agency would send a press release to the local newspaper , telling of the money that would be spent .
Included in this press release was a reference to the support given to the project by the Congressman .
The message was clear : vote for a boondoggle , and there will be money spent in your district .
“ Get credit for bringing home the bacon ” — in Washington , the most popular form of pork .
There is a popular myth that the government must preserve assets for future generations , because private enterprise wastes resources in the present .
This makes no economic sense .
Private ownership furthers the conservation of assets that owners believe will appreciate .
They want to capture the value of this increase in value .
Politicians are more likely to consume government - owned resources in such a way that incumbents are re-elected .
Civil Service — protected bureaucrats are anxious to gain more control over assets .
The agencies may lease the assets to private industry , thereby capturing the value of the output for the agency or department .
The public is no different .
It also wants to defer the day of judgment .
It wants stable prices , which it now has .
It wants low unemployment .
It is getting the opposite .
It wants low interest rates , which it now has .
It wants economic growth .
The government ’s Bureau of Economic Analysis dutifully now reports this .
Meanwhile , tax receipts in the states continue to fall , indicating economic contraction .
Americans refuse to look at their retirement portfolios and ask this question : “ Will I be able to live comfortably on this capital ? ”
With interest rates at banks under 1 % , the answer is obvious : no .
Yet they do not change .
They do not triple or quadruple their rate of savings .
They do not plan to stay in the work force until 75 or 80 .
They do not buy foreign currencies or gold .
They do not plan to start a business to retire into .
The voters want the government to guarantee them a safe retirement , Medicare benefits , and a stable dollar .
But the government is already so far down the road to default that it can only play kick the can .
We are on the back of a tiger .
To get off the inflationary tiger , the depressionary tiger will maul us .
We want to defer the decision .
PERCEPTION IS NOT ACTION
To perceive what is about to happen is not the same thing as taking evasive action .
People want to believe that the numbers will not get worse for them .
They may believe that things will get worse for strangers , but they do not believe that this could happen to them .
Most people know nothing of all this .
The audience that laughed at the Saturday Night Live skit did not wake up on Sunday morning and say , “ What the Treasury is going to do to China is what it is going to do to the rest of us . ”
They assume the following : “ The Chinese are fools to let us do this to them , but the government would never do this to us . ”
The government has implicitly promised not to default on its sovereign debt .
The trouble with sovereign debt is that it is issued by sovereign governments .
Sovereign governments are sovereign .
That is to say , they are above the law .
They enforce the laws they choose to enforce .
Short of going to war , foreign governments cannot compel compliance .
The voters think they can enforce compliance .
But they can not get blood out of a turnip .
They also can not get money out of a bankrupt government .
Some can .
Everyone can’t .
Everyone thinks , “ I am in the group of citizens who will get paid . ”
Everyone can not be correct about this .
The numbers tell us that there will be a default .
But , psychologically , even the tiny handful of people who understand the implications of the numbers do not all take evasive action .
The cost of action is higher in the short run than the cost of inaction .
It is n’t in the long run , but the long run does not command respect in a present - oriented culture .
This is why kick the can is such a popular pastime .
People assume that the bad numbers will improve merely from the passage of time .
They believe that sovereign governments are sovereign over economic cause and effect .
They do n’t believe in rigorous cause and effect .
They believe in it only insofar as it benefits them personally .
They believe in selective causation .
The acceptance of the idea that the objectively bad numbers will not compound over time is an indication of a person ’s rejection of economic causation .
It is an acceptance of the efficacy of perception without action .
CONCLUSION
Count the personal costs of inaction .
If the bad numbers are compounding faster than the good numbers , draw the correct conclusion : inaction will turn out to be very expensive .
Then take appropriate evasive action .

WASHINGTON 
As foreign investors once again try to buy American industrial assets , the Obama administration is grappling with how to protect national security while promoting economic recovery .
In recent days , the administration has threatened to block the proposed takeover by the Chinese government of a tiny Nevada gold mining company , according to executives for the company , Firstgold .
Administration officials have also raised questions about a bid by a United Arab Emirates - controlled company to buy a large stake of Virgin Galactic , which is trying to build the world ’s first commercial carrier to take tourists into space .
The issues involved are serious enough that the companies involved in the Virgin Galactic deal have agreed to withdraw the application to provide more time for them to be addressed .

― Darth Vader to Jabba regarding Crumb 's manners [ src ]
Salacious B. Crumb was a Kowakian monkey - lizard who worked as a jester in the court of the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure during the Galactic Civil War .
Known for his shrill laughter , Crumb kept his master amused until his death during the rescue of Han Solo by members of the Alliance to Restore the Republic .
Contents show ]
Biography Edit
A male Kowakian monkey - lizard from the planet Kowak , [ 1 ] Salacious B. Crumb was known for his shrill , cackling [ 3 ] laughter and sophisticated sense of humor like his fellow monkey - lizards .
Many individuals of his species served as favored pets among denizens of the underworld , retaining their apparently hilarious - sounding names , and Crumb was no exception , [ 6 ] becoming the unofficial [ 3 ] court jester of the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure .
Crumb 's association with Jabba began when the thief stowed away on the Hutt 's starship , and was found and captured by the Twi'lek Bib Fortuna .
[ 1 ]
Jabba struck up a unique deal with the monkey - lizard :
If Crumb could amuse Jabba at least once a day , he would be allowed to eat and drink as much as he pleased ; if he failed , however , he would be slain .
Crumb lived in this manner for over a dozen standard years , [ 2 ] and henceforth sat beside Jabba to mercilessly tease and imitate captives , amusing his master greatly with his mimicry and laughter .
[ 1 ]
Crumb even imitated visitors , courtiers , and even Jabba himself , and used his position on the Hutt 's dais to steal morsels of food .
Jabba 's noxious pet was tolerated because of the amusement he brought Jabba , and because of his unwavering support for his master . [ 3 ]
Crumb was present at Jabba 's side when the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader arrived in Jabba 's Palace to negotiate with the Hutt , [ 7 ] and later accompanied his master aboard the sail barge Khetanna to celebrate with Vader .
Crumb laughed uproariously as Jabba 's gangsters fired at a herd of banthas , causing Vader to threaten the creature 's life should he laugh again in his presence . [ 8 ]
Crumb was present when members of the Rebel Alliance came to rescue Han Solo from his boss ' clutches .
After Jabba took former Alderaan Princess Leia Organa as his slave and Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker killed his pet rancor Pateesa , he accompanied his boss and his guests on the Khetanna to the Great Pit of Carkoon , where Jabba planned to execute the Rebels along Solo . [ 5 ]
When Skywalker managed to free himself and Leia cut off the lights of the barge , Jabba 's guests , including Crumb , altered and ran in search of an exit from the barge while Organa seized the moment to choke Jabba to death with her chain .
Following the Hutt 's death , Crumb began to bite C - 3PO , almost snatching one of his eyes , but R2 - D2 went to the rescue of the droid and shocked Crumb , who turned away annoyed .
Crumb was eventually killed when the Khetanna was destroyed by the Rebels , who escaped alive . [ 2 ]
Personality and traits Edit
" Salacious was a natural performer , and he was blessed with a panoply of physical features suitable for a crowd - pleasing clown : floppy ears , messy hair , wide - and - oh - so - hypnotic eyes , gangly limbs , clumsy movements , and an infectious cackle .
But he did n't possess much of a brain between those outsize ears . "
― Lugubrious Mote [ src ]
A Kowakian monkey - lizard with a distinctive shrill cackle , Salacious Crumb usually sat on Jabba 's lap , where he frequently stole food and mimicked , as the palace 's unofficial jester , Jabba 's courtiers , visitors and sometimes even Jabba himself .
In fact , Salacious was just tolerated because his antics amused the Hutt and because of his unwavering support of his master . [ 3 ]
Salacious was also known for his lack of respect , a trait which was demonstrated when the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived to negotiate with the Hutt .
Aboard Jabba 's sail barge Khetanna , he laughed uprariously as the Hutt 's gangsters fired at a herd of banthas .
The Sith Lord threatened the jester 's life should he laugh again in his presence . [ 8 ]
According to the mole - flea Lugubrious Mote , Salacious was not very intelligent .
She described him as " dumber than a newborn rancor ' ' . [ 9 ]
Behind the scenes Edit
Salacious B. Crumb was voiced by Mark Dodson and puppeted by puppeter Tim Rose , who also puppeted Admiral Gial Ackbar , in the 1983 film Star Wars : Episode VI Return of the Jedi .
As seen in the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi : The Making of a Saga , Rose actually gave Crumb a voice ( other than Crumb 's laughing as seen in Return of the Jedi ) , which he frequently used in conjunction with the puppet to joke around on set , but his voice was ultimately replaced with Dodson's .
Salacious B. Crumb ended up being actor Anthony Daniels ' favorite character of the series . [ 10 ]
The puppet for Salacious was created by Tony McVey .
It 's name was accidentally created by The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi puppeteer Phil Tippett .
George Lucas had given them the task of deciding the character 's name .
While trying to decide on a name , Tippett and his crew went out to lunch .
They had drunken " a few pitchers of beer " , and on exit Tippett decided to bend down to tie his shoes .
He said " Wait a minute , guys , while I tie my soolacious " , slurring the word " Shoelaces " .
A crew member immediately recognized its potential .
While George Lucas initially rejected the name for Jabba 's jester , he changed it to Salacious and added the word " Crumb " for the character 's surname as an homage to underground comic book artist Robert Crumb . [ 10 ]
According to Michael Carter , the actor who played Jabba 's majordomo Bib Fortuna , in a The Force .
net interview , during the filming of Jedi , there were several scenes which involved Jess and Salacious B. Crumb , but these scenes , according to him , were cut from the final edit of the film . [ 11 ]
However , some of these scenes appeared in the non-canonical " Lapti Nek " : The Music Video from Jabba 's Palace and in Warwick Davis ' documentary Return of the Ewok .

A Paris court has found Google guilty of copyright infringement in a ruling which could have ramifications for its plans to digitise the world 's books .
The search giant must pay 300,000 euros ( £ 266,000 ) in damages and interest to French publisher La Martiniere .
It was one of many to take Google to court for digitising its books without explicit permission .
Google was also ordered to pay 10,000 euros a day until it removes extracts of the books from its database .
Google expressed disappointment at the ruling .
" French readers now face the threat of losing access to a significant body of knowledge and falling behind the rest of internet users , " said a spokesman for the firm .
Serge Eyrolles , head of the French publisher 's union Syndicat National de l'Edition , said he was " completely satisfied with the verdict " .
" It shows Google that they are not the kings of the world and they can't do whatever they want , " he said .
Google wants to scan millions of books to make them available online .
This court case will be seen as a victory for critics of the plan who fear Google is creating a monopoly over information .
Publisher Herve de La Martiniere launched his court case three years ago but Google continued to scan books during this period .
La Martiniere , the French Publishers ' Association and authors ' group SGDL who started the court battle initially demanded that Google be fined 15 m euros ( £ 13.2 m ) .
The book publishers claimed that scanning books was an act of reproduction and , as such , was something that should be paid for .
Google 's plans to establish a digital library have hit several buffers .
It agreed to a settlement with US authors and publishers but is renegotiating after the US Justice Department concluded that the deal violates anti-trust law .
Parkinson ’s Law
By C. Northcote Parkinson
Northcote Parkinson is Raffles Professor of History at the University of Singapore .
This article first appeared in The Economist in November 1955 .
It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion .
Thus , an elderly lady of leisure can spend an entire day in writing and dispatching a postcard to her niece at Bognor Regis .
An hour will be spent in finding the postcard , another in hunting for spectacles , half - an - hour in a search for the address , an hour and a quarter in composition , and twenty minutes in deciding whether or not to take an umbrella when going to the pillar - box in the next street .
The total effort which would occupy a busy man for three minutes all told may in this fashion leave another person prostrate after a day of doubt , anxiety and toil .
Granted that work ( and especially paper work ) is thus elastic in its demands on time , it is manifest that there need be little or no relationship between the work to be done and the size of the staff to which it may be assigned .
Before the discovery of a new scientific law - herewith presented to the public for the first time , and to be called Parkinson ’s Law1 - there has , however , been insufficient recognition of the implication of this fact in the field of public administration .
Politicians and taxpayers have assumed ( with occasional phases of doubt ) that a rising total in the number of civil servants must reflect a growing volume of work to be done .
Cynics , in questioning this belief , have imagined that the multiplication of officials must have left some of them idle or all of them able to work for shorter hours .
But this is a matter in which faith and doubt seem equally misplaced .
The fact is that the number of the officials and the quantity of the work to be done are not related to each other at all .
The rise in the total of those employed is governed by Parkinson ’s Law , and would be much the same whether the volume of the work were to increase , diminish or even disappear .
The importance of Parkinson ’s Law lies in the fact that it is a law of growth based upon an analysis of the factors by which the growth is controlled .
The validity of this recently discovered law must rely mainly on statistical proofs , which will follow .
Of more interest to the general reader is the explanation of the factors that underlie the general tendency to which this law gives definition .
Omitting technicalities ( which are numerous ) we may distinguish , at the outset , two motive forces .
They can be represented for the present purpose by two almost axiomatic statements , thus :
Factor I . An official wants to multiply subordinates , not rivals and
Factor II .
Officials make work for each other .
Full essay in PDF .
You cannot totally dislike a group with that kind of team spirit , so I hope those were not the exact same people carrying the sign that equated the health care bill with the Holocaust .
There was something sort of touching , in an eerie , slightly disturbing way , when John Ratzenberger  the guy who once played the mailman on “ Cheers ”  told the crowd that the health care bill advocates were “ Woodstock Democrats ” like Abbie Hoffman and Wavy Gravy .
The crowd seemed on the old side , but is it really possible that any of them are still worrying about Abbie Hoffman ?
That any of them knew who Wavy Gravy is ?
Was n’t his main claim to fame giving out free granola ?
Is this a problem we need to deal with at the present moment ?
But I digress , sort of .
If the health care vote happens this weekend , perhaps you will want to flip back and forth between the football games .
Try to picture Minority Leader John Boehner as an overage cheerleader with a strange - colored tan .
A while back , Speaker Nancy Pelosi was promising that the House bill would have a “ robust ” public option that would have offered real competition to the insurance companies , thus driving costs down .
But then Pelosi was faced with a mini-rebellion from red state Democrats who were terrified by the news of Republican victories in races having nothing whatsoever to do with Barack Obama , Congress or health care , and she modified the plan .
Now it ’s a nonrobust option , sort of like decaf instant coffee .
And even if it passes , the bill will go to the Senate where everybody is embroiled in an argument over whether the public option should involve a trigger , as Olympia Snowe urges , or an opt - out , which Majority Leader Harry Reid is peddling , or be eliminated altogether so the red state Democrats are pacified and Joe Lieberman does not go through with his threat to filibuster .
Although Lieberman is no longer a Democrat and backed John McCain in the last election , his former party did let him hang around and keep his important committee chairmanship .
Supporting an attempt to kill the Democrats ’ most important piece of legislation through a parliamentary procedure would be a tad churlish .
But there we are .

Give users a Hollywood ending
We can all take a lesson from filmmakers : endings matter .
The way we end a conversation , blog post , user experience , presentation , tech support session , chapter , church service , song , whatever ... is what they 'll remember most .
The end can matter more to users than everything we did before .
And the feeling they leave with is the one they might have forever .
Think of all the movies where the best song is saved for the ending .
A big chunk of " Best Original Song " Academy Award winners have been songs that played only during the closing credits .
They want you to leave the theater with the feeling that song evoked .
When a movie goes through " beta " ( a test screening ) , the studios are n't looking for feedback on the whole damn movie ... they 're measuring audience reaction to the end .
If the audience hates the ending ( too sad , too absurd , too unresolved , etc. ) , that 's what they reshoot .
I was reminded of the power of endings when I went to another Red Rocks concert a few weeks ' back -- this time it was David Gray ( with Aimme Mann and Beth Orton ) .
Whatever you may think of David Gray 's music , the guy gives good encore .
They 're like a whole separate show , and he leaves you feeling with a powerful , emotional , energetic , finale .
It 's not just filmmakers that appreciate The End - - learning theory has known this for a long time .
Students in a classroom are more likely to remember what they learned / heard / did first and last than whatever happened in the middle .
It 's the Recency Effect ( along with its counterpart for beginings , the Primacy Effect ) .
Good teachers try to have more beginnings and endings by breaking up lessons into small chunks , rather than doing a single 45 - minute lecture .
In fact , here 's what matters in my blog posts :
From a retention and recall view , middles suck .
So let 's talk about endings since they 're one of my personal weak spots .
Even when psychology / cognitive science tells us that the end can matter more than the middle , it feels counterintuitive .
We focus so heavily on the meaty - middle while the ending is just a tacked on afterthought .
So what if we left the customer feeling frustrated and unsatisfied with our tech support as long as they know we spent a ton of time trying ?
Who cares if the presentation just ... sort ... of ... fades ... out ... if the rest of it was killer ?
And the ending of a chapter is just another paragraph , right ?
Yes , I want to think more like a filmmaker on this .
As Sacha Molitorisz put it in Now that 's an ending :
" When a film resolves itself well , audiences leave satisfied and content , even if the preceding 90 minutes have been uninspiring .
If , however , the climax is forced or implausible , the preceding scenes will be stripped of any poignancy .
In other words : a terrific ending can make an excellent film a masterpiece ; a dud ending can ruin an otherwise intriguing offering . "
But even if you buy into the power of the ending , the next question is , " What kind of ending ? "
Should it be a Hollywood ending ?
As opposed to , say , an indie finish ?
That depends on your definition and the circumstances , of course .
There 's hollywood endings and then there 's HOLLYWOOD ENDINGS .
Not all Hollywood endings must be happy , and not all indie films must end in complete and utter incomprehensability ( in that " I 'm more unresolved than thou " way . )
It all gets back to what we hope our users will think and feel at the end .
I need to be asking the right questions about my goals , to figure out how to end :
* Do I want to help my users memorize something ?
Then I should stick that at the end , or at least repeat it at the end .
* Do I want to help and motivate my users to do something ?
Then I should end with what the sales / ad / preachers refer to as an inspiring Call To Action .
* Do I want my users to think more deeply ( or more creatively ) about something ?
Then I should end with some things still unresolved ( easy for me since I 've rarely figured anything all - the - way out ) .
* Do I want my users to be curious ?
Then I should end with a teaser ... something that hints at what 's to come , whether it's new products , new capabilities the user will have , new and exciting ways for them to participate , etc .
Leave them with a question ...
* Do I want my users to care about something ?
Then I should end by giving them a damn good reason ... something that touches the emotional side of their brain .
( Note : by " care " I 'm talking about things like , " care about writing software tests " or " care about creating good user docs " or " care about the importance of endings . " )
* Do I want my users to know that we care about them ?
Then make sure the user experience has a satisfying ending , and that means every session .
( Think of how many times you 've bought something online and while the shopping part is compelling , once they 've taken your credit card info you 're lucky to even get a text confirmation on the screen . )
* Do I want my users to feel like they kick ass ?
Then I should focus less on what they think of me or my product , and more on how they 'll feel about themselves as a result of the interaction .
If they experience frustration , confusion , fear , anxiety , intimidation , and so on , that can be an " I suck " experience .
So , endings are crucial .
They 're what sticks .
But why , then , are there so many examples of bad ( or at least wimpy ) endings ?
What do YOU think ?
Do you have any examples of good or bad endings ?

My favorite endings are ones that took you someplace you did n't expect - but yet make a whole lot of new " connections " to all the stuff that came before as well as your own experience .
Good writers / storytellers / movie makers do it well .

I 'm in the process of putting together a presentation on what I have accomplished in my 4 years as the IT Manager at a university residential college and have been trying to work out on what point I wanted to end .
Having just read your post , I 've now gone back and reorganised it to end on a much stronger finish than what I was going to have !
So great article Kathy and good timing :)

" When a film resolves itself well , audiences leave satisfied and content , even if the preceding 90 minutes have been uninspiring . "
I can think of good movies with bad endings but I can't think of a single bad movie with a good ending .
Even if one exists , it certainly would n't leave me satisfied .
" Oh my god , that movie sucked !
Oh , but cool ending " .
NOT .
Likewise , if your presentation sucks , a good ending is n't going to save it .
Posted by : Daniel Berger | Aug 16 , 2006 10:43:55 PM
Sara : excellent point !
It was Mamet , I think , who said that when things happen in the film they should be " surprising yet self - evident " ( I think I made a post on that somewhere on this blog ... )
I like to think of that for teaching , especially , where you set up completely unexpected scenarios , but then afterwards you think , " Of COURSE ... how else could it possibly have worked ? "
Hobbes : good for you , and good luck : )
Daniel : " ... I ca n't think of a single bad movie with a good ending . "
Well , you may have just proved the point -- how can you say that your perception of the movie was n't * changed * ( backward in time , even ) , by the ending ?
How do we know for certain that our opinion of the entire movie was n't altered by the end ?
But I do think that the notion of an ending fixing something no matter how bad it is would be pretty ridiculous , but that 's not what I said .
And if a presentation truly sucks , an ending wo n't fix that , but that 's not what I said .
An ending cannot work a miracle , but it CAN make a big difference in how all that went before it is perceived ( or at least recalled ) .
Brains are full of tricks .
There 's an unrelated but potentially relevant set of studies that have proven that people WILL change their perception of * the very same piece of video visuals * based solely on the quality of the audio .
If the audio is good , their perception / rating of the * visuals * goes UP .
If the quality of the audio is bad , they do not say , " The video was good but the audio sucked " , but rather they honestly believe that the visuals were worse as well .
We know from these studies that the power of audio is ( in this context ) more important than the visuals , because the reverse is not true .
Nobody changed their opinion of the audio based on the visual quality .
In other words , sound has the power to alter our perception of visual quality , but visuals do not have the power to alter our perception of the audio quality .
OK , now I 'm not sure why I brought that up ; )
But at least it does show that our perception of things ( in this case , films ) can be altered by the quality of a particular aspect .
And while I know that her comment was extreme , I worked for a motion picture ad agency ( and did work for several studios ) long enough to see just how much the ending really * did * matter during those tests .
There are lots of other situations , too , where our perception of one thing changes our perception of something else .
I 'll have to do a post on how students rank the quality of their instructors ...

Curses !
Sara stole my comment ! ( nearly ) :-)
I was going to point out that one trap to avoid when thinking of your killer ending is that the end is not necessarily where you think it is .
Just because you 're the one who gave the presentation , or you 're the one who wrote the blog entry , or you 're the one who delivered the stuff that enabled the user experience - do n't be lulled into thinking that you 're the one who gets to say where the ending is going to be .
If one of your customers calls up for support on your product - that 's not a _new_ interaction .
That 's just replacing the ending on the last interaction that you had with your customer .
You did well last time ?
You delivered a kick - a** product to your customer ?
That can all come unravelled when they next talk to you .
Likewise , blog entries .
You 've spent a heap of time coming up with the perfect ending to your article - but if you reply to a specific reader 's comments ... it 's _that_ reply that will be remembered by that reader as the " ending " .
Which reminds me of a philosophy suggested once :
" Live every day as if it were your last .
And one day ... you 'll be right ! "
Posted by : omni | Aug 16 , 2006 11:11:00 PM
omni : you rock .
And I 'm not just saying that so it 'll be the thing you remember ; )
Now I am going to remember this :
" one trap to avoid when thinking of your killer ending is that the end is not necessarily where you think it is .
Just because you 're the one who gave the presentation , or you 're the one who wrote the blog entry , or you 're the one who delivered the stuff that enabled the user experience - do n't be lulled into thinking that you 're the one who gets to say where the ending is going to be . "
You certainly got MY brain spinning .
Hmmmm ... and what if we applied this to beginnings as well ?
( And of course our writing teachers always try to tell us that we should never begin at the beginning )
Posted by : Kathy Sierra | Aug 16 , 2006 11:20:00 PM
Kathy ,
Thank you !
Very smooth ! ;-)
But that 's an excellent idea about beginings !
As an example :
I guess if you get it right , the chances are much higher that the word of mouth " marketing " power of a passionate user base is going to get to new people - begining the association - before your own marketing efforts kick in .
I guess the question that springs to mind is :
Is it possible to ( usefully ) take all of that into account when designing the stuff that our users will experience ?
Or is it counter - productive to try ?
Posted by : omni | Aug 17 , 2006 12:14:28 AM
In the beginning I give the benefit of doubt and pay extra attention .
Then by its own nature my mind wanders .
There is so much processing about right and wrong ( wrt my world view , prior knowledge , this and that )
When the end comes there is automatic realization about the wandering and again I pay extra attention .
Omni :
The philosophy is more like the journey of the seed .
Is fruit / seed the begin or the end ?

Nicely done .
But not quite the complete picture .
Research by the likes of Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahnemann and Dan Arielly show quite clearly that people actually use three factors when evaluating how good an experience was .
One is obviously the ending .
The other two are the trend ( getting better vs. getting worse ) and the highest emotional point .
Interestingly , in most circumstances , the length of time is n't factored into the evaluation .
The best approach when designing an experience is obviously to gradually build up to a high point right at the end .
The ending alone is not enough to create a great evaluation .
Do n't take it from me .
Read it for yourself in Kahnemann 's 2002 Nobel Prize lecture at http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2002/kahnemann-lecture.pdf
Take care when designing experiences , not to design solely for the customer 's thinking brain .
Neurobiology research shows that 95 % of the evaluation of an experience is done through non-conscious evaluation of the emotions and associated feelings the experience evokes .

Great points as ever Kathy , but let 's not underplay the middle - yes it can sag and be flabby but if we 're disciplined it can also conform to Pescian logic and roll us through to the ending .
And not in the style of the middle of a David Gray concert where the prevalent emotion must surely be " will this ever end ? "
Posted by : John Dodds | Aug 17 , 2006 3:32:10 AM
It 's what I 've always called the big pink bow .
We naturally want everything neatly tied off , with nothing left unresolved .
I 'm like this about disagreements - I want resolution .
It drives my husband nuts because I can't let a thing go until we have achieved resolution , while he 's quite happy to put it behind him and move on .
On the subject of presentations , though , I provided training in presentation skills for many years and one of the things I found was that a presentation often worked better if the intended closing paragraph was brought to the beginning , the intended opening paragraph scrapped and a new ending written .
So yes , it always seemed the most tweaking needed to focus on the start and finish .

As a mountain biker racer , VP sales and Enthusiast Blogger for yourmtb.com , my entire thought process is the end game .
1. Winning the race
2. Closing the sale
3 . Writing a good blog people will remember
Your post clued me into a couple of ideas I should use when considering the ending :
1. Race with the end in mind .
Do n't worry about attacking out of the gate .
Stay calm and relax into the course .
Let the other riders burn out .
2 . The preliminary software sales work , i.e. marketing , promotion , conversation , etc. is nothing without the " sale " at the end .
Focus on getting the sale not on everything else .
3 . Write short and simple paragraphs with the ending in mind .
Do n't worry about the guts of the paragraph .
Keep it tight , yet end with a BANG !

What about cultural differences ?
One thing that comes to mind for me is the immense difference between a typical Hollywood movie vs. a typical Asian film .
To generalize , if it 's Asian , the hero is gonna die .
If it 's American , the hero rides into the sunset .
I realize I 'm generalizing here , but I have to wonder if the way you frame your endings should change based on whether you 're presenting to an audience from a different culture ?
Would giving a " big pink bow " to a conservative Japanese client be less satisfying than ... hmmm , now I can't think of a positive way to express killing off the hero .
" Sacrifice the product for the user ! " , maybe ?
Anyway , just wanted to point out that there are different cultural expectations of pacing , ending , and ( I can't wait for the " seduction " post ! ) beginnings .

Posted by : Rimantas | Aug 17 , 2006 10:14:25 AM
The ironic part about this post is that it is LONG ( not unlike many of your posts ) .
I read the first couple of paragraphs , tuned out for the middle , and read the last paragraph or three .
This is n't intended to be a slam or critique , merely an observation of the intersection of your writing style , my reading style , and today 's post .
Posted by : jt | Aug 17 , 2006 10:43:21 AM
It 's a great point you make here .
As a public speaker , I see many times how a good ending is more important than most of what is said .
I think the beginning is a bit more important than the ending just because capturing attention is essentail to have people listening before the end .
One thing I would add about the middle .
Most people do n't think about the pace and timing of the middle .
If the middle is too long , then the user never makes it to the end .
They have checked out before then .
You can put sections in the middle to make it seem less long , but you still have to capture attention at each section to maintain interest .
It 's very formulaic , but the grade school rule of one intro paragraph , three body paragraphs and one concluding paragraph is an actually very useful tool in pacing and flow .

Castaway was a great movie , but its ending really sucked , in my opinion .
The last half - hour , or however long , is just a gradual decline , leading up to a final shot of Tom Hanks with a goofy smile .
The best ending I can think of is the original Super Mario Bros .
The game itself is very solid , and while the " ending " is rather short , it gives you exactly what you want : more gameplay !
You start the game over , but now it 's more challenging .
It 's too bad they did n't continue this in the later games .
On a similar note , Super Mario Bros. 2 has a decent ending , story - wise .
The game does n't really make sense ; none of the enemies are familiar and the method of killing them is kind of absurd .
When you finally beat the last guy , you find out that Mario was dreaming .
It 's kind of cliché , but it makes the entire game sort of make sense .
Years later , I discovered that SMB2 was really a different Japanese game but with different graphics , which explains the different game mechanics .

With regards to the ending of a shopping experience , I think CDBaby rocks above all others .
Here 's the e-mail they send to you after you 've made a purchase :
-- begin
Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination - free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow .
A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing .
Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold - lined box that money can buy .
We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved ' Bon Voyage ! ' to your package , on its way to you , in our private CD Baby jet on this day , Tuesday , August 15th .
I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby .
We sure did .
Your picture is on our wall as " Customer of the Year " .
We 're all exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY .
COM !!
-- end
How 's _that_ for a rousing shopping experience ? =)
Kathy , I dig the bit about sound affecting one 's impression of a visual piece .
When I was younger I used to play a game called Fury 3 .
I could never get the sound to work though so I 'd make my own sound effects .
It was awesome ; I had so much fun with that game .
( Despite my parents coming over to me on occasion to see what the hell I was doing . )

I may be wandering far afield here , but jumping off Graham Hill 's post about evaluating an experience by non-conscious emotional reactions and later comments on audio affecting the video , I 've seen one instance lately that might demonstrate the points .
It 's a commercial by a big aerospace contractor .
The music is soft and lilting , as if it belongs with footage of a picnic .
But the visuals are military aircraft and targeting systems .
( The company uses the same track more effectively in other commercials , for a campaign effect , I guess . )
The spot left me disturbed and confused , and it 's ending was only good because it meant the spot was over .
The power of music and audio quality to make or break an entire av experience , I think , is stronger than many realize .
Thanks for another thoughtful post , Kathy .
As usual , I feel momentarily smarter for having dropped by .

The ending is especially important when the recepient is likely to experience it .
That 's not always the case , you know .
If you make movies or teach , only very few people will actually leave during the show .
But if you are making content for the web or tv , you will probably find that the beginning is even more important than the end .
Because the most difficult part of your job is to make people slow down and read / view whatever you made .
Posted by : Per Esmann Jensen | Aug 18 , 2006 1:23:00 PM
Kathy ,
While I agree that endings are very important ( you 're always as good as your last show ) , and you want to send people off with something to remember , I also think it 's really critical to have a meaty middle that grabs and holds attention .
For example , I read your blog as often as I can , and I must say that each time I read it I feel like I 've just discovered something - a new thought , phrase , concept .
What I 've discoverd is introduced to me in the beginning and maybe punctuated at the end , but it 's the nuggets in that consistently great middle that I remember .
So , please do n't change your style !
As a software interface designer , I think that every task you try to get someone through has an ending - the most satisfying ending ( of course ) is for the user to have gotten there with no pain , feeling smart and pleased that they accomplished what they set out to do , and having the process be learnable and memorable so they want to do it again ( cause in most cases they have to ) .
And if what the user produces as a result of this task delights them , then that 's the Hollywood ending I 'd like .
Does n't happen enough though .
Beginnings ...
The beginning is making the access to the task recognizable , intuitive , and natural .
Middles ...
The middle is the hardest - those clues , both verbal and visual , that guide you through the journey of the task .
So how about after you write something about beginnings , you could consider those middles again .
Maybe you 'd have something more complimentary to say about them ?
Just a thought .

Points well taken and well considered .
But neither the post , nor any of the comments have covered the obvious advice that most expository writers , speakers , or presenters miss :
WRITE / DESIGN THE ENDING FIRST .
When you know where you 're going , first you can build towards it .
Second , it makes editing down much easier : everything that builds toward the ending stays , anything that does n't serve the experience of the ending , dele .
Dollars to donuts that advice given in advance would have saved Karyn ( above ) the trouble of moving endings to the beginning and designing a new ending .
Ending of this comment ?
A question :
Why are n't most blogging tools designed to encourage this strategy as well as desktop word processors or outliners ?
