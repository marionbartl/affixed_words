GM showed off their driver - free Chevy Tahoe at CES in an effort to remove “ driver error ” on the road .
CEO Rick Wagoner says they expect to have these on the road by 2018 .
The video below explains more about this latest innovation .
The USS Cole was attacked by a suicide bomber in the port of Aden .
Seventeen US sailors were killed .
The exact local time was 11:18 a.m. which makes it 2:18 a.m. in Washington .
There is a good chance the phone rang , not at the White House , but this time in Chappaqua N.Y. , at 3 a.m. in the morning .
Read what happened and so much more on Hillary Clinton ’s experience , here .
The Clinton Aides are quick to argue , that the published files are only a part of the whole picture :
“ The schedules are only a guide for Senator Clinton ’s time in the White House and by their nature do n’t include a lot of the very kinds of things that gave her deep experience in her eight years there — calls with world leaders , impromptu meetings and strategy sessions are all omitted from the schedule , ” said Jay Carson , a Clinton campaign spokesman .
“ And some of her greatest influence and experience was as the president ’s trusted adviser — precisely the kind of thing that is invaluable but does n’t make it on a daily schedule . ”
So where are the phone logs ?
Where is her personal schedule ?
Hillary Clinton is free to publish all that to bolster her claim , that she is indeed much more experienced as Senator Obama !
Her claim , she was under sniper fire in Bosnia : Debunked !
Her claim , she was against NAFTA from the start :
Not supported by her WH schedules !
Her claim : “ I ’m delighted to be here with Ambassador Wilson .
He and I did travel together to Africa and , sort of , paved the way for the president ’s trip the following year , which was historic . ”
Not true !
I guess she has some splainin ’ to do .
In collaborazione con successoinrete.com , presentiamo articolo sul prep sheet e sulla sua funzione per migliorare le prestazioni di un website .
Tra gli strumenti che abbiamo a disposizione e che possiamo utilizzare per migliorare le prestazioni del nostro sito web , esiste uno molto utile di cui si sente parlare poco o addirittura nessuno ne parla .
A mio avviso , chiunque abbia un sito internet o abbia in mente di crearne uno , dovrebbe conoscere questo interessante strumento comunemente chiamato dai marketers " prep- sheet " .
Ne hai già sentito parlare ?
In ogni caso spiegherò ora in cosa consiste .
Come per ogni strumento di marketing , potremo comunque vivere senza il prep- sheet , infatti conta l’intera strategia e la somma delle tecniche adottate per ottenere i migliori risultati , ma dato che esiste e possiamo trarne dei grossi vantaggi , per quale motivo dovremo ignorarlo ?
Anzi , da molto tempo per me è un must irrinunciabile .
Il prep -sheet serve a segnalare il proprio sito ai motori di ricerca e alle web directory , ed è un elenco dettagliato di tutte le voci che ci verrà chiesto di inserire , con i paragrafi e le frasi che abbiamo scelto .
Perché è così importante ?
Per risparmiare tempo , e quando abbiamo deciso di procurarci una rendita da internet il tempo diventa il nostro focus principale ; per non fare errori nella segnalazione del sito al motore di ricerca ; per non dover ripetere ogni volta tutta la procedura ; pero non creare frasi in modo veloce senza un’attenta pianificazione .
Tutti questi motivi che rendono valido l’utilizzo di un prep - sheet li può capire bene chi si è trovato a dover inserire per decine di volte il proprio sito nei motori di ricerca e nelle directory , ogni volta partendo da zero .
In questi casi l’odio per la rete diventa un sentimento comprensibile .
Vediamo come si estende un prep-sheet .
Per prima cosa apri un semplice programma per editare testi , WordPad , MS Word , etc. e inizia con : 1 ) Titolo Scegli un buon titolo per il tuo sito .
Non usare parole molto commerciali , altrimenti i motori potrebbero non accettare la tua segnalazione .
Usa parole semplici descrittive e non più di 5 o 7 parole .
Preferibilmente deve essere lo stesso del titolo che compare solla pagina principale del tuo sito .
2 ) URL Qui dovrai soltanto citare la URL del tuo sito ( es : http//:www.ilmiosito.it).
Per non sbagliare copia e incolla questo indirizzo direttamente dalla barra degli indirizzi del tuo browser .
Assicurati del corretto funzionamento del link ; se non dovesse funzionare correttamente la tua segnalazione sarà annullata .
3 ) Descrizione Devi pensare a una descrizione del tuo sito con , al massimo , 15 parole " TOP " .
Non utilizzare virgole né simboli strani e non usare un linguaggio promozionale .
4 ) Commenti Qui dovrai inserire una descrizione un po ’ più lunga , circa 25 parole .
Alcuni motori o directory ti danno la possibilità di inserire questo commento sul perché credi che il tuo sito dovrebbe essere inserito nei loro elenchi .
Approfittane 😉 5 ) Nome dell ’azienda Puoi inserire il nome della tua ditta oppure il nome dell ’URL .
Pensa a cos ’è meglio per descrivere meglio ciò che promuovi ( nel nostro corso gratuito puoi trovare alcuni suggerimenti per scegliere un nome efficace – iscriviti su www.successoinrete.com).
Se il nome della ditta non descrive la tua attività , forse , ti converrebbe inserire un nome con 2 o tre parole più descrittive .
6 ) Domicilio della ditta Città Stato o Provincia Cap Telefono e Fax
Bene , ora sei pronto per inserire il tuo sito nei motori di ricerca e nelle web directory .
Non devi fare altro che controllare che non ci siano errori e successivamente collegarti ai siti dove intendi segnalare la tua Home Page .

バエズとステイが 「ロゼッタストーン」と題されたサーベイを書いているようで、そのドラフトが公開されました。
題名 : Physics , Topology , Logic and Computation : A Rosetta Stone
著者 : John Baez , Michael Stay
URL : http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rose.pdf
[ 追記 date = " 2008-03 - 28 " ] 完成版 は
http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf です。[/追記]
ジョン・バエズは、カリフォルニア大学の先生で異常に精力的な数理物理学者です。マイク（Mike/Michael）・ステイ*1は、「CPS（継続渡し方式）変換をJavaScriptで説明してみるべ、ナーニ、たいしたことねーべよ」でも紹介した人で、Googleの社員です*2。
21世紀のロゼッタストーンとは何か
ロゼッタストーンには、同じ内容が3つの言語で書かれていたそうです；古代エジプト語、ヒエログリフ（象形文字）、古典ギリシア語。そのため、ヒエログリフの解読に役立ったとのこと。
（写真 ：Wikipedia 「 ロゼッタ・ストーン」より）
そんな話に続けてバエズ／ステイ曰く：
At present , the deductive systems in mathematical logic look like hieroglyphs to most physicists .
Similarly , quantum field theory is Greek to most computer scientists , and so on .
So , there is a need for a new Rosetta Stone to aid researchers attempting to translate between fields .
Table 1.1 gives our guess as to what this Rosetta Stone might look like .
現在、数理論理学の演繹システムは、大部分の物理学者にとってヒエログリフのように見えます。同様に、場の量子論は、大部分のコンピューターサイエンスの専門家にとってあたかも古典ギリシア語でしょう。このような分野間の断絶と解離はいたるところで見受けられます。
そこで、分野間をつなぐ翻訳作業をしようとしている研究者の指針となるべき”現代のロゼッタストーン”が必要になります。表1.1は、このロゼッタ・ストーンがどんなものであるかを推測する手がかりを与えます。
その 表1.1はこんなです：
すべての分野を、圏論的な枠組みで眺めるのが基本です。圏論の「対象」と「射」が、各分野で何になるかを示したのが表1.1のロゼッタストーン・ポケットバージョンです。
分野 その分野を圏論で見たときの対象 その分野を圏論で見たときの射 物理 物理系 物理過程 トポロジー 多様体 同境（コボルディズム） 論理 命題 証明 計算 データ型 プログラ ム
このような対応表を、より詳細化することにより、”各分野間の翻訳用辞書＝現代のロゼッタストーン”が手にはいるだろう、という目論見ですね。もっとも、バエズ／ステイ論文はまだドラフトで、計算の部分などはまったく書かれてません。
分野を超えて現れる奇妙な絵
本物のロゼッタストーンにはヒエログリフが含まれていたのですが、現在のロゼッタストーンにも絵記号が登場します。物理、トポロジー、論理、計算の各分野間で翻訳する際に、それら分野ごとの言語からの中間形式、あるいはより普遍的な言語として“絵による言語＝現代のヒエログリフ”があるに違いない、と僕は信じています。
バエズ／ステイ論文から、いくつかの絵を拾ってみると；
まず最初にファインマン図です。
このテの図は、ボブ・クックの「物理系実務者のための圏論入門」のなかで、ヒルベルト空間のモノイド圏の図示として多用されています。
次はこれ ：
これは、デカルト閉圏で成立するとある定理（Δ;(!×1 ) = 1 = Δ ;(1×!)）を絵で描いたものです。同じような描き方で、次はラムダ計算のベータ変換（の特殊ケース）を描くとこうなります。
少しだけ絵の流儀が違うのですが、やっていることは僕の「デカルト閉圏におけるお絵描き計算の基礎」と同じです。
論理の部分では、バエズ／ステイは普通の証明図を使っていますが、最近は証明ネットという絵も使われるようになりました（下の絵はhttp://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~montela/papers/tlca03.pdf から）。
なんか見てるだけで楽しくなるでしょう、えっ、楽しくない、ハー、そうですか。
僕は絵が好 き
ごく最近 も 「非決定性プログラミングだって絵を描いてみれば一目瞭然」なんてエントリーを書きました。「絵を描くのはいいよね」から、他のいくつかのエントリーを参照してます。あと、以下のようなエントリーもあります。アミダとブレイドは、バエズ／ステイ論文でも中心的役割を演じていますよ。
第4回「OpenIDをとりまくセキュリティ上の脅威とその対策」からだいぶ時間がたってしまいましたが、その間にOpenID周辺ではさまざまなニュースが駆け抜けていきました。特に大きいのはOpenID関連の仕様が新しくなったことです。今回はこの新しい仕様であるOpenID Authentication 2.0において変わった点をピックアップして解説します。
今回は、以下のトピックを扱います。
新しい用 語
User - Supplied Identifierによる、ユーザビリティの向上
新し いIdentifierとディスカバリー
ネットの世界に受け入れられつつあるOpenID
さて、去年の暮れからOpenID周辺では重大な変化が次々と起きている状況で、主要なニュースを簡単に洗い出すと以下のようになります。
● 2007年11月30 日
Googleが提供するブログサービスBloggerでOpenIDを使ったコメント投稿がサポート
● 2007 年12月5 日
● 2008年1月23 日
Googleが提供するブログサービスBloggerでOpenID IdPサービス（OpenID 1.1ベース）を提供
● 2008 年1月30 日
多くの読者が容易に想像できるであろうプレーヤーがOpenID Provider（以下、OP）として名乗るだけでなく、実際に試験サービスを開始しました。OPとはOpenID 1.1でのIdPのことです。新しい用語に関してはこの後すぐに解説します。
まただいぶ時間がかかりましたが、OpenID
Authentication 2.0とOpenID
Attribute Exchange 1.0という仕様も正式に採用されることになりました。
これでネットユーザーの相当数がOpenIDのEnd Userになったといえる状況となったのです。これはOpenIDが本格的にWebベースの認証技術の中核になりつつあるといえるでしょう。
この流れについていけるように、今回はOpenID
Authentication 2.0で変わった大きな点を取り上げて解説していきます。まずは新しい用語から学びましょう。
OpenID Authentication 2.0での用語
新しい仕様では少し用語の変更がありました。OpenID 1.1時代からの変更点がある場合はその旨を明記します。
● Identifier
OpenIDにおけるIdentifierはhttpまたはhttpsをschemeとするURI、あるいは2.0からはXRIというURIを拡張した形式で表されたものを指します。
● User - Agent
Webブラウザのことです。
● Relying Party
OpenID 1.1で はConsumerという名前でした。OpenID Identifierを使った認証結果をOPから受け付けるWebアプリケーションを指します。RPと略します。
● OpenID Provider
OpenID 1.1ではIdPという名前でした。OpenID認証サーバのことです。OPと略します。
● OP EndPoint URL
OpenID認証プロトコルで定義されたメッセージを受け付けるURLです。
● OP Identifier
OP を表すIdentifierです。
● User - Supplied Identifier
RPに対してエンドユーザーによって提示されるIdentifierのことで、Claimed IdentifierまたはOP Identifierのことを総称したものがUser-Supplied Identifierです。
● Claimed Identifier
エンドユーザーが所有していると主張するURLのことです。最終的にOPによってエンドユーザーの主張が正しいかどうかを認証という形で検証することになります。
● OP - Local Identifier
OP がエンドユーザーを識別するためにローカルに用いられるIdentifierです。必ずしもエンドユーザーが管理しているものではありません。代理認証（delegating）を行う際に、openid2.local_idというパラメータにOP-Local Identifierを指定します。
以前の記事で取り上げた 「 保存版 ・ OpenID1.1の用語集」を読まれた方はある程度理解できるかと思いますが、
User -Supplied Identifier
OP Identifier
の説明で何か引っ掛かるのではないでしょうか。 具体的には 、User-Supplied Identifier で の「 Claimed IdentifierまたはOP Identifierのことを総称したものが」という部分であり、今まではClaimed Identifierのみが認証開始に取り扱うIdentifierだったのに対して、OP IdentifierというOpenID Providerを表すIdentifierを含めて取り扱っている部分です。
実はこの部分 はOpenID Authentication 2.0で変わった大きな変更点の1つです。まずはこのことに関して解説しましょう。

The days of the American empire might be at an end , Fortune 's Andy Serwer argues .
Play video
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A growing number of top economists believe that the U.S. economy has now toppled into recession .
Alarm bells were set off Tuesday by a grim report on service businesses , which make up the majority of the U.S. economy .
The Institute of Supply Management said that activity in the service sector declined for the first time in nearly five years .
This report also indicated that employers are cutting staff .
The survey covers the retail , transportation and health care industries as well as hard hit areas such as finance , real estate and construction .
Some economists argued that the normally low - profile ISM services reading , coupled with the government 's report Friday showing the first monthly net loss in jobs in more than four years , is proof that recession is now a reality .
" My forecast had been that the recession would begin this quarter , but the hard data was n't there yet , " said Keith Hembre , chief economist of First American Funds .
" But now we 're seeing that .
The service sector is a much larger component of the economy [ than manufacturing ] and this is very much a recession reading . "
The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of whether the economy has entered recession .
But the NBER typically does not declare a recession until well after one has begun .
Weakness spreading
Economists took the latest report as a sign that problems are no longer restricted to just housing and manufacturing .
" We 're definitely seeing conditions spread to more parts of the economy .
The big drop in business activity , that 's a huge red flag , " said Gus Faucher , director of macroeconomics for Moody 's Economy.com .
Faucher said his firm now believes the economy is in a recession but he believes it 's possible that growth will resume in the second half of this year .
However , Faucher noted this will depend upon additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve , coupled with Congress quickly passing a proposed $ 150 billion stimulus package .
That package includes $ 600 tax rebates for most U.S. taxpayers and some temporary tax cuts for businesses .
Economist Bob Brusca of FAO Economics said he doubted that the U.S. was in recession a week ago , but now he believes there 's about a 75 % chance that a recession began in January .
" That 's what recessions do .
They come upon you all of a sudden , " he said .
" When you look back at history , you 're struck by how even - keel it is until the bottom just falls out . "
What 's next for the Fed
Besides the ISM and jobs report , Brusca said he was concerned about the results of the Federal Reserve 's survey of senior lending officers released Monday .
The survey showed a tightening of lending standards for business and residential loans in the past three months .
According to a statement from the Fed , lenders are reporting a " reduced tolerance for risk " as the reason why they are being more cautious .
And even for the relatively safe " prime " residential loans made to borrowers with good credit , 55 % of lenders surveyed by the Fed reported tighter lending standards .
Brusca said this is a major concern for the central bank .
" The Fed has been leaning on banks to not tighten so much , " he said .
Worries about banks tightening their lending standards is one reason why the Fed announced two large rate cuts in just the course of eight days in late January , reducing the key federal funds rate from 4.25 % to 3 % .
Most economists are n't looking for additional cuts of that magnitude , but they do expect more cuts .
Even Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker , who is known primarily for being more concerned about inflation than economic growth , said in a speech Tuesday that " the prominence of downside risks means that further easing ultimately may be warranted . "
Lacker does not get to vote on monetary policy decisions this year , however .
Lacker added that " sluggish growth in the near term " -- not an actual recession -- is the most likely economic scenario .
But he did not completely rule out the possibility of a " mild recession , similar to the last two we have experienced . "
Moody 's Economy.com is forecasting cuts totaling three - quarters of a percentage point over the next three scheduled Fed meetings in March , April and May .
But the markets want more drastic action by the Fed .
The Chicago Board of Trade 's fed fund futures are pricing in a 30 % chance of a quarter - point cut this month , when the Fed is n't even scheduled to meet .
Those futures are also pricing in a 100 % chance of a quarter - point cut in March , and a 28 % chance of a half - point cut during the month , up from virtually no chance of a half - point cut ahead of Tuesday 's ISM report .
LAREDO , Tex . 
When one of the most successful coaches in the history of track and field goes on trial next month in the long - running federal investigation into doping in sports , lawyers for both sides are prepared to reveal that cheating in track is far more widespread than previously known .
The main witness against the coach , Trevor Graham , has said he supplied illicit drugs and advice on their use to Mr. Graham and his camp of elite athletes , including Marion Jones , as well as to many other sprinters and their coaches .
Angel Guillermo Heredia is identified as Source A in the felony indictment .
He agreed to be a cooperating witness three years ago when , according to court filings , investigators confronted him with evidence of his drug trafficking and money laundering .
Since then , Mr. Heredia said , he has provided prosecutors with documentation and with the names of many elite track athletes and Olympic medal winners .
Mr. Graham , who is charged with three counts of making false statements to federal agents , says that he is innocent .
A defense motion to dismiss , which was denied , said the government ’s case had been built on accusations by Mr. Heredia that “ are not true and are merely an effort to attempt to divert attention from his illicit drug dealing and the illicit drug usage by athletes . ”

I love when Cruise pulled off Anonymous 's mask off and it was Xenu .
That 's the moment that made the video right there .
When it 's Xenu and he 's saying " Xenu , Xenu " and everyone is so shocked .
But I feel this should have been two separate videos because I did n't really like the first part , just the second part starting from Tom Cruise on his computer .
The first part deserves to exist , just because it completely is correct in its criticism , but I 'm just saying it was n't fun to watch , and it 's such a starkly different style and the partition is so much they should be separate videos .
What is the message there anyway , that Tom Cruise is only faking being a scientologist ?
I thought I saw something a long time ago with a similar title , but it had an animutation of John Stewart from the daily show , and the anime dragon girl from Dragon Half .
Do you know what that was called ?
Being single , you may find yourself dating many different of the Types of Women discussed in the Fundamental Truths about Women and Midlife Dating Today section of this site .
Right now I ’m going to discuss one type in particular – one of my favorite types … the Party Girl .
Now some women are party girls all the time , yet others are situational party girls … which means they are displaying party girl tendencies because they just got divorced and / or are struggling with being single for the first time in a while .
As a midlife bachelor , it is your duty to entertain these party girl women .
They are a lot of fun – yes !
Here are the Seven Signs You are Dating a Party Girl :
I ’ve personally dated a lot of party girls plus I currently have a bunch of party girl female friends – and I ’d say this list is fairly complete .
Not all party girls display all seven characteristics – but I ’d say if your date or girlfriend has five or more of those seven then she is without question a party girl .
Here ’s an elaboration on each of the seven signs .
1 ) She is under the influence of something every time you go out .
Most of time this means that she drinks to excess whenever you go out .
By “ drinking to excess ” , I do n’t necessarily mean that she gets plowed – she may or may not get plowed .
Rather I mean that she drinks more than minimally … she might have five glasses of wine , for example .
Being under the influence can also refer to drugs – one of my female friend party girls is always taking Vicodin , and then drinks two or three drinks .
When I told her that she was a party girl , she was offended – which I found hilarious .
2 ) She requires a lot of attention .
Party girls are often Attention Whores – women who need a lot of attention , praise , reinforcement , etc .
There is absolutely nothing wrong with a woman being an attention whore … most women appreciate attention , some just require more of it than others .
You have to tell her that she looks hot … you have to notice little things she has done or is wearing … you have to give her a kiss when you see her … maybe hold her hand … maybe write her a cute little note or something .
You get the idea .
Do n’t overdo it though – else you yourself might just become annoying .
3 ) Whenever something good or bad happens , she gets wasted .
The more hardcore party girl will always drink excessively whenever there is either really good or really bad news .
Her solution to just about anything is getting plowed .
If this is the case with the woman you are dating , be careful – too much of anything is n’t good .
4 ) She dresses provocatively .
Assuming your party girl girlfriend is good - looking , then her dressing provocatively can be very hot .
Dressing provocatively is closely related to item 2 ) above – she requires a lot of attention .
You are more likely to get a provocatively - dressed party girl into bed sooner versus any other type of woman – so keep that in mind !
5 ) She often goes out without you .
Party girls love to party – even if you are not always available to go with her .
She may go out and party several times each week – sometimes with you , sometimes with her party girl girlfriends , etc .
She simply loves to go out .
6 ) Your first sexual encounter with her happened on the first or second date .
As a rule , party girls love to have sex .
And since they typically are partying with alcohol , their inhibitions are diminished … which adds up to your lucky day .
When I look back at all the various party girls I have dated in my own past , I had sex with every single one of them on either the first or second date .
And I ’m not really anyone special , mind you .
7 ) You have sex more frequently than normal .
Having a lot of sex – especially during the first few months of a new relationship – is quite common when you are dating a party girl .
This is one reason why I love party girls !
These party girls require a lot of sex because they need attention , and there is nothing wrong with that !
If you do not already know what it is like to date a party girl , then I hope you discover how much fun they are to date .
They are so much more fun than many of the other Types of Women out there .
Enjoy the party .
Paypal is the world 's leading online payment service Web payment firm Paypal has said it will block " unsafe browsers " from using its service as part of wider anti-phishing efforts .
Customers will first be warned that a browser is unsafe but could then be blocked if they continue using it .
Paypal said it was " an alarming fact that there is a significant set of users who use very old and vulnerable browsers such as Internet Explorer 4 " .
Phishing attacks trick users into handing over sensitive data .
Paypal said some users were still using Internet Explorer 3 , released more than 10 years ago .
It lacks many of the security and safety features needed to protect users from phishing and other online attacks .
Legitimate sites Paypal said it supported the use of Extended Validation SSL Certificates .
Browsers which support the technology highlight the address bar in green when users are on a site that has been deemed legitimate .
The latest version of Internet Explorer support EV SSL certificates , while Firefox 2 supports it with an add - on but Apple 's Safari browser for Mac and PCs does not .
" By displaying the green glow and company name , these newer browsers make it much easier for users to determine whether or not they 're on the site that they thought they were visiting , " said Paypal .
The steps were outlined in a white paper on managing phishing , written by the firm 's chief information security officer Michael Barrett and Dan Levy , director of risk management .
In it , they said : " In our view letting users view the PayPal site on [ an unsafe ] browser is equal to a car manufacturer allowing drivers to buy one of their vehicles without seatbelts . "
Paypal described the battle against phishing as a " fast - moving chess match with the criminal community " .

What are these ?
I try to ignore it , but I really am at heart a perfectionist .
I like to do things well , and do things right .
But too often I aspire to be perfect , and instead of planning a course of action and starting something , I do n’t actually get anywhere .
Aspiring to always finish what I start has actually made it harder for me to complete anything , ever .
The idea behind finishing what you start , is , of course , simple .
Set aside time , focus on the task , and go through everything until it is complete .
Do n’t put off part of the project and come back to it .
Get to the end point and then move on to a different task , knowing you have finished with the first .
In theory it sounds wonderful .
I love the concept .
Deal with everything , be done , move on .
And I have thought for a long time that an efficient person operates this way .
Start something and completely finish it .
And then move on to the next thing .
Excellent .
In reality – I do n’t operate this way .
The idea of processing everything related to a task and completing it before starting anything else has made me avoid more tasks than I ’ve completed .
It stymies me from even attempting certain things because I know I wo n’t be able to finish , and it has caused me to abandon many tasks midstream because I realize there ’s no way I ’ll complete them any time soon .
In the past , it has even led me to pay bills late – I would set aside time to sit down and pay all my bills , and then realize I was missing a statement for something , and just abandon the idea entirely for another day .
And then I ’d forget and … whoops .
Some people ca n’t see the forest for the trees .
I have the opposite problem .
I ca n’t see the trees for the forest .
In my present financial life , it may look like I ascribe to the single - minded focus philosophy that finishing what you start entails .
I concentrate on one debt , I pay it off , I concentrate on the next .
This has worked for me , and continues to work much better than any other method I have tried , as far as concentrating my focus on one debt task at a time .
That ’s because I am finishing really small pieces of the overall puzzle , not concentrating on my entire debt profile .
This week , when I started thinking about being done with the credit card debt , and looking at the debts we had left , instead of being excited , I became overwhelmed .
$ 26,000 + to go !
Oh… my .
So to make any progress , I have to narrow my focus and think about the really small picture .
If I think about the big picture – like my debt in general – I just feel overwhelmed .
One thing at a time is how I operate .
As an overall philosophy for my finances being a perfectionist really does n’t work for me .
There are many parts of my financial life that need attention , and many of them are too overwhelming for me to think about dealing with all at once .
For example , our retirement accounts .
I have done some things – I moved my IRA to a company and investment I was happy with , and we ’ve developed a plan to increase my spouse ’s 401 K contributions .
But there are a lot of other pieces of the retirement puzzle that need to be figured out – how much do we need to save now ?
I ’ve started that but I still have n’t gotten to an answer .
What allocation is really best for my spouse ’s 401K ?
Again , I have started thinking about it , but I have only done the most preliminary of research .
In my brain , I feel like I should sit down , do the work , and be done , but in reality I do n’t operate in that manner .
If I tell myself I need to do this start to finish , that will be enough reason to never start .
But letting myself do things at a slower pace , little by little , I will get them done , and not be intimidated by the overwhelming process , to boot .
And so I ascribe to a less than perfect philosophy , both in my financial life as well as the rest of my life .
Ninety percent is the new one hundred percent .
This morning , when I thought for the thousandth time , I really need to clean off my desk , instead of starting , finding a few things I did n’t know how to deal with right then , and abandoning the project , I just made a pile of “ later ” stuff .
Now my desk is 90 % cleaned off and yes , the “ later ” pile might take as long itself as the other 90 % did to deal with , but at least it looks small and annoys me a lot less .
And I can see my desk .
Throughout the day today , I ’ve been picking up tasks to do from that small pile and actually completing them and putting them away , something I would n’t be doing if they were still buried in the other 90 % of randomness that used to be on my desk .
Little things add up , and if I make it a goal to get a little bit done every day , instead of trying to do everything all at once , it does get done .
Eventually .
But at least , it gets done .
In everything from my finances to cleaning my desk to organizing my kitchen .
It gets done .
I make progress , instead of trying to be perfect .
With money and with life .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Countrywide Financial Corp. said late Friday that up to 20 % of its employees stand to get laid off within three months , as the nation 's largest mortgage lender slashes costs in a desperate attempt to stay financially afloat .
The Calabasas , Calif . - based company CFC , announced that it plans to reduce its workforce by 10,000 to 12,000 jobs , or up to 20 % , mostly in areas impacted by lower mortgage - market origination volumes .
Countrywide said that the reductions could be less than projected if the interest - rate environment and outlook for market volume outlook improve .
Based on current interest - rate levels , the company added that it expects total origination volumes will fall about 25 % in 2008 from 2007 .
Countrywide had grown its payrolls rapidly in past years to take advantage of the U.S. boom in real estate .
But it has been hit hard by recent turmoil in home - loan markets , triggered by a wave of subprime defaults , and the lender already has suffered a sharp drop in originations this year .
This turmoil has made it harder for companies like Countrywide to tap debt markets .
Last month , Countrywide borrowed $ 11.5 billion from a group of 40 banks because the company struggled to get financing in the secondary mortgage market or the commercial - paper market .
The lender said that it continues to move its residential - lending business into its federally chartered thrift entity , Countrywide Bank , FSB as it tries to increase liquidity and reduce borrowing costs .
By Sept. 30 , almost all home - loan production will be originated within the bank , according to the company .
Countrywide is the latest company linked to housing to release a wave of pink slips .
Companies in the mortgage and housing sectors have cut more than 80,000 jobs this year .
See running tally of housing - sector layoffs .
American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. AHMIQ , once the 10th biggest mortgage lender in the United States , in early August announced that it was laying off 6,000 workers and then filed for bankruptcy protection .
On Friday , the Labor Department said that U.S. employers cut back hiring in August for the first time in four years , as the downturn in the housing market took its toll on construction jobs and manufacturing employment fell .
See Economic Report .
At the end of 2001 , the year the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to 1.75 % from 6.5 % , Countrywide had fewer than 18,000 employees on its payrolls .
By the end of 2006 , that number had tripled , to nearly 55,000 .
Shares of Countrywide fell 1.5 % to $ 18.21 by the close of trading Friday .
In after - hours trading , they rose 1 % .
Monday is the deadline to take advantage of an unusual opportunity to vote in Democratic and Republican primaries in the same year .
Those who voted in the Democratic presidential primary in February can still switch parties and vote in the June 3 Republican primary , or vice - versa .
But to do so , they must file a change of party affiliation form by Monday .
New Jersey is holding two primary elections this year .
The first , on Feb. 5 , was limited to picking a presidential nominee .
Sen .
John McCain won all of the state 's delegates to the GOP convention while Sen. Hillary Clinton got most of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention .
On June 3 , the Democratic and Republican parties will be nominating one candidate for U.S. Senate and a candidate for each of New Jersey 's 13 seats in the House of Representatives , as well as candidates for local offices .
Republicans will be electing 49 delegates to their national convention in Minneapolis - Saint Paul .
Vice - President Dick Cheney is well known for his discretion , but his official White House biography , as posted on his Web site , may exceed even his own stringent standards .
It traces the sixty - three years from his birth , in Lincoln , Nebraska , in 1941 , through college and graduate school , and describes his increasingly powerful jobs in Washington .
Yet one chapter of Cheney ’s life is missing .
The record notes that he has been a “ businessman ” but fails to mention the five extraordinarily lucrative years that he spent , immediately before becoming Vice - President , as chief executive of Halliburton , the world ’s largest oil - and - gas - services company .
The conglomerate , which is based in Houston , is now the biggest private contractor for American forces in Iraq ; it has received contracts worth some eleven billion dollars for its work there .
Cheney earned forty - four million dollars during his tenure at Halliburton .
Although he has said that he “ severed all my ties with the company , ” he continues to collect deferred compensation worth approximately a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year , and he retains stock options worth more than eighteen million dollars .
He has announced that he will donate proceeds from the stock options to charity .
Such actions have not quelled criticism .
Halliburton has become a favorite target for Democrats , who use it as shorthand for a host of doubts about conflicts of interest , undue corporate influence , and hidden motives behind Bush Administration policy — in particular , its reasons for going to war in Iraq .
Like Dow Chemical during the Vietnam War , or Enron three years ago , Halliburton has evolved into a symbol useful in rallying the opposition .
On the night that John Kerry won the Iowa caucuses , he took a ritual swipe at the Administration ’s “ open hand ” for Halliburton .
For months , Cheney and Halliburton have insisted that he had no part in the government ’s decision about the Iraq contracts .
Cheney has stuck by a statement he made last September on “ Meet the Press ” : “ I have absolutely no influence of , involvement of , knowledge of in any way , shape , or form of contracts led by the Corps of Engineers or anybody else in the federal government . ”
He has declined to discuss Halliburton in depth , and , despite a number of recent media appearances meant to soften his public image , he turned down several requests for an interview on the subject .
Cheney ’s spokesman , Kevin Kellems , responded to questions by e-mail .
Representative Henry Waxman , a liberal Democrat from California and the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform , has argued aggressively that the Bush Administration has left many questions about Halliburton unanswered .
Last year , for example , a secret task force in the Bush Administration picked Halliburton to receive a noncompetitive contract for up to seven billion dollars to rebuild Iraq ’s oil operations .
According to the Times , the decision was authorized at the “ highest levels of the Administration . ”
In an interview , Waxman asked , “ Whose decision was it ?
Was it made outside the regular channels of the procurement process ?
We know that Halliburton got very special treatment .
What we do n’t know is why . ”
Halliburton has been accused of exploiting its privileged status .
Last year , a division of the company overcharged the government by as much as sixty - one million dollars in the course of buying and transporting fuel from Kuwait into Iraq .
Halliburton charged the United States as much as $ 2.38 per gallon , an amount that a Pentagon audit determined to be about a dollar per gallon too high .
Although Halliburton has denied any criminal wrongdoing , the inspector general for the Department of Defense is considering an investigation .
Halliburton blamed the high costs on an obscure Kuwaiti firm , Altanmia Commercial Marketing , which it subcontracted to deliver the fuel .
In Kuwait , the oil business is controlled by the state , and Halliburton has claimed that government officials there pressured it into hiring Altanmia , which had no experience in fuel transport .
Yet a previously undisclosed letter , dated May 4 , 2003 , and sent from an American contracting officer to Kuwait ’s oil minister , plainly describes the decision to use Altanmia as Halliburton ’s own “ recommendation . ”
The letter also shows that the Army Corps of Engineers , the federal agency that oversees such transactions , supported Halliburton ’s decision to use the expensive subcontractor — which may explain why it has been reluctant to criticize the deal .
Scott Saunders , a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers , confirmed the authenticity of the letter , and acknowledged that Halliburton had picked Altanmia .
“ Halliburton told us that only Altanmia could meet our requirements , ” he said .
Experts in the Persian Gulf oil business say that the Altanmia deal looks suspicious .
“ There is not a reason on earth to sell gasoline at the price they did , ” Youssef Ibrahim , the managing director of the Strategic Energy Investment Group , a consulting firm in Dubai , said .
“ Halliburton and their Kuwaiti partners made out like bandits . ”
A well - informed Kuwaiti source called the prices charged by Altanmia “ absurd , ” and said that Halliburton ’s arrangement to buy Kuwaiti oil through a middleman , rather than directly from the government , was “ highly irregular . ”
He added , “ There is no way that this could have transpired without the knowledge and direction ” of Kuwait ’s oil minister , Sheikh Ahmad Al - Fahad Al - Sabah .
Two sources told me that the oil minister ’s brother , Talal Al - Fahad Al - Sabah , may have secret financial ties to Altanmia .
( The brothers are also nephews of the Emir and the Prime Minister of Kuwait . )
“ There are calls in parliament to open an investigation , ” the Kuwaiti source said .
“ It could shake the government . ”
Halliburton , meanwhile , is contending with two new scandals .
Last week , the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had overcharged the government by sixteen million dollars on a bill for the cost of feeding troops at a military base in Kuwait .
And last month the company made an astonishing confession : two of its employees , it said , had taken kickbacks resulting in overcharges of $ 6.3 million , in return for hiring a different Kuwaiti subcontractor in Iraq .
Halliburton said that the employees , whose names it declined to reveal , had been fired and the funds returned .
The day after this disclosure , the Pentagon awarded yet another contract to Halliburton , worth $ 1.2 billion , to rebuild the oil industry in southern Iraq .
Defenders of Halliburton deny that it has been politically favored , arguing that very few other companies could have handled these complex jobs .
As Cheney said last September on “ Meet the Press , ” __“ Halliburton is a unique kind of company .
There are very few companies out there that have the combination of very large engineering construction capability and significant oil - field services . ”
Dan Guttman , a fellow at Johns Hopkins University , agrees with Cheney ’s assessment , but sees Halliburton ’s dominance as part of a wider problem — one that has reached a crisis point in Iraq .
After years of cutting government jobs in favor of hiring private firms , he said , “ contractors have become so big and entrenched that it ’s a fiction that the government maintains any control . ”
He was n’t surprised that Halliburton ’s admission of wrongdoing in Kuwait had failed to harm its position in Washington .
“ What can the government say — ‘ Stop right there ’ ? ” Guttman said of Halliburton .
“ They ’re half done rebuilding Iraq . ”
The Vice - President has not been connected directly to any of Halliburton ’s current legal problems .
Cheney ’s spokesman said that the Vice - President “ does not have knowledge of the contracting disputes beyond what has appeared in newspapers . ”
Yet , in a broader sense , Cheney does bear some responsibility .
He has been both an architect and a beneficiary of the increasingly close relationship between the Department of Defense and an élite group of private military contractors — a relationship that has allowed companies such as Halliburton to profit enormously .
As a government official and as Halliburton ’s C.E.O. , he has long argued that the commercial marketplace can provide better and cheaper services than a government bureaucracy .
He has also been an advocate of limiting government regulation of the private sector .
His vision has been fully realized : in 2002 , more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars of public money was transferred from the Pentagon to private contractors .
According to Peter W. Singer , a fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of “ Corporate Warriors , ” published last year , “ We ’re turning the lifeblood of our defense over to the marketplace . ”
Advocates of privatization , who have included fiscally minded Democrats as well as Republicans , have argued that competition in the marketplace is the best way to control costs .
But Steven Kelman , a professor of public management at Harvard , notes that the competition for Iraq contracts is unusually low .
“ On battlefield support , there are only a few companies that are willing and able to do the work , ” he said .
Moreover , critics such as Waxman point out that public accountability is being sacrificed .
“ We ca n’t even find out how much Halliburton charges to do the laundry , ” Waxman said .
“ It ’s inexcusable that they should keep this information from the Congress , and the people . ”
Unlike government agencies , private contractors can resist Freedom of Information Act requests and are insulated from direct congressional oversight .
Jan Schakowsky , a Democratic representative from Illinois , told me , “ It ’s almost as if these private military contractors are involved in a secret war . ”
Private companies , she noted , can conceal details of their missions from public scrutiny in the name of protecting trade secrets .
They are also largely exempt from salary caps and government ethics rules designed to protect policy from being polluted by politics .
The Hatch Act , for example , forbids most government employees from giving money to political campaigns .
Halliburton has no such constraints .
The company made political contributions of more than seven hundred thousand dollars between 1999 and 2002 , almost always to Republican candidates or causes .
In 2000 , it donated $ 17,677 to the Bush - Cheney campaign .
Indeed , the seventy or so companies that have Iraq contracts have contributed more money to President Bush than they did to any other candidate during the past twelve years .
Sam Gardiner , a retired Air Force colonel who has taught at the National War College , told me that so many of the contracts in Iraq are going to companies with personal connections with the Bush Administration that the procurement process has essentially become a “ patronage system . ”
Major Joseph Yoswa , a Department of Defense spokesman , denied this .
He told me that multiple safeguards exist to insure that the department ’s procurement process for Iraq contracts is free of favoritism .
Most important , he said , career civil servants , not political appointees , make final decisions on contracts .
Gardiner remains unconvinced .
“ The system is sick , ” he told me .
Cheney , he added , ca n’t see the problem .
“ He does n’t see the difference between public and private interest , ” he said .
George Sigalos , a Halliburton executive , recently gave a speech at a conference in Washington for businesspeople who hoped to obtain government contracts in Iraq .
Many in the crowd had paid nearly four hundred dollars to attend , drawn by descriptions of Iraq as “ the next Klondike , ” as James Clad , an official with the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation , a federal agency , put it .
Sigalos began by pointing out that private contractors supplied the bullets that the Continental Army used in the American Revolution .
“ This did n’t begin with Halliburton , ” he said .
Halliburton ’s construction - and - engineering subsidiary , Brown & Root Services , started working with the U.S. military decades before Cheney joined the firm .
Founded in Texas , in 1919 , by two brothers , George and Herman Brown , and their brother - in - law , Dan Root , the firm grew from supervising small road - paving projects to building enormously complex oil platforms , dams , and Navy warships .
The company ’s engineering feats were nearly matched by its talent for political patronage .
As Robert A. Caro noted in his biography of Lyndon Johnson , Brown & Root had a symbiotic relationship with L.B.J. : the company served as a munificent sponsor of his political campaigns , and in return was rewarded with big government contracts .
In 1962 , Brown & Root sold out to Halliburton , a booming oil - well construction - and - services firm , and in the following years the conglomerate grew spectacularly .
According to Dan Briody , who has written a book on the subject , Brown & Root was part of a consortium of four companies that built about eighty - five per cent of the infrastructure needed by the Army during the Vietnam War .
At the height of the resistance to the war , Brown & Root became a target of protesters , and soldiers in Vietnam derided it as Burn & Loot .
Around this time , in 1968 , Dick Cheney arrived in Washington .
He was a political - science graduate student who had won a congressional fellowship with Bill Steiger , a Republican from his home state of Wyoming .
One of Cheney ’s first assignments was to visit college campuses where antiwar protests were disrupting classes , and quietly assess the scene .
Steiger was part of a group of congressmen who were considering ways to cut off federal funding to campuses where violent protests had broken out .
It was an early lesson in the strategic use of government cutbacks .
Instead of returning to graduate school , Cheney got a job as the deputy for a brash congressional colleague of Steiger ’s , Donald Rumsfeld , whom Richard Nixon had appointed to head the Office of Economic Opportunity .
The O.E.O. , which had played a prominent role in Johnson ’s War on Poverty , was not favored by Nixon .
According to Dan Guttman , who co-wrote “ The Shadow Government ” ( 1976 ) , Rumsfeld and Cheney diminished the power of the office by outsourcing many of its jobs .
Their tactics were not subtle .
At nine o’clock on the morning of September 17 , 1969 , Rumsfeld distributed a new agency phone directory ; without explanation , a hundred and eight employee names had been dropped .
The vast majority were senior career civil servants who had been appointed by Democrats .
The purging of the office was a mixed success .
Bureaucratic resistance stymied Cheney and Rumsfeld on several fronts .
But by the time Ronald Reagan became President the overriding principle that had guided their actions at the O.E.O. — privatization — had become a central precept of the conservative movement .
For most of the eighties , Cheney served in the House of Representatives .
In 1988 , after the election of George H. W. Bush , he was named Secretary of Defense .
The end of the Cold War brought with it expectations of a “ peace dividend , ” and Cheney ’s mandate was to reduce forces , cut weapons systems , and close military bases .
Predictably , this plan met with opposition from every member of Congress whose district had a base in peril .
This is a quick post to let you know that the Bahrain World Trade Center has turned on all three of its huge wind turbines simultaneously .
For a glimpse of the turbines in action , check out the video over the fold :
The three massive turbines , measuring 29 meters in diameter , are supported by bridges spanning between the complex ’s two towers .
Through its positioning and the unique aerodynamic design of the towers , the prevailing on - shore Gulf breeze is funneled into the path of the turbines , helping to create power generation efficiency .
The wind turbines will deliver approximately 11 - 15 % of the energy needs of the building , or 1100 to 1300 megawatt - hours per year — enough to provide light in 300 homes for over a year .
Not in the general population , alas .
But a poll in a recent front - page post at Daily Kos , Hobbits 2.0 ? , had some stunning numbers :
The poll was about which viewpoint best fits the site contributors ’ positions on human evolution , with four options corresponding to young - earth creationism , old - earth creationism , theistic evolution , and non-theistic evolution ( i.e. , no god involved ) .
Not surprisingly for a progressive political site , the two creationist options received negligible support .
But what I found stunning was that the no-god - involved response enormously outweighed the theistic evolution response , by a margin of better than 3 - to -1 !
This is a very significant result when one considers where it appeared .
Daily Kos is the largest progressive political blog on the internet , averaging around 1 million hits per day , and represents a vast community of involved , motivated writers , donors , voters and activists .
The fact that nonbelievers apparently predominate by such an overwhelming margin is an extremely encouraging indicator that atheists and freethinkers are becoming more and more politically involved and active , and cements our status as an important bloc of swing voters .
Some would - be atheist leaders may think we should sit out elections , but this result , thankfully , is a fairly good sign that atheists in general firmly reject that defeatist strategy .
This result also , I think , conclusively refutes the all - too - common cynicism which holds that there is no meaningful difference between the two American political parties .
I can personally guarantee that no major Republican or conservative site is going to show poll results anything at all like this .
( Exhibit A. )
I grant that there is often not enough of a difference between the two parties on several important issues .
But for any American voter who cares about freedom of conscience , the choice is clear : in their present incarnation , Republicans are unapologetically the party of dominionism and theocracy .
Democrats , even if they spend far too much time pandering to religious sentiment , are much more reliable when it comes to obeying the separation of church and state .
Granted , some caveats are in order : we should n’t put too much stock in this poll .
This result is hardly scientific – its respondents are self - selected .
Since the poll appeared only on the web , the respondents are likely to be disproportionately drawn from younger voters , whom we already know are increasingly secular .
And since it appeared at the end of a science - related post , it ’s likely to gather respondents interested in science and technology , whom we can expect to be even more secular than young voters in general .
As a reflection of the general electorate , it ’s not likely to be at all accurate .
But it does show that there is a substantial number of freethinkers who are politically informed and active .
In an America where religious voters ’ loyalties are already well established , this should be a bright , blinking message for political candidates .
The next one who spends some time addressing our concerns just might end up getting into office .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Regional U.S. banks will be allowed to temporarily boost holdings of mortgage - backed securities by some $ 150 billion in another bid by regulators to bring stability to troubled mortgage markets .

The move announced on Monday by the Federal Housing Finance Board enables the banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank system to expand their holdings of securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the congressionally chartered companies that are the two biggest U.S. home financing providers .
Regulators have made a series of moves to ease strains in U.S. mortgage markets where a rising tide of foreclosures has made lenders so wary that it has threatened to dry up funding .
Just last Wednesday , the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac eased their capital requirements , allowing them to pump another $ 200 billion into distressed mortgage markets with purchases of mortgages and mortgage securities .
The Federal Housing Finance Board on Monday voted to let the banks immediately use existing capital to increase their holdings of mortgage - backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie , or agency MBS , for two years .
The $ 4.5 trillion market for agency MBS is the cornerstone of the entire mortgage market and had shown signs of cracking until signs of federal support appeared .
“ Without a functioning mortgage market , you ca n’t get out of the mortgage mess , ” said Walter Schmidt , head of mortgage bond strategy at FTN Financial in Chicago .
“ It seems like the government is doing what it can . ”
But MBS on Monday failed to draw support from investors , who were taking profits from the sharp rally sparked by lower capital mandates for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , he said .
Yields on Fannie Mae MBS paying 5.5 percent interest rose more than those on Treasuries , and yield spread widened to 2.03 percentage points from 1.81 points on Thursday .
Yields move inversely to prices
The Federal Home Loan Banks were permitted to purchase about $ 150 billion of mortgage - backed securities under existing rules and will now be able to buy roughly that same amount in new agency investments , according to bank sources .
The 12 Federal Home Loan banks provide low - cost “ advances ” for real estate loans to member banks that hold their stock -- such as Countrywide Financial Corp and Washington Mutual Inc -- and have been one few sources of liquidity in a tightening credit market .
“ Increasing the agency MBS investment authority for the banks is another way in which the system can perform its traditional mission , ” said Ronald Rosenfeld , chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Board .
The regional banks are held cooperatively by more than 8,000 lending institutions and enjoy a favored position in the capital markets because of their implied government backing .
MEASURED SUPPORT
The Treasury Department issued a measured statement of support for the bank regulators ’ action , stressing that it saw it as a temporary action until markets settle down .
“ The targeted decision by the Federal Housing Finance Board to enable the Federal Home Loan Banks to assist temporarily in this period of stress , consistent with safe and sound operations , will bring more liquidity to the mortgage market , ” Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said .
Mortgage help from the FHLB helped U.S. Treasury debt extend sharp price losses , with investors betting that the Federal Reserve would be less likely to continue aggressively cutting interest rates because regulators have taken a stronger hand in spurring markets .
“ It definitely is one of many bullets being fired at this ( housing and mortgages ) problem , ” and could weigh on Treasury prices , said T.J. Marta , fixed - income strategist with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets in New York .
“ All these efforts are causing strategists to rethink the amount of easing they expect from the Fed , ” he said .
I spent some time digging around in the Python code to understand how .pyc files work .
It turns out they are fairly simple , then kind of complex .
At the simple level , a .pyc file is a binary file containing only three things :
A four - byte magic number ,
A four - byte modification timestamp , and
A marshalled code object .
The magic number is nothing as cool as cafebabe , it ’s simply two bytes that change with each change to the marshalling code , and then two bytes of 0d0a .
The 0d0a bytes are a carriage return and line feed , so that if a .pyc file is processed as text , it will change , and the magic number will be corrupted .
This will keep the file from executing after a copy corruption .
The marshalling code is tweaked in every major release of Python , so in practice the magic number is unique in each version of the Python interpreter .
For Python 2.5 , it ’s b3f20d0a .
( the gory details are in import . c )
The four - byte modification timestamp is the Unix modification timestamp of the source file that generated the .pyc , so that it can be recompiled if the source changes .
The entire rest of the file is just the output of marshal .
dump of the code object that results from compiling the source file .
Marshal is like pickle , in that it serializes Python objects .
It has different goals than pickle , though .
Where pickle is meant to produce version - independent serialization suitable for persistence , marshal is meant for short - lived serialized objects , so its representation can change with each Python version .
Also , pickle is designed to work properly for user - defined types , while marshal handles the complexities of Python internal types .
The one we care about in particular here is the code object .
The nature of marshalling gives us the important characteristics of .pyc files : they are independent of platform , but very sensitive to Python versions .
A 2.4 .pyc file will not execute under 2.5 , but it can be copied from one operating system to another just fine .
So that ’s the simple part : two longs and a marshalled code object .
The complexity , of course , is in the structure of the code object .
They contain all sorts of information produced by the compiler , the meatiest of which is the bytecode itself .
Luckily it is n’t hard to write a program to dump these things out , thanks to the marshal and dis modules :
import dis , marshal , struct , sys , time , types

A lot of this stuff I do n’t understand , but the byte codes are nicely disassembled and presented symbolically .
The Python virtual machine is a stack - oriented interpreter , so a lot of the operations are loads and pops , and of course jumps and conditionals .
For the adventurous : the byte - code interpreter is in ceval .c .
The exact details of the byte codes change with each major version of Python .
For example , the PRINT_ITEM and PRINT_NEWLINE opcodes we see here are gone in Python 3.0 .
In the disassembled output , the left - most numbers ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) are the line numbers in the original source file and the next numbers ( 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , ... ) are the byte offsets of the instruction .
The operands to the instruction are presented numerically , and then in parentheses , interpreted symbolically .
Lines with “ >> ” are the targets of jump instructions somewhere else in the code .
This sample was very simple , with a single code object for the flow of instructions in the module .
A real module with class and function definitions would be more complicated .
The classes and functions would themselves be code objects in the consts list , nested as deeply as needed to represent the module .
The module code object has class code objects which themselves have function code objects , and so on .
Once you start digging around at this level , there are all sorts of facilities for working with code objects .
In the standard library , there ’s the compile built - in function , and the compiler , codeop and opcode modules .
For the truly adventurous , there are third - party packages like codewalk , byteplay and bytecodehacks .
PEP 339 gives more detail about compilation and opcodes .
Finally , Ananth Shrinivas had another take on exploring Python bytecode .
AMERICANS have learned to take with a grain of salt much of the rhetoric in a campaign like the current Democratic donnybrook between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Still , there are some red lines that should never be crossed .
Clinton did so Tuesday morning , the day of the Pennsylvania primary , when she told ABC's " Good Morning America " that , if she were president , she would " totally obliterate " Iran if Iran attacked Israel .
This foolish and dangerous threat was muted in domestic media coverage .
But it reverberated in headlines around the world .
Responding with understatement to a question in the British House of Lords , the foreign minister responsible for Asia , Lord Mark Malloch - Brown , said of Clinton 's implication of a mushroom cloud over Iran : " While it is reasonable to warn Iran of the consequences of it continuing to develop nuclear weapons and what those real consequences bring to its security , it is probably not prudent in today 's world to threaten to obliterate any other country and in many cases civilians resident in such a country . "
A less restrained reaction came from an editorial in the Saudi - based paper Arab News .
Being neighbors of Iran , the Saudis and the other Gulf Arabs have the most to fear from Iran 's nuclear program and its drive to become the dominant power in the Gulf .
But precisely because they are most at risk from Iran 's regional ambitions , the Saudis want a carefully considered American approach to Iran , one that balances firmness and diplomatic engagement .
The Saudi paper called Clinton 's nuclear threat " the foreign politics of the madhouse , " saying , " it demonstrates the same doltish ignorance that has distinguished Bush 's foreign relations . "
The Saudis are not always sound advisers on American foreign policy .
But they understand that Rambo rhetoric like Clinton 's only plays into the hands of Iranian hard - liners who want to plow ahead with efforts to attain a nuclear weapons capability .
They argue that Iran must have that capability in order to deter the United States from doing what Clinton threatened to do .
While Clinton has hammered Obama for supporting military strikes in Pakistan , her comments on Iran are much more far - reaching .
She seems not to realize that she undermined Iranian reformists and pragmatists .
The Iranian people have been more favorable to America than any other in the Gulf region or the Middle East .
A presidential candidate who lightly commits to obliterating Iran - and , presumably , all the children , parents , and grandparents in Iran - should not be answering the White House phone at any time of day or night .

Recently , I wrote about Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy ( TIZA ) , a K - 8 charter school in Inver Grove Heights .
Charter schools are public schools and by law must not endorse or promote religion .
Evidence suggests , however , that TIZA is an Islamic school , funded by Minnesota taxpayers .
TIZA has many characteristics that suggest a religious school .
It shares the headquarters building of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota , whose mission is " establishing Islam in Minnesota . "
The building also houses a mosque .
TIZA 's executive director , Asad Zaman , is a Muslim imam , or religious leader , and its sponsor is an organization called Islamic Relief .
Students pray daily , the cafeteria serves halal food - permissible under Islamic law -- and " Islamic Studies " is offered at the end of the school day .
Zaman maintains that TIZA is not a religious school .
He declined , however , to allow me to visit the school to see for myself , " due to the hectic schedule for statewide testing . "
But after I e-mailed him that the Minnesota Department of Education had told me that testing would not begin for several weeks , Zaman did not respond -- even to urgent calls and e-mails seeking comment before my first column on TIZA .
Now , however , an eyewitness has stepped forward .
Amanda Getz of Bloomington is a substitute teacher .
She worked as a substitute in two fifth - grade classrooms at TIZA on Friday , March 14 .
Her experience suggests that school - sponsored religious activity plays an integral role at TIZA .
Arriving on a Friday , the Muslim holy day , she says she was told that the day 's schedule included a " school assembly " in the gym after lunch .
Before the assembly , she says she was told , her duties would include taking her fifth - grade students to the bathroom , four at a time , to perform " their ritual washing . "
Afterward , Getz said , " teachers led the kids into the gym , where a man dressed in white with a white cap , who had been at the school all day , " was preparing to lead prayer .
Beside him , another man " was prostrating himself in prayer on a carpet as the students entered . "
" The prayer I saw was not voluntary , " Getz said .
" The kids were corralled by adults and required to go to the assembly where prayer occurred . "
Islamic Studies was also incorporated into the school day .
" When I arrived , I was told ' after school we have Islamic Studies , ' and I might have to stay for hall duty , " Getz said .
" The teachers had written assignments on the blackboard for classes like math and social studies .
Islamic Studies was the last one -- the board said the kids were studying the Qu'ran .
The students were told to copy it into their planner , along with everything else .
That gave me the impression that Islamic Studies was a subject like any other . "
After school , Getz 's fifth - graders stayed in their classroom and the man in white who had led prayer in the gym came in to teach Islamic Studies .
TIZA has in effect extended the school day -- buses leave only after Islamic Studies is over .
Getz did not see evidence of other extra-curricular activity , except for a group of small children playing outside .
Significantly , 77 percent of TIZA parents say that their " main reason for choosing TIZA ... was because of after - school programs conducted by various non-profit organizations at the end of the school period in the school building , " according to a TIZA report .
TIZA may be the only school in Minnesota with this distinction .
Why does the Minnesota Department of Education allow this sort of religious activity at a public school ?
According to Zaman , the department inspects TIZA regularly -- and has done so " numerous times " -- to ensure that it is not a religious school .
But the department 's records document only three site visits to TIZA in five years -- two in 2003 - 04 and one in 2007 , according to Assistant Commissioner Morgan Brown .
None of the visits focused specifically on religious practices .
The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons ( BAAPS ) * has administered a righteous shoeing to a website offering girls the chance to pitch for a boob job and chaps the opportunity of sponsoring the enhancements .
The offending site , myfreeimplants.com , asks the ladies : " Have you ever wanted bigger breasts ?
But could n't afford the expensive costs of surgery ?
Here is your opportunity to earn Free Breast Implants ! "
Gentlemen , meanwhile , are enticed with : " Help the girl of YOUR dreams , get the body of her dreams .
Develop a connection with a girl of your choice and help her earn Free Breast Implants ! "
Well , BAAPS has slammed the whole exercise as " degrading " and has warned British women " that the process was entirely inappropriate for what should be a life - changing decision " .
The BAAPS press release explains :
The BAAPS have learned that UK women are being lured into joining the ' myfreeimplants.com ' site , where they post photos of themselves and a personal profile , meant to entice men to donate money to pay for their breast augmentation surgery .
Benefactors are then allowed unrestricted access to all profiles , are able to ' send messages to the ladies ' as well as ' purchase any personal products the ladies may have for sale ' and even ' receive custom photos of your favourite girls ( you may even request specific outfits ) ' .
Consultant plastic surgeon and BAAPS president Douglas McGeorge piled in with : " This is a wholly inappropriate way to proceed with what should be a serious decision made by a fully informed patient .
The site 's promise that there are ' no right or wrong ' cases is frightening - clearly there is no proper medical assessment of candidates , which at best could lead to disappointment , at worst , to someone 's health being endangered . "
Adam Searle , consultant plastic surgeon and former BAAPS president , thundered : " I thought I could no longer be appalled by the circus - like atmosphere surrounding plastic surgery - but this is really quite shocking .
The invitation for women to post suggestive photos , sell personal items and chat with strangers over the Internet in exchange for a breast augmentation is just plain degrading . "
Although myfreeimplants.com is evidently a professional operation , this is not the first time gals have pitched for Bulgarian airbags online .
Long - term readers will recall the case of 24 - year - old Michel , who sent out a plea to boost her " itty - bitty boobies " from a modest 34A to a mouth - watering pair of " big tatas ( o ) ( o ) !!! "
History agreeably records that she pulled it off , and deployed her " new big boobs on June 6th , 2003 " , or " D - Day " as she wittily adds .
In fact , that should actually be " C - Day " , as the snaps demonstrate . ®

ATLANTA ( AP ) The Georgia Supreme Court denied a new trial Monday for a death row inmate convicted of killing a Savannah police officer in 1989 , even though several witnesses against him recanted their testimony .
Troy Davis , 39 , was a day away from being put to death last July for the fatal shooting of 27 - year - old Officer Mark MacPhail when the state Board of Pardons and Paroles issued a stay of execution .
MacPhail was shot twice after he rushed to help a homeless man who had been assaulted .
Davis appealed to the state Supreme Court , which ruled Monday in a 4 - 3 decision that a lower court did not err in refusing to grant Davis a new trial .
Writing for the majority , Justice Harold Melton said that the high court considered the core question of whether a jury presented with Davis ’ allegedly new testimony would probably find him not guilty or give him a sentence other than death .
“ Most of the witnesses to the crime who have allegedly recanted have merely stated that they now do not feel able to identify the shooter , ” Melton wrote .
He added that one of the witness affidavits “ might actually be read so as to confirm trial testimony that Davis was the shooter . ”
“ We simply cannot disregard the jury ’s verdict in this case , ” Melton wrote . [ … ]
Davis ’ lawyers say seven witnesses have recanted or contradicted their testimony that they saw Davis shoot the officer , saw him assault the homeless man or heard Davis confess to the slaying .
Three people who did not testify at trial have said in affidavits that another man , Sylvester Coles , confessed to killing the officer after Davis was convicted .
After the shooting , Coles identified Davis as the killer .
This case is an example of why I have a problem with the death penalty .
I have seen government on every level make too many mistakes for me to continue to hold the view that the government is competent enough to execute someone convicted of a death row offense .
If a person serving a life sentence is wrongfully convicted but is later determined to be not guilty of the crime , at least the wrongfully convicted person can be set free .
A person wrongfully executed cannot be resurrected .
Did Troy Davis kill Officer Mark MacPhail in 1989 ?
I have no idea ; this is the first I ’ve heard of the case .
I do , however , have a problem with the idea that 7 witnesses could recant their testimonies and a court could decide that such a development would not warrant a new trial .
Justice Harold Melton says he believes that the witness affidavits “ might ” still identify Davis as the shooter .
Might ?
This statement in itself is very chilling .
Why guess what the new evidence might say ; why not allow a new jury determine if Davis was the shooter based on the remaining forensic and circumstantial evidence ?
If the prosecution has a strong enough case they will not need the unreliable testimony .
Which leads me to another point : eyewitness testimony has been shown to be extremely unreliable .
The Innocence Project has states the following regarding eyewitness misidentification :
Eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions nationwide , playing a role in more than 75 % of convictions overturned through DNA testing .
While eyewitness testimony can be persuasive evidence before a judge or jury , 30 years of strong social science research has proven that eyewitness identification is often unreliable .
Research shows that the human mind is not like a tape recorder ; we neither record events exactly as we see them , nor recall them like a tape that has been rewound .
Instead , witness memory is like any other evidence at a crime scene ; it must be preserved carefully and retrieved methodically , or it can be contaminated .
Think about it : have you ever witnessed a crime ?
I have .
One night , I saw several young Hispanic males breaking into a vehicle in the parking lot of the apartment complex I was living in at the time .
I got a very good look at the face of one of the criminals because he spotted me in my pickup .
The man walked right up to my window , looked directly in my eyes , put his finger to his lips to tell me to keep quiet , and then left ( I nodded “ yes ” because I knew I was outnumbered and did n’t know if any of them had weapons ; this was a very frightening experience ) .
Even though I got a very good look at one of them , I could not confidently pick this individual out of a lineup even if the lineup was an hour or so after the fact .
No matter how hard I tried , I could not remember exactly what he looked like .
I could offer a description of the man but I would not be able to make a positive I.D .
This experience forever changed what I thought about eyewitnesses .
Most eyewitnesses are probably very certain they have identified the right person but are mistaken .
If the prosecution ’s case hinges solely on eyewitness testimony of complete strangers , the man should be set free .
Unfortunately , it seems that the Georgia Supreme Court has forgotten that the burden of proof is on the state ; not the other way around .
For as long as I can remember , adding the phrase " like a girl " to the end of whatever you were saying was a put - down , an insult , something to come to fisticuffs over .
Little boys the world over hated being told that they , for example , " threw like a girl . "
I 'm not defending the statement , and as a member of the fairer sex , I certainly do n't agree with its intent , but hey , that 's been the case from the playground on up .
When it comes to investing , though , you could do a whole lot worse than learning to " invest like a girl . "
And that 's why I 'd bet Warren Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRK - A ) ( NYSE : BRK - B ) , would n't get offended if I told him to his face that he invests like a girl .
In fact , he 'd probably thank me ( and perhaps slip me a box of See 's Candies ) .
Hang on to see why -- and stay tuned for our soon - to - be published book on this very topic .
What makes Buffett Buffett
What is it that makes Warren Buffett such a consistently phenomenal investor ?
Is it that he 's zigging and zagging along with the market 's every move ?
Is he trading all the time , buying this and selling that , racking up taxes and commissions all the while ?
No , no -- what makes Warren Buffett the investor whom every investor wants to be like is that he approaches investing differently from the way most men do .
He 's patient and does thorough research .
He waits for the right price to buy .
He seeks to never sell the companies he invests in .
He 's the anti-trader , if you will .
Yep , you heard it here -- Warren Buffett invests like a girl .
And that 's a very good thing .
Women and investing
So how exactly do women invest ?
Check out these characteristics of female investors that distinguish them from their male counterparts .
Women spend more time researching their investment choices than men do .
This prevents them from chasing " hot " tips and trading on whims -- behavior that tends to weaken men's portfolios .
Men trade 45 % more often than women do , and although men are more confident investors , they tend to be overconfident .
By trading more often -- and without enough research -- men reduce their net returns .
But by trading less often , women get better returns and also save on transaction costs and capital gains taxes .
A study by the University of California at Davis found that women 's portfolios gained 1.4 % more than men's portfolios did .
What 's more , single women did even better than single men , with 2.3 % greater gains .
Women tend to look at more than just numbers when deciding whether to invest in a company .
They invest in companies they feel good about ethically and personally .
And companies with good products , good services , and ethics tend to have better long - term prospects -- and face fewer lawsuits .
These are some of the traits that make female investors more like Buffett and less like frazzled , frenetic day traders , with their ties askew , hair on end , and eyes bleary .
Patience and good decision - making help set women apart here .
Trend - spotting
Women also have a keen eye when it comes to identifying companies poised for greatness .
They typically look beyond the shiniest , newest bio - techno - gadget and focus instead on retailers meeting their needs , on products that they can't live without , and on consumer goods they buy in their day - to - day lives .
And that type of insight can pay off .
Buffett 's long - standing investments in Coca - Cola ( NYSE : KO ) and Gillette ( now owned by Procter & Gamble ( NYSE : PG ) ) meet this standard of easy - to - understand investments with competitive advantages .
Legendary fund manager Peter Lynch has famously credited his wife with discovering pantyhose maker Hanes , which at one point was Fidelity Magellan 's largest holding .
And he's also written about watching the shopping habits of his then - teenage daughters to discover investment ideas .
Shoot , even our own Bill Mann has told us that his wife shone the light on Swedish clothing phenom Hennes & Mauritz ( OTC BB : HMRZF ) , better known as H&M , which went on to be a great performer for him .
Look at a company like recent Motley Fool Stock Advisor recommendation Coach ( NYSE : COH ) , which started turning around several years ago thanks to fresh designs that drew customers in like moths to a flame .
The stock 's stumbled over the past year and remains beaten down today because of ongoing fears about the economy and the " strength of the consumer , " but the fact remains that it 's a solid , well - run business with desirable products and a growing market .
I 'll bet you could have talked to any number of female shoppers early on who could have clued you in that the company 's products were much improved -- and that the financials could n't be far behind .
So what if you 're not a girl ?
It 's possible , dear reader , that you 're of the male persuasion , but do n't fret .
By focusing on the traits that created superinvestor Warren Buffett -- patience , the willingness to dig deep , the ability to wait for the right price , and the desire to buy and hold instead of trade , trade , trade -- you can awaken the feminine side of your investment psyche .
Consider it .
Your portfolio will thank you for it .

The problem with most people these days is that they get so comfortable with their expenses through the aid of credit cards .
They become so indulged with cashless shopping that more and more people are spending more than what they can afford .
For this reason , experts contend that budgeting can definitely alleviate the consumers from “ financial strain ” by managing their expenses and income instead of falling into the pit of liabilities .
However , some people just contend that they cannot simply do budgeting alone .
They insist that they need some help in order to come up with a reliable and workable budget .
That ’s why some financial experts have created some money budgeting software that will facilitate the creation of a good budget in order to promote wise money - saving strategies .
Basically , money budgeting software assists an individual in his or her expenditures and uses the money sensibly .
These new technologies will help distribute the money into various aspects and areas and will also help add to savings .
So , if you still do n’t know what the money budgeting software can do for you , here is a list of its advantages :
1 . It helps you keep track of your expenses
Money budgeting software can definitely allow you to keep track of your expenses .
With this kind of technology , you get to understand your cash flow and allow you to be aware of how much money you spend and earn .
2 . It helps you to create some probable projections of the future
While some people are comfortable with the usual type of budgeting on paper , utilizing a money budgeting software can give you more than what you expect .
You can even make some possible projections using your integrated money budgeting software .
And if you are really into hard copies , you can even print them out for record keeping .
3 . It gives you control
The problem with most people who do not have a budget to guide them is that they tend to overspend with what they have .
With this kind of help , you can gain control of your expenditures .
You will be able to know when you are already overspending or not .
Plus , you become attentive of the blow of every money decision that you make .
The bottom line is that money budgeting software can definitely give you the kind of assurance and control that you need to keep track of your expenses .
In this way , you can be surer that all of your spending activities are based on reason and plan and not just sheer indulgences .
The worldâ€™s largest tidal turbine , weighing 1000 tonnes , has been installed in Northern Irelandâ€™s Strangford Lough .
The tidal turbine is rated at 1.2 megawatts , which is enough to power a thousand local homes .
It was built by Marine Current Turbines , and it will be the first commercial tidal turbine to produce energy , when it begins operation later this year .
The turbine has twin rotors measuring 16 meters in diameter .
The rotors will operate for up to 18 - 20 hours per day to produce enough clean , green electricity .
The turbine will be positioned 400 meters off of shoreline in Strangford Lough , which is know for its fast tidal current , and protection from severe weather .
The rotors on the SeaGen turbine turn slowly : about 10 to 20 revolutions per minute .
A shipâ€™s propellers , by comparison , typically run 10 times as fast .
The risk of impact from SeaGen rotor blades is small , because the marine creatures that swim in strong currents tend to be agile , and can avoid slow - moving underwater obstructions .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Commenting on the future prospects for tidal current energy , Martin Wright , Managing Director of Marine Current Turbines said : â€ œWe will build on the success of SeaGen to develop a commercial tidal farm , of up to 10 MW in UK waters , within the next three years .
With the right funding and regulatory framework , we believe we can realistically achieve up to 500MW of tidal capacity by 2015 based on this new SeaGen technology .â€ 

While the rest of the raft of presidential candidates are busily proclaiming their firm belief in a Christian God , former Alaska senator Mike Gravel has recorded a delightfully frank denouncement of religion in politics .
The quirky Democratic presidential candidate says what 's obvious to any student of history :
That aligning specific religious views with politics is a dangerous exercise .
" I am deeply insulted that in some areas that not only is evolution is shunned but efforts are made to substitute it with creationism and all other kinds of teachings , which corrupt our youth , " he says in a YouTube video recorded on Saturday .
" There ’s no foundation for this .
I think it ’s unfortunate .
We ’re regressing in these areas , and so I think we have responsibility to our children to provide them with the greatest scientific information available to all of us , and that begins with respect to evolution . "
Gravel goes on to talk about morality , and how trying to legislate morality reflects a failure of the religious community .
Clearly pointing to former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , a Republican who recently suggested that we ought to amend the constitution to be brought in line with " God 's standards , " Gravel said : " I ... really exhort as public policy that we concentrate on keeping religion out of politics , and keeping a very , very strong separation between church and state .
Otherwise you will take the oppressive nature of the state and marry it with the oppressive nature of religion , and that is the ultimate oppression of human beings . "

Over the last two months we 've seen renewed legal struggle at the Federal Communications Commission over so - called fleeting expletives , fleeting derrières , and fleeting imagined g- strings .
Now we 've got a case of fleeting Pokemon , and the station that broadcast it is facing a $ 16,500 fine proposed by the agency 's Media Bureau on Wednesday .
The FCC has ruled that one of those cute little Pikachu - type fellows ( or characters , sorry , whatever ) transformed itself into the wrong image at the wrong time on TV station WCIU in Chicago .
Four times , actually .
Instead of raising itself up as a lightening filled nemesis or some such , it became " an embossed image of itself on several Eggo waffles , " according to the station 's license renewal application .
Then the show announcer said : " And look out for limited edition Pokemon Eggo waffles .
You can catch 'em all . "
Not only that , but twice the station broadcast a commercial spot for " Fruit by the Foot , " a General Mills product , during which a Pokemon character also appeared .
WCIU , clearly aware of the Children 's Television Act's ( CTA ) prohibition of this kind of selling , argued that the station did n't do anything wrong and will never do it again .
These broadcasts contained only " fleeting images " of the characters who made " fleeting appearances " in commercialized contexts , the station pleaded .
In addition : " The Licensee described the measures taken to prevent future violations of the commercial limits and contended that its new procedures have prevented recurrence of similar incidents , " the FCC's Notice of Apparent Liability observed .
Perhaps WCIU was trying to associate these broadcasts with the agency 's constitutionally dubious crackdown on " fleeting expletives , " scheduled for review by the Supreme Court .
But unlike the FCC 's vague and irrational rules on decency , the CTA is pretty precise about this sort of fare .
TV stations can air no more than 10.5 minutes of commercial matter an hour on children 's television broadcast during the week ; no more than 12 minutes per hour on the weekends .
And any time the program associates itself with a product ( e.g. , the cartoon character endorses or transforms itself into an advertised item ) , the whole show becomes defined as a " program length commercial " — pushing the broadcaster way over its children 's commercial time quota and exposing the license owner to a fine .
Congress put these rules into the CTA , enacted in 1990 , because until children get to around the age of seven or eight , they do n't have the cognitive ability to know that they are even watching commercials .
Kids accept the claims of the ads , many for sugary foods and snacks , as statements of fact .
They especially accept them if their favorite animated character endorses the product ( or even morphs into the product , as in this case ) .
And , of course , kids watch tons of TV .
An FCC report disclosed last year that most children in the United States have watched the equivalent of three school years of television by the time they enter the first grade .
This trend , " combined with the prevalence of unhealthy foods and a more sedentary lifestyle have created a perfect storm that has made childhood obesity a nationwide problem , " concluded FCC Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate at a conference on children 's ' television held in the summer of 2006 .
Tate spoke while the Commission was tackling the tricky task of extending these rules from analog to digital TV , where kids programs will increasingly refer and even link to commercial Web sites .
In 2004 the Commission proposed a set of revised regulations for children 's digital TV .
But industry reps said they were too prohibitive and public interest groups called them too weak .
Fearing a lengthy lawsuit , the FCC dropped their proposed guidelines and let a consortium of players that included the American Academy of Pediatricians and Viacom bargain with each other .
Finally in September of 2006 the two groups came up with a complex set of new guidelines that the FCC approved .
Among other requirements , digital children 's TV shows may not display links to Web sites unless the site offers " a substantial amount of bona fide program - related or other noncommercial content " and is " not primarily intended for commercial purposes . "
In addition , a program related character can appear on the displayed Web site only in sections that are " sufficiently separated " from site product advertisements .
And digital stations that split their signal into multi channels have to offer a larger array of children 's shows , " roughly proportional " to those offered on their primary signal .
These new rules , however , are n't as precise as the analog TV regs .
They also have yet to be extensively applied , so get ready for plenty more fleeting Pokemons and other digital miracles to show up on the FCC 's penalty docket in the near and distant future .
Maybe some court cases too .

Living Off The Grid
It ’s our nature to fill the voids of our ignorance with our own assumptions .
That 's exactly what I had done with my beliefs about the Amish community .
I knew that they typically did n't use electricity , and from that I drew a conclusion that they must have a moral objection to it based on their religious beliefs .
As a former electrician , and current technology enthusiast , I did n't have an immediate interest when my girlfriend suggested that we travel to Ohio to visit some of the Amish towns and villages there .
That would be like the antithesis of everything I find exciting , I thought to myself .
I would be bored , and they would disapprove of my lifestyle and occupation if they knew about it .
These were the thoughts that ran through my uninformed mind .
When we made the trip I discovered that my apprehension , and many of my assumptions , were unfounded .
Instead of being bored I was fascinated by people and a lifestyle that was simple , but fulfilling , and without many of the annoyances and complexities that drive the rest of us crazy .
One of our destinations was a hardware store and historical museum named Lehman's .
In addition to serving as a marketplace for goods and products it's also a great place to learn about the area 's past , and the Amish communities and lifestyles there .
When I decided to write about this I contacted them from a brochure I saved , and was able to ask some questions from Glenda Lehman - Ervin - an operating member of this family owned business .
Q. How long have you been involved with the Amish community ?
53 years !
My father , Jay Lehman , started Lehman 's in 1955 to serve the local Amish community with the non-electric products they need to maintain their lifestyle .
Today , in a twist of irony , we have some Amish customers , but more importantly Amish vendors .
So Dad is still helping them preserve their way of life by providing an outlet for their hand - crafted products .
This means that not only can they work from home , which preserves their farm lifestyle , but they teach their skills to the next generation .
By buying large amounts of hickory rockers , custom wrought iron pieces , and hand weaved baskets , for example , we provide an income for our Amish neighbors .
Q. What do you enjoy most about this involvement ?
Everything -- they are delightful , hardworking craftspeople , with a wonderful work ethic .
They keep us in touch with our roots by reminding us of the importance of family and the beauty of simplicity .
They like to eat every meal " with their feet under their own table , " which means at home with their loved ones , and they live in a much less complicated , disposable world .
They also do n't have the capitalist / materialistic mentality that many of us do ( more is better ! ) and they do n't compete with each other .
Sameness is valued so there is a lack of envy and jealousy .
They are still creating hand weaved baskets , hickory rockers , wood toys and custom wrought iron -- items that are hard to find being made in the United States today .
Q. I had previously believed that the use of electrical energy , of any kind , was against Amish religious beliefs .
I 've since learned that this is n't necessarily true .
Can you explain why many people may have this misconception , and what the Amish view of electricity really is ?
They call it the invisible barrier -- they believe they are called to be IN the world , but not OF the world .
They are also under the constraints of a local Bishop , unlike most organized religions .
We sell some wonderful books and a DVD ( The Amish , How They Survive ) that explains this well .
Q. So how would they be affected , or unaffected , by a blackout or power outage ?
When there is a power outage in our area , like the Great Blackout of August 2003 , for example , many of the Amish are n't even aware of it .
Their daily existence is not changed much by the electric grid .
Although , if an Amish person works in an English business , such as a restaurant , they would be affected as would their co-workers .
And if there were a long - term power outage ( a week for example ) they would notice the effects because they often shop at local grocery stores .
Q. What are some of the various ways that Amish communities have learned to enjoy a quality lifestyle without being connected to outside power lines ?
Family and home is the most important thing to an Amish person .
They are not caught up in the materialistic , capitalist mentality that the English ( which is what they call us ) are .
Again , that DVD explains this in detail .
Q. What are your most popular products that help them have convenience in living this lifestyle ?
We have everything you need for heat , food , light and water with no electricity .
Wood cook stoves , hand tools , oil lamps , water pumps , gas refrigerators , hand cranked grinders and juicers , canning equipment , wheelbarrows and much more .
Q. During your interaction with Amish communities do they ever express a wonder or desire to enjoy more modern things like television , computers , or the Internet ?
I would say no , but you 'd have to ask them !
It is very foreign to them and they know their families would n't approve .
Plus they are n't used to it .
If you did n't have a swimming pool and sauna inside your house , but knew someone that did , would you miss it ? :)
Q. What are some things that technophiles , like myself , could learn from these communities that might benefit the quality of our own lifestyles ?
The simplicity and the beauty of a rural life .
If you have a regular lawn mower that wo n't start , you have to wonder about gas , or oil , or some other mechanical problem that you might not know how to fix .
If you have a push mower , and it is n't working , you are n't walking !

A 43 - year - old man from San Rafael , Califonia , was charged on Tuesday with " driving while intoxicated and causing injuries , reckless driving , and hit - and - run with injuries " after ramming three other vehicles and slightly injuring two people , while under the influence of a veritable pharmacy of narcotics , the Marin Independent Journal reports .
According to officer Mary Ziegenbein of the California Highway Patrol , Antonio Patrinostro was " arrested Sunday evening on southbound Highway 101 near the Lincoln Avenue offramp after his car bumped into three other vehicles in 55 - mph traffic " .
However , this was no ordinary drug - crazed highway rampage , since Patrinostro " told the [ arresting ] officer that the vehicle could fly if he went fast enough , and basically just started bouncing off of cars " .
Ziegenbein elaborated : " He was under the influence of cocaine , Valium and marijuana and stated that it was a top secret experiment with his doctor for Area 51 and the government .
He also stated that he was working for a cure for AIDS by taking the drugs . "
Patrinostro was booked into the county jail , and his bail set at $ 50,000 .
If convicted , he faces more than three years ' jail . ®
GCC 4.3.0 exposes a kernel bug

A change to GCC for a recent release coupled with a kernel bug has created a messy situation , with possible security implications .
GCC changed some assumptions about x86 processor flags , in accordance with the ABI standard , that can lead to memory corruption for programs built with GCC 4.3.0 .
No one has come up with a way to exploit the flaw , at least yet , but it clearly is a problem that needs to be addressed .
The problem revolves around the x86 direction flag ( DF ) , which governs whether block memory operations operate forward through memory or backwards .
The main use for the flag is to support overlapping memory copies , where working backwards through memory may be required so that the data being copied does not get overwritten as the copy progresses .
Debian hacker Aurélien Jarno reported the problem to linux - kernel on March 5th , which was found when building Steel Bank Common Lisp ( SBCL ) using the new compiler .
GCC 's most recent release , 4.3.0 , assumes that the direction flag has been cleared ( i.e. memory operations go in a forward direction ) at the entry of each function , as is specified by the ABI ( which is , somewhat amusingly , found at sco.com [ PDF ] ) .
Unfortunately , this clashes with Linux signal handlers , which get called , incorrectly , with the flag in whatever state it was in when the signal occurred .
This has the effect of leaking one bit of state from the user space process that was running when the signal occurred to the signal handler , which could be in another process .
That , in itself , is a bug , seemingly with fairly minimal impact .
Prior to 4.3 , GCC would emit a cld ( clear direction flag ) opcode before doing inline string or memory operations , so those operations would start from a known state .
In 4.3 , GCC relies on the ABI mandate that the direction flag is cleared before entry to a function , which means that the kernel needs to arrange that before calling a signal handler .
It currently does n't , but a small patch fixes that .
The window of vulnerability is small , but was observed in SBCL .
The sequence of events that would lead to memory corruption are as follows :
a user space program does an operation ( memmove ( ) for example ) that sets DF
for example ) that sets DF a signal occurs for some process
the kernel calls the signal handler
the signal handler does a memmove ( ) in what it thinks is a forward direction
in what it thinks is a forward direction the memory is copied in the reverse direction , leading to corruption
It is hard to see how that could be turned into a security breach , but it would be a mistake to assume that it can't .
Other kernel bugs , like the one that allowed the recent vmsplice ( ) exploit , have looked liked memory corruption , but were found to be more than that .
The DF issue may turn out to be harmless from a security standpoint , but it should not be assumed .
So , now the question is : what to do about it .
It is clear that the kernel should not leak the DF state to signal handlers , regardless of what GCC does .
It is interesting to note that this behavior is the same ( DF is not cleared on entry to a signal handler ) on BSD kernels , leading some to claim that it is the ABI that is incorrect and that GCC should revert to its old behavior .
Solaris kernels do clear the DF before calling signal handlers .
This problem has existed for 15 years ; GCC has always emitted code that worked correctly on kernels that did not follow the ABI , until now .
Part of the problem is that there are an enormous number of installed kernels that are vulnerable to this problem , but only if GCC 4.3 is installed .
That version of GCC is not , yet , in widespread use , so the thinking is that GCC should revert its behavior now , before it gets into distributions .
As kernels with the fix become more widespread , the " proper " behavior could be restored .
The GCC folks do n't necessarily see it that way , so it is unclear what will happen .
While it is true that distributors can control what kernel version and GCC version they ship , those are n't the only ways that either GCC or GCC - compiled binaries get installed .
It is a bit of ticking time bomb for random memory corruption at a minimum .
Handling those bug reports will be very difficult and time consuming .
While the new behavior of GCC is correct , and the kernel is broken , it would be very helpful to back out this change , perhaps providing the new behavior via a command - line argument for those who are sure their binaries will be running on patched kernels .
Some discussion on the gcc - devel list would indicate that a GCC 4.3.0.1 or 4.3.1 may be forthcoming .
The brief meeting focused on forging better economic ties China 's President Hu Jintao has held a historic meeting with Taiwan 's Vice - President - elect , Vincent Siew .
It was the highest - level contact between the two governments since their post - civil war split in 1949 .
The meeting , on the sidelines of a business conference on China 's Hainan island , was short .
But correspondents say it represented an important signal that both sides now want to improve relations , after several years of worsening ties .
' Common trust '
Mr Siew is the running - mate of Ma Ying - jeou , who won a convincing victory in Taiwan 's elections in March , and has vowed to improve the island 's standing with its much bigger neighbour once he takes office on 20 May .
TAIWAN - CHINA RELATIONS
Ruled by separate governments since end of Chinese civil war in 1949 China considers the island part of its territory China has offered a " one country , two systems " solution , like Hong Kong Most people in Taiwan support status quo
Taiwan flashpoint
The BBC's Caroline Gluck in Taiwan 's capital , Taipei , says that while this may have been a low - key 20 - minute meeting , it was one laden with symbolism .
She says expectations are high that the meeting could mark a watershed in relations which had been severely strained during the eight - year administration of Taiwan 's independence - leaning President Chen Shui-bian .
Mr Siew was already attending the Boao Forum for Asia in his capacity as chairman of the Cross - Strait Common Market Foundation , a non-profit group that works to improve economic co-operation between Taiwan and China .
After exchanging pleasantries with his Taiwanese visitor , Mr Hu said improving relations required efforts from both sides .
" On this occasion I am happy to exchange opinions on the cross - strait economy with Mr Siew , " he said .
Before the meeting , Mr Siew said : " I hope that through this meeting we can deepen the understanding between the two sides and also create a basis for common trust . "
Although under President Chen economic links have steadily tied the Taiwan closer to the mainland , China has aimed hundreds of missiles at the island .
Beijing regards Taiwan as part of its territory , and has aggressively countered any moves to formalise Taiwan 's de facto independence .
Ahead of the meeting , US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte labelled it " a good way forward " in efforts to settle differences between the two sides .

What are these ?
Bush thinks spied - on Americans should ‘ suck it up ’?
A reporter at this morning ’s White House press conference asked the president an interesting question I have n’t heard Bush respond to before : “ You can get the Congress to protect telecom companies from lawsuits , but then there ’s no recourse for Americans who feel that they ’ve been caught up in this .
I know it ’s not intended to spy on Americans , but in the collection process , information about everybody gets swept up and then it gets sorted .
So if Americans do n’t have any recourse , are you just telling them , when it comes to their privacy , to suck it up ? ”
Bush protests , saying he “ would n’t put it that way … in public , ” before effectively agreeing with the premise of the question .
This is actually quite helpful .
First , Bush avoids the question , which makes sense given that he can’t answer it .
Second , he goes on to repeat bogus talking points , such as his baseless insistence that the illegal surveillance “ was legal , ” effectively because he says so .
But I ’m especially interested in the “ suck it up ” angle .
Bush did n’t want to “ put it that way , ” but in effect , that ’s what he believes , and he conceded as much this morning .
Consider the implications here .
The Bush administration , with no legal authority , asked the telecoms to open up their data streams to the NSA .
Intentionally or not , law - abiding Americans ’ communications were subjected to illegal surveillance , in a scheme that preceded 9/11 , and went on for years afterwards .
According to Bush , what are Americans entitled to in response ?
Absolutely nothing .
Indeed , he means that quite literally .
He obviously opposes Americans bringing their concerns to court for a fair hearing , but he also opposes compromise measures that would let the telecoms off the hook and allow these Americans to seek recourse against the Bush administration instead .
Telecoms and the administration teamed up to break the law and violate your privacy .
The only appropriate response , Bush believes , is to change the law and make those crimes legal several years after the fact , ending reasonable lawsuits that already before the judiciary .
And if you do n’t like it , you should suck it up .
For the record , knowing that some of you ca n’t watch video clips online , here ’s the full transcript of the president ’s wholly unsatisfactory answer .
THE PRESIDENT : I would n’t put it that way , if I were you , in public .
Well , you ’ve been long been long enough to — anyway , yes , I — look , there ’s — people who analyze the program fully understand that America ’s civil liberties are well protected .
There is a constant check to make sure that our civil liberties of our citizens are n’t — you know , are treated with respect .
And that ’s what I want , and that ’s what most — all Americans want .
Now let me talk about the phone companies .
You cannot expect phone companies to participate if they feel like they ’re going to be sued .
I mean , it is — these people are responsible for shareholders ; they ’re private companies .
The government said to those who have alleged to have helped us that it is in our national interests and it ’s legal .
It ’s in our national interests because we want to know who ’s calling who from overseas into America .
We need to know in order to protect the people .
It was legal .
And now , all of a sudden , plaintiffs attorneys , class - action plaintiffs attorneys , you know — I do n’t want to try to get inside their head ; I suspect they see , you know , a financial gravy train — are trying to sue these companies .
First , it ’s unfair .
It is patently unfair .
And secondly , these lawsuits create doubts amongst those who will — whose help we need .
I guess you could be relaxed about all this if you did n’t think there was a true threat to the country .
I know there ’s a threat to the country .
And the American people expect our Congress to give the professionals the tools they need to listen to foreigners who may be calling into the United States with information that could cause us great harm .
So , on the one hand , the civil liberties of our citizens are guaranteed by a lot of checks in the system , scrutinized by the United States Congress .
And secondly , I cannot emphasize to you how important it is that the Congress solve this problem .
The Senate has solved the problem .
And people say , would you ever compromise on the issue ?
The Senate bill is a compromise .
And there ’s enough votes in the House of Representatives to pass the Senate bill .
It ’s a bipartisan bill .
And the House leaders need to put it on the floor , let the will of the House work .
In my judgment , it happens to be the will of the people , to give the professionals the tools they need to protect the country .
If there ’s a shred of honesty in this response , it ’s hiding well .

This type of a nymphette is hard to pass on by – knowing eyes , charming smile , and watch her roll on that sofa – is n’t that amazing .
Comedy Hour
Comedy does n’t have to be bad
About a month ago , I was brainstorming a mission idea with a few friends called “ Five Star Fast Food ” .
The idea was to deck out a fast food joint with all the trappings of a five star restaurant .
There would be a Maitre D’ standing behind a podium asking for your reservation , a hostess to seat you , a waiter to take your order , and an attendant in the bathroom .
The obvious problem with this idea is that it would very likely be shut down as soon as it begins .
I decided to focus on the bathroom attendant aspect , figuring that we could last much longer in a secluded men ’s room .
The next step was to pick the perfect restroom .
The challenge here is that pretty much every fast food place in New York has a single occupancy bathroom , many of which require a key for entry .
I needed to find a single - gender , multi-occupancy restroom .
After spending about a week surveying various disgusting locations , I finally found what I needed in Times Square .
The Times Square McDonald’s
The Times Square McDonald ’s is a sight to see .
Its facade is made to look like a Broadway theatre ; in fact , it ’s adjacent to the Lion King .
It ’s three stories tall , has menus on flat - screen TVs , and movie projections on its walls .
On the third floor in the very back corner , it has a very large men ’s room with three urinals , two stalls , and four sinks .
The men ’s room also conveniently had a “ Diaper Changing Station ” that would double as our amenities table .
The next step was to find our employee .
My friend Todd Simmons worked as a professional bathroom attendant for three years in Manhattan .
Obviously , he was the logical choice to play the part .
His experience would enable him to be totally comfortable and natural throughout the mission .
He knew all of the tricks of the trade .
Agent Simmons
I spent about $ 50 gathering supplies for the mission .
I hit up K - Mart , Rite Aid , and various dollar stores for “ travel - size ” toiletries .
Our attendant had it all : cologne , deodorant , mints , gum , dental floss , Tylenol , Advil , condoms , shaving cream , disposable razors , Q - tips , baby powder , Gold Bond , Band - Aids , cough drops , mouthwash , plastic cups , hair gel , Kleenex , and our crown jewel–a “ Barbicide ” canister filled with actual Barbicide and several combs .
Our wares would be presented on two silver trays on top of a lace tablecloth .
We arrived at the McDonald ’s at about 1:45 in the afternoon .
We each ordered food and sat down at tables close to the bathrooms .
There were two cops finishing up their meal just a few tables away .
We figured the male cop would probably use the facilities before leaving , so we waited it out .
We were correct ; he took a quick trip to the men ’s room and then left the scene .
We sprang into action .
Agent Simmons had a tuxedo concealed under his winter coat .
Agent Todd carried a large K - Mart shopping bag with all of the supplies .
Within two minutes our table was ready to go .
The Table
Barbicide
Agent Kula handled digital video and photography for this mission .
He hid his DV camera inside a Kleenex box and pointed it towards the door .
We were a little worried about the legal implications of covertly filming men of all ages in a bathroom .
Agent Simmons carried a decoy tape in his pocket in case management discovered us and demanded our tape .
Our hidden camera is on the right

Agent Simmons prepares for his first customer
Agent Simmons stood in front of the automatic hand dryers , essentially blocking access to them .
He was armed with a dispenser of antibacterial hand soap ( much better than the pink industrial soap on the wall ) and nice paper towels .
If folks were going to wash their hands , they were n’t going to dry them without using our attendant .
Since our McDonald ’s was located in Times Square , we received visitors from all over the world .
Agent Simmons ’ first customers were a group of British school boys , visiting the US on a school trip .
The first British boy
The first two boys to enter were terribly excited about the attendant .
They cheerily washed their hands and both took peppermints on the way out
The boys dry their hands with our paper towels
Several IE Agents ( Balaban , Krafft , Skillman , & Todd ) were sitting just outside of the bathroom to observe the reactions of people as they left .
The boys came running out of the bathroom anxious to report back to the rest of the group .
“ Heather ! ” one boy cried , “ They ’ve got a butler in the bathroom and he gave us sweets ! ”
The group ’s chaperone made a trip to the bathroom to investigate the boys claims .
The chaperone
His accent was unbelievably thick , but it was clear he was delighted that there was someone in the room to “ help the boys wash up ” .
He shook Agent Simmons ’ hand , explaining “ the kids are astonished because they do n’t do this in England . ”
Several more boys entered the bathroom to take part in the fun .
The original boys returned twice to get more sweets , and then stood outside the door bragging to their female classmates .
Things quieted down for a bit after the British group left .
About ten minutes in to the mission , the first McDonald ’s employee entered the room .
His nametag read “ Roman ” , and he did n’t seem to speak very much English .
Roman
Agent Simmons ’ approached Roman warmly .
“ Hey there .
I ’m Todd .
I ’m from Corporate McDonald’s .
We ’re trying out a new promotion today . ”
Roman quickly shuffled out of the bathroom with out speaking .
He would return several times throughout the mission to sweep , ignoring Agent Simmons each time .
A man and his young child visited the bathroom .
The father had to pick his son up so Agent Simmons could help him wash his hands .
He tipped $ 1 . Agent Simmons made it clear that tips were entirely optional and that his services were provided free of charge .
He made small talk with everyone who entered the room , asking them where they were from , if they had seen a Broadway play , etc .
He also peppered McDonald ’s slogans in to his banter .
“ We ’re lovin ’ it today and we hope you are too . ”
“ You deserve a break today . ”
“ We like to see you smile , sir . ”
The man pictured above was a tourist visiting from South Korea .
He and Agent Simmons had a two minute conversation about the weather .
“ I always carry an umbrella because I hate rain , ” the man said .
Two tourists from the land of New Jersey
The man above was seeking cold water , and was disappointed to hear that the faucets were only providing hot water today .
A second employee entered the bathroom , Rafael .
He sweeps and leaves , giving Simmons a suspicious eye , but not responding to Simmons ’ friendly banter .
Rafael
The man pictured about spent over five minutes in the bathroom , brushing his teeth ( he brought his own toothbrush and tooth paste ) .
He turned out to be the CFO of Hitachi visiting from Japan .
He had just seen the Broadway musical “ Mama Mia ! ” and gave Agent Simmons a brief review .
“ It was so - so .
The songs were very clever , but that ’s all .
I like the ABBA songs , but the plot is very simple . ”
He went on to say that you can “ see good musicals in Japan , but in the United States–especially New York –they ’re fantastic . ”
The young man pictured above was very curious .
He asked Agent Simmons ’ , “ This is a good paying job ? ”
He then revealed that his step - father used to be a bathroom attendant in Brooklyn .
As Agent Simmons shared a smile with him , a third employee began shouting from the door .
It was a female employee dressed the same as Roman and Rafael .
She did n’t speak very much English either , so Agent Simmons had a hard time communicating with her .
“ Only muchachos , ” he tried to explain .
She responded , “ Nobody else ?
I go in ? ”
She waited until all of the men had exited the room and then came in to get a closer look at Agent Simmons ’ setup .
He tried to calm her , “ We work together .
Te llamo Evelyn ? ”
She quickly left .
Many folks were kind enough to tip throughout the day .
Agent Simmons made a total of $ 6.92 .
The international theme continued as the day went on .
Agent Simmons ’ was visted by a group of Germans , a Russian gentleman , and a couple of guys from Yonkers , NY .
Agent Simmons attends to a Russian man
A German man wanted to know if Agent Simmons worked for McDonald ’s or by himself .
Once Simmons explained to him that it was a McDonald ’s promotion , he decided , “ I like the idea .
Sounds good . ”
The bathroom got quite crowded at certain points .
All in all , Agent Simmons helped around fifty customers .
Men waiting in line for an open urinal
Evelyn , the female employee , must have alerted the management .
A gentleman wearing a tie entered just as Simmons was explaining the McDonald ’s philosophy to a customer , “ We do n’t want to be a part of the same fast food culture as everyone else .
McDonald ’s is the biggest , the best , and this is Broadway ! ”
The manager enters
The manager did n’t know how to respond .
He stuttered for a moment and finally burst out with “ Y - Y - You do n’t have any authorization to do this . ”
“ Yes , I do , ” Simmons responded .
“ I ’m Todd .
I ’m from the corporate office . ”
The Manager shook his head and gave his name , Ted .
“ This is part of a special promotion .
They did n’t send you a memo or a fax ? ”
I ’ll call .
They did n’t tell me anything about this .
Lemme call .
We started in Akron , Ohio and the Los Angeles and Portland , Oregon .
You ’re sure you ’re in the right McDonald ’s ?
I hope so .
I sure hope so !
No problem .
Manager
Ted left the bathroom to place a call to corporate .
We captured this entire exchange with the manager Ted on our hidden camera .

Speaking at Cooper Union in New York City on Thursday , Barack Obama went where few Democrats have dared to go in the past quarter - century :
He made a case for more regulation .
As part of a speech on his economic platform , Obama depicted the current economic crisis as a consequences of deregulation in the financial sector .
“ Our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get , however you can get it , ” he said .
“ Unfortunately , instead of establishing a 21st century regulatory framework , we simply dismantled the old one — aided by a legal but corrupt bargain in which campaign money all too often shaped policy and watered down oversight . ”
This is quite a statement from a candidate who ’s received $ 6 million in campaign contributions from securities and investment firms , just slightly less than rival Hillary Clinton , who cashes in at $ 6.3 million .
Obama ’s criticism was sharp , but his six - point plan for rebuilding a regulatory structure was short on both details and teeth , and relies on the Federal Reserve , which is like having the fox guard , well , the other foxes .
Still , his use of the r-word signals what is at least a rhetorical departure for a party that has been running from regulation for decades .
Obama is n’t the only one .
Last week at the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce , Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank , chair of the powerful House Financial Services Committee , also argued that years of banking deregulation were in part responsible for creating the subprime mortgage crisis and the larger economic downturn , which he did n’t hesitate to call a recession .
He talked about the need to impose more “ discipline ” on investment banks , requiring a higher level of capitalization and transparency .
Frank called on Congress to consider establishing a “ Financial Services Risk Regulator ” that would have “ the capacity and power to assess risk across financial markets ” and “ to intervene when appropriate . ”
Such a proposal may seem like too little too late in a month when the likes of Bear Stearns crumbled to dust , yet , like Obama ’s speech , it suggests a small shift in what has long been the dominant position of the Democratic Party .
Without entirely eschewing the sacred myth that the free market always knows best , some congressional Democrats are envisioning a more direct role for the federal government in carrying out economic policy and imposing rules and restrictions on banks and brokerages .
Calls for increased oversight of financial markets come at a time when the Federal Reserve System , the quasi-public institution that is seen as the fulcrum for managing the economy , is losing credibility , what with its failure to predict or head off the current crisis and its ineffective and controversial responses once it arrived .
Americans are beginning to look elsewhere for leadership on these issues .
As the economy continues to decline , some voters may finally start asking their government to rein in Wall Street .
And some Democrats may finally be willing to veer out of lockstep in the party ’s long march toward deregulation .
Deregulation has been the mantra on both sides of the aisle since the late 1960s .
Long gone are Democrats like Michigan ’s Phil Hart who , as chair of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee , held hearings on the concentration of economic power in the United States , and proposed expanded government regulation of everything from the oil and auto industries to pharmaceuticals to professional sports .
Hart believed that because wealth and power were concentrated in the hands of such a small number of corporations , the market economy had become no more than a facade .
In this context , what would bring about lower prices and greater productivity and innovation was more government intervention and regulation , not less .
Hart got a Senate building named after him , but his warnings about the threat of unbridled corporate power and consolidation went unheeded .
Instead , the rush to deregulation began , first in the transportation sector .
Efforts begun under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford came to fruition under Jimmy Carter , who hired deregulation guru Alfred E. Kahn to head the Civil Aeronautics Board , the widely loathed agency responsible for regulating the airline industry .
Senator Ted Kennedy and his then aide , future Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer , embraced deregulation as a consumer issue , and with their support , Kahn quickly worked his way out of a job :
The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act dissolved the CAB and removed most regulation of commercial airlines .
Carter also signed into law bills deregulating the railroads and the trucking industry .
You could argue that transportation deregulation has been a wash — replacing a system of bureaucratic incompetence with one of profit - seeking negligence , and exchanging safety for lower prices .
The same cannot be said for the deregulation of the energy sector , notably the natural gas and oil industries under Ronald Reagan , and the electric utilities under George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton .
Left to its own devices , a deregulated energy industry has given us Enron and Exxon — California brownouts and $ 100 barrels of oil .
Deregulation of the telecommunications industry , also under Clinton , reduced the number of major phone service providers to just a handful of multimerged giants .
Even more damaging , in light of today ’s economic crisis , was the sweeping deregulation of the banking and financial services industries that took place in the 1990s .
What makes this enterprise particularly confounding is not only the fact that it took place under a Democratic president with support from a majority of Democrats in Congress , but that it followed so closely on the heels of the savings and loan crisis , which ought to have served as a cautionary tale on the dangers of deregulation in the banking sector .
The Depository Institutions Act of 1982 , another Reagan initiative , was supposed to “ revitalize ” the housing industry by freeing up the S&Ls to make more loans .
Instead , the regulation rollback led to what economist John Kenneth Galbraith called “ the largest and costliest venture in public misfeasance , malfeasance and larceny of all time ” as they engaged in a fury of high - risk lending .
The collapse that followed cost taxpayers an estimated $ 150 billion in government bailouts , and contributed to the recession of the early 1990s .
Yet Bill Clinton , elected in large part because of that recession ( a la James Carville ’s “ It ’s the economy , stupid ” ) , was talking about deregulation before he was even inaugurated .
The National Review reported that “ Bill Clinton embraced at least one Reaganesque idea at the Little Rock economic summit ” he held in December 1992 : “ banking deregulation . ”
The banking industry objected to regulations put in place in 1989 after the S&L debacle , as well as others dating back to FDR .
The heads of the six major U.S. banking associations , according to the National Review , had written “ a long letter to the President - elect in December advocating nine substantive reforms . ”
The conservative magazine concluded that the new president seemed more than willing to oblige , but bank deregulation was being held back by such powerful congressmen as “ House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez ( D. , Tex . ) , a populist throwback to the Thirties who believes bankers are by definition out to exploit the ‘ little guy ' ” and “ House Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell ( D. , Mich . ) , who holds a quasi-religious belief that banks caused the Great Depression and must be tightly regulated .
( Dingell ’s father was a principal author of the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 . ) ”
The Glass - Steagall Act was , in fact , a primary target of the Clinton - era deregulation effort .
An early piece of New Deal - era legislation , the act was passed in response to speculation and manipulation of the markets by huge banking firms , which most liberal economists believed had brought on the crash of 1929 .
Glass - Steagall imposed firewalls between commercial banking and investment banking , and between the banking , brokerage , and insurance industries .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks lobbying and campaign contributions , “ Eager to create financial supermarkets that peddle everything from checking accounts to auto insurance , the three industries for years have lobbied Congress to streamline regulatory hurdles that bar such operations . ”
Despite Bill Clinton ’s announcement that “ the era of big government is over , ” it took the better part of his administration for him to push these initiatives through Congress .
In 1999 , Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , always a good friend to Wall Street , finally brokered a deal between the administration and Congress that allowed banking deregulation to move forward .
Shortly after the compromise was reached , Rubin took a top position at Citigroup , which went on to embark upon mergers that would have been rendered illegal under Glass - Steagall .
As the New York Times put it , Rubin would be leading “ what has become the first true American financial conglomerate since the Depression ” — a conglomerate that could exist only because of legislation he had just shepherded through Congress .
Passage of the Financial Services Modernization
Act of 1999 was celebrated in a Wall Street Journal editorial as an end to “ unfair ” restrictions imposed on banks during the Great Depression , under the headline “ Finally , 1929 Begins to Fade . ”
But Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman , writing in Mother Jones , warned that the legislation , which amounted to the “ finance industry ’s deregulatory wish list , ” would “ pave the way for a new round of record - shattering financial industry mergers , dangerously concentrating political and economic power . ”
Mokhiber and Weissman also predicted that such mergers would eventually “ create too - big - to - fail institutions that are someday likely to drain the public treasury as taxpayers bail out imperiled financial giants to protect the stability of the nation ’s banking system . ”
Enter Bear Stearns .
In addition , the merging of commercial and investment banking helped enable high - risk mortgage lending to make its way into the mutual funds and 401Ks of millions of Americans in the form of mortgage - backed securities .
“ Diversifying bad debt just spreads the poison , ” as Frank said in his Boston speech .
It also makes a falling housing market reverberate throughout the economy far more than it did even during the S&L collapse .
Enter the subprime crisis .
And welcome back , 1929 .
As these new financial giants go into freefall , a little regulation once again sounds like a good idea , just as it did in 1933 .
But increased regulation will never come willingly from the Federal Reserve , an “ independent entity ” that is answerable to no one , and has always operated largely in the interests of the big banks that make up its membership and provide its funding .
Under two decades of leadership by the notorious anti-regulator Alan Greenspan , the Fed took a hands - off approach , preferring to set “ guidelines ” for the financial industry rather than enforce rules .
In December 2007 , the New York Times compiled a rundown of the multiple warnings and pleas made to Greenspan , over a period of at least seven years , to address the dangers posed by subprime lending — all of them , of course , rebuffed by the man who still claims he could n’t have predicted that the housing bubble would someday burst .
The Fed ’s approach is unlikely to change much now — at least , not without a fight .
The Federal Reserve is set up in such a way that Congress cannot force its hand .
But it can apply pressure , by way of threatening to pass legislation to accomplish what the Fed refuses to do .
That ’s what Barney Frank did last summer , when he thought Fed chair Ben Bernanke was n’t doing enough about predatory lending practices .
“ The Fed has the authority to spell out rules about what is unfair and deceptive , ” Frank said in an interview with Bloomberg News .
“ If by default the Fed is not in the process of doing it , we , I think , should pass a law giving the authority ” to other government agencies .
Now , in addition to outlining a plan to deal with the epidemic of foreclosures , Democrats on the Financial Services Committee are looking at legislation that could force financial firms to sing for their supper — a few bars , at least .
The Financial Services Risk Regulator proposed by Frank last week would have the power to demand “ timely market information from market players , inspect institutions , report to Congress on the health of the entire financial sector , and act when necessary to limit risky practices or protect the integrity of the financial system . ”
In return , he said , financial institutions would have “ potential access to the discount window for nondepository institutions . ”
Frank was referring to the lending program for brokers started by the Fed on March 17 , which extends the same lending rules previously employed by commercial banks to securities firms .
Two days after it opened , Financial Week reported , under the headline “ Investment bank CFOs Not Proud , ” that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had already overcome concerns that borrowing from the Fed might “ make them appear financially weak , ” and had taken advantage of the discount window , at the new rock - bottom interest rate of 2.5 percent .
So Barney Frank ’s modest proposal simply says that if the government is going to back loans to billionaire investment firms at rates that middle - class credit card holders can only dream about , the companies are going to have to submit to a little oversight in return .
Critics outside the government have taken things a step further , advancing the view that if the taxpayers are going to be responsible for bailing out greedy financial giants like Bear Stearns , they ought to get a piece of them in return , as well as some say in how they are run .
Conceivably , the federal government could either take over and run the affected enterprises , or at the very least take a share of the stock in order to exercise control .
“ I think it makes the most sense to take it [ Bear Stearns ] over outright , ” Dean Baker , codirector of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , said in an email last week .
“ The key point is that we do n’t want Bear Stearns taking big risks with the public ’s money .
I suppose it ’s better that we at least share in the gains if they do this sort of gambling , but it would be better to have the government directly step in and not allow the gamble . ”
Such measures are highly unlikely .
But Baker argues that a bailout without some kind of consequences will have no impact at all on the kind of unrestrained , irresponsible behavior on the part of financial firms that got us into this mess in the first place .
“ The issue here is essentially the moral hazard problem that you had with the S&Ls , ” he said .
“ If you have the option of making a bet where the government covers your losses , you might as well make it a risky one . ”
Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) also says he wants to “ pin down just how the government decided to front $ 30 billion in taxpayer dollars ” to back the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase .
He and Senate Banking Committee chair Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) have both said they will hold hearings on the matter .
But according to the Center for Responsive Politics , Baucus and Dodd are among the top recipients of donations from the securities and investment industry .
In the end , the real question is what kind of regulation of these industries can come from a Democratic Party that now relies on them to fund its campaigns .
A few reform - minded Democrats in Congress wo n’t get far without support from the White House .
And while financial industry campaign contributions to Democrats have climbed ever since Bill Clinton shifted the party ’s rhetoric and policymaking away from “ big government , ” donations in this election cycle dwarf those of the past .
With his speech in New York , Obama is clearly trying to show himself to be a man who is n’t afraid to bite the hand that ’s feeding him .
He is also putting space , on this issue , between himself and Hillary Clinton , in part by reminding voters of the outcomes of Bill Clinton ’s policies .
He denounced both “ Republican and Democratic administrations ” for regulatory failures leading to the current crisis , and , as the New York Times reported , “ handouts supporting the speech ” noted that “ the banking and insurance industries spent more than $ 300 million on a successful campaign to repeal the 1933 Glass - Steagall Act in 1999 . ”
Any effort Hillary Clinton might make to separate herself from her husband ’s positions will be undermined by the fact that Robert Rubin , promoter of bank deregulation and still a top official at Citigroup , is an advisor to her campaign .
On Monday in Philadelphia , in her own speech on economic issues , Hillary Clinton urged President Bush to immediately form an “ Emergency Working Group on Foreclosures , ” which “ could be headed by eminent leaders like Alan Greenspan , Paul Volcker , and Bob Rubin . ”
For the moment , at least , Obama has staked out the higher ground on this issue .
In the end , though , says Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , “ No matter who becomes our next president , Wall Street will have an indebted friend in the White House . ”
Once the campaign rhetoric fades , the only thing that might bring change on Wall Street is a revolt on Main Street , from Americans who finally cast blame for their lost homes and depleted retirement accounts on its rightful source .
I suspect this thing in the NYT is going to get a lot of discussion .
They took out adjustable - rate mortgages at the peak of the housing bubble to buy homes they would otherwise not be able to afford .
Or they refinanced existing mortgages to take cash out .
And now , two or three years later , the day of reckoning is here .
These are not lower - and middle - income borrowers , but more affluent consumers with annual incomes of $ 100,000 or more who are increasingly being ensnared in the home mortgage crisis .
The first step for distressed homeowners , said Rhonda Porter , a certified mortgage planning specialist and broker in Seattle , is to pull out their loan documents and see what they say .
Mr. Geller said he had heard of just one loan balance reduction won by a borrower .
That borrower , a real estate consultant in California who did not want to be identified because he feared angering his lender , said he used his understanding of state law to negotiate the refinancing .
He bought a condominium two years ago for $ 450,000 and invested another $ 50,000 for improvements .
His ARM had a 5.5 percent initial rate that was soon resetting to 7.25 percent .
But his condo is now worth only about $ 350,000 .
His lender agreed to give him a 6 percent fixed - rate mortgage and , he said , to knock $ 135,000 off the principal .
The agreement came only after he stopped paying his mortgage for two months .
“ I am very happy and grateful to the lender because what I owe on my condo now is in line with its worth , ” he said .
“ I ’m ecstatic . ”
Borrowers should determine if they live in a state with nonrecourse laws .
In general , lenders in those states cannot pursue borrowers for money owed .
But these laws are complex and change often , so consulting with a lawyer may be necessary , Mr. Geller said .
He has compiled a list of nonrecourse states at www.mortgagerelief formula.com / recourse .
If you can get the lender to approve your short sale , you can walk away pretty much unscathed .
You can have good credit .
You can even fix any negative reports they may have made about you , reports that say you were late .
And you wo n't face any more of those huge loan payments .
You 'll be free and clear , baby !
But first you gotta get there .
The way to make sure that the lender says yes is to give the lender * exactly * what they need to see . . .
The way to sell your house quickly is to follow the formula I call the Sell Your House in Nine Days system .
It is also called the round robin . . . .
The key here is convincing them [ the lender ] that the short sale price is right .
They rely a lot on a broker 's price opinion , or BPO .
And there is a whole system of ethically and honestly convincing the broker that the selling price is a fair one .
If the broker reports that your short sale price is fair , the lender will probably say " yes . "
The shocking secret of how to buy without qualifying and without getting on the hook for a loan . . .
Here 's the deal you are looking for .
If you are in an area with $ 150,000 houses , find a house where the motivated seller has a $ 150,000 mortgage .
And then buy the property " subject to " the existing mortgage .
It really is that simple .
The seller moves out .
You settle at the lawyer 's office .
Nobody tells the lender anything .
You start making the payments .
The loan is still in Mr. Seller 's name .
Is that a problem ?
No .
You are the owner .
You have a grant deed on file at the county courthouse in your name .
No problem at all .
Anyone can sell their house to someone else as long as they are still the owner , and title will transfer .
Even if there are loans still on the house .
Does n't matter .
So in this situation , Mr. Seller signed a deed over to you .
You checked the loan balance ( punching in Mr. Sellers ' loan number into the mortgage company 's automated robot phone system ) and now you have the keys and you have every right and privilege as the owner that Mr. Seller did .
But look what you did .
You have the mortgage interest deduction which lowers your taxes .
You own the house , lock stock and barrel .
But you never had to get your own loan .
Many sellers will want you to pay off the loan .
Of course they will .
But they are motivated , remember ?
So you tell them that you are n't going to do that just yet .
When will you ?
Maybe in a year or three .
Maybe in five years .
A motivated seller can be convinced to sell to you because they are relieved that someone else is stepping into their shoes .
It 's human nature to breathe a sigh of relief and let someone else ( you ) deal with the mortgage .
And it 's as simple as that .
There are wrinkles to this and things you should know , but it really is n't that hard .
It gets worse from there .
A lot worse .
First of all , I really want to know what a " certified mortgage planning specialist " is .
As a certified mortgage nonsense detector , I call BS .
Second , that 's the entire paragraph .
Besides not noticing the rather savage irony of all these rich folks who are only now getting around to seeing what the loan documents say -- so it 's not just those dumb poor folk who do that ?-- there 's no indication of what is supposed to happen next .
Is it just me , or is there a hint here that the first thing people should do is check to see if there 's some way to sue ?
At the end of the article is a little story that 's likely to piss off plenty of readers : A " real estate consultant . "
( Is n't anyone just a broker anymore ? )
But what " understanding " of what " state law " did this dude use to get this deal done ?
Why is the dude " afraid of angering his lender " ?
He already got his deal . . . ?
Then there is this : I 'll go for state foreclosure laws being complex , but changing often ?
Really ?
Like , how often ?
My impression has been that some of our recent troubles stem from the fact that foreclosure laws have n't changed in a lot of places since the Depression .
Anyway , I was interested in that list because I have been asked for one several times .
The link in the NYT piece is not formatted properly ; try this .
What you will get is simply a list of states with non-judicial foreclosure processes .
Labelled " non-recourse mortgage walkaway states . "
Is this Geller simply incompetent , not understanding the difference between non-judicial foreclosure and antideficiency statutes ?
Or is he just trying to jump on the same bandwagon of youwalkaway.com ?
And how did he get to be a source for an article in the NYT , giving him " credibility " and free publicity ?
I suggest spending a few minutes with Mr. Geller 's website
Of course you do n't get the " details " of how this works unless you " download the report , " and I am not sure my PC is well - enough protected to do that .
But after the short sale , we get to Mr. Geller 's advice for what to do now that you no longer own a home :
Yes , this is the bucket of scum that the reporter has given credibility to on the pages of the Grey Lady .
Is there left an editor who , to paraphrase Jackson Browne , still knows how to cry ?
Please do go back and take note that the anecdote of the borrower who scored the $ 135,000 principal reduction turns out to be a story " Mr. Geller heard of . "
The finds were made in a cellar under Haut de la Garenne in Jersey , where 160 people have said they were abused .
Lenny Harper , Jersey 's deputy police chief , said : " They are items which witnesses have said were in there when offences were committed against them . "
On Saturday a child 's skull was discovered on the premises .
Underground room
Search teams have been digging turf around the home 's grounds which they believe may have been disturbed .
The BBC's Robert Hall said he had learned the cellar contained a shallow bath and a set of shackles .
The shackles had been found on the floor but may once have been fastened to the wall , he added .
Mr Harper said the finds were made in a bricked - up cellar - one of three underground rooms being investigated by officers at the home .
He told reporters that the two items discovered would " tend to provide corroboration for some of the allegations which we have received about offences that were committed " .
We are looking for all sorts of evidence which would include , I would have to say , human remains

However , he declined to answer questions about what the discoveries may have been , and refused to be drawn on reports that one of the items found was a set of shackles .
But no further human remains had been found , he added .
Mr Harper said one of the items was discovered on February 27 and the second on February 28 .
He added that detectives did not have a " definitive " list of missing children .
" What we do have are anecdotal statements along the lines of : ' We were in there with such and such a person ' , and maybe a first name , ' and they got into a row and there were screams one night and they did n't appear again the next day and someone said they had run away to the UK ' , " he said .
" We are looking for all sorts of evidence which would include , I would have to say , human remains . "
A sniffer dog reacted " strongly " when it entered the room on Wednesday , according to officers .
A forensic archaeologist has been sifting through large piles of rubble and soil in the cellar .
Mr Harper said a second underground room adjoining the first had still to be searched .
It is understood to be the same size as the first - about 12ft square and 8ft high - and also bricked up .
And a former member of staff at the home who contacted police about a third underground room - unconnected with the first two cellars - will be asked to help officers locate it .
The former employee added that the third cellar was not part of the main building and was used as a store room , a police spokesman said .
The former Haute de la Garenne home care home and Jersey Sea Cadets are the main focus of an investigation into the sexual and physical abuse of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 15 dating back over several decades .

Stop your progress , gays -- polygamists might get some ideas
by Jeremy Hooper
Hey women :
Do n't you dare push for the right to vote because that might le ad to infants or canines wanting the same !
Hey African - Americans :
Do n't push for integration because that might cause widely dissimilar groups to draw a connection from your fight and use it as a springboard for their own cases .
Hey early 20th century foes of Prohibition : Do n't stand up for one 's legal right to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages , as that might lead certain fetishists to brand and market a six - pack of piss .
Hey gays who are pushing for the injustices that have been waged against your liberties :
Do n't push for the legal relationship recognition that you fully deserve , as such might help polygamists .
Such is the argument of some of our Florida - based opponents .
This from the Tallahassee Democrat :
" This is not the end game .
There are many people who want to bring their aberrant forms of marriage to the table , and once you open the door , there 's really no end to it , " he said .
" If marriage means anything , then marriage means nothing . "
Stemberger said " logic , biology , tradition and common sense " dictate that marriage is not for homosexuals .
He further cited law - review articles and statements by proponents of polygamy and group marriage who claim there is no legal reason to limit marriage to one man and one woman .
" These are not crazies , " he said .
" These folks are where homosexual activists were 25 years ago .
The problem is , when you unlock that door , there 's really no end to the argument of where we 're going to define marriage . "
There is no line of logic from our opponents that 's more annoying than the idea that this specific fight for equality is a " slippery slope . "
They act as if we are just the first act of an " immorality play " that 's being performed out on the world 's stage .
To many of our foes , we 're not humans with actual grounds for advancement .
No , no -- instead we 're litmus tests for whether or not their version of a pleasant society is going to be steamrolled by all that is " wicked . "
It 's as if they 've all of a sudden adopted the persona of Madame FearMongera : " Pro-Family " Psychic , with their crystal ball giving them insight that we could never understand .
And it 's really frickin ' unfair !
You know what ?
Other groups very well might come along and try and use gay marriage as a test case for their own desired advancements , since legislation of morality is at play in the gay - centric marriage equality battle .
We all have the right to push for the change we wish to see in the world .
And when those other groups make their cases , we all will have the opportunity to form opinions regarding our support for them .
But the righteousness or non-righteousness of subsequent movements has zero bearing on the current debate , and it is completely unfair to suggest that it does !
What we are talking about is the now .
We have to deal with the present issues informed by the past struggles , not deal with a one - sided , fear - mongery presentation of a possible future !
We very well may cross some of the predicted bridges someday , and we have a duty to accurately assess them when they arise .
But to suggest that we should destroy the inroads that we 've already made so as to not enable others to piggyback on our progress is as unfair as simplistically writing off our relationships as " aberrant " arrangements that are precluded by common sense !
Come to think of it , it is that last idea that is truly in danger of begetting more and worse ideas !
Proposed ban on gay marriage sparks debate [ Tallahassee Democrat ]
Your thoughts
What would stop polygamy from being governmentally recognized if same - sex marriage became accepted ?
Well , I would say the same things that stop it currently , whatever those things may be .
I do n't understand why same - sex marriage must be seen as a stepping stone to polgamy for the simple fact that same - sex marriage and polygamy are not on the same path .
They are each their own unique " variations " of marriage as it is known now , and polygamy could just as easily sprout directly from " traditional marriage " as it could as off - shoot of newly - recognized same - sex marriage .
If there really was a push for legal polygamy , it would be occuring already , separately from the same - sex marriage fight .
It 's almost insulting to polygamists to assume they are just waiting around for same - sex marriage to go through so that they can strike , using as their sole reason " Hey , you let them do it ! "
The " slippery slope " effect may be true for something like , say , if you let one student go to the bathroom , they will all want to go , but to extend that simple logic to a debate as large and complex as this one is irresponsible .
Posted by : Eric L | Mar 27 , 2008 3:00:23 PM
Well it 's all about the fear , Eric .
They know that polygamy freaks out more people than same - sex marriage , so they work that angle .
But yes , it is an independent matter that will play out regardless of what happens with same - sex marriage .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 27 , 2008 3:06:36 PM
It 's an interesting insight into their " scale of immorality " and how they view what is worse than something else .
At least same - sex marriage seems to be at the top of the slope , huh !
Posted by : Eric L | Mar 27 , 2008 3:16:43 PM
It 's odd how Christians keep bringing up polygamy , beacause it was morally right and practiced by Christians past .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Human evolution has been moving at breakneck speed in the past several thousand years , far from plodding along as some scientists had thought , researchers said on Monday .

Human evolution has been moving at breakneck speed in the past several thousand years , far from plodding along as some scientists had thought , researchers said on Monday .
In fact , people today are genetically more different from people living 5,000 years ago than those humans were different from the Neanderthals who vanished 30,000 years ago , according to anthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin .

In fact , people today are genetically more different from people living 5,000 years ago than those humans were different from the Neanderthals who vanished 30,000 years ago , according to anthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin .
The genetic changes have related to numerous different human characteristics , the researchers said .
Many of the recent genetic changes reflect differences in the human diet brought on by agriculture , as well as resistance to epidemic diseases that became mass killers following the growth of human civilizations , the researchers said .
For example , Africans have new genes providing resistance to malaria .
In Europeans , there is a gene that makes them better able to digest milk as adults .
In Asians , there is a gene that makes ear wax more dry .
The changes have been driven by the colossal growth in the human population -- from a few million to 6.5 billion in the past 10,000 years -- with people moving into new environments to which they needed to adapt , added Henry Harpending , a University of Utah anthropologist .
“ The central finding is that human evolution is happening very fast -- faster than any of us thought , ” Harpending said in a telephone interview .
“ Most of the acceleration is in the last 10,000 years , basically corresponding to population growth after agriculture is invented , ” Hawks said in a telephone interview .
The research appears in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
FAVORABLE GENE MUTATIONS
The researchers looked for the appearance of favorable gene mutations over the past 80,000 years of human history by analyzing voluminous DNA information on 270 people from different populations worldwide .
Data from this International HapMap Project , short for haplotype mapping , offered essentially a catalogue of genetic differences and similarities in people alive today .
Looking at such data , scientists can ascertain how recently a given genetic change appeared in the genome and then can plot the pace of such change into the distant past .
Beneficial genetic changes have appeared at a rate roughly 100 times higher in the past 5,000 years than at any previous period of human evolution , the researchers determined .
They added that about 7 percent of human genes are undergoing rapid , relatively recent evolution .
Even with these changes , however , human DNA remains more than 99 percent identical , the researchers noted .
Harpending said the genetic evidence shows that people worldwide have been getting less similar rather than more similar due to the relatively recent genetic changes .
Genes have evolved relatively quickly in Africa , Asia and Europe but almost all of the changes have been unique to their corner of the world .
This is the case , he said , because since humans dispersed from Africa to other parts of the world about 40,000 years ago , there has not been much flow of genes between the regions .
Lebanese politics are confusing , so what follows is a brief summary of where political affiliations currently stand .
Since former president Emile Lahoud stepped down over five months ago , Lebanon has been without a president and the political parties representing diverse social and religious sects are currently divided into two camps .
The US - backed March 14th Coalition , led by Saad Hariri , the son of assassinated former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri , currently holds the majority in Parliament .
The March 14th Coalition is dominated by Mustaqbal , Hariri ’s party , the ( mostly Druze ) Progressive Socialist Party , led by Walid Jumblatt , and two Maronite Christian parties , the Lebanese Forces , led by Samir Geagea , and the Kataeb Party , led by former president Amine Gemayle .
The Opposition , also known as the March 8th Coalition , is led by Hizbullah , allegedly backed by Iran and Syria , which is tenuously allied with Nabih Berri ’s Shiite Amal Movement and Christian general Michel Aoun ’s Free Patriotic Movement .
Though both coalitions have agreed on General Michel Sleiman as Lebanon ’s next president , political deadlock has prevented his election .
The division of Lebanon ’s political parties is often described as falling along religion lines , particularly Sunni-Shiite antagonisms .
In reality , both the Christians and the Druze have political parties in both camps , and most Sunni and Shiite people we know do not perceive the March 14th - March 8th split as a simply religion division .
The morning of May 6th the March 14th - led Council of Ministers made two controversial decisions : they declared Hizbullah ’s telecommunications system , a fiber optic network instrumental to ending the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon in 2000 , " illegal and unconstitutional " and called for the dismissal of General Waqif Shouqair , head of security at Beirut ’s International Airport and one of the few remaining Shiite officials in the current government .
The Council of Ministers accused Shouqair of allowing Hizbullah - controlled cameras at the airport .
Both Shouqair and Hizbullah deny these charges ; Hizbullah maintains that Shouqair is simply Shiite , and not a member of Hizbullah .
Wednesday , March 7th , totally unrelated to the previous day ’s decisions , the General Labor Confederation organized a strike demanding an increase in Lebanon ’s pitiful minimum monthly wage of $ 200 US dollars .
While the Opposition supported the labor strikers , many March 14th supporters ’ shops remained open .
Our neighborhood was quiet , and we spent our day off of school doing homework in a café , fully expecting a return to normalcy the next morning .
By early afternoon , the Opposition and strikers had blocked the airport highway south of the city , erecting blockades of burning tires and piles of dirt .
Soon after , armed fighting broke out between March 14th and Opposition militias in Beirut and continued into the following morning .
The blockades shut down the airport , paralyzing all air traffic in and out of Lebanon .
A friend ’s aunt arrived on one of the last planes to land , and , unable to find transportation home , walked through the smoldering barricades and caught a taxi back into Beirut .
People began to leave the city for homes in the mountains or flee the country through the Syrian border .
We heard from our neighbors that a pregnant woman had been shot on the road to Damascus ; by nightfall , the road was closed .
On Thursday May 8th , tensions ran high following a night of continued militia clashes and rumors the Opposition planned to set up encampments along airport road ; similar to the tent city that has paralyzed Beirut ’s commercial downtown district for the last two years .
In Hamra , West Beirut , many shops remained open and the streets were quiet .
Our local grocery store was crowded with neighborhood residents anxious to stock up ; by early afternoon there was no bread to be found in Hamra and the supermarkets shelves were nearly empty .
That afternoon Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah gave a rare press conference .
Nasrallah ’s demands of the March 14th government were clear : Hizbullah ’s communications network is an indispensable " weapon of the resistance " and the government ’s decision to threaten this weapon was tantamount to a declaration of war .
" We believe that a war has started , and it is our duty to defend our arms , resistance and the legitimacy of this resistance " , Nasrallah explained , " we do not want to attack or launch an aggression on anyone , but we do not allow anyone to launch an aggression on us . "
In West Beirut , we heard gunfire as his speech ended .
The fighting was so loud by Thursday evening that even from our apartment on the isolated and protected American University of Beirut campus we could hear machine gun fire , the single blasts of snipers ’ rifles , and the boom of rocket - propelled grenades .
There was constant gunfire all night .
It sounded impossibly close to us but it was hard to tell with the water below bouncing back strange echoes .
There were a few really loud blasts that rattled our door open ( leaning out my window I watched a group of people below me scream and run for cover ) .
Standing on our balcony talking on the phone I watched three rocket propelled grenades trailing red shoot over campus .
RPG searchlights swept back and forth across the front of our building , and we saw a carload of armed men driving along the sea road and smelled the smoke of burning tire piles at blockades a few blocks away .
We finally fell asleep despite the booms of the fighting and woke up a few hours later to the roll of thunder .
The thunder sounded like bombs ; my roommate screamed and I lay shaking and confused in my bed but a few seconds later a torrential rain came .
The storm stopped the fighting , and we heard only the occasional pop of snipers ’ rifles as we fell back asleep .
By the morning of Friday , May 9th , several Arab countries , including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , called for their citizens to evacuate .
Our Lebanese flat mate Sally has family in Kuwait and the embassy agreed to help her leave .
They refused to venture into West Beirut to pick her up , so we walked with her through the deserted streets to the edge of downtown .
Aside from the occasional blast of machine gun fire , our neighborhood was eerily quiet , and we saw no one except an Ethiopian maid with a well - groomed dog .
" See , there are people out ! " I said hopefully .
Later , a friend explained that during the July War migrant laborers collected the trash during the bombings , concluding : " there ’s a reason they sent the maid . "
We passed through three Lebanese Army blockades on our way to the Kuwaiti evacuation meeting point .
The soldiers gaped at us in utter disbelief , lowering their guns and pushing their helmets back to stare .
I ca n’t imagine what they thought of us : lone young women with linked arms , Sally carrying her leopard skin purse .
A soldier leaned out a tank and told us to watch out for snipers on the rooftops .
We held hands , Sally recited Koran , and we tried to stay close to the base of buildings .
The meeting point was a deserted office with a shattered glass door ; a man took us down to a basement garage where Sally was whisked into a waiting sedan and driven away .
On our way back to the university we saw Lebanese Army tanks rolling down Bliss Street , the main road running along the top of the campus .
Usually bustling with AUB students crowding cafés and street food stands selling hot crepes , coffee , and manaeesh ( flatbread with cheese ) , the street was totally empty .
Less than an hour later what sounded like sniper fire directly above our heads on Bliss Street send us ducking and running to our apartment .
We heard from our flat mate that that the Opposition had taken over West Beirut , including our neighborhood of Hamra .
" Do n’t worry , " she said , " they are not bad people .
I ’m Sunni from Saida ( Hariri ’s hometown ) and I am not worried .
But you probably should n’t try and go talk to them right now . "
The Opposition ’s occupation of West Beirut was completely unexpected and immediately followed by sensational headlines and accusations from an embarrassed March 14th coalition that Hizbullah was staging a coup and starting a civil war .
By the afternoon Opposition forces broke into Hariri ’s Future TV station , taking it off the air and drawing sharp criticism from international media institutions .
We spent the day on campus , reading the news online or leaning off our balcony to try and see Opposition militia outside the university .
Friday evening was quiet , and when we awoke Saturday morning , the Opposition was withdrawing and handing West Beirut over to the Lebanese Army .
When we went for a walk through Hamra early Saturday , a few stores were re-opening and there was light traffic .
Aside from shattered glass on the street , the flags of parties aligned with the Opposition hanging from shopping centers or graffitied below street signs , and piles on uncollected trash , the neighborhood seemed almost normal .
Our friends quickly began arranging to leave and join their families outside of Beirut ; one young woman managed to get out of Beirut to Tripoli only to find a fierce gunfight on the street in front of her family home .
Though Hizbullah peacefully withdrew from Beirut , fighting between militias spread to the northern city of Tripoli and inland to the mountains in the east .
The calm in Beirut was broken later that day in the Sunni neighborhood of Tariq Jedideh when a Shiite shopkeeper opened fire on a Sunni funeral procession , killing two people and wounding six .
A few hours later , in the village of Aley , which lies east of Beirut , Jumblatt ’s Druze militias ( allied with March 14th Coalition ) allegedly knifed two Hizbullah soldiers to death .
That afternoon , Prime Minister Fouad Siniora gave a speech that was widely received as conciliatory : he agreed to pass the decisions regarding Hezbollah ’s communications network and the dismissal of General Shouqair onto the Lebanese Army .
Despite government concession and an uneasy ceasefire fighting between government militias and Opposition militias continued Sunday , Monday , and Tuesday .
The Arab League sent a delegation to broker a deal and the United States sent the Navy destroyer the USS Cole towards the Mediterranean from the Persian Gulf .
We anxiously waited to hear the results of the negotiations led by the Arab League mediators .
It is now past twelve on the night of Wednesday , May 13th .
We can hear gunfire again , but this time it ’s celebratory .
Following negotiation with the Arab League team , the government just rescinded their decisions to dismantle Hizbullah ’s telecommunications system and fire the airport head of security , General Shouqair .
This is a huge victory for the Opposition , who have flexed their muscles and demonstrated the inability of the Lebanese Army or March 14th militias to prevent the Occupation of West Beirut .
This represents a crucial shift in the delicate balance of power ; it remains to be seen if the government will remain backed down .
President Bush ’s consistent conflation of Hizbullah with Al - Qaeda is alarming , and does n’t bode well for a resolution to the stalemate between the US - backed March 14th Coalition and the Opposition .
The complex issues of representation underlying the past week ’s conflict are far from resolved , and talks will continue in the coming days .

' Katyn ' Massacre at the Berlin Film Festival History Lessons from Poland
Until now , no one has managed to force open the darkest corners of Poland 's " sealed memory . "
Andrzej Wajda 's new World War II drama , " Katyn , " succeeds .
It tells the long - taboo tale of the roughly 14,500 Polish military officers murdered by the Soviet army in 1940 .

The internet is to human interaction as Pringles are to potatoes .
Companionship and closeness are processed into an unrecognizable slurry , then reconstituted as an unnatural recreation of their original incarnation .
We start as social creatures , isolate ourselves into small rooms writhing with power strips , then make friends with similarly sequestered people , trying to re-create the very communities we 're avoiding .
There are a lot of people I genuinely like whom I 've never met in person .
I care about them , at least enough that if they got arrested I 'd gladly PayPal them bail money .
Nonetheless , here 's something I will never say : " Wow , this party is so great , it 's almost as cool as a message board ! "
Even I am not capable of that level of sarcasm , and I 'm a professional sarcast .

With this in mind , I 'm not sure why I keep trying out new social networking sites .
The very term social networking gleams with utilitarian smarm .
If you 're the sort of person who will go home in the middle of a shindig and / or gala to pick up more business cards , you 're a social networker – congratulations , leave me alone .
Really , any verb construct that does n't lend itself to the preterite tense should be considered with deep suspicion .
" What did you do last night ? " " I social networked !
I networked socially !
I found myself in a social situation , so I networked it ! "
If I can't substitute caroused , reveled or at the very least hobnobbed , then it's not the sort of social I want to network anyway .
Still , I feel obligated to keep up with the cutting edge of web communities , which generally means I just sign up with anything Jason Kottke tells me to .
That 's how I got involved with Twitter .
Twitter takes the Pringles analogy to its logical conclusion .
It 's something like a collection of personal blogs , only each entry is limited to 140 characters , so you end up with a vertical stack of bite - size , artificially flavored communication snacks .
They 're oddly compelling while remaining staunchly unsatisfying , and it always feels like maybe the next one will quell the roiling ennui inside .
Like an elderly widow keeping the TV on for " company , " I keep a Twitter window open whenever I 'm online , and accept that as sort of , kind of communication .
Over the course of my day I learn that Wil Wheaton enjoys the new B - 52s album , Jonathan Coulton is taking a minivan cab and Kottke himself is having a " really crappy morning . "
I think one reason Twitter leaves me unsatiated is that it asks the most boring question possible : " What are you doing ? "
Call up a friend and ask them what they 've been doing lately and you might get an interesting response .
Ask them what they 're doing right now and you 're almost guaranteed to get a boring answer : " Eating lunch . "
" Thinking about doing some laundry . "
That 's because if they were seducing a Nobel Prize laureate or rescuing a baby from a burning submarine , they would n't have answered the phone .
Furthermore , the 140 - character limit , while discouraging the sort of self - indulgent maxi-musings that characterize LiveJournal , ends up being too short for interesting topics , while remaining way too long for boring ones .
Boring : " I need a new shoelace .
Well , I guess I need two .
I do n't want mismatched shoelaces . "
Eighty - three characters , and already about 70 too long .
I 'd suggest shortening this to " I still exist . "
Interesting : " I 'm at Six Flags !
It 's Robot Day !
I'm in the Bourbon - Bot line , and I 'm behind Jeanne Tripplehorn !
She just asked if I have any massage oil in m "
Insufficient .
Of course , I provide my own contributions to Twitter .
I 'm not some sort of Twitter - leech .
What do I talk about ?
Hash browns , mostly .
I 'm keeping a running log of my attempts to cook the perfect hash browns .
Seriously .
I must be stopped .

Random Numbers : Nothing Left to Chance Posted March 2008 .
The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance .

It is often said that mathematics is about understanding patterns and that these patterns are what makes mathematics beautiful .
This article , however , is about how mathematics may be used to create , or at least simulate , randomness , the lack of patterns .
Surprisingly , we will see that it is difficult to create random behavior ( in fact , the words " create randomness " may sound a little jarring ) and to determine when we have successfully done it .
We will focus on constructing random sequences of numbers .
There are many reasons why we might want to do this .
For centuries , people have used randomness -- a coin toss , for instance -- to make important decisions .
Of course , many states run lotteries that use a sequence of random numbers to determine the recipients of huge amounts of money .
Some readers may remember the draft lottery used during the Vietnam war .
In 1969 , the days of the year were ordered by drawing pieces of paper , each with a day of the year written on it , from a bin .
Young men born on those days drawn first were more likely to be drafted .
A statistical analysis later found that , because they were placed in the bin later , days toward the end of the year were more likely to be drawn .
In other words , the days were not ordered randomly , and a more mathematical solution was proposed for subsequent years ' lotteries .
Currently , random numbers are used to form encryption keys when information needs to be passed securely , say , across the Internet .
Random sequences of numbers are also important for simulating real - world phenomena .
For instance , a bank that operates a network of ATM machines may wish to test its software by simulating the actions of customers accessing their accounts at random times through random machines .
Random numbers are also used by so - called Monte Carlo methods to obtain numerical approximations to problems that may be too difficult to solve exactly .
For instance , imagine that we do not know the area of the unit circle .
We could place the unit circle inside a square of known area and randomly add points to the square .
The percentage of points that lie inside the circle should approximate the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square .
The figure below shows 2000 points randomly placed inside a square whose sides have length 2.2 , 1308 of which lie inside the circle .
The approximate area of the circle is then the area of the square , 4.84 , times 1308/2000 , which is 3.16536 ( the exact area is , of course , ) .
Where do random numbers come from ?
Most of us already have an intuitive notion of what random numbers are , but , as we 'll see , this is a difficult question to answer precisely .
Simply said , we should not be able to use the numbers that we have seen to predict which number will come next or to restrict the possibilities .
For example , you may wish to think of rolling an ideal die .
On each roll , each of the numbers - - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 - - is equally likely to appear .
If we roll many times , we may expect to see each of the six possibilities roughly one - sixth of the time .
In addition , if we count the number of successive pairs , we would expect to see each of the 36 possible pairs appear with roughly equal frequency .
It is possible , however , that we roll the die one thousand times and obtain a " 1 " each time .
Regardless , each number is equally likely to show up on the 1001st time .
( This seeming paradox lies behind a well known Dilbert cartoon . )
At first glance , it may seem like a simple thing to generate random numbers .
In fact , you may think that humans could do this easily by , for instance , just writing sequences of 0's and 1's in a stream of consciousness .
By following this link , you will be able to write a sequence of one hundred 0's and 1's that will be analyzed using a few of the tests we 'll encounter later in this article .
If your sequence passes these tests , it shares several properties with truly random sequences .
However , you will most likely find it difficult to write a sequence that passes these tests .
Humans have a difficult time creating random sequences by trying to " act randomly . "
Truly random sequences of numbers may be generated by natural phenomena .
Indeed , the web site HotBits , makes available random sequences generated by recording the times between the decays of radioactive particles .
For instance , the time between two decays is recorded and compared to the time between the next two .
If the first time is shorter than the second , a " 0 " is recorded , but if the first time is longer than the second , a " 1 " is recorded .
In this way , a sequence of random bits , which may be concatenated to form random integers , is produced .
Another site , Random.org , works in a similar way by recording the amplitude of atmospheric noise .
An interesting question is whether the digits of form a random sequence .
Numerical evidence , based on looking at trillions of digits , suggests that they do , but not enough is known at this time to say definitively .
Random number generators
While some sequences generated by natural phenomena produce truly random numbers , many applications require that we be able to create random numbers efficiently inside a computer .
This may sound impossible : computers simply execute a set of instructions whose output is determined by the input .
Since we supply the computer with the instructions and the input , the output is determined by our choices .
How can such a number be random ?
The answer is that it 's not .
Instead , our goal is to use a procedure that hides our footprints so that the numbers create the illusion of randomness .
More precisely , we want the numbers to share many properties that we would expect a truly random sequence to enjoy .
Such a procedure is often called a pseudorandom number generator , since the numbers generated are not truly random , though we will follow convention and use the term random number generator .
Our discussion is greatly influenced by Donald Knuth 's exposition in Volume 2 of The Art of Computer Programming , cited in the references .
John von Neumann proposed using the following method as one of the first random number generators .
Suppose we want to create eight - digit numbers .
Begin with an eight - digit number X 0 , which we call the seed , and create the next integer in the sequence by removing the middle eight digits from X 0 2 .
For instance , if X 0 = 35385906 , we find that X 0 2 = 1252162343440836 so that our next number is X 1 = 16234344 .
If we repeat this a few times we find : X 0 16234344 X 1 55392511 X 2 33027488 X 3 81496359 X 4 65653025 X 5 31969165 X 6 02751079 X 7 56843566 X 8 19099559 X 9 79315399
Since it is difficult , at first glance , to find a pattern in these numbers , we may think that this is an appropriate way to find random numbers .
In other words , we have created the illusion of randomness through a deterministic process .
Further study shows , however , that this is not a good random number generator .
Each term in the sequence depends only on its immediate predecessor and there are only a finite number of possible terms .
This means that the sequence will inevitably repeat .
The problem is that the sequence can get caught in relatively short cycles .
For instance , if the number 31360000 appears in the sequence at some point , we end up with this number again after another 99 iterations and this cycle continues indefinitely .
The middle square method may give you the idea to ask the computer to perform a sequence of many , unrelated , random operations .
In fact , Knuth constructed an algorithm that used 13 " peculiar " steps to produce the next number in a sequence of 10 - digit numbers and found that it was a very poor way to generate random numbers .
I created a simple algorithm to generate two - digit numbers using apparently " random " operations .
Start with a two digit number whose digits are d 1 d 0 .
d .
Form a new digit r = 10 - ( d 1 +d 0 ) mod 10 .
+d ) mod 10 .
Form the three digit number s=d 1 rd 0 .
rd .
Let and form a new two digit number e 1 e 0 where e i is the d i th digit in t after the decimal .
and form a new two digit number e e where e is the d digit in t after the decimal .
If e 0 is larger than 5 , replace it with 10 - e 0 .
is larger than 5 , replace it with 10 - e .
Now find the arctangent of ( e 1 + 1 ) / ( e 0 + 1 ) .
Our new two - digit number is formed by the first two digits after the decimal point .
What may seem surprising is that this algorithm produces the short cycle 91 , 96 , 46 , 1 , 64 , 73 , 72 , 91 , .... , and most seeds lead us to this cycle .
As Knuth writes , " The moral of the story is that random numbers should not be generated with a method chosen at random [ emphasis original ] . "
Linear congruential generators Surprisingly , a good source of pseudorandom number generators comes from the linear congruential method , introduced by Derrick Lehmer in 1949 .
Here we choose a modulus : m a multiplier : a an increment : c a starting value : X 0 We then form the next terms in the sequence by X n+1 = f ( X n ) = ( aX n + c ) mod m .
At first glance , it is hard to believe this will produce the illusion of randomness .
Remember that we want each term of the sequence to appear to be independent of its predecessor .
Can we really accomplish this using a linear function ?
It turns out that the art is in choosing appropriate values of a , c , and m .
Of course , there are only a finite number of possible numbers 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , m - 1 and since one term is determined by its immediate predecessor , the sequence will inevitably form a repeating cycle whose period will be no larger than m .
If this period is short , the sequence will quickly begin to repeat , undesirable behavior if are trying to mimic a random sequence .
However , the following theorem shows us how we may make the period have the maximal length m .
To express this theorem , it is convenient to use the shorthand b = a - 1 .
The period of the sequence { X n } is m if and only if c is relatively prime to m .
b is a multiple of every prime that divides m .
b is a multiple of 4 if m is a multiple of 4 .
For example , the choices , and c = 64 produce a cyclic sequence of numbers whose period is m=8505 .
We therefore have X n+1 = ( 106X n + 64 ) mod 8505 .
Shown below are the first few points ( x , f ( x ) ) created using this generator .
As you can see , they appear to be randomly placed .
Typically , integers are represented in a computer using 32 bits so it is natural to choose a value of m close to 232 .
With an appropriate choice of a and c , our sequence will then cycle through most of the integers that the computer can represent .
Notice that a = c = 1 satisfies the hypothesis of this theorem .
However , this choice produces the sequence X 0 , X 0 + 1 , X 0 + 2 , X 0 + 3 , X 0 + 4 , ... , which is hardly random .
Clearly , we need another condition , in addition to the maximal period condition , if we are going to create random numbers using this method .
A second condition , which we will now describe , will be quantified using the potency of the sequence , which we define to be the smallest integer s such that bs = 0 mod m .
To understand this quantity , begin with X 0 = 0 ( which will eventually be encountered since the sequence has period m ) , and notice that X 1 = ( aX 0 + c ) mod m = c X 2 = ( ac + c ) mod m X 3 = ( a2 c + ac + c ) mod m X n = ( an - 1 c + ... + ac + c ) mod m X n = ( an - 1 ) c / b ) mod m
If we expand an - 1 = ( b + 1 ) n - 1 , then we obtain
If the potency is 1 , then we have X n = ( cn ) mod m .
This sequence is certainly not random .
If the potency is 2 , then X n+1 - X n = ( c + cbn ) mod m .
In other words , the difference between successive terms behaves in a predictable way so that the sequence cannot be considered random .
Continuing this thinking shows that we need the potency to be relatively high to achieve the illusion of randomness .
Experimenting shows that a potency of at least 5 is necessary to create useful random numbers .
However , a linear congruential sequence with a potency of 5 is not guaranteed to be random .
In our example above , we had and , which produces a linear congruential sequence of maximal period with potency 5 ( the first few points are shown on the left below ) .
In constrast , if we take and , we obtain a linear congruential sequence with maximal period and potency 2 ( the first few points are on the right ) .
In spite of the fact that linear congruential sequences are simply defined , the numbers produced are good enough for many applications .
In fact , random numbers provided by computer programming languages , such as Java , are often created by linear congruential generators .
The choice of the seed X 0 is often taken as the current time expressed in milliseconds .
Other methods , besides the linear congruential method , have been proposed for creating random sequences .
Two other ideas come to mind .
First , we might choose a quadratic function rather than a linear one .
Robert Coveyou suggested the function : X n+1 = X n ( X n + 1 ) mod 2e and showed that it produced sufficiently random numbers .
Also , we could consider using more than the previous term in the sequence to generate the next .
An example is the lagged Fibonacci sequence , suggested by Gerard Mitchell and Donald Moore in 1958 : X n+1 = ( X n - 24 + X n - 55 ) mod m once the first 55 terms of the sequence are generated using , say , a linear congruential generator .
The appearance of 24 and 55 in this expression , chosen after careful study , guarantees that the sequence has a suitably long period .
How do we recognize random numbers ?
If we propose a method for creating random numbers , we need some way to measure how good its results are .
We will now describe a few tests that are important but still somewhat inadequate .
To get started , we will describe one test and how it is implemented .
Then we will describe a collection of subsequent tests that may be implemented in a similiar way .
Let 's consider a simple case in which the numbers we generate are either 0 or 1 .
There are 32 = 25 possible sequences of five numbers , and each group of five numbers belongs to one of six categories depending on whether there are 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 zeroes .
The following table shows n i , the number of these 32 possibilities that have i zeroes and p i , the probability that a sequence of five numbers , chosen at random , has i zeroes .
i n i p i 0 1 1/32 1 5 5/32 2 10 10/32 3 10 10/32 4 5 5/32 5 1 1/32
What we will now describe is known as the chi square test .
Given our sequence { X n } of zeroes and ones , break it into r disjoint groups of five consecutive elements , and denote by r i the number of groups having i zeroes .
If our sequence were random , we should have so we can measure how our sequence differs from a random one by computing ( r i - rp i ) 2 .
Since p 2 is much larger than p 0 , we should expect that r 2 is much larger than r 0 and that the corresponding error term should be larger .
To avoid giving undue weight to any of the six possibilities we divide ( r i - rp i ) 2 by rp i and form the chi square statistic as a measure of how our sequence compares to a random sequence .
Smaller values of V should more closely resemble a random sequence .
For example , suppose we have r 0 = 10 , r 1 = 46 , r 2 = 95 , r 3 = 107 , r 4 = 60 , r 5 = 15 , for which we compute V=4.835 .
To interpret this number , we may compute V for all possible sequences { X n } of zeroes and ones of length 5r and ask what percentage p of the sequences have a lower value of V .
Of course , implementing this would be rather tedious , but there is a general theory , which will not be described here , that comes to our rescue and enables us to compute an approximate percentage p in a relatively simple way .
In our example , we find that we obtain a lower value of V in approximately p = 56 % of the other sequences .
Knuth suggests that our sequence fails the test when p < 1 % or p > 99 % and that we view it with suspicion when either p < 10 % or p > 90 % .
The thought is that if p is too high , then it differs too much from a random sequence to be considered random .
If p is too low , it too closely matches the statistics of a random sequence and should therefore be rejected since its characteristics are too similar to those of a random sequence .
Knuth also suggests running the test three different times on different sequences produced by the generator we are testing .
If any test gives a suspicious result , we should not view the generator as producing sufficiently random results .
In the same way , we may wish to repeat the test many times and determine how closely the percentages p match the uniform distribution ; that is , we expect p to be between 0 % and 10 % about 10 % of the time , between 10 % and 20 % about 10 % of the time and so forth .
There is a widely accepted collection of such tests , known as the Diehard tests , that may be performed in a similar way .
We list here a few of them .
To qualify as a useful random number generator , a method needs to pass all of these tests , and passing one test is no guarantee that it will pass another .
Frequency test :
We would like our numbers to be uniformly distributed so that if the numbers come from 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , m - 1 , then each number occurs with roughly equal frequency .
In this case , we let r i be the number of times i occurs in our sequence and notice that p i = 1 / m .
Of course , the nonrandom sequence 0 , 1 , 2 , ... would pass this test .
We may therefore ask in addition that every pair ( i , j ) occur in successive elements with equal frequency .
Here we let r i , j count the number of times the pair ( i , j ) occurs in the sequence and note that p i , j = 1 / m 2 .
This is called the 2 - distribution test and may be extended to the more general k - distribution test .

Permutation test : Select some small value for t such as t = 3 , break the sequence into disjoint groups of t consecutive elements and assume that no two elements in a group are equal .
There are t! possible ways in which the elements are ordered , each of which is equally likely .
Select some small value for t such as t = 3 , break the sequence into disjoint groups of t consecutive elements and assume that no two elements in a group are equal .

Run test :
In this test , we count the length of " runs , " portions of the sequence in which the terms either increase monotonically or decrease monotonically .

Gap test :
We fix a range of values , such as 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , m/ 2 , and count the number of terms in the sequence separating two terms that appear in this range .
We fix a range of values , such as 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , m/ 2 , and count the number of terms in the sequence separating two terms that appear in this range .
Poker test :
We form the elements in the sequence { X n } into groups of five consecutive elements and count the number of " poker hands " that we have .
These are :
All different : abcde
One pair : aabcd Two pairs : aabbc
Three of a kind : aaabc
Full house : aaabb
Four of a kind : aaaab
Five of a kind : aaaaa
We form the elements in the sequence { X } into groups of five consecutive elements and count the number of " poker hands " that we have .
These are : Birthday spacings test :
This test was introduced by George Marsaglia in 1984 .
Think of the terms of the sequence X n as birthdays and the numbers 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , m - 1 as days of the year .
We will study the spacing between the birthdays .
To do this , first order the terms in the sequence in nondecreasing order and find the spacings between the birthdays .
We let r i be the number of times i occurs as a spacing .
The spectral test
The tests we 've examined so far may be applied to any random number generator and work by examining sequences output by the generator .
The spectral test is specifically designed for linear congruential generators and works by studying the output of the generator over the entire period .
We first construct the set of all points ( x , f ( x ) ) where f is the function defining the generator .
For example , if m = 8505 , , and c = 64 , we have Notice that all the points lie on a finite family of equidistant parallel lines .
In fact , if you look carefully , you will notice that there are many such families of parallel lines containing all the points .
This is to be expected since the function f ( x ) is a linear function .
For each family of lines , we may consider the distance between the lines and define d to be the maximum of these distances over all the families of lines .
The accuracy of the linear congruential generator is defined to be 1/d .
The accuracy is greater for the generator on the left ( which also has a higher potency ) since the maximum distance between families of parallel lines is smaller than for the example on the right .
m = 8505 c = 64 m = 8505 c = 64
To get a feel for why the accuracy should reflect the quality of the random number generator , let 's look at the plot of one - twentieth of the points in a period .
Remember that all the points will lie on families of lines .
When the accuracy is large , the families of lines are all tightly packed together .
When one family of lines is relatively far apart , there is less flexibility for where the points will appear , which makes the sequence appear less random .
The spectral test may be applied in other dimensions as well .
For instance , in dimension three , we form the collection of points {(x , f ( x ) , f ( f ( x ) ) } and notice that these points lie on families of planes .
The accuracy is then the reciprocal of the maximum distance between the planes .
There is an efficient algorithm for computing the accuracy in low dimensions .
Indeed , the spectral test is the best available for linear congruential generators : all generators that are known to be good pass the spectral test while all generators known to be bad fail it .
Conclusions
As we 've seen , it can be hard to generate a sequence of random numbers and hard to determine exactly how random the sequence is .
It is also surprising that one of the most popular means for generating random numbers is given by such a simple linear function .
In 1997 , Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura found a new random number generator , which they named the Mersenne Twister , with the phenomenally large period 219937 - 1 .
Though it is not safe to use in cryptographical applications , it generates random numbers very efficiently and is now in wide use .

Women in Saudi Arabia are using Facebook and other networking sites to chat to men
A woman was beaten up and shot dead by her father for talking online with a man she met on the website Facebook .
The case was reported on a Saudi Arabian news site as an example of the " strife " the social networking site is causing in the Islamic nation .
It said the man shot his daugther after discovering she had been chatting online to a young man she had met on Facebook .
“ Security sources assured Al - Arabiya .
net that the father beat up his daughter and then shot her dead , ” it said .
A leading Saudi preacher told Al - Arabiya.net that Facebook was a " door to lust " for women and called for it to be blocked to prevent social " strife " .
Sheikh Ali al - Maliki said women were posting " revealing pictures " and " behaving badly " on the site , which has become popular with young Saudis .
Internet engineers said that young Saudis were using Facebook to flirt and make " web-cam calls " .
Saudi Arabia imposes an austere form of Sunni Islam which prevents unrelated men and women from mixing , bans women from driving and demands that women wear a headscarf and cloak in public .

One female Saudi Facebook fan told The Mail that blocking the site would be pointless because people would simply switch to similar sites .
The 27 - year - old woman , who did not want to be named , admitted many young Saudis used Facebook to get in touch with members of the opposite sex .
“ In Saudi Arabia , we live more of a virtual life than a real life .
I know people who are involved in on - line romances with people they have never met in real life , ” the woman said .
“ And many of us use Facebook for other things , like talking about human rights and women 's rights .
" We can protest on Facebook about the jailing of a blogger which is something we could n't do on the streets . "
Engineers also told Al - Arabiya.net that there were Facebook pages for homosexual and lesbian relations .
Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and is punished by flogging , jail or even death .
The Saudi authorities block access to websites they deem sexual , pornographic , politically offensive , " un - Islamic " or disruptive because of controversial religious and political content .
But Syria is the only Arab country so far to have blocked Facebook .
When the ban was enforced in December , Syrian media said it was to prevent Israeli users from infiltrating Syrian social networks .
Yesterday 's hearing into Comcast 's traffic - shaping practices at Harvard Law School attracted a huge crowd , one so large that people who arrived over an hour before it started were turned away .
It was a packed house for a good show , one that featured Comcast and net neutrality proponents making their case in front of the five commissioners of the FCC .
A day after , allegations have surfaced that Comcast paid people to show up and sit in the meeting room in order to keep people from expressing their feelings about Comcast 's actions to the FCC .
Save The Internet is accusing Comcast of busing in a crowd of supports to pack the room .
" These seat - warmers were paid to fill the room , a move that kept others from taking part , " according to a posting on the Save The Internet blog .
" They arrived en masse some 90 minutes before the hearing began and occupied almost every available seat , upon which many promptly fell asleep . "
Over 100 people were turned away from the meeting by campus police once the room reached capacity .
" First , Comcast was caught blocking the Internet .
Now it has been caught blocking the public from the debate , " said Save The Internet campaign director Timothy Karr in a statement .
" The only people cheering Comcast are those paid to do so . "
Save The Internet snapped this picture
of attentive audience members
Comcast denies packing the room .
" We did pay some individuals to stand in line and hold seats for Comcast employees , " Comcast spokesperson Charlie Douglas told Ars .
" It 's a common practice in Washington , DC . "
Douglas said that it was no more than a couple of dozen people that were paid to stand in line , and that everyone interested in attending the event had ample opportunity .
" To be fair , everybody knew when [ the meeting ] was and where it was , " Douglas noted .
" Everybody had plenty of time to generate interest in getting people to attend , including Free Press . "
Why would Comcast want a room full of employees at the FCC hearing ?
" Obviously , this has big implications for a lot of Comcast employees , " Douglas answered .
" They have a lot invested in this and they have every right to be able to attend as well .
" Everybody had equal time and it's all up on the web .
Everybody can read the transcripts and listen to the audio and comment on what was covered . "

The detections were made at the Keck Observatory
They have pictures of what appear to be very faint galaxies that shone more than 13 billion years ago , a mere 500 million years after the Big Bang .
The remarkable claim dramatically exceeds the current , broadly accepted record for the most distant detection .
The Caltech - led team behind the work recognises there will be sceptics but says it believes its data is strong .
It has published details in The Astrophysical Journal ; and the group leader , Professor Richard Ellis , has been arguing the case at a conference in London , UK .
" We 've had these galaxies for over a year and we have gone back to the telescope and revisited them , to prove their signals are robust , " he explained .
" We feel confident now that we have done all that is humanly possibly to show the community that these galaxies are at these great distances , " Professor Ellis told BBC News .
Big zoom
The international team of astronomers found its six " candidate " galaxies using one of the 10 m
Keck telescope twins sited on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
The researchers employed a technique known as gravitational lensing to achieve the detections .
This makes use of the gravity of relatively nearby objects ( in this case galaxy clusters ) to magnify the light coming from much more distant objects ( the six candidates ) .
The team had a clear idea of where to look
More details
The team then further refined its search by only looking for a very narrow wavelength of light where its target galaxies - if they existed - would be expected to shine .
It has taken three years ' painstaking work to make and check the observations .
" Using Keck II , we have detected six faint star - forming galaxies whose signal has been boosted about 20 times by the magnifying effect of a foreground cluster , " said Caltech co-worker Dan Stark .
" That we should find so many distant galaxies in our small survey area suggests they are very numerous indeed . "
It 's a crowd
This is perhaps the most significant implication of the study .
Astronomy is now engaged in a major drive to tie down the timings of key events in the early Universe .
Scientists would like to see extensive evidence for the very first populations of stars .
These hot , blue giants would have grown out of the cold neutral gas that pervaded the young cosmos .
The IOK - 1 : The most distant galaxy yet found ... until now ?
Peering at a distant epoch
They would also have " fried " the neutral gas around them to produce the diffuse intergalactic plasma we detect between nearby stars today .
But this theory demands the earliest star - forming phase in the Universe was a busy one - and the significance of the latest study is that it suggests the numbers of stars required did indeed exist .
" The area of sky we surveyed was so small that for us to find anything at all suggests to us these objects must be very numerous , " Professor Ellis told the BBC News website .
" Obviously it 's a bit of a stretch to estimate a population from just six objects - but if you went out into a London street , looked at one piece of pavement and found six people standing there , I think you could reasonably conclude London was a crowded place . "
Redshift hunters
It has been known for a while that the Caltech - led group had some very interesting pictures .
In the past 12 months , knowledge of their existence has been shared at scientific conferences and hinted at by popular publications such as Time Magazine and the BBC News website .
But Ellis and colleagues have deliberately held back from formal publication of their work .
Theirs is a field which has burned the reputations of others who have rushed forward with announcements that could not be confirmed by subsequent , independent observation .
Even so , to get an idea of how big a leap in detection is now being claimed can be illustrated by the " ruler " astronomers use to describe far - off sightings .
They will often be heard referring to " redshift " .
It is a measure of the degree to which light has been " stretched " by the expansion of the Universe .
The greater the redshift , the more distant the object and the earlier it is being seen in cosmic history .
The current , widely accepted distance record - holder is the IOK - 1 galaxy detection announced last year which had a redshift of 6.96 .
Its light was being seen when the Universe was little more than 700 million years old ( Current estimates have the Universe coming into existence about 13.66 billion years ago as a " hot soup " of elementary particles ) .
Getting to this mark was a process of steady , incremental steps through redshifts in the lower - sixes and fives .
The Caltech - led group has now suddenly jumped into the redshift region of eight to 10 .
Dr Andy Bunker is a high - redshift hunter with Exeter University , UK .
He has worked with the Ellis group in the past but was not involved in this study .
He commented : " Richard is a careful worker and he knows the burden of proof is very high .
" His group is aware of the history of the field and that 's why they are being a little bit cagey ; but I think this is a significant paper and unlike many that have gone before , I believe this will stand the test of time and at least some of the six candidates will be confirmed by others in due course . "
The Caltech - led group hopes soon to get some confirmation of its own by looking at a different wavelength of light using the Spitzer Space Telescope and through the use of a new spectrograph instrument which is being installed at the Keck .
A refurbished Hubble Space Telescope is expected to be able to reach up to redshift 10 ; and its successor , the James Webb Space Telescope , due for launch early in the next decade , should be capable of redshift 15 observations .
Richard Ellis , the Steele Professor of Astronomy at Caltech , Pasadena , US , delivered a talk at the From IRAS to Herschel and Planck Conference .
The meeting was organised to celebrate the 65th birthday of Royal Astronomical Society President Professor Michael Rowan - Robinson .
Even the powerful Keck struggles to see the greatest distances
It uses a trick - a gravitational zoom lens to magnify far - off objects
The candidate galaxies are among the first to form in the Universe
Their stars would have helped end a period dubbed the ' Dark Ages '
In this cold phase the Universe was filled with neutral gas atoms
The stars of the ' Cosmic Renaissance ' changed their environment
These giants ' nuclear cores synthesised the first heavy elements
Their intense ultraviolet light also ' fried ' the neutral gas atoms
The resulting plasma - free electrons and protons - is evident today

Buffett points out that the Dow 's annual compounded gain was 5.3 percent in the 20th century .. and it was a " wonderful " century .
To match that rate in the 21st century , the Dow would need to close around 2,000,000 at the end of 2099 .
( 1,988,000 Dow points to go , eight years in . )
Anyone expecting a 10 percent annual gains from stocks this century are " implicitly forecasting a level of about 24,000,000 on the Dow by 2100 . "
( Buffett suggests you explain the math to any adviser who talks to you about double - digit gains , " not that it will faze him . " )
He warns , " Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while he fills his pockets with fees . "
That does n't mean you should n't put money into stocks .
I think it means you should n't pay someone to manage your stock investments , just because that person says he or she can get you fantastic returns that beat the overall market .
In the past , Buffett has recommended stock index mutual funds for many ' regular ' investors .
The discussion gives context to the question Buffett asked us to ask youabout where the Dow will be in 2099 .
He 'll be talking more about that Monday morning when he joins Becky Quick live in Omaha on CNBC 's Squawk Box starting at 6 am ET .
I 'll also provide " live blog " coverage of the whole thing here on Warren Buffett Watch .
Buffett and Becky will chat several times during Squawk 's three hours .
For the first time ever , Buffett will be answering some of your questions , submitted to us by email .
( Thank you to everyone who has already sent in questions or will be doing so .
We 're only sorry Buffett wo n't be able to answer them all ! )

Case studies are interesting but do not resolve the question .
Thomas Frank described how Kansas is full of socially conservative Republicans at all income levels .
But then there is south Texas , whose low - income Latinos are socially conservative on many issues but vote for Democrats .
Manhattan ’s upper west side remains strongly Democratic despite its steadily increasing income level , but the suburbs of Dallas are full of high - income conservative Republicans .
There are many ways of looking at social class , attitudes , and voting .
We ’ll take a demographic approach and compare religious to secular voters .
Regular churchgoers are about 15 % more likely than non-attendees to vote Republican .
Perhaps surprisingly , this big religion gap did not show up until 1992 , when Bill Clinton ran against George H. W. Bush , as we show in Figure 1 .
Back in 1980 , Jerry Falwell ’s Moral Majority and other Religious Right organizations played a prominent role in rallying support for Ronald Reagan and other Republican candidates .
But the gap between religious and non-religious in voting was actually less for Ronald Reagan — in both 1980 and 1984 — than for Gerald Ford in 1976 .
As Glaeser and Ward ( 2006 ) point out , the recent political divisions associated with religious belief coincide with the geographic pattern of richer states supporting the Democrats and poorer states going Republican .
Figure 1 . Difference in probability of voting for the Republican candidate for president , comparing people who went to church at least once per week to nonattenders .
Nothing much was happening until 1992 , when all of a sudden George H. W. Bush received 20 % more of the vote among religious than among the nonreligious .
So religion matters .
For whom does it matter ?
Does it matter for the frustrated masses , seduced by emotional issues , or for the less economically - pressed elites ?
We can answer the question by measuring the religious / secular gap among voters at different income levels .
Figure 2 . Support for George W. Bush , as a function of income , plotted separately for frequent church attenders , moderate attenders , and non-attenders .
The difference between rich and poor is large for religious people but disappears among the non-religious .
The difference in Republican support , comparing regular religious attendees to non-attendees , is huge for rich voters but low among the poor ; see Figure 2 .
This result — that church attendance predicts voting more for the rich than the poor — is consistent with the finding of Ansolabehere , Rodden , and Snyder ( 2007 ) that “ low - income Americans are significantly less inclined to vote based on moral values than are high - income groups . ”
They find the impact of economic issues on voting is larger for regular churchgoers , residents of Republican - leaning states , and rural voters than for non-churchgoers , residents of Democratic states , and urban or suburban voters .
To connect to Figure 2 : the line for regular churchgoers is steep , while the line for non-attenders is flat .
Thus , income predicts how you vote — if you are religious .
We had earlier found that income predicted voting more in poor states than in rich states ( Gelman , Shor , Bafumi , and Park , 2007 ) .
This again fits the story of post - materialism , that economic concerns are more important in poorer areas , with social and religious issues mattering more among the rich .
The United States is far from unique in having religion as a political division .
Religious and secular voters differ no more in America than in France , Germany , Sweden , and many other European countries , consistent with the post - materialist notion that people in richer countries have the luxury of voting on social issues .
Figure 3 tells the story .
Huber and Stanig ( 2007 ) and Huber ( 2007 ) noted that , within each country , the differences between rich and poor voting tend to be larger among religious voters ; however , the differences between rich and poor — both in their voting patterns and in the size of the religion gap — are larger here than in most other countries , a finding also consistent with post - materialism .
Incomes are more unequal in the United States than in other rich countries today , and so it makes sense that rich and poor vote more differently .
And , indeed , the Democratic and Republican parties are farther apart on issues of economic redistribution than are left and right parties in most European countries .
Religious Americans are more Republican than secular Americans , but the difference between them is mostly among the middle class and rich — the “ post - materialist ” values voters .
The evidence does not support the idea that lower - income Americans are voting based on “ God , guns , and gays . ”
Figure 3 .
For each of thirty countries ( ordered by per-capita GDP ) , estimated vote for conservative parties by income and religious attendance .
In each plot , the solid , light , and dotted lines show the estimates for frequent religious attenders , occasional attenders , and nonattenders .
With only a few exceptions , churchgoers and higher - income people are much more likely to vote for conservative parties .
The curve show logistic regression fits , which can be misleading because the actual pattern is not always smooth ; for example , in some countries , middle - income people vote more conservatively than the rich or the poor .
The purpose of this figure is to quickly show overall patterns of richer or more religious people voting conservatively in different countries .

Blocking your kids ' access to TV and the computer could help them shed weight , an experiment with 70 overweight children showed .
The results of the study , published in the current issue of Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine , involved children aged 4 to 7 years whose body mass index ( BMI ) was at the 75th percentile or higher for their age and gender .
All of them regularly watched television or played computer games for at least 14 hours a week at home .
That does n't even sound like a lot compared with some of the habits ...

The European Commission 's reform of VAT on internet - delivered services such as software , ringtones and music has been adopted and will take effect from 2015 .
Europe 's finance ministers yesterday agreed the proposed measures , which means that they become EU legislation , shortly to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union .
The proposal was hammered out in a political agreement on the issue last December .
VAT on " telecommunications , broadcasting and electronic services supplied to consumers " will now be charged at the rate in the country of the customer , not of the supplier , as is now the case .
The fact that the VAT rate of the supplier applied to online transactions led to firms such as Amazon , Skype and Paypal , relocating to Luxembourg , which has Europe 's lowest VAT rate .
Luxembourg had long objected to the changes because it said it would lose tax revenue .
All the other changes announced will take effect from 2010 , but the changes to consumer online services will only come into force in a staged process from 2015 in what is being widely seen as a concession to Luxembourg .
For business to consumer services outside of the definition of " telecommunications , broadcasting and electronic services " , the VAT rate charged will be that of the supplier 's country .
EU Commissioner for taxation and customs László Kovács said the new rules would eradicate inequalities in a system where the competition for business locations was skewed .
" This is particularly true of services which can be supplied at a distance where , as a result of current rules , businesses have been locating in countries with lower VAT rates .
As a result , Member States have seen their revenues eroded , " he said .
Luxembourg has claimed that it will lose € 200 m a year in revenues generated by its 15 per cent VAT rate , the lowest in Europe .
Sweden 's 25 per cent is the highest rate .
Under the compromise deal the entire VAT generated by a transaction will not be sent to the customer 's country until 2019 .
The new laws will also create a system that will automatically transfer VAT between countries to settle the debts created by the new agreement .
This will replace a paper based system and will allow companies to claim back VAT from countries where they are not even registered for the tax .
" I am particularly proud of the new procedure to allow businesses to electronically claim VAT refunds from other Member States in which they are not registered but have paid VAT , " said Kovács . "
This change from a paper - based to an electronic system means that refunds for businesses will be faster and easier . ”

China is heavily reliant on its exports
China 's industrial output weakened in January and February as firms were hit by lower exports , official data shows .
The measure of factory production grew by 15.4 % in the two month period , down from 18.5 % in the same period of 2007 .
Chinese firms are having to deal with higher raw material costs after crude oil prices climbed to record levels .
They have also been hit by a stronger yuan , weakening US demand , and poor weather at the start of the year , which hampered transport and distribution .
" Exporters are facing big problems and they are unable to make profit , " said Andy Xie , an independent economist based in Shanghai .
Recent figures showed that Chinese exports increased by 16.8 % in the eight weeks to the end of February , less than half the growth rate of 41.5 % in the same period a year earlier .
As well as the external problems facing Chinese producers , the government also is taking steps to slow output in an attempt to stop the booming economy from overheating .
China 's continuing economic expansion has pushed up the rate of inflation , and prompted higher interest rates .
" With heightened inflation risks , we expect that further tightening measures by the government coupled with a gradual softening in exports will likely lead to downward pressure on industrial production , " Goldman Sachs said .
Dr. Haidt developed a better sense of the elephant after visiting India at the suggestion of an anthropologist , Richard Shweder .
In Bhubaneswar , in the Indian state of Orissa , Dr. Haidt saw that people recognized a much wider moral domain than the issues of harm and justice that are central to Western morality .
Indians were concerned with integrating the community through rituals and committed to concepts of religious purity as a way to restrain behavior .
On his return from India , Dr. Haidt combed the literature of anthropology and psychology for ideas about morality throughout the world .
He identified five components of morality that were common to most cultures .
Some concerned the protection of individuals , others the ties that bind a group together .
Of the moral systems that protect individuals , one is concerned with preventing harm to the person and the other with reciprocity and fairness .
Less familiar are the three systems that promote behaviors developed for strengthening the group .
These are loyalty to the in - group , respect for authority and hierarchy , and a sense of purity or sanctity .
The five moral systems , in Dr. Haidt ’s view , are innate psychological mechanisms that predispose children to absorb certain virtues .
Because these virtues are learned , morality may vary widely from culture to culture , while maintaining its central role of restraining selfishness .
In Western societies , the focus is on protecting individuals by insisting that everyone be treated fairly .
Creativity is high , but society is less orderly .
In many other societies , selfishness is suppressed “ through practices , rituals and stories that help a person play a cooperative role in a larger social entity , ” Dr. Haidt said .
He is aware that many people — including “ the politically homogeneous discipline of psychology ” — equate morality with justice , rights and the welfare of the individual , and dismiss everything else as mere social convention .
But many societies around the world do in fact behave as if loyalty , respect for authority and sanctity are moral concepts , Dr. Haidt notes , and this justifies taking a wider view of the moral domain .
The idea that morality and sacredness are intertwined , he said , may now be out of fashion but has a venerable pedigree , tracing back to Emile Durkheim , a founder of sociology .
Dr. Haidt believes that religion has played an important role in human evolution by strengthening and extending the cohesion provided by the moral systems .
“ If we did n’t have religious minds we would not have stepped through the transition to groupishness , ” he said .
“ We ’d still be just small bands roving around . ”
THE key to maintaining economic stability is well - placed confidence in the markets .
Bubbles , by contrast , result from misplaced confidence .
We are living in a post - bubble world , following the stock market bubble of the 1990s and the real estate bubble of the 2000s .
That is the backdrop for the current crisis .
We need to restore confidence in the markets ’ basic ability to function , not in their presumed tendency to make us all rich by always going up .
Some short - term remedies are under way .
President Bush has said that fiscal policy is urgently needed to address the current situation and has reached tentative agreement with Congress on a temporary tax cut of $ 150 billion .
This might increase the official federal deficit from about 1 percent of gross domestic product to something like 2 percent , about where it was a couple of years ago .
And on Tuesday , the Federal Reserve under its chairman , Ben S. Bernanke , made an emergency between - meetings cut of three - quarters of a percentage point in the federal funds rate .
The move brought that benchmark rate down to its level midway into the 2001 recession , and the Fed has signaled that it stands ready to make further cuts .
While a temporary tax cut and interest rate cuts are good ideas , they do n’t address the underlying crisis of confidence .
If these measures succeed merely in making people consume more , running to the malls and making the already - negative personal saving rate even more negative , they wo n’t restore faith in the financial markets .

BAGHDAD ( AP )  Iraq 's presidency endorsed the execution within 30 days of Saddam Hussein 's cousin , known as " Chemical Ali , " who was sentenced to death for his role in the 1980s scorched - earth campaign against Kurds , officials said Friday .
The approval by Iraq 's President Jalal Talabani and two vice presidents was the final step clearing the way for Ali Hassan al - Majid 's execution by hanging .
It could now be carried out at any time , a government adviser and a prosecutor said .
Al - Majid was one of three former Saddam officials sentenced to death in June after being convicted by an Iraqi court of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for their part in the Operation Anfal crackdown that killed nearly 200,000 Kurdish civilians and guerrillas .
The officials said the three - member presidential council agreed to al - Majid 's execution , but did not approve the death sentences against the other two — Hussein Rashid Mohammed , an ex-deputy director of operations for the Iraqi armed forces , and former defense minister Sultan Hashim al - Taie .
The men's fate had been in legal limbo since this summer and the decision could represent a compromise to ease Sunni objections to executing al - Taie , widely viewed as a respected career soldier who was forced to follow Saddam 's orders in the purges against Kurds .
Al - Majid would be the fifth former regime official hanged for alleged atrocities against Iraqis during Saddam 's nearly three - decades rule .
Saddam , who also had been a defendant in the so - called Anfal trial , was hanged Dec. 30 , 2006 , for ordering the killings of more than 140 Shiite Muslims from the Iraqi city of Dujail following a 1982 assassination attempt against him .
A government adviser , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to release the information , said Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and U.S. officials had been informed of the decision by phone and a meeting was planned to decide when and where the execution should take place .
A senior U.S. military official said the military was aware the order had been signed , and that the date for the execution would be determined by the Iraqi government .
The other two men remain in U.S. custody but are under the jurisdiction of the Iraqi government , the official said , declining to be identified ahead of an official announcement .
Prosecutor Jaafar al - Moussawi , who said he had received word of the decision from the presidential council , said there was a legal basis for the execution of " Chemical Ali " but not of the other two .
He said no law existed that could force the presidential council to endorse the execution of all three , so it had the prerogative to just sign off on one of the orders .
An appeals court upheld the verdicts against the three in September .
Under Iraqi law the executions were to have taken place within a month .
But they were put on hold after Sunni leaders including Vice President Tariq al - Hashemi launched a campaign to spare the life of al - Taie .
President Jalal Talabani , himself a Kurd , had also refused to sign the order against al - Taie , a Sunni Arab from the northern city of Mosul who signed the cease - fire with U.S. - led forces that ended the 1991 Gulf War .
Al - Taie surrendered to U.S. forces in September 2003 after weeks of negotiations .
His defense has claimed the Americans had promised al - Tai " protection and good treatment " before he turned himself in .
Many Sunni Arabs saw his sentence as evidence that Shiite and Kurdish officials are persecuting their once - dominant minority and as a sign of Shiite influence over the judiciary , raising concerns the executions could ignite retaliatory sectarian attacks .
The case also strained relations between al - Maliki's Shiite - led government and U.S. officials .
In late November , the Shiite prime minister asked U.S. President George W. Bush to hand over " Chemical Ali " and the other two former regime officials .
The officials said al - Hashemi had refused to agree to the executions of the other two because he considered them career soldiers following orders .
There have been little calls for leniency , however , regarding al - Majid , nicknamed " Chemical Ali " for ordering poison gas attacks that killed thousands .
Besides Saddam , his half brother and former intelligence chief Barzan Ibrahim , and Awad Hamed al - Bandar , former head of Iraq 's Revolutionary Court — were hanged in January 2007 , prompting criticism from human rights groups .
Saddam 's former vice president , Taha Yassin Ramadan , had been sentenced to life in prison for his role in Dujail but was executed in March after the court decided this was too lenient .
Three other defendants were sentenced to 15 years in jail in the Dujail case , while one was acquitted .

How Roman Numerals Work
This page explains how Roman numerals work .
This is the convention I was taught in school .
The Romans ( and subsequent users ) were n't nearly as strict about how to write numbers in their day , but this is the way you will see Roman numerals written in almost all cases today .
The Letters
First , here is the value of each letter :
I = 1 ( one ) V = 5 ( five ) X = 10 ( ten ) L = 50 ( fifty ) C = 100 ( one hundred ) D = 500 ( five hundred ) M = 1000 ( one thousand )
Note that there was no number smaller than one .
The concept of zero and negative numbers did not exist .
There are actually values over 1000 ( M ) .
Putting a bar over the appropriate letter indicates it should be multiplied by 1000 .
So , for example , " V " with a bar over it would be 5000 .
This gives letters up to M- bar or 1,000,000 ( one million ) .
Unfortunately , barred letters are hard to write in HTML , so we 'll stick with non-barred letters .
( By the way , " I " was never barred since I - bar equals " M. " )
The Rules
The letters should be arranged from the one with the largest value to the one with the smallest .
Each letter 's value is added to the previous ones .
Only powers of ten ( I , X , C , M ) can be repeated .
Do not repeat any letter more than three times in a row .
Because of the preceding rule , certain numbers must be written using subtraction .
In this case , a letter with a smaller value precedes one with a larger value and the value of the smaller is subtracted from the larger .
The result is then added to the rest of the letters .
The following rules apply to subtraction :
Only powers of ten ( I , X , C , M ) can be subtracted .
The smaller letter must be 1/5th ( one - fifth ) or 1/10th ( one - tenth ) the larger one .
The smaller letter must be either the first letter or preceded by a letter at least ten times greater than it .
If another letter follows the larger one , it must be smaller than the number preceding the larger one .
Examples for Each Rule
1510 is written MDX , not XDM or DXM or other combinations .
100 is not written LL ( not a power of ten ) or XXXXXXXXXX ( too many repeated Xs ) .
CCXLIII = 100 + 100 + ( 50 - 10 ) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 243 .
800 is n't CCM because you can only subtract one letter from another , not two .
45 is n't VL because V ( 5 ) is n't a power of ten .
99 is n't IC because I ( 1 ) is 1/100th of C ( 100 ) , not 1/10th .
49 is n't IL because I ( 1 ) is 1/50th of L ( 50 ) , not 1/5th .
1400 is n't DCM because D ( 500 ) is less than 1000 ( 10 * 100 ( C ) ) .
140 is n't XCL because L ( 50 ) is n't smaller than X ( 10 ) .
100 is n't XCX because X ( 10 ) is n't smaller than itself .
In Plain English
Think of each combination of letters of equal powers of ten as one digit .
For example , in CCCLXII ( 362 ) , CCC ( 300 ) is the hundreds , LX ( 60 ) is the tens , and II ( 2 ) is the ones .
Subtraction only takes place for four and nine times a power of ten ( i.e. 4 , 40 , 400 , 9 , 90 , 900 ) .
This is to avoid more than three of the same letter in a row .
It is written by putting a smaller value in front of a larger one .
So 4 is IV , not IIII .
And 900 is CM , not DCCCC .
This complicates the first statement of this section some because there might be a higher power of ten in a lower power of tens section .
For example , in MCMIX ( 1909 ) , M ( 1000 ) is the thousands , CM ( 1000 - 100 = 900 ) is the hundreds , and IX ( 10 - 1 = 9 ) is the ones .
To put it most concisely :
When converting to Roman numerals , convert each digit separately .
For example , for 953 convert 900 , 50 , and 3 to give CM , L , and III to get CMLIII .

Possibly , there are even more naked women at Maureen Dowd ’s house today than there were when this place was JFK ’s Georgetown bachelor pad in the fifties .
They are lounging in the vintage posters , carved into her Deco furniture , painted in huge trompe l’oeil pastorals on the living - room wall .
“ My girlfriend Michi said , ‘ You ’ve got to paint clothes on them , ’ like you know how they did at the Sistine Chapel ? ” says Dowd , who is drinking white wine from a goblet with a naked woman carved into its stem .
“ But I like them .
I think they ’re kind of campy . ”
Michi is Michiko Kakutani , one of Dowd ’s circle of extremely close female friends at the New York Times , where Dowd is , of course , the only female op - ed columnist .
It ’s a post she says she is “ not temperamentally suited to , ” despite the fact she ’s been doing it for ten years and has won a Pulitzer and a passionate army of fans in the process , because Dowd does n’t like “ a lot of angst in my life , ” and it is specifically her job to provoke .
Her natural inclination — her fundamental drive — is , rather , to seduce .
But then those two things are not entirely unrelated .
It is n’t easy being the lone female on “ murderers ’ row , ” as the columnists ’ offices in the Washington bureau are called .
( And Dowd ’s office just happens to be next door to her ex-boyfriend John Tierney ’s .
“ It ’s like , ‘ Out of all the gin joints in all the world … ’ It is weird , ” she says .
“ We share a bathroom , which I guess could have ended up happening if we ’d gotten married . ” )
Dowd says she does n’t mind that W. has nicknamed her “ The Cobra , ” and she probably kind of likes being called “ the flame - haired flamethrower , ” but she hates all monikers that involve knives or other sharp objects .
“ I have a fear of castration , ” she explains , perching herself with catlike precision on the striped settee in her lacquer - red sitting room .
“ Not fear of being castrated but fear of castrating . ”
This from a woman who once referred to Al Gore as “ practically lactating . ”
Dowd is wearing a low - backed black sweater , black pants , and green cowboy boots .
“ I ’m into clothes , but in a way that ’s related to wanting to walk into a film noir movie , ” she says .
“ You know , I love to go to vintage stores , but mostly it ’s stuff that I do n’t have anywhere to wear … I do n’t have the life that goes with the clothes .
Alessandra ” — Stanley , the Times ’ television critic and another of Dowd ’s best friends — “ says my wardrobe is very Siegfried and Roy . ”
It ’s good that Dowd is dressed in a neutral color today , because otherwise she would clash with the room around her .
Her red hair is backlit by her collection of motion lamps — glowing squares and spheres that bubble with swimming fish and parrots and floating music notes .
The red walls are lined with shelves exploding with books , old record jackets ( Nancy Sinatra , Peggy Lee ) , family photos , various feathered ornaments and fans , a collection of tigers , another of mermaids , and a dozen or so antique martini shakers .
A poster that the Times ’ managing editor Jill Abramson gave her pictures a glamorous woman surrounded by a rapt circle of men above the words KEEP MUM .
SHE ’S NOT SO DUMB !
CARELESS TALK COSTS LIVES .
“ I have terrible taste , ” says Dowd .
“ Ask any of my friends . ” Aaron Sorkin — whom
Dowd will describe to me variously as a “ genius , ” a “ really close friend , ” and a “ guy I used to date ” — calls her house a cross between the New York Public Library and the House of the Rising Sun .
Brains versus sex .
The serious and the superficial .
The battle of the sexes .
This has long been the terrain of Dowd ’s journalism , and it ’s the explicit focus of her new book , Are Men Necessary ? , 338 pages of ruminations and witticisms on matters ranging from the Anita Hill–Clarence Thomas hearings to the vestigiality of male nipples .
Though Dowd ’s importance as an antagonist of the White House has never been greater , the book throws open the door to her critics ’ favorite complaint : frivolousness .
“ When I started as a White House correspondent , ” the second female in the position in the Times ’ history , “ there was a lot of criticism from guys saying , ‘ She focuses too much on the person but not enough on policy . ’
I never understood that argument at all .
I just did n’t agree with the premise , ” says Dowd .
“ Even Scotty Reston , ” the storied Washington correspondent who joined the Times the day World War II began and decidedly did not groove on women in the workplace , “ said that after the president got the bomb , you had to sort of focus on his judgment and who he was as a person , because that ’s all you had .
All the great traumatizing events of American history — Watergate , Vietnam , the Iran / contra stuff — have always been about the president ’s personal demons and gremlins .
So I always thought that criticism was just silly … as if it was a girlish thing to be focused on the person . ”

Dowd ’s femininity is dramatized by the relentless maleness of the worlds she inhabits .
She appears that much more redheaded surrounded by the blue - suited stoniness of Washington , the arid fustiness of the New York Times .
When Dowd started out as a political correspondent , she had a term for women in her position : color girls .
“ I always liked the sort of funnier , weirder thing to write about as opposed to the official thing that would be officially more prestigious but , to me , not as interesting , ” Dowd says .
“ So I liked being a color girl .
You can deliver something unique . ”
The light in which she ’s bathed herself is low and gray but flattering .
In Are Men Necessary ? , we are taken along on a chummy sororal romp with the women who just happen to make up the female voice of what is arguably the most influential newspaper in the country — to the Crème de la Mer counter at Saks , for example , with Dowd and “ my girlfriend Alessandra . ”
Another friend “ called nearly in tears the day she won a Pulitzer : ‘ Now , ’ she moaned , ‘ I ’ll never get a date ! ’ ” ( Kakutani won a Pulitzer in 1998 . )
“ We ’re just ordinary friends , ” Dowd says , “ like you ’re friends with your girlfriends , except now it ’s kind of weird because we ’re a lot of critics . ”
And in her book , Dowd asserts , “ If there ’s one thing men fear , it ’s a woman who uses her critical faculties . ”
But Dowd is more than the sum of her critical faculties ; she ’s an utter and unreconstructed fox .
Something that nearly every person I spoke to about her mentioned , unprompted , is that men ca n’t resist her .
I tell her this , and she pauses long enough to give her rejoinder a forties - movie - star snap : “ Where are they ? ”
If Judith Miller represents the bad witch of the New York Times in the public imagination — self - important , suffering , wrong — then Maureen Dowd is Glenda : Technicolor , spreading mirth among the munchkins , floating around in a protective pink bubble .
Obviously , Miller — “ Miss Run Amok , ” as she ’s called herself , according to the Times — was allowed to run rampant over the rules .
But the Dowd crowd enjoys its own particular brand of latitude at the paper .
When Geraldo Rivera demanded a correction after Stanley asserted that he had “ nudged ” a rescue worker aside to make room for his camera crew after Hurricane Katrina , for instance , the Times ran an “ Editors ’ Note ” defending her “ figurative reference ” only after public editor Byron Calame wrote a whole column in Rivera ’s defense .
Dowd , Kakutani , and Stanley are the cool girls of the New York Times — think Heathers , but nice .
Whereas Miller famously elbows away the competition , Dowd employs a different tactic .
“ She ’s the opposite of the woman who pulls the ladder up behind her , ” says Dowd ’s good friend Leon Wieseltier , in an observation that was echoed by colleague after colleague .
“ She keeps pushing it lower . ”
Still , a common newsroom perception is that Dowd ’s clique gets special treatment because its members use their charm instrumentally — an occupational hazard for successful women that runs roughly proportional to their level of physical attractiveness .
And then there is their extremely close proximity to Jill Abramson .
“ When I became managing editor , I gave a short speech :
My mother told me when I was going off to summer camp , ‘ You just need one friend and you ’ll be okay , ” says Abramson .
“ At work , Maureen is that one friend . ”
Abramson , responsible for managing the paper ’s Judith Miller coverage , is also , of course , at the center of it .
“ I ’m so sorry it ’s taken me so long , ” she said when she returned my call .
“ I ’ve just been buried under all this Judy Miller crap . ”
Shortly thereafter , Dowd herself floated down and took center stage , with a remarkable Saturday column titled “ Woman of Mass Destruction . ”
The piece began with the words “ I ’ve always liked Judy Miller ” — a statement that seemed laughably implausible when , a few paragraphs later , Dowd described being bumped from her seat at a White House briefing by the shamelessly aggressive Miller .
Dowd came off smelling suspiciously roselike : “ I could only laugh . ”
The column ended by , for all intents and purposes , calling for Miller ’s dismissal .
It was a classic Heathers move , a savage put - down delivered with comic panache .
Dowd voiced what many at the Times felt — the piece cut surgically through the murky facts and mea culpas and got to the core issue .
Still , some thought she ’d crossed a line by going after a colleague , no matter how reviled that colleague had become , and saw the column as grandstanding .
Dowd thought hard before writing the column , delaying it from Wednesday to Saturday .
“ As a woman , I know that if I write about another woman , it will be perceived as a catfight , ” she says .
She also worried that she would seem to be carrying others ’ water .
Dowd says she never talked to editorial - page editor Gail Collins or publisher Arthur Sulzberger .
Jill Abramson , Dowd says , advised her not to write it , fearing that it would be seen as piling on .

But after Miller wrote her own account of the Plame situation , Dowd went ahead .
“ I realized I had to , because for the last five years , I ’ve written a lot about WMD and the scamming and hype by the administration , and in a way , Judy was a phantom player in this .
” In response to the column , Miller e-mailed a seven - point rebuttal , beginning with the words , “ I like you , too . ”
Both on the page and in person , Dowd does n’t let anyone forget she ’s a woman .
When she appeared on Letterman to promote her first book , Bushworld , in 2004 , she wore a little black dress with spaghetti straps , and with her red hair fluffed in an Old Hollywood wave , Dowd had a certain Jessica Rabbit ambience .
“ You look tremendous , and I guess you must be going somewhere after this because nobody gets this nicely dressed for me , ” Letterman told her .
“ I did , ” she breathed .
“ I ’ve been in love with you forever . ”
“ It ’s almost impossible not to be a little bit in love with Maureen , ” says Washington reporter Todd Purdum .
“ She ’s bewitching .
Maureen is … a sorceress . ”
Purdum thinks there ’s “ a practical part of Maureen that knows that .
She ’s a very different personality than Mary McGrory , ” the Washington Star columnist at whose parties Dowd and George Stephanopoulos used to serve drinks when they were in their twenties .
“ But she ’s not dissimilar in this way :
She bends a lot of people to her will with this amazing combo of smarts and charm .
I ’ve done things for Maureen like carried bags and fixing her computer in the middle of the night that I would n’t have done for anyone else . ”
Dowd acknowledges her debt to McGrory in Are Men Necessary ? : “ I tried to learn from her , ” she writes .
“ The way she acted helpless like a barracuda . ”
It is a testament to Dowd ’s seductiveness that even after the blistering Bushworld , the first President Bush still e-mails her to this day .
“ I went with Maureen to a party at this fancy townhouse for Bush Senior after he had published a book of his letters , ” remembers Abramson .
“ We got there , and his eyes lit up when he saw her come in .
He shooed the two of us into a little room ; he said , ‘ Bar will kill me if she sees you here ! ’
It ’s like an illicit friendship he has with her . ”
As eviscerating as Dowd can be on the page , in person she seldom fails to charm .
She bristles , though , at the suggestion that she ’s used her feminine wiles to get information .
“ I used to get furious about that , ” she says .
“ I thought that was such an insult , because I never thought I did .
Sally Quinn had that famous quote that if a senator was telling her something and he had his hand on her ass , she ’d just let it stay there until he told her .
That was not my school .
My school was I wanted to be charming but I did n’t want to flirt with a source .
Like I had a really good relationship with Marlin Fitzwater , Bush One ’s press secretary , and I think I would tease him sometimes …
There was a roast I had to do about him once , and I said he was catnip for women or something .
But I just felt that it would be unprofessional to flirt with him . ”
“ Well , yes , she was very flirtatious , ” says Fitzwater .
“ She was just an interesting person to be around on a personal basis . ”
“ I ’ve always had this great flirtatious relationship with her , so it ’s hard to get mad at her for any length of time , ” says former Clinton White House spokesman Mike McCurry .
“ I ’d call and yell at her , and I ’d always end up laughing and saying , ‘ Well , this is n’t gonna go anywhere . ’ ”
Dowd ’s technique is described by one former colleague as “ mischievous destabilization . ”
She once walked up to Newt Gingrich ’s spokesman , Tony Blankley , while he was in the middle of a speech and flipped his tie over to see the label .
“ But the flirtation word I would take exception with , because it implies something inappropriate , ” says Blankley .
I met Dowd for the first time when she attended a reading I was giving at a local bookstore .
I was standing at a lectern answering a question about the breakdown of the women ’s movement when something caught my eye — something red .
I tried to say something smart .
I tried to think of something funny .
I knew that the flame - haired flamethrower was in my midst .
When it was over , she came up , handed me my book to sign , and said her first words to me : “ Just make it out ‘ to my idol . ’ ”

Dowd concedes that when a female reporter is playful , “ that ’s probably indistinguishable to a guy from flirting . ”
She thinks about it for a minute .
“ But in my head , it is n’t flirting . ”
She laughs .
“ It ’s so funny because I would get so angry about a lot of this stuff over the years , like when people would — as they constantly do — put me in catfights with other women .
Like when Alessandra was hired , for instance , and Howell was the Washington bureau chief . ”
Howell Raines went on to become the executive editor of the Times and was pushed out two years ago in the wake of the Jayson Blair scandal .
“ He called me in and said , ‘ Now , I do n’t want you to be jealous that Alessandra is coming . ’
I just blew up and said , ‘ I happened to be the one who recommended her and she ’s my best friend and I ’m really offended ! ’
But it ’s hopeless .
Some guys are going to like to do that . ”
But was n’t it slightly more complicated than that ?
Was n’t Howell Raines , at one point , Dowd ’s boyfriend ?
“ He was my boss , ” she says very firmly .
Then she cracks up .
It is worth keeping in mind that less than 30 years ago , in April 1977 , when Dowd was still a metro reporter at the now - defunct Washington Star , the female staff members of the New York Times were at a turning point in a class - action suit against their employer for systematic discrimination against women in hiring practices and compensation .
According to Nan Robertson ’s book The Girls in the Balcony : Women , Men , and the New York Times , publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger ’s baffled response was , “ Why ca n’t a private company have men around if it wants to ? ”
That same year , Anna Quindlen was hired and went on to become the third woman ever to have a regular Times op - ed column .
In one famous column , Quindlen expressed disgust with the Times when the paper ran a story naming the woman who accused William Kennedy Smith of raping her , replete with blind quotes about the alleged victim ’s bar - hopping “ wild streak . ”
Quindlen ’s urban - earth - mother feminism fit with the cultural climate of her moment and served as a vital foil for the Times ’ still lagging grasp of gender equity .
It was Quindlen who hired Dowd as a Times metro reporter in 1983 , and Quindlen suggested Dowd as her replacement when she retired from writing her column in 1995 .
“ I ’ve known a number of really first - rate writers who could n’t make it as columnists , because to be a columnist you have to create a persona , ” says Quindlen .
“ The rap on Maureen as a reporter was that there was too much persona in the prose .
Columnists are probably the only people readers talk about like they ’re people : Strangers say to me , ‘ Did you read Maureen yesterday ? ’
As though Maureen ’s my friend — which is true — and Maureen ’s their friend — which is not true . ”
If Dowd fears castrating , she also seems frequently unable to resist it .
Dowd initially conceived of her column as partly about politics , partly about men and women — in Dowd ’s voice , which sounds a little like the actress Carol Kane ’s , this comes out “ min and womin ” — and partly about Hollywood .
“ Anna was focused on women ’s issues , ” says Dowd .
“ When I got the column , I did n’t want to do women ’s issues per se , but I did want to look at things through a woman ’s eyes .
When I started doing humor pieces , Michael Kinsley ” — the former editorial - page editor of the L.A. Times , now a columnist for the Washington Post — “ and Bill Safire separately took me aside and said do n’t do that :
You ’re going to be perceived as a girl .
And usually I ’ll take any advice .
But in that case , I just knew that was wrong for me . ”
“ I was completely wrong , ” says Kinsley .
“ I thought that she would get pegged as a girl and not taken seriously , but she in fact sort of reinvented the column as a form and made it …
Well , I ’m not going to continue this girl metaphor , because I ’m just going to get into trouble .
It ’s basically the technique of a novel : She wants to be Edith Wharton , and she is . ”
Dowd thinks of her columns as “ political cartoons . ”
In her hands , W. is a spoiled brat in cowboy boots ; the Democrats are the “ mommy party . ”
If Dowd fears castrating , she also seems frequently unable to resist it .
Clinton behaved “ like a teenage girl trying to protect her virginity ” ; “ he would be laughed out of any locker room in the country . ”
( Clinton returned fire at the 1998 White House correspondents ’ dinner when he read a list of mock headlines , including “ ‘ Buddy Got What He Deserved , ’ by Maureen Dowd . ”
Buddy was his neutered chocolate Lab . )
As in all caricatures , some traits are minimized , others are amplified and possibly distorted , but the fundamental essence is usually captured so precisely that Dowd ’s images often win a permanent place in the culture .
She ’s retold the last three presidencies as long - running sitcoms , where the joke is always on the man in charge .
In a way , she ’s created her own reality — Dowdworld — and we just live in it .

Only slightly less remarkable than her hold over Bush the First , despite her status as perhaps the single most effective basher of Bush the Second , is the fact that Dowd managed to be the apple of two successive executive editors ’ eyes : Joe Lelyveld and his replacement , Howell Raines .
Dowd once threatened to quit ( “ Not for the first or last time , ” says Lelyveld ) after an editor announced on speakerphone that a front - page story she ’d written on Kitty Kelley ’s biography of Nancy Reagan “ was n’t up to the Times standard . ”
“ Some very bad judgments were made by editors , and a story that should have been played with a lot of restraint was treated seriously and put on the front page and Maureen was pressured and I did n’t think she was at fault , ” says Lelyveld .
Lelyveld successfully appeased her with a bouquet of red roses .
“ Women know that they will , on occasion , get some extra attention because of their gender , or because they ’re charming or clever or attractive , ” Dowd writes in Are Men Necessary ?
“ They are willing to accept the benefits that come when the boss is taken with them . ”
Her title is a play on James Thurber and E. B. White ’s 1929 treatise Is Sex Necessary ? , in which they assert that relations between men and women went off course when flappers started flirting with equality by smoking , drinking , working , and imagining they had “ the right to be sexual . ”
Dowd updates the discussion with her feelings on the contemporary “ primal fear of single successful women : that the aroma of male power is an aphrodisiac for women , but the perfume of female power is a turnoff for men . ”
Her solution , or at least part of it , is old school : “ I always subscribed to the Carole Lombard philosophy : ‘ I live by a man ’s code , designed to fit a man ’s world , yet at the same time I never forget that a woman ’s first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick . ’ ” One could replace “ yet at the same time ” with “ consequently . ”
In her book , Dowd has it both ways :
She objects to the way men reduce women to chickish stereotypes , but then she ca n’t help but engage in a little bit of it herself .
It can be frustrating to hear her carve up the world along gender lines , to watch Dowd dress various human traits in pink or blue .
“ Maureen does believe that there are two teams : that there are the boys and there are the girls , ” says Wieseltier .
Dowd told me that “ Condi and Hillary do n’t throw like girls , ” for example .
“ Hillary was willing to kind of debilitate the integrity of feminism to promote her own and her husband ’s interests , and that ’s a very manly thing to do . ”
Really ?
Men are inherently more self - interested than women ?
What about Martha Stewart ?
( What about Judith Miller ? )
Dowd recently received a minor spanking at the hands of Barbara Ehrenreich after Dowd wrote in her March 13 column about the dearth of female op - ed writers and how she tried to get out of the job herself after six months : “ As a woman , I told Howell , I wanted to be liked — not attacked . ”
In response , Ehrenreich told the New York Observer , “ Some of us love fights .
I think that ’s complete bullshit . ”
“ I put Barbara ’s comment in my book because I know it is n’t the same for everyone , ” says Dowd .
“ I was just saying how it felt for me . ”
Dowd is not a partisan .
She was as merciless with Clinton as she was with Bush , and she is as skeptical of feminism as she is of communism .
As Wieseltier puts it , “ She insists that the human logic of events is their primary logic .
She ’s never distracted by the political or economic explanation . ”
Dowd is assumed by most people to be a Democrat .
But a certain brand of lefty will never forgive her for her coverage of the Clinton impeachment , the work that won her a Pulitzer .
“ A lot of people thought , Well , Maureen Dowd should be a liberal columnist and sticking up for our side , ” says Mike McCurry .
“ They thought that she was aiding and abetting Ken Starr and the Republican hate machine , and in reality she was part of this kind of Irish - Catholic mafia that included Chris Matthews and Mike Kelly that thought Clinton ’s sins were beyond the pale . ”
Dowd was the youngest of five children raised by her father , Mike , who was a D.C. police inspector , and her mother , Peggy , who died this past July and was the love of Dowd ’s life so far .
Dowd ’s mentor , former Times managing editor Arthur Gelb , calls Peggy Dowd “ the source , the fountain of Maureen ’s humor and her Irish sensibilities and her intellectual take . ”
In her last years , her mother ’s eyesight began to fail .
“ One day my phone rang , it was 7:30 in the morning , and my mother said , ‘ Hello , operator , I ’ve lost my sight and I need to be connected to a hospital . ’
She meant to press zero but she had pressed redial , ” Dowd says .
“ So I ran over and we get to the doctor ’s building and she says , ‘ I ’m never … gonna … see … ’ And I thought she was going to say ‘ your face , ’ or something , but she goes , ‘ Tim Russert ’s face again . ’
I went , Tim Russert ?!
What about me ?
It was hilarious .
But I loved that about her .
I ’m the one at the newspaper , but she ’s the real news junkie . ”
“ I listened in on one of their conversations once and it was just like one of Maureen ’s columns , ” says McCurry .
“ That same kind of caustic commentary .
I remember thinking , Her columns are letters to her mom . ”
Her mom , like the rest of the Dowd family , was thoroughly Republican .
“ Oh , God , ” says Dowd ’s sister , also named Peggy .
“ Crimson . ”
They rarely discuss politics .
“ There are times when her columns get to me , but then I gotta think , you know , at the end of my life , George Bush is not going to be knocking on my door , ” says Peggy Dowd .
“ It does n’t matter how much money I send him or how many times I vote for him , if I ’m in the hospital , he wo n’t come and hold my hand , and I know Maureen will . ”
I ask if , given her mother ’s traditionalism , Mrs. Dowd had domestic aspirations for her youngest daughter , who at 53 has never lived with a boyfriend .
“ I know she always worried about it because I was her baby , and also I ’m a little … scattered , ” says Dowd .
“ She did bring it up right before she died .
I wish I could have put her mind at rest ; I think she would have loved that .
But everybody does n’t get everything .
I told her I would work on it . ”
A few days later , I go to see Dowd at the New York Times .
She has been coming to Manhattan a lot lately , sometimes just to avoid unpacking her mother ’s boxes and sometimes to see her friends and sometimes for a professional function , like the one she has tonight .
But the guard in the lobby tells me she is at the D.C. bureau .
When I convince him that Dowd is really in the building , he sends me to the third floor .
There ’s no receptionist there , so I start wandering under the fluorescent lights through the weirdly hushed newsroom .
“ If she ’s here , she ’d be near that back wall , ” a man who appears barely undead informs me .
But all the offices in back are either dark and empty or inhabited by men .
Eventually someone pops his head up from a cubicle like a prairie dog and tells me to go upstairs .
When I finally find her on the tenth floor in her beige - carpeted office , Dowd looks like a bright bird in a business suit , her red hair smooth and frizzless despite the torrential rain outside .
“ This was Anna ’s office , and she had a quilt on the wall and they had her name on a gold plate outside , and then I started using it and I liked having her name on the gold plate because it gave me a sense of continuity , ” she says .
“ But then one day I came in and they had switched it to a gold plate that just said columnist .
I complained to Howell , and I said that ’s giving me a very insecure feeling . ”
I ask Dowd what the dinner she is attending tonight is for , and she looks down at her shoes .
“ Okay , I have something embarrassing to admit , ” she says .
“ It turned out to be next Wednesday , but by the time I realized … well , I did n’t want to screw up your schedule , and I realize I ’m very disorganized , and I debated whether to tell you because it makes me look so stupid , but I am stupid !
I just lost my cell phone in the cab .
Alessandra called me and she goes , ‘ Are you missing something ? ’ ”
“ Maureen does believe that there are two teams , that there are the boys , and there are the girls . ”
If the genre Dowd fetishizes is film noir , the genre she inhabits is romantic comedy — glamorous but madcap .
Dowd is the irresistible scatterbrain ; the vixen rendered cozy by her own haphazardness .
You can imagine the script and the props and the wardrobe for “ The Redhead and the Gray Lady . ”
“ Bush Senior , one of his assistants teases me that we have this kind of forties movie - star relationship where he ’s the upper - crust guy and I ’m the lower - class girl and we have this funny cultural collision , ” Dowd says .
“ Once when I was having dinner with one of his top aides , after he ’d had a couple martinis , he goes , ‘ Frankly , we do n’t see you at the New York Times .
We see you more like the New York Post or the Chicago Tribune . ’
And I said , ‘ You mean because I ’m ethnic or working class ? ’
And he was like , ‘ Yeah . ’ ”
Dowd says she ’s not the “ private - plane type .
It makes me nervous .
I mean , I do n’t even like to fly first class . ”
But her taste for famous men has , from time to time , required it of her .
She describes Michael Douglas , whom she dated right before he married Catherine Zeta - Jones , as “ a really nice guy , a very romantic guy . ”
The humor of their romance is not lost on her : “ Whether he can handle a woman who wields ice picks ?
I used to tease him about that .
Sometimes actors ask me out , and then I ’m worried because they can act like they ’re not scared of me , or threatened ?
But then maybe later they are .
I remember him announcing at dinner , like way after we knew each other : ‘ I ’m not scared of you . ’
But it made me nervous that he had to tell me .
I also became close with his father , Kirk , ” says Dowd .
“ He told me this funny story once about when he was first discovering his Judaism and he was making The Bad and the Beautiful and he was fasting on certain days , and he looked at me and he goes , ‘ Do you have any idea how hard it is to make love to Lana Turner on an empty stomach ? ’ ”
Dowd ’s other well - documented romance was with The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin .
In May 2001 , the New York Post reported that Dowd had accidentally sent “ randy ” e-mails intended for Aaron Sorkin to her colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin .
“ That ’s a real cautionary tale of e-mail , ” she says .
“ I had only met him ; I did n’t really know him and I was just trying to kind of give him tidbits of political things .
So I just would e-mail him funny things , and that one was a joke that some guys at a bar said , but when it appeared in the New York Post it was as if I were saying it .
Which was so embarrassing , because it was just such a dumb line , and so at least if they were going to catch you with some flirtatious e-mail — which we were n’t doing at that point — you ’d like it to be , like , a cool kind of line .
And it was also embarrassing because I think he was married then . ”
Possibly this encounter was less humiliating for Aaron Sorkin than his arrest the previous month at the Burbank airport , where he was stopped at security for attempting to catch a plane to Vegas with a stash of magic mushrooms and a $ 4 crack pipe .
Sorkin would later admit to writing some of his best work while freebasing cocaine in his room at the Four Seasons .
On Yom Kippur , I received an e-mail from him responding to my request for an interview : “ I ’m atoning for my sins today and that ’s gonna take a while .
Is tomorrow okay ? ”
Sorkin describes Dowd as “ a dream girl .
It ’s always seemed to me like she stepped out of a movie from the forties — if Rita Hayworth were just a brilliant writer , that ’s what Maureen would be .
We would take trips — we would meet in New York or go to Hawaii for a few days , and she would have with her five suitcases of , like , lamé .
It was like she was the assistant wardrobe mistress from La Cage aux Folles .
It ’s like , in case she ’s going to need it ; it brings her some kind of comfort … like a blankie . ”
Peggy
Dowd thinks that her baby sister “ intimidates men with her writing and her smarts .
I ’ve had friends who ’ve said , ‘ I ’d love to date her , but what would I talk about ? ’ ” Sorkin describes Dowd as “ more independent than I would like . ”
Wieseltier thinks that “ what ’s kept her single is her integrity :
It ’s quite simply that she ’s never found a man she loves enough to marry . ”
But it ’s also the case that being married or otherwise tied down removes a gal ’s aura of sexual mystery .
As Linda Fiorentino ’s character remarks in one of Dowd ’s favorite movies , The Last Seduction , “ A woman loses 50 percent of her power when people find out who she ’s sleeping with . ”
Wieseltier — who calls Dowd “ Bridgid , ” which is her middle name and the name of Fiorentino ’s Last Seduction character — says that his friend “ has created this character called Maureen Dowd who is dazzlingly glamorous . ”
This character is ageless .
This character is single .
The next morning , Alessandra Stanley is making eggs on the Upper West Side .
“ When I got divorced , I finally got to cook ! ” she says .
“ You know how insufferable men are .
When they cook , they have to be a chef .
I had dinner at [ Columbia J- school dean ]
Nick Lemann ’s house once , and it was like we were all witnesses to genius . ”
When Dowd walks in , she looks like she ’s just come from a nightclub .
She ’s in a distressed denim skirt and very tight high - heeled , knee - high black boots with her suit jacket from yesterday and her hair up in a clip and her sunglasses on .
“ I just had to dump my whole purse out , ” she says .
“ I was so afraid I was gonna leave my cell phone in the cab again .
But it turned out to be in my pocket .
Are you cooking ?
I should ’ve ordered some croissants or something from room service and brought them over . ”
“ Yes , you should have . ”
“ Alessandra has the most beautiful manners of anyone outside of the first President Bush . ”
“ The Wasp , ” says Stanley .
“ That ’s her Wasp side , not her Italian side , ” Dowd finishes .
“ What time is it , exactly ?
I love this watch — Mike Luckovich , I met him at the White House correspondents ’ dinner , and we somehow got in this conversation about how he collects vintage ties and I had a bunch of them from when I used to imitate the way Alessandra dressed , she used to wear ties .
What year was that ? ”
“ I do n’t want to say . ”
“ It was a while back , ” says Dowd .
“ I do n’t wear them anymore , so I sent them to him and he sent me this watch .
I think it ’s engraved TO BLANCHE .
So what time is it ?
I ’m so happy that woman called you with the cell phone .
Although phones are relatively easy , it ’s when you leave your computer in the cab . ”
Has that happened ?
“ Perhaps , ” she purrs .
“ Perhaps that ’s happened in the past .
When I was on the campaign , that might have happened once or thrice . ”
“ I left my coat in Iowa , ” says Stanley .
“ I remember the campaign had to send it to me because I went straight to New Hampshire .
It must have been Dole . ”
“ Alessandra loved covering Dole . ”
“ Because he was genuinely one of the meanest , funniest people on Earth and he could n’t stop , ” says Stanley .
“ He could not stop himself ! ”
“ Alessandra ’s been everywhere .
How many languages do you speak ? ”
“ All right , do n’t do this , ” says Stanley .
“ Just tell her . ”
“ Like Dorothy Parker .
You remember that famous line of hers ? ”
“ No , ” says Dowd .
“ Someone said so - and - so speaks eighteen languages .
Dorothy Parker says , yeah , but she ca n’t say no in any of them . ”
The phone rings , and Stanley checks the caller I.D. “ That ’s type A , ” she says .
“ That ’s Anna .
I ’m not answering that phone .
Anna Quindlen reads everything , every paper , and you do n’t want to talk to her in the morning because she ’s wired .
If she could write a column every single day , she would . ”
“ My watch says twenty of two , ” says Dowd .
It is 10:30 in the morning .
“ All right , girls , I ’m going to try and catch this train , ” she says and puts on her pink Burberry trench coat and slings two different duffels over her shoulders , neither of which is really closed .
She does , in fact , look like a character — gorgeous , charming , a little ridiculous — in a novel .
But it ’s a true story .
Some of her best work .
It looks like Will Smith is going to be all over the remake of the Karate Kid .
Today we learn that he will not only be producing , but also directing the project .
We get the scoop from our friends at moviesonline :
Will Smith is in fact going to direct the upcoming Karate Kid movie according to production notes .
His son Jaden Smith will also star .
There has been a lot of past speculation on who would star , and who would direct but it would seem the speculation can now end .
Overbook Entertainment have Will Smith listed as the director and Jaden Smith as its star .
Will Smith has had quite the journey .
If you would have told me back in the day , that The Fresh Prince would be directing a remake of the Karate Kid in the future ( as the Kung Fu Kid ) ; I would have called you a liar and a prophet of questionable ability .
But here we are , and it looks like Mr. Smith ’s directorial debut on a feature film , will be alongside his son and Jackie Chan or Steven Chow .
Steven Chow has confirmed that he is in talks to play Mr. Miyagi and we get his words on the matter today via themoviehole :
Martial arts magnate Stephen Chow ( “ Kung Fu Hustle ” ) has confirmed online rumours that he ’s in talks to play wise and wrinkly warrior Mr Myiagi in a ‘’ Karate Kid ’ ’ remake .
“ I ’m very fond of ‘ The Karate Kid ’ and would love to join in the remake project , no matter as a producer , director or actor ” , says Chow .
“ But it depends on my schedule .
As you know , next year I will work on two movies , ‘ Dragon Ball ’ and ‘ Journey to the West . ' ”
So it is not yet confirmed that Chow will be Miyagi , but he is certainly still in the running .
Chan is a high octane contender however and although both men are great choices , I think I would prefer the pastoral Chan for the role of Kung Fu Master .
Lots of news out today regarding this project and we will have to hope that they walk with the wisdom of Macchio to create a film that pays tribute to the original .
Skeletons in the White House

Yale University may , possibly , be withholding America 's most dangerous secrets .
The institution protects the interests of three " Orders , " presenting Scroll and Key , Wolf 's Head , and the notorious Skull and Bones as " Senior Fraternities , " but former pledges of these " Tombs , " particularly Skull and Bones , dominate American politics and prestigious corporations .
The Constitution places the people over the government and states equally , everyone included .
If they can investigate us , " we the people " need a closer analysis of future , US leaders , their dinner dates , and the companies who drop billions upon trillions into funding their schemes .
Secrets between powerful organizations , namely , Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key ( two prime suspects in enforcing the planet under a single government ; the New World Order ) , deserve a mandatory investigation .
Think history was an accidental phenomenon ?
Time to learn how to analyze an entire situation , outside of the group , for " the group " is the reason the entire race is destined to fall , but no worries ; it is only the end of the world .
Does anyone realize the dangers of dormancy ?
Politics and media navigate society , affecting our way of thinking .
Global instability skyrockets , the government raises taxes to fund their " War on Terrorism , " and still , the body politic fusses without a fight .
In this carelessness , our species dissolves .
If the best excuses to not vote circumference either , " I really do n't know about politics " ( translation : " I do n't care enough about anything , let alone politics . " ) , or , " Why should I vote ?
What 's the difference ? " ( translation : " I 'm too lazy to do anything " ) , we already signed our fate .
Civilization , truly , is doomed .
The truth is , there may , really not , be a distinct identity between the elephant and ass ; herein lies the beginning to a major problem .
Erase philosophical variations of the Democrat and Republican parties , and one will find that separating the left from the right leads to a unified interest of totalitarianism .
GPS devices are implanted in most automobiles , and now , imbedding tracking systems in children has raised discussion .
Adults are next .
Are we heading toward a Brave New World , or will the year 2084 resemble Orwell 's 1984 ?
American politics currently reflect characteristics of a global campaign to enforce totalitarian socialism as the New World Order , a predestined history written in New Haven , Connecticut , circa 1832 ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par . 9 ) .
The Order of the Skull and Bones ' alias is the " Brotherhood of Death " ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par .
1 ) but despite " popular belief , " the quiescent society was not the first enigmatic consortium at Yale University ; Phi Beta Kappa , established in 1780 , was the taciturn predecessor of Skull and Bones ( Schiff , par . 2 - 3 ) .
Harvard administration , in reaction to the closed - door policies of the garbo fraternity , assigned Unitarian Massachusetts chaplain and destined president of Harvard , as the liaison who would preach on the behalf of denouncing the presence of sodality as a part of collegiate curriculum .
Everett 's solicitation impacted Phi Beta Kappa , henceforth , propelling the defiant trend in the oaths of silence ( Dong , par . 7 - 9 ) .
In an offended backlash to the transition , Yale 's 1833 valedictorian , William Huntington Russell , in alliance with Alfonso Taft , father of president , William Howard Taft , and fourteen others , assembled the Order of the Skull of Bones , December 1832 .
Russell and Company , built in 1823 , by William Huntington 's cousin , Samuel , affixed the corporation 's fortune in the US opium smuggling - trade with China .
Samuel 's prosperity of the family wealth would be the funding agency , overseeing the construction of the " Tomb " in 1856 ( Millegan , par. 10 , 20 ) .
William Huntington Russell returned to the US after a year in Berlin , enticed with Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 's infusion of " scientific method " with humanitarian enterprise .
The proletarian theorem dominated Bavaria during his foreign study , basing philosophy at the roots of communism and fascism ( Millegan , par . 7,9 ) .
During his year 's stay , he sustained a relationship with a corrupt , German luminary of an underground organization who promoted death as their insignia .
The society which was none other than , the apocalyptic Order of Bavarian Illuminati ( Robbins , " George W. Bush and the ' Brotherhood ' " par . 2 ) . The German coterie seemed to " share an affinity for the Hegelian ideas of the historical dialectic , which dictates the use of controlled conflict — thesis versus anti-thesis — to create a pre-determined synthesis ; a synthesis of their own making and design , where the state is absolute and the individuals are granted independence based on their obedience to the state — a New World Order " ( Millegan , par. 38 ) .
First traces of the Illuminati appeared , supposedly , as early as the fifteenth century , but Adam Weishaupt reinstated the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati ( originally named the Order of Perfectibilists ) May 1 , 1776 ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par . ) .
Weishaupt was employed as a Professor of Natural and Canon Law at the University of Ingolstadt in 1775 , the year marking his elicitation of the Order of the Illuminati , an opposing party in the University .
His " cosmopolitan " ideas , along with others who thwarted " the bigotry and superstitions of the Priests , " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par .
2 ) took offense to the clergy , thus , confirming the revolt , also known as the " Enlightened " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par . 2 ) .
In 1785 a messenger , en route from Frankfurt - on - the - Main to Paris , was struck by lightning .
Discovered on the dead body was a piece written by Weishaupt titled , " The Original Shift in Days of Illumination , " the contents describing the future goal for " the New World Order through Revolution " ( Millegan , par. 88 ) .
The " professed object " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par .
1 ) was , by the mutual assistance of its members , " to attain the highest possible degree of morality and virtue and to lay the foundation for the reformation of the world by association of good men to oppose the progress of moral evil " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par . 1 ) . Illuminati means , " intellectually inspired , " an occult claiming , " wisdom from a higher source " ( Secret Organizations , " List " par. 9 ) , blending philanthropy with mysticism ( Secret Organizations , " List " par . 9 ) .
Yale University derives from the generosity of one who is referred to as a philanthropist , but " mystic " does not justly describe the Order of the Skull and Bones or the ill manners of their operative secrets ( Millegan , par . 2 ) .
Dissidence surrounds the existence of the Illuminati , just as any clan vying for world domination , yet , they are more than a fabled doctrine specifically created for the first Tomb Raider movie .
Weishaupt revived an independently - thinking league of republicans seen as a " rationalistic secret society , " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par . 5 ) .
The propagandist liberation of humanitarian thought , the exploding trend of eighteenth - century Europe , paralleled the fellowship 's nuclear ideology ; their accelerated rise to power became far too easy .
The Illuminati was the " first society to use political subversion as the machinery of a secret organization offered by freemasonry ... through the craft , they began to spread " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par. 5 ) . Historians , namely the Masonic writers , suggest , they were nothing more than a " curious historical footnote , " ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par .
6 ) but conspiracy theorists beg to differ ; in their opinion , the Illuminati holds an association with the Trilateral Commission , International Zionism , and communism , all directly related to the Vatican as a bid for world domination ( Obie , " Adam Weishaupt " par . 6 ) .
Can the existence of the Skull and Bones , truly , be traced to the Illuminati ?
Conspiracy theorists say " absolutely , " pointing to the beginnings with the Russell family tree .
Around the late eighteenth century , the clan moved to Germany from Scotland .
As the plot thickened , individuals with the surname , Russell , appear significantly constant throughout the many levels of the New World Order .
Several other Russells validated prominent memberships with the Illuminati , Masons , and groups controlling the plans of the New World Order , mainly dominating the business as merchants and lawyers ( Springmeier , par. 14 -5 ) .
The actual Skull and Crossbones symbol , the one associated with the flags sailing on the pirate ships ( also on the Russell Trust Association 's fleet during the opium trade ! ) , waves the message of a " double cross " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 49 ) , and happens to be the official crest of the Illuminati ( Marrs , p. 91 ) .
The resemblances are far too striking to be coincidental .
Both follow the rampant motif of " constructive chaos " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par .
6 ) , emitting contradictions on every crucial issue while keeping their agenda hidden ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par . 6 ) .
The Bonesmen hold tightly to " constructive confusion " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 15 ) , purposefully leaking " conflicting mythologies to spring up about the origins and history of their secret fraternity " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 15 ) .
Common similarities between the organizations evidently point to a strong connection .
The Illuminati and the Order both designate " secret " names for their initiates following induction ; names known only to the members within the group ( Marrs , p. 91 ) .
Rituals , tight bonds to authoritative figures , and philosophy encompass three , shared traits of the fellowships , but the code of ethics , explicitly for the Skull and Bones , elevates apprehension .
Their rites of passage ceremony involves a masquerade demonstrating an " idolization of death , and attainment of power by killing " ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par . 8 ) .
Associated with the fact that an asymmetric amount of Bonesmen graduate into the CIA , an agency which promotes " torture and murder to achieve its ends " ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par. 8 ) , surfaces the assumption that the Order formats a precipitated adherence to iniquitous , lewd behavior and ethics ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par . 8 ) . Conspiracy theorists lose their minds over the phenomenon of the Nathan Hale statues on Yale 's campus , CIA headquarters in Langley , VA ( Oldenburg , par. 25 ) , and Phillips Academy , Andover Massachusetts ( Millegan , par . 3 ) , one of two preferred training grounds for future enrollment in Skull and Bones ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 30 ) .
Conspiracy theorist Kris Millegan sees a link between Skull and Bones and the Illuminati .
According to a publication on Meta- Religion.com , section nine , " The Illuminati : Subverting the Body Politic , " Proofs of Conspiracy , is heavily referenced .
The book was written in 1798 by John Robison , member of a Freemason Lodge and professor of natural philosophy at Edinburgh University in Scotland .
Within the text , " an association has been formed for the express purpose of rooting out all the religious establishments and overturning all existing governments ... the leaders would rule the World with uncontrollable power , while the rest of the world would be employed as tools of the ambition of their unknown superiors " ( Millegan , par. 96 -9 ) .
Ceremonial highlights of initiation into the " Recent Degree " ( Millegan , par. 99 ) in Illuminism , included in the article , mentioned " a skeleton pointed to him [ the initiate ] , at the feet of which are laid a crown and a sword .
He is asked , ' whether that is a skeleton of a king , nobleman , or beggar . '
As he cannot decide , the president of the meeting says to him , ' the character of being a man is the only one that is important " ( Millegan , par. 99 ) .
Funny ... similar writing can be found in the Tomb of the Skull and Bones , ironically , inscribed in German : " Wer war der Thor , wer Weiser , Bettler oder Kaiser ?
Ob Arm , ob Reich , im Tode gleich . " translation : " Who was the fool , who the wise man , beggar , or king ?
Whether poor or rich , it 's all the same in death " ( Millegan , par . 100 ) .
Bonesmen agree with Illuminists , preferring to keep the secrets within families .
The Order 's personal independence and maximum authority has been kept confined to a tight - knit circle of eminent WASP ( White Anglo - Saxon Protestant ) clans .
Propagation of endowed membership is a screening process the Seniors bestow upon their junior prospects ; all with elite , East Coast backgrounds .
Favoritism has always been shown to the Protestants , especially those with roots in the WASP families ( Robbins , " George W. Bush and the ' Brotherhood ' " par . 5 ) .
The aftermath formulated from this tight intermingling administers a " narrow - minded " bias against ancestry , not of these bloodlines .
The bulk are Puritans , migrating to the US in the initial " wave " of foreigners during the seventeenth century .
The second blast of power emanated in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries from clans striking it rich , mostly in the trade business .
Through their affluent estates , they earned their " rites of passage " into the ranking of the New England exclusive .
A minority of Jewish banking families , voyaging to the States with the second group of eighteenth and nineteenth century WASPs , were ultimately permitted minimal entry into the private haven of the top - flight New Englanders , but the elitists never viewed the Jews as equivalent in their differentiation of politics and culture .
Overall , the WASPs grew suspicious of their intentions and never found assurance with allowing them into the " inner circle " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 27 ) .
Progress would eventually call for changes , and a shift in the Order forced conformity among the society 's networking .
Lanny Davis ,
Yale class of 1967 and secret society member , wrote an article published in the 1968 yearbook , describing the " ideal " roster for a successful year 's membership in the Skull and Bones .
The list includes , " the football captain , chairman of the Yale Daily News , a conspicuous radical , a Whiffenpoof , a swimming captain , a notorious drunk with a 94 average , a film - maker , a political columnist , a religious group leader , a Chairman of the Lit , a foreigner , a ' ladies ' man ' with two motorcycles , an ex-service man , a Negro , and if there are enough to go around , a guy nobody else in the group had ever heard of , ever " ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par . 9 ) . Notably , the Skull and Bones have an affinity for consistently " tapping " the same type of members ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par. 10 ) .
Since 1991 , after heated dispute concerning " date rape " ( Safer , par .
39 ) Skull and Bones , finally , " tap " women ( Oldenburg , par. 51 ) .
On Yale 's Old Campus sits Weir Hall , a brick structure which looks more like King Arthur 's castle rather than a college residence hall .
The building sports a tower , over - looking the courtyard of the brown , limestone mausoleum that casts an eerie aura along High Street .
On second Saturday evening in April , the week following " Tap Night , " in one sneaks to the top of Weir , the mysterious shrieking of the initiates from inside the windowless " tomb " can be heard ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par .
6 ) , but these abecedarians receive treatment , unlike the recognitions on freshman " Tap night . "
In contrary , the successors are aerated into the darkness of the witching hours and notarized to silence about the dimension they are on the verge of infiltrating ( Dong , par . 2 ) .
" Tap Day " received the name from the process of the initiation .
The senior Bonesmen march about campus , to the dorms , off - campus housing , or all locations of designation in search of their " tapees . "
Upon finding their prey , they stealthily approach the unsuspecting victim , tap them on the shoulder , and shout in a booming voice , " Skull and Bones !
Do you accept ? "
If the individual accepts ( very rarely does one decline such an offer ! ) , a scroll , bound with a black ribbon , sealed by black wax with the skull and crossbones emblem , complete with the " mystical Bones number 322 , " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 33 ) is produced , designating the information on the eve of initiation .
Specific instructions tell the candidate to don no metal objects or clothing ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 33 ) .
Only after graduation , are the members allowed to reveal their affiliations to Skull and Bones .
The recognition is identified by wearing the official Skull and Crossbones pin ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par . 5 ) .
For 174 years , Bones has been the most covertly cryptic and liturgical , above all senior and secret societies .
Adversary " Senior " societies at Yale , namely , Book and Snake , File and Claw , Wolf 's Head , Berzelius , and Elihu , in honor of Elihu Yale ( Schiff , par . 7 ) , [ the ] man responsible for changing the face of once , Collegiate College in 1718 ( Millegan , par . 2 ) , conduct " tomb raids . "
The taunting underlies tradition , hoping to surface the inner sanctums of the Skull and Bones ' lair .
Raiding the Skull and Bones " tomb " was not a privilege reserved for competing societies .
Spring break , 1975 , a forty - eight - year - old writer , now living in Toronto , broke into the Bones ' base station with her boyfriend .
She referred to the fortress as a " clubhouse " minus a tree .
After commenting on the infamous " room of license plates " ( Abcarain , par. 16 ) , she adds , " They were always ripping things off with ' 322 ' on them " ( Abcarian , par. 16 ) .
The number 322 holds a debatable significance to the " old- boy network " ( Abcarian , par. 17 ) .
Conspiracy conflicts conspiracy within the connotation of the number .
Four Years at Yale , the 1871 , incognito publication authored by Yale class of 1869 , Lyman Bagg , included the first dissertation of the Order of the Skull and Bones .
He observes , " the mystery now attending its existence forms the once great enigma which college gossip never tires of discussing " ( Schiff , par . 3 ) .
Bagg addresses the " injustice conferring of Phi Beta Kappa elections " ( Schiff , par .
3 ) progressing the settlement of " a sort of Burlesque convivial club " ( Schiff , par . 4 ) .
Separating facts from fiction , he argues that the Skull and Bones was confidentially called , the " Eulogian Club , " in attribute to Eulogia , the goddess of eloquence ( Schiff , par . 4 ) .
The year , 322 B.C. , refers to the death of Alexander or Demosthenes , thus , placing Eulogia in the pantheon ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par. 14 ) .
His concept resonates the Skulls ' affinity for the number 322 , but rejects the popular belief of the Hellegianistic hypotheses ( Schiff , par . 4 ) .
To amplify the suggestive undertones , a secret admirer bequeathed an endorsement of $ 322,000.00 to the Order in 1967 .
The graduate student remains , unidentified ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par. 14 ) .
Ron Rosenbaum , Yale 68 ' ( President Bush 's graduating class ) presently writes for The New York Observer .
The journalist spent sophomore year living in Jonathan Edwards Resident College ( Yale 's glorified name for " dorm " ) , neighbor to the headquarters of the Order of the Skull and Bones .
Since departure from the Ivy League , the mysterious silence fuels a life - long obsession with the illustrious " boys ' club . "
September 1977 , Esquire published Rosenbaum 's " The Last Secrets of the Skull and Bones , " the first piece to publicly challenge the Order in over a century .
The abstracts , memorandums , and compilations , concerning the lattice of the Skull and Bones ' , Greco - Egyptian catacomb and documentation of their bizarre , sacramental praxis , he procures from antagonistic Orders ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par. 17 ) , disgruntled exes of Bonesmen ( Oldenburg , par. 33 ) , and female " tomb " raiders ( Rosenbaum , " Inside George W.'s " par . 3 ) . Rosenbaum 's menagerie of the Skull and Bones ' , aggregate culmination includes elucidated layouts of the Tomb labyrinth , complete with the precise designation of the " holiest of holy " Bones ' havens , the disreputably omnipotent , Room 322 ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par. 17 ) .
In the Yale library 's " manuscript room , " Rosenbaum discovered a box labeled " The Russell Trust Association , " the fraternity 's " proper " name .
Among the various files sat File and Claw 's revealing documentation stolen in the 1876 raid .
According to the memorandum , the founding year of the society , 1832 , is also noted in the eyes of conspiracy theorists , 32 ' the founding year , and the " two " in reference to a notion that Skull and Bones is a second league within a larger , international pyramid ( henceforth , ' 322 ' ) ; " one " belonging to a lodge in Germany , " two , " to the Order of the Skull of Bones , and " three , " mounted in another lodge , an undisposed location in the States , supposedly Scroll and Key ( Marrs , p. 91 ) , or another American , college secret society ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 11 ) .
One of the testaments in the Rosenbaum collection was a charted description of an inducting session in 1940 .
The dossier read as follows : " New man placed in coffin - carried into central part of the building .
New man chanted over and ' reborn ' into society .
Removed from coffin and given robe with symbols on it .
A bone with his name on it is tossed into bone heap at start of every meeting .
Initiates plunged into mud pile " ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par. 18 ) .
The juniors are , almost , " beaten to death , " to represent dying in order to be born anew into the family of the Order .
After the period of cleansing , the candidates are given the Druid - like cloak , a symbol of " new identities , " issued new names , " re-christened " as " Knight X " ( Robbins , " George W. Bush and the ' Brotherhood ' " par . 7 ) . Chosen titles indicate an occupation or " existential status " ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par .
4 ) , upholding the secret bearings infused into every logic of the Order ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par . 4 ) .
In 2001 , Rosenbaum and a camera crew , lurked from a stoop of Weir , and taped a shenanigan , interpreted as the zenith to a Skull and Bone 's induction ceremony .
The baptismal denoted a " frat party gone medieval " ( Oldenburg , par. 34 ) .
The footage exemplifies the Blair Witch Project documentary , rather than a induction to a fraternity ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par. 21 ) .
Due to their initiation practices , Skull and Bones are a rumored annex participating in the " mysticism " guild , subservient to a prominent society ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par. 23 ) , but this mystique exemplifies " Harry Potter meets Dracula " ( Safer , par. 20 ) , in contrast to buoyant optimism .
The greater , said , syndicate of the sorcerer 's coalition , is " The Black Lodge , " supposedly , coefficients of the Thule and Vril Societies , two fellowships immersed in the development of Nazism ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par. 24 ) .
Contrary to the German - Nazi concepts , secondary assessments of the Order 's ritualistic shenanigans are interpreted as paganism , specifically , the Druids or Wiccans .
The " Satanic " occult theme draws historical memoirs with the ambience of the Scots or Celts .
To preserve the purity of the Skull and Bones blood , one of the most crucial aspects involved in initiation is the infamous masturbation session while lying naked in coffin and spilling deepest , darkest , personal sexual fantasies and sexual history .
The purpose of this otherwise display of " too much information " is a judgment of whether or not the candidate is proper material to intertwine with the bloodlines of the Skull and Bones empires .
Pure pedigrees and preparatory boarding school attendance , top the prerequisites for selection .
Any signals of resistance is a sign the initiate is unwilling to surrender himself for the benefit of the Order ( Robbins , " George W. Bush and the ' Brotherhood ' " par .
5 ) . " Ritualistic psychological conditioning " ( Wikipedia , " Skull & Bones " par. 15 ) aligns with the stunt in the casket .
Autobiographies are documented in great detail , expanding personal files , accumulated research on each initiate , prior to " Tap Night . "
The story telling sessions would petrify a psychiatrist , psychologist , and psycho - therapist , but for the members , " sharing time " is " bonding time . "
Intricate notes compiled as additions " for the record , " to ensure a collection of black mail material , if any leakage , the file supplies an immediate plug .
The interrogations are so intense , some newbies edge the possibilities of needing an actual shrink ; a handful , literally , have a mental collapse ( Robbins , " George W. Bush and the ' Brotherhood ' " par . 7 ) .
Bones alumni refer to their former brethren as " Patriarchs " ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par. 29 ) .
Once a year , the Patriarchs meet north of Alexandria Bay , NY , on the Order 's private land , Deer Island , but they are expected to make occasional appearances at the Tomb .
The cameos intimidate and awe the current members , signifying the big shoes they are expected to fill ( Dart , par. 23 - 4 ) .
Relationships remain close for the older members .
Orthodox Jew Donald Etra , Skull and Bones 68 ' , who describes himself as " a strong Zionist " ( Abcarian , par. 13 ) admits to the LA Times , " I am a liberal Democratic criminal defense attorney who voted for George Bush , and I will vote for him again . "
Perhaps Bush appointing him to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council offered encouragement , but Etra claims , " Most of us put friendship first and politics a far , far second " ( Abcarian , par. 13 ) .
Conspiracy theorists raise their brows at the fact that Yale alumni have dominated the presidential race for the past thirty - two years in the position of president or vice - president .
For the previous fifteen years , every resident of the White House boasts a Yale degree ( Greenway , par . 1 ) . Considering the Bones " tap " ( initiate ) , selectively , fifteen juniors per year , the limitations guarantee six to eight hundred members , living , at a time .
Precisely , 2,500 , total , members fill the Bones ' roster .
Due to the specifics in numbers , one " Bonesman " against fellow " Bonesman , " running for president , poses questionable odds ( Oldenburg , par . 9 ) . Alexandra Robbins , author of Secrets of the Tomb : Skull and Bones , the Ivy League , and the Hidden Paths of Power , predicted the potential Bush vs. Kerry " face off " ( Beam , par . 2 ) .
From senators and congressmen , US Supreme Court justices , CIA officials , Cabinet members , and ( not to be forgotten ) presidents ( Oldenburg , par. 19 ) , to Henry Luce , Time magazine 's founder , Harold Stanley , of Morgan and Stanley , and Dean Witter , Jr. , Dean Witter Investments , who merged with Morgan and Stanley in 1997 ( Korff , par . 4 ) . The World Masquerade Ball Committee , surname for the universal , mystic fellowship , signifies a ring in which the Skull and Bones pull significant weight as representation of the most powerful elite of the nations ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 10 ) .
Accentuating the strengths that support Skull and Bones , a rivaling society , " raided the Tomb " in 1988 , lifting documentation which read : ( the overall intentions of the Skull and Bones ) " is to propel our members to places of control , in every facet of life in the world " ( Korff , par . 8 ) .
The organization focuses on placing their graduates into prestigious and influential professions , mainly , politics , media , and commerce .
The " up and coming , " prominent , generation ( Skull and Bones Class of 60 ' through 71 ' ) obsesses over controlling the White House .
By winning a second term in the Oval Office , Bush , Jr. preserved his birthright in the Bones empire , an infrastructure buried in the depths of politics .
People appear to be ideologically ignorant to believe a Democrat Commander - in - Chief is the answer to Utopia , but the chance for survival under Kerry Administration may as well be the Bush 's family values .
Joseph Lieberman chaired the Yale Daily News , the most coveted , student title on campus , while Bush , Jr. perfected the " jock " image with a mediocre G.P.A .
Since freshman year at Yale , Kerry has been practicing his smiles for the camera , campaigning for the presidency .
Howard Dean also deserves note , descending from this era of the most exclusive , US , secret society .
Despite their vast differences in extra- curricular activities , all four indicated signs of various temperaments that would advance their careers toward the pinnacle of US politics .
History and political science were the centralized studies , and the four men received guidance from , generally , the same professors and tutors ( Laurence , par. 2 , 7-11 ) .
An interview conducted by Tim Russert , NBC's Meet the Press , confirmed Kerry 's enrollment , but the Senator withheld all information that went beyond his affiliation to the Order .
His staff refused further commentary when interrogated by the Boston Herald .
Kelley Benander , Kerry 's spokeswoman , was quoted , " John Kerry had absolutely nothing to say about this subject .
Sorry . " ( Koroff , par . 2 ) .
To no one 's surprise , Bush Jr. and Sr. have never disclosed any information about their connections to the network ( Korff , par . 3 ) . Russert popped the question , regarding President Bush 's membership to the Order .
W. , Jr. , simply , replied that the club was " so secret we can't talk about it " ( Jasper , " Bipartisan Bonesmen " p. 3 ) .
He covered his tracks by chuckling and implying , due to the secrets , perhaps , the Skull and Bones no longer existed .
After clearing his throat , he , nervously , changes the subject to the " War on Terrorism . "
Both men followed the past orders ( no pun intended ) of Bush 's grandfather , Prescott , to " claim everything , explain nothing , deny everything ! " ( Jasper , " Bipartisan Bonesmen " p. 5 ) .
Giving the Skull and Bones a historical x-ray , one will find that the Senator and the President , broke a major , fraternity creed ; if a genuine affiliate of the club hears an outsider mention the Skull and Bones , Bonesmen are to exit stage left ( for the Democrats ) or right ( for the Republicans ) , immediately ( Jasper , " Bipartisan Bonesmen " p. 4 ) .
Since George W. , Jr. took the throne of the Oval Office , he appointed fellow , Skull and Bones , class of 1968 , Robert McCallum , as Assistant Attorney General .
In the US District Court , McCallum " filed pleadings , seeking to extend executive privilege to any government official in pardon cases " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
4 ) ; this documentation deepens the secrets surrounding presidential pardons , more than ever .
Bush did not bother to initially share with Congress about his assembly of a " shadow government " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
5 ) residing in " secret bunkers " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
5 ) along an undisposed location on the East Coast , after 9 - 11 , but thanks to William Cooper , author of Behold a Pale Horse and former Navy and Air Force Intelligence , the areas are no longer hidden from the public .
Around the rise of the Cold War in the early 1950s , the government installed the " secret bunkers , " under mountains in North Carolina , Virginia , West Virginia , Pennsylvania , and Maryland , yet Congress remains clueless about the existence of the " Federal Relocation Centers " ( Cooper , p. 116 ) ; virtually underground cities that are fully operational , but instead of using the resources to spy on Osama Bin Laden or other terrorist groups , these military facilities keep a twenty - four hour surveillance on the citizens of the United States of America ( Cooper , p. 115-7 ) .
In addition to his illusiveness , he attempted to withhold " classified information about the anti-terrorist campaign " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
5 ) from specific members of Congress .
Within the past couple of years , " invasion of privacy " became " patriotic , " thanks to the USA Patriot Act .
The decree permits FBI access to consumer records that shop owners are barred from viewing .
After approval from a " secret Washington ' spy court ' " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
6 ) , President Bush was excessively enthusiastic about giving his " John Hancock " on the Act.
Attorney General John Ashcroft , in October 2001 , published a memorandum enthusing federal agencies to keep " as much information as possible " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
7 ) from the body politic .
In November , " W. , Jr. " approved an " executive order severely hindering public access to former presidents ' records , " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par .
8 ) conveniently , intercepting the release of Reagan - Bush presidential records .
In addition to his " shady " actions , he " signed legislation that jails or fines journalists who publish sensitive leaks , essentially , reviving the Official Secrecy Act that President Clinton vetoed " ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par . 9 ) . According to the Bill of Rights , these actions seem a bit , shall we say , " unconstitutional ? "
Robbins ' book , Secrets of the Tomb ... , cracked a few bones , upon release in 2002 .
In Robbins ' USA Today editorial , she denies the Order 's conspiring plots to dictate a single - society world ( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par. 12 ) , after accusing the Order of plotting to take over the world in her book , however ; the words spout from the mouth of a former member of Yale 's secret society , Scroll and Key , the foreign policy powerhouse ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par. 16 ) .
Robbins , openly , concedes to her past accomplishment as the main , contributing factor , granting her interviews with over one - hundred , previous Bonesmen ( Abcarian , par. 27 ) , but are her disclaimers to " verifiable fact " ( Jasper , " Bipartisan Bonesmen " p. 7 ) skeptical because of her antecedent incorporation with a secret society ?
Evidently , Scroll and Key is , also , a prime suspect in the scheme vying for world domination ( Trunkerton , " New World Order - History " par . 3 ) . The Atlantic Monthly published Robbins ' first piece about the Skull and Bones ( Thompson , par. 24 ) , and to the shock of no one , the piece contradicts , but also supports information in her book and the USA Today editorial .
Interestingly enough , the Atlantic Monthly 's founder is Richard Ely Danielson , Skull and Bones 07 ' ( Sutton , p. 28 ) .
Although her biased point of view is full of holes , the editorial does contain substantial data , concerning our current president .
She describes George W.'s decisions as , " turning the government into a secret society - an old - boy , throwback establishment that even holds its secret spy-court proceedings in an elaborately , locked , windowless room ... "
( Robbins , " White House Bonesman " par . 2 ) .
Does this sound familiar , perhaps , a personification of a certain building on Yale 's Old Campus , known as the " Tomb , " silent , windowless ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par .
1 ) at 64 High Street ?
( Yale , " Skull and Bones , 1999 " par . 1 ) .
British conspiracy theorist , Antony Sutton , is widely recognized for his collection of pamphlets infused into a book , America 's Secret Establishment : An Introduction to the Order of the Skull and Bones , published in 1986 .
In 1968 , Stanford University 's Hoover Institution , published Western Technology and the Soviet Economic Development .
Sutton 's manuscript questioned US government relations in the scandals of history .
His curiosity remained a mystery , until the early 1980s ( Sutton , p. vii ) .
" According to several ' informed ' sources " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par .
110 ) , Sutton was one of many historians to be privileged with " in-house " manuscripts , belonging to the Skull and Bones , meeting minutes , ritual highlights , and a roster of members from the beginning to 1982 .
( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 110 ) .
Sutton says upon receipt of the eight - inch , thick file of documents : ( in relation to Western Technology and the Soviet Economic Development ) " ... a formerly fuzzy world became crystal clear " ( Sutton , p. vii ) .
The plan for a New World Order appears to be a prevalent theme throughout the documentation .
Sutton is under the impression that the Bonesmen 's cardinal focus is the achievement of a " New World Order " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par .
112 ) defined as a world dominated by US military authority and US domination over , " all strategic raw materials " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 113 ) .
The Skull and Bones romanticize an image of Sparta , as the WASPs , the " warrior caste " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 113 ) of the Persian Empire , with a structure of " coalitions of satrap armies , " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par . 113 ) the model for their New World Order .
Sutton says the " romantic mystique of purgative powers of combat " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par . 114 ) is at the center of comprehending the Skull and Bone 's art of possibilities ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 114 ) .
Skills of the " outdoors men , " related to hunting , and the " ordeal " of war finalize the third , crucial prerequisite for being " tapped . "
Service in any of the four military branches on a resume is highly esteemed in the eyes of Bonesmen ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par , 31 - 2 ) .
In the early 1900s , the Order 's pride and joy was an outfit of Naval pilots , known as the Yale Flying Unit , hand - picked by none other than Senator Prescott Bush , grandfather of George W. ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 32 ) .
The Skull and Bones search to revamp the US masterdom of the era proceeding post - WWII , a time that George H. W. Bush calls the , " American Century . "
The society means to " utilize the institutional networks of the US government and key , private agencies ( i.e. The New York Council on Foreign Relations ) to advance their purpose " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par .
5 ) , most importantly , the cause of seizure of " undisputed control " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par .
7 ) over Earth 's supply of oil ( can we say , " War on Terrorism ? " ) .
The " constructive chaos , " masking the honesty of their hidden agendas , is constantly emitted , regarding all critical policy issues ; they are more than aware of their desire to spout indifference in both nominal " friends " and " enemies " ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par . 6 - 7 ) .
The ancestry of the Order stressed the seriousness of silence , merging tactics with tradition .
Covering the entire creed of the Bonesmen , the practice fills every tiny crevice of the private society ( even the smallest " leak " of " blue blood " spilled onto public curiosity , potentially , risks exposure of the global Monopoly game ) .
America 's property on the board boasts the most prestigious , above all , Western powers .
Skull and Bones is the ultimate training camp , recycling the WASP , drug smuggling families .
Fascist attitudes still highlight the miniscule Native - American population , forced onto government properties ; sporadic , desolate areas , basically , worthless wastelands ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par. 26 ) .
From 1832 advanced into modern times , the Skull and Bones appear to have had their bony fingers wrapped around every skeletal structure of American civilization .
For an organization with such small numbers , the Bonesmen have effectively and strategically situated themselves in all realms of politics , research , financial groups , media , and governmental establishments for 174 years , and their success prevails ( Robbins , " George Bush and the ' Brotherhood ' " par . 4 ) .
The immense prosperity of the Order increases the questions of schemes plotted behind the triple - padlocked door ( Rosenbaum , " Last Secrets " par . 7 ) . Inside the " Tomb " clocks run five minutes faster than standard time zone , as a representation of being " ahead " of the rest of the world ( Robbins , " Skull and Bones Society " par. 23 ) .
We are all familiar with the " Golden Rule , " " whoever has the gold makes the rules . "
In a quest for the New World Order , the Bilderberg , consequently , extend into other aristocratic ivory towers , namely , the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission .
All three draw strong connections , linked to David Rockefeller ( Marrs , p. 44 ) .
Affiliates of the Skull and Bones fill the rosters of these three , eminently omnipotent alignments ( Goldstein and Steinberg , par . 5 ) . Surprised ?
The American Free Press believes that Bilderberg , unitarily , holds an agreement of ratifying a " world government " controlled by the UN while engaging supremacy over the riches the planet and all social orders .
Although the Bilderberg does not fully support President Bush in his " War on Terrorism , " they are still unified in the decision to create a New World Order ( Tucker , " Bilderberg Batters " par. 24 ) .
Bilderberg is the " crème de la crème , " with financial backing that puts the combined , net incomes of the Trilateral , CFR , and the Bonesmen into a " piggy - bank " sized , child 's toy .
The " unnamed " group derived the title " The Bilderbergers " from Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek , Holland ; the location in which their first , super - secretive meeting was publicly discovered in 1954 ( Marrs , p. 39 ) .
Behind heavily guarded doors of hotel conferences , the usual suspects , H. Kissinger and D. Rockefeller ( two filthy , rich names , that need no further explanations ) play Monopoly , the International , One - Time Edition , with filthy , rich friends , alongside political powers , CFR member , Kenneth S. Dam , US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury , chair of the US Federal Reserve Board , Alan Greenspan , present Secretary of Defense for the US , Donald Rumsfeld , and puppet for American Foreign Affairs , Andrew Parisiliti , assigned to Nebraska native , Senator Chuck Hagel , for advisory purposes .
These corrupt men are a mere tidbit , rubbing shoulders and shaking hands with the Secretary - General of NATO , Scotland 's Lord George Robertson , Spain 's Queen , Sofia ( last name , secret ! ) , Turkey 's representative for Economic and Social Studies Council , Kernal Dervis ( not to be mistaken with a military " Colonel " ) , Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard , Queen of the Netherlands ( three names to balance Sophia 's one ) , Supervisory Board 's chair of Deutsche Bank , Deutschland 's Hilmar Kopper , and banking , political , and random media affiliates of the international elite ( The American Free Press , " Do Names Make News ? " par. 2 , 7 , 15 , 17 , 20 - 2 , 26 , 30 - 1 , 33 - 6 , 43 , and 45 ) .
Founded by David Rockefeller , dominant business partner of the Skull and Bones ( Trunkerton , " New World Order " par. 10 ) , the Trilateral Commission spawned in 1973 ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par . 1 ) . The Commission drew a more tightly knit coop between central " democratic industrialized " regions of the globe with " shared leadership " functions in the larger " international system " ( Ross , " Trilateral " par . 3 ) .
Initially , Rockefeller 's creation was meant to run no longer than three years , but after the triennia ( three year period ) , the success of the group exceeded original intention and repeatedly renewed their engagements until 2006 .
Rockefeller formed the commission due to dissatisfaction over the Vietnam War .
The instant intention destined to bond as one , at a time of considerable static among governments , the loftiest level of maintaining an unofficial group which could possibly look together at key problems facing three areas .
On a deeper level , there was a sense that the US was no longer in the place of a lone leader as the country had been prior to WWII .
In lieu of this , the Trilateral Commission hoped to share leadership responsibilities , forming an alliance with , mainly Europe and Japan , making it necessary to the " successful navigation of the international system " ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par .
2 ) to face " the major challenges of the coming years " ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par . 2 ) .
The Trilateral Commission is composed of three elite groups , or " rings , " that circumference the " bulls eye ; " the " inner , " " center , " and the " outer " ( Ross , " Trilateral " par. 24 ) .
The membership roster names , roughly , 300 " prominent business , political , and intellectual decision - makers of Western Europe , North America , and Japan " ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par . 2 ) .
The outer ring are present merely for show , " camouflage purposes only " ( Ross , " Trilateral " par. 26 ) .
The consistency of the membership derives from , strictly , the Council on Foreign Relations , but the CFR members are knowledgeable to , precisely , half of the schemes involved with the " Global Union movement " ( Ross , " Council " par . 1 ) . American's arm of the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) emerged July 29 , 1921 , headquartered in New York .
John D. Rockefeller , with international banking firm , J.P. Morgan and the original gang who designed the schematics of an oxymoron known as " The Federal Reserve " ( which , in fact , is not owned or operated by the federal government ! ) , inducted this evil into society ( Blase , par. 20 ) .
During the most recent convictions , involved in the current triennium , the two driving factors behind the purpose of this group are to : " help countries fulfill shared leadership responsibilities " ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par .
2 ) in the larger global structure and " widen the framework " ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par .
3 ) to sustain generalizations across the planet ( Trilateral Commission , " About " par .
4 ) , but their purpose states : " Close Trilateral cooperation in keeping peace , in managing the world economy , in fostering economic redevelopment , and alleviating world poverty will improve the chances of a smooth , and peaceful evolution in the global system " ( Ross , " Trilateral " par . 7 ) .
No one speaks on the behalf of others , but this sounds a bit fishy ; perhaps , a plot that is along the lines of promoting the New World Order ?
By working collectively with the Bilderberg and Council on Foreign Relations , the trio of powerful guilds plot to divide the world into three districts , under one currency and one government , where the US military would be the domineering law enforcement .
April 5 - 8 , 2002 , the Trilateral Commission held a conference at the Ritz Carlton in Washington DC .
Among the participants were big names such as , David Rockefeller , representing Chase Manhattan Bank , Madeleine K. Albright , former secretary of state , C. Fred Bergsten , former assistant secretary of the treasury , Geoffrey T. Boisi , vice chairman , JP Morgan Chase ( Skull and Bones based corporation ) , Richard N. Cooper , former under secretary of state , John M. Deutch , former director , Central Intelligence Agency , General Lord Guthrie , director , NM Rothschild & Sons ( Rothschild , a dominant family name in the history of the Order of the Skull and Bones ) , Trinidad Jimenez , Socialist Party , Madrid ( why on earth would a member of the Socialist Party be invited to a convention with , supposedly , democracy - based roots ? ) , Henry A. Kissinger , former secretary of state ( yet another favorite man of the Order ) , Kenneth L. Lay , former CEO , Enron Corporation , and several other strong holds in the oil , banking , and finance industries , as well as educators from the top universities ( Tucker and Bollyn , " Bilderberg Convenes " par. 1 ) .
Quite an interesting sample from the overall list considering the nature of the organization in relation to the Order of the Skull and Bones !
George W. , Sr. , in fact , was a member of the Trilateral Commission , but withdrew from membership before assuming responsibilities with the Reagan campaign ( Trunkerton , " New World Order " par . 9 ) .
The Bushes are not in alliance with the US , in contrast , the family and the Order are sworn to silence with the Bilderberg , the Council on Foreign Relations , and the Trilateral Commission ; all three leagues interested in one goal , the goal of the New World Order .
This has been a Skull and Bones project since Order was put into effect by William Huntington Russell in December 1832 .
The positions on Capital Hill are irrelevant to the citizens of this country .
Throughout history , esteemed Bonesmen can be traced in their memberships to these , three groups ( Trunkerton , " New World Order " par . 3 ) . Despite which party seizes control over Washington DC , one fact remains , the crucial morals are at the whim of the Council on Foreign Relations .
Senator Kerry is an exercised constituent of the CFR .
Former members of the CFR include vice - president Cheney and Franklin Roosevelt ( Blase , par. 58 -9 ) .
Beneath the facade of the government " for , by , and of the people , " slinks a sinister slew of skeletons .
" The real rulers in Washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes , " warns Justice of the Supreme Court , Felix Frankfurter ( 1939 - 62 ) .
President Roosevelt wrote , " The real truth of the matter is , as you and I know , that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson , " February 23 , 1954 ( Blase , par . 9 ) .
A clip from a Senator William Jenner speech : " Outwardly , we have a Constitutional government .
We have operating within our government , a bureaucratic elite which believes our Constitution is outmoded " ( Blase , par. 10 ) .
Historical scandal writes a sinister , hypocritical plot , composed by the hands of rebellious Europeans and the global underground subculture .
The Order of the Skull and Bones ' record mirrors an incubator and assembly point for " rising generational elites " ( Korff , par . 1 ) .
Considering the history , one cannot be appalled that society conspires upon a baffling labyrinth of affluent capitalism and wary schemes .
To reveal allegations of ominous ties connecting the CIA , Trilateral Commission , Illuminati , Council on Foreign Relations , Bilderberg , and even the Nazis , one does not have to penetrate far below the surface .
The Bonesmen take an oath of silence at initiation , yet none will publicly deny or confirm the stories ; however , the fact they seem to go out of their way to decline interviews with the press raises questions .
Not all Patriarchs lock their jaws about a secret society whose secrets appear fundamentally trifling .
Millegan says , " The longer you look at this thing , the more you start to think ' can this actually be true , ' because the reality of why this group exists is staggering ...
It 's the ultimate system of networking to get what you want " ( Korff , par . 5 - 6 ) .
An " Anonymous Yale Student , " 1873 , quoted in the preface of Sutton 's America 's Secret Establishment : An Introduction to the Order of the Skull and Bones : " We offer no objections to their existing clan .
No one disputes with them this right ; we question but the plan on which they act , — that he who wears upon his breast their emblem , he for every post shall be considered best " ( Sutton , p. vii ) .

It includes most of the features and functionality of TurboTax ’s paid options , including a best / fastest refund guarantee , support via live chat , W - 2 importing , and your choice of e-filing or print - and - mail filing .

TurboTax ’s free edition is n’t appropriate for complex tax situations .
If you have significant interest or capital gains income , rental property income , or business income , or qualify for certain common tax credits ( such as the Student Loan Interest Deduction ) , you ’ll need to upgrade to a paid plan .
Moreover , customer support for anything but technical issues is more limited at this price point .
If you want to pay your tax prep fees with your federal refund , you must pay a hefty refund payment processing fee .
The good news : TurboTax has several plans at multiple price points .

TaxSlayer ‘s free file option plan has no residency or citizenship restrictions .
Federal filing is free for filers who earn less than $ 100,000 ( AGI ) .
One state return is included ; additional state returns are available for $ 29 apiece .
TaxSlayer ’s Free File Federal has some key downsides , however .
Once built to support tax situations across the complexity spectrum , the Simply Free plan is now for the simplest situations only .
Common situations that are n’t covered by the Simply Free plan include :
Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC )
Itemized deductions
Self - employment income
Stock sales
Rental property income
Plus , you ca n’t take advantage of TaxSlayer ’s audit assistance services or use the website ’s live chat feature .
And though phone support is available from TaxSlayer ’s nonprofessional customer service team , TaxSlayer pushes higher - paying clients – those using the Premium and Self - Employed editions – to the front of the line when they call .
So if you call at a busy time , plan to get comfortable .

Credit Karma
Tax has one plan , and it ’s totally free for all filers .
It does n’t get better than that .
There are some devils in the details .
Unlike larger competitors , Credit Karma
Tax has no expert support to speak of , so it ’s not a great choice if the complexity of your tax situation exceeds your familiarity with tax law .
And the platform does have some functionality gaps that may impact filers with unusual tax situations ( for instance , those who earned income from foreign sources ) .
On the bright side , Credit Karma
Tax boasts free state returns , pre-filled forms for existing Credit Karma members ( saving time during intake ) , and 24/7 customer support .
Like the rest of Credit Karma , the tax prep interface is colorful and mobile - friendly .

TaxAct‘s Free Edition is a user - friendly platform that ’s appropriate for simple situations ( Form 1040 EZ and 1040A ) .
If you ’re filing through the Free File Alliance , you need to meet one of the following qualifications :
AGI under $ 55,000 and younger than age 56
Qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit
AGI under $ 66,000 and active military
These qualification requirements are subject to change , so check with TaxAct before completing your return .
TaxAct ’s free version was once quite expansive , appropriate for virtually any tax situation .
That ’s no longer the case .
If you want to itemize deductions or report passive income from stock sales or rental properties , you ’ll need to upgrade to a paid plan .
On the bright side , TaxAct ’s free version waives filing fees on state returns , so it ’s truly a nothing - out - of - pocket deal , though paying your federal filing fees with your refund will set you back a few bucks .

Though it ’s not as well - known , FreeTaxUSA offers free federal tax filing for tax situations of all complexity levels .
Known as Totally Free , it supports all major forms and schedules , as well as useful features like prior - year return importing and storage .
FreeTaxUSA also offers free live support from customer service professionals , though its roster of tax professionals does n’t measure up to bigger competitors like TurboTax and H&R Block .
FreeTaxUSA is available to filers across the United States , though state returns cost $ 12.95 each .
FreeTaxUSA has some noteworthy drawbacks , including a lack of audit assistance ( which , with the Deluxe version , includes help interpreting IRS notices , drafting responses , and preparing the documents necessary to navigate your audit ) .
It ’s also not very mobile - friendly , making it a poor choice for filers utilizing tablets or smartphones .

7. Free File Fillable Forms
If your AGI is more than $ 69,000 and you do n’t mind taking the DIY tax - filing route , you can still take advantage of an IRS - administered free electronic filing system .
The IRS makes its entire database of tax forms and schedules available in PDF format at FreeFileFillableForms.com .
To complete your tax return , fill out the appropriate forms through the online system and submit them through the IRS ’s e-filing system .
You ’ll receive your refund ( if eligible ) on the same schedule as you would with a branded online tax preparation service .
With Free File Fillable Forms , your work is automatically saved as you go , so you do n’t need to fill out your entire return in one sitting .
And regardless of how complex your tax situation is , you can find the forms and schedules necessary to complete your tax return here , subject to some limitations outlined by the IRS .
There are n’t any income , age , citizenship status , or other eligibility restrictions for Free File Fillable Forms .
Free File Fillable
Forms might sound like the ultimate free filing option , but there ’s a major catch :
The IRS provides no support whatsoever for taxpayers who opt to use this resource .
In other words , you have to know how to fill out each form and schedule on your own , or at least be confident enough to navigate the IRS ’s library of tax preparation resources to find out how .
If you have a straightforward tax situation and have prepared your taxes on your own in the past , this might not be an impossible bar to clear .
If your situation is more complicated or you ’re just not comfortable with the idea of preparing your tax return unaided , Free File Fillable Forms is n’t a great option .
Even a seemingly trivial preparation error could lead the IRS to reject your return and ask you to re-file , delaying your return in the process .
In the worse case , you could be flagged for an audit .
And note that functionality is severely constrained here – you ca n’t import prior - year returns , for example .
IRS Free File Alliance
The above are n’t the only free tax prep options for low - to moderate - income filers .
If your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) was less than $ 69,000 last year and you have a relatively straightforward tax situation , you may be eligible to file your taxes for free through an IRS Free File Alliance provider .
The Free File Alliance is a listing service offering direct access to about a dozen free filing services from a consortium of participating tax preparation companies , all of which have to meet strict quality and security standards set by the IRS .
According to the Free File Alliance , roughly 70 % of the U.S. taxpaying population is eligible for free filing , and tens of millions of returns have been filed since the Alliance ’s inception in the early 2000s .
Use the Free File Alliance Lookup
Tool to find options that apply to your specific tax situation .
Who Participates in the Free File Alliance ?
Free File Alliance participants include well - known online and offline tax preparation firms , including Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block , as well as lesser - known options like Online Taxes at OLT.com and ezTaxReturn.com .
Aside from the $ 66,000 AGI cap , each participating company has specific eligibility criteria .
Some things to keep in mind regarding Free File Alliance eligibility and access :
Accessing Free File Platforms .
To qualify for a free return with any of the participating companies , you need to access their filing platform through the Free File website .
It ’s like an affiliate promotion – you do n’t get the deal unless you click the affiliate link on the partner site .

Tax Situation Complexity .
Some Free File Alliance companies only offer free filing to people with simple tax situations .
If you ’re an independent contractor , business owner , investor , or have a complicated situation for other reasons , you may still need to pay a filing fee .
Therefore , it ’s important to evaluate your options carefully and choose from those that offer free preparation for people who need to file Schedules C , D , E , or other forms common to complex tax situations .

Filer Location .
Some Free File Alliance companies decline to serve filers in certain states .

Before you sign up for a service , make sure it ’s available in your area .

Functionality may vary from program to program .
For instance , some limit whether you can import prior - year returns and forms into your current - year tax return .
Others have limited customer support resources .
It ’s best to read the fine print on each service ’s features before making a choice .
State Free File Programs
The IRS also maintains links with about two dozen state - level Free File programs ( indicated in deep blue on the map below ) , which also leverage relationships with name - brand tax filing services that meet states ’ security and quality criteria .
As with the federal Free File program , filer eligibility requirements may vary by company and state .
Final Word
I do n’t know many people who love filing their taxes , even if they ’re reasonably confident that they ’ll get a juicy refund .
Filing taxes takes time and effort , and even the best software programs can’t totally protect you against mistakes .
Filing for free ca n’t make up for the inconvenience , but at least it keeps more of your money where it belongs : in your wallet .
Still , free filing options are n’t for everyone .
If you have a complicated tax situation – particularly if you ’re self - employed , own a business , or have investment income from multiple sources – it ’s likely not worth the small upfront savings .
A mistake could easily offset the money you saved on your return .
And you might set yourself up for a stressful , potentially costly IRS audit .
There ’s no shame in opting for a paid plan or even hiring a certified public accountant who can provide hands - on attention .
If you do choose to hire a CPA , our top choice would be Circle CPA .
Their CPAs provide quality tax prep service with a pay - what - you - want model .

We all want to live well and no one wants their living standard to decline .
That makes sense , right ?
It 's just the way we are made .
What does not make any sense is the strange article of faith that has descended over Washington , DC , that says that no prices must ever be permitted to decline due to recessionary pressures .
All resources in the national treasury , every conceivable monetary manipulation , all efforts of every regulatory body must be marshaled toward the great national goal of re-pumping the economy , which must never ever be permitted to fall even a tiny bit .
Welcome to the War on Recession , which is being pursued with the same vehemence and folly as the War on Terror , and will likely prove just as spectacularly destructive of its own aims as well as liberty itself .
Maybe we need songs , banners , and little ribbon pins too .
Let 's think about the big picture .
The economy was overinflated due to reckless monetary policy and government agencies treating critical sectors such as housing as a democratic right and thereby too big to fail .
The trend dates back decades but the bubble became insanely large only within the last 5 – 10 years .
Something had to give .
And it turns out that this was just the beginning .
All sectors were puffed up and inflated .
Can we agree that there was a problem — that not all was well , despite appearances ?
I think we can .
So what do we do in this case ?
There has to be a downward correction , but there 's no reason to panic .
A good correction is just what a recovery needs to get going .
Such is the nature of the Fed - created business cycle .
So what could it possibly mean to claim that the economy must never be allowed to fall into recession ?
I 'm thinking here of similar claims :
" That drunk is sobering up .
Quick , give him a shot of tequila ! "
" That druggie is coming out of his acid trip .
Get the syringe ! "
" Do n't look now but that insomniac is going to sleep .
Someone wake him ! "
Now , it 's fair to say that the person hollering out the solution to each of the above scenarios does n't really understand the nature of the problem .
So it is with the Fed .
It sees stocks falling , credit markets under pressure , unemployment rising , investment falling .
But rather than conclude that all these factors represent a bubble , it has the opposite response : keep the bubble inflated at all costs !
It 's time that we question the very foundations of this war on recession .
The recession is a regrettable but inevitable backlash against a boom that was not justified by the fundamentals .
That last phrase is the critical thing .
I am not saying that the recession is the price we pay for economic growth .
Boom times are fabulous times , provided that they are rooted in sound fundamentals .
And what are those ?
Essentially it is this : the timeframe of investment must match the timeframe of society at large .
If people are long - term oriented and saving money , resources become available for investment in the future .
When production is completed , there are consumers to buy .
But if no one is saving money and there is no sound store of capital , there are no resources to invest — unless , of course , the Fed creates that money .
The money the Fed creates is wholly illusory , a fiction of investors ' imaginations .
It will vanish when the economy wakes up to reality .
This is an example of investment unjustified by fundamentals .
What to do in that case ?
There must be a correction .
There is nothing the Fed or the Congress can do about it .
They certainly should n't attempt to prevent it .
To attempt to prevent the correction is like turning into the skid : it only makes it worse .
All this nonsense about digging ourselves out of recession through government intervention began with the New Deal .
Before then , government did n't do much at all about the downside of the business cycle .
And guess what ?
Recessions were short and less than lethal for economic health .
Indeed , they were the essential foundations of future recovery .
All that changed with FDR , who used the economic downturn as the great excuse to make himself the economic führer of America .
But here is the amazing fact : not once has this strategy worked .
Not in the New Deal .
Not in the 1970s .
Not in the 1980s .
Not in the 1990s .
Not once has government done anything to restore prosperity during a slump .
What happens again and again is that government spends , the Fed inflates , the regulators punish , there is wailing and gnashing of teeth , and then , at some point , we hit bottom , and normalcy begins to return again .
The most government can do is prolong the period at the bottom .
Otherwise , it is just wasting resources .
Take a look at Murray Rothbard 's book The Panic of 1819 .
Here we have America 's first big financial panic .
The public was going nuts demanding answers .
Congressmen proposed this and that .
Debates raged in the papers .
But government ultimately took no action at all .
Sure enough , the panic went away on its own .
So it was in 1920 and 1921 .
The government did n't intervene and voila normalcy returned .
Here 's another strange thing about this antirecession mania : for years we 've been hearing from the environmentalists that we need to live more simply , do without , cut back , drive bikes not cars , and generally lower our standard of living and look after the well being of plants and lizards and things .
It turns out that Americans do n't really go for this message .
A slight downtick in the price of the house causes hysteria .
So as we look forward to the recession there is at least this one silver lining .
The environmentalists wo n't get very far with their message that we should embrace poverty and call it our own .
PHYS771 Quantum Computing Since Democritus
University of Waterloo , Fall 2006
Tuesdays and Thursdays , 1:00 - 2:30 pm
BFG Building , 2nd floor seminar room ( BFG2125 )
Instructor : Scott Aaronson
3141 Davis Centre
Email : scott at scottaaronson dot com
Office hours :
After class or by appointment
Description :
This course tries to connect quantum computing to the wider intellectual world .
We 'll start out with various scientific , mathematical , or philosophical problems that predate quantum computing : for example , the measurement problem , P versus NP , the existence of secure cryptography , the Humean problem of induction , or the possibility of closed timelike curves .
We 'll then examine in what ways , if any , quantum computing affects how we should think about the problem .
To keep things grounded , each session will end with a concrete puzzle that students will be expected to have thought about ( if not solved ) by the next session .
The class format will strongly encourage participation , discussion , and debate .
Prerequisites : Mathematical maturity and some previous exposure to quantum computing .
Responsibilities :
The main one is to scribe one or two sessions ; we might experiment with using audio recordings to help with this .
Besides that , students are expected to
show up , actively participate in discussion , work on the puzzles , do the readings ( which will generally be light ) , and turn in one or two problem sets ( having either solved the problems or else explained why they could n't solve them ) .
Quantum Computing Since Democritus Book Is Now Available !
All students [ at Yale Law School ] are required to take courses in contracts and in torts , and they 're randomly assigned to an instructor for each class .
Some of these teachers have Ph.D.s in economics , some in philosophy and other humanities , and some have no strong disciplinary allegiances at all .
Professors are encouraged to design their courses as they see fit .
Instructors from economics may emphasize the role of contracts in making possible the efficiency gains of the marketplace , while philosophers may emphasize equal outcomes for contracting parties .
So economists teach about efficiency and philosophers teach about equality .
To figure out whether this affected their young charges , we put 70 Yale Law students in a computer lab , and had them play a game that would reveal to us their views on fairness ....
It turns out that exposure to economics makes a big difference in how students split the pie , in terms of both efficiency and outright selfishness .
Students assigned to classes taught by economists were more likely to give a lot when it was cheap to do so .
But they were also much more likely to take the whole pie for themselves .
In an effort to soothe jangled nerves , the firm sent an e-mail message to employees Monday assuring them that Bear was still in business and that they would get their salaries  cold comfort to bankers who receive upward of 90 percent of their compensation in a year - end bonus .

Bear also told employees that grief counselors were standing by .
“ The stability of your world is shattered , ” said Ari Kiev , a psychiatrist who counsels financial executives .
“ You are angry at the firm for failing you .
But it ’s more than money .
It ’s the shame and embarrassment .
Now the question is , can you pay for the house and do you give up the second car ? ”
To be sure , there have been some Bear stock sales .
Mr. Cayne ’s predecessor , Alan Greenberg , has sold over $ 50 million worth of shares since early 2007 , and Jeffrey Mayer , a top fixed income executive , sold $ 9 million in stock last December for $ 89 a share .
Mr. Schwartz sold $ 6 million at the same time .
But for the most part , Bear executives were not big stock sellers , and their shrunken net worth has spread a viral resentment throughout the firm as employees of all ranks contemplate their reduced circumstances and search for scapegoats .
In the hallways at Bear , there were many to blame : James Dimon , chief executive at JPMorgan , whose stock rose 10 percent as the market cheered him for getting such a bargain ; the Federal Reserve of New York for pushing hard for a deal ; Warren J. Spector , the former co-president who was responsible for the two hedge funds that collapsed last summer ; and finally Mr. Cayne and Mr. Schwartz , for not having brought additional capital into the firm last year .
Mr. Cayne and Mr. Schwartz declined to comment .
People who have spoken to Mr. Cayne say he is stunned by the abrupt demise of the firm , where he has worked since the late 1960s .
Now chairman , he was not an active participant in the negotiations over the weekend but he did come into the office , cigar in mouth as always .
As for Mr. Schwartz , he has told people at Bear that the offer for $ 2 a share was the best available deal that he could make that would please all the firm ’s constituencies .
This comic quite literally came to me in a fever dream this morning .
My apologies if it makes very little sense .
See you tomorrow .

When the NY Times called Ron Paul a “ Nazi , ” in a smear typical of the newspaper that printed press releases for Josef Stalin , LRC blew the whistle , and mobilizing the Ron Paul movement , forced the newspaper to retract .
Has that ever happened before ?
When Tim Russert on Meet the Press slammed Ron in a nasty attack - interview , we helped get the truth out , and made sure Tim and NBC heard about our concerns .
When Glen Beck said that Ron Paul supporters were potential “ domestic terrorists , ” LRC helped make sure his sponsors knew our outrage .
Next thing you knew , Glenn was hosting Ron for an hour interview that was , by Beckian standards , pretty darn fair .
This is the 21st century , and 18th - century technology like newspapers , and 20th - century technology like television , better get used to the Internet .
LRC and the Ron Paul Revolution are holding them all to account .
Indeed , LRC has more readers than at any time in our eight - year history .
We have greater influence than ever before .
Yet we are in danger of being put out of business .
The trouble began almost a year ago .
LRC had become Ron Paul Central , and the lawyers urgently told us to cut down drastically on the amount and favorability of our Ron Paul coverage , since we were allied with the tax - exempt Center for Libertarian Studies .
So we did the only thing possible :
We seceded from CLS .
We knew that when donors lost tax - exemption for their gifts , it would endanger the future of LRC .
But frankly , this worry had to come second to the essential role LRC was called to play in the most exciting , hopeful movement in our lifetimes .
After all , it was Lew who was asked to announce Ron ’s decision to the world in LRC , and we knew then that this would be THE great opportunity for libertarian ideas .
Like you , we love and admire Ron Paul .
I chaired his 1988 run for the presidency ; Lew has been his friend for more than 30 years , and was his congressional chief of staff before starting the Mises Institute .
When Ron wanted someone to introduce his new books on foreign policy and economics to the world , Lew was his choice .
Of course , the Ron Paul Revolution has exceeded even our hopes .
Ron has done more to spread the ideas of peace , liberty , and hard money than anyone ever .
Combine that with 1 ) his personal integrity , principles , and obvious honesty and goodness ; 2 ) the magnificent potential of the internet , including LRC ; 3 ) the lives and work of great libertarian intellectuals like Murray Rothbard ; 4 ) the war crimes and economic disasters of Cheney - Bush - Greenspan ; and 5 ) the masses of young people and other Americans desperate for a change , and : Wow !
All we have worked for all our lives , is coming true before our eyes .
Yet this could also be our last , best hope against the empire , the Fed , and the neocons .
Were we to sit back ?
Ignore ?
Be apathetic ?
Never .
The stakes are too high .
I am so proud of Lew and the role LRC has played in our movement .
Since 1999 , we ’ve taught millions of young people in this country and around the world about the ideals of personal liberty , free markets , peace , private property , and the gold standard .
Ron once named LRC the “ Top Freedom Site on the Web . ”
It ’s his home page on his own computer .
And the Ron Paul Revolutionaries feel the same .
LRC has long been the most trafficked libertarian site .
But we ’re growing really fast now .
Just last month , we had more than 1.8 million visits !
A Houston consultant , looking at Google Analytics and all the readership - rating sites , tells us that LRC is among the top 10 political sites in the world .
Indeed , we are virtually tied with such sites as the huge and viciously anti-Paul " Daily Kos , " which has employees upon employees .
At LRC it ’s Lew ’s nights and weekends , and a bleary - eyed Webmaster .
Lew really needs an assistant or two .
We must do more advertising and outreach on the Web .
It ’s Lew ’s dream to be able to assign libertarian investigative reporters , to expose the opposition , and sponsor large Internet publishing projects on our ideas and a Ron Paul Administration .
There is demand for an LRC magazine as well .
But forget all that .
Right now I just want to keep the wolf from the door .
Most important , we cannot let Ron and our ideas down .
We have to stand with Ron , no matter what the smears and attacks .
It has fallen upon LRC to rebut the hate brigade .
And its venom increases minute by minute .
Why ?
Ron has lit an unprecedented prairie fire for liberty , with his peaceful revolution ( and do n’t you love the highlighting of the word “ love ” in revolution ? ) .
We must do our part .
It is up to us to teach the Austrian economics upheld by Ron , and the real truths of American history — about Lincoln , Wilson , Roosevelt , and the rest .
I have never been so optimistic in my life .
Ron has rocked the Fed , the military - industrial complex , the spenders , the taxers , the neocons , every bad guy in our national life .
And when I meet a young person on fire about Ron and our ideas , I know that chances are , Lew has played a role in his or her development .
As I indicated above , the attacks mount .
David Horowitz calls us “ Islamofascist . ”
David Frum says Lew is “ unpatriotic . ”
Newt Gingrich denounced him for criticizing FDR ( the neocons ’ favorite after Lincoln ) .
And Bill Kristol ’s father Irving — the so - called godfather of neoconservatism — once warned Lew against starting the Mises Institute .
Imagine what he ’d say about LRC !
But as you might expect , Lew has a track record of not obeying neocon orders .
Indeed , we were anti-neocon before it was cool .
And did you know , by the way , that we helped make “ neocon ” a well - known pejorative term ?
Though they adopted the name for themselves , the neocons now call anyone else ’s use of it “ bigotry ” !
Sure , fellas .
Gosh , I ’d hate to see these birds toasting each other at LRC ’s funeral .
But they ’ll do it unless you help .
And look , LRC is Internet Central for the Ron Paul Revolution .
Our blog is checked many times a day by me and everyone else following Ron ( and even looked at by the Man himself ) .
We are growing and growing in readership .
It ’s inconceivable that we should go out of business while our outreach and influence are increasing at such an amazing pace .
If we can stay in existence , there is no telling where we will be in one , three , six months , and how much more good we ’ll be able to do .
Look , I am careful not to ask you for money too often .
But I really need your help now for LRC to keep going and growing ; indeed , I need your help for us to stay in existence , even though your contribution will NOT be tax - deductible .
For libertarianism , for peace , for freedom , for the Ron Paul movement , LRC is indispensable .
And the thought of putting another smirk on the face of Horowitz or Gingrich is sickening .
Sure , I ’m biased , but I think LewRockwell.com is indispensable .
This is our time .
This is our moment .
Please help us keep the cause of freedom growing on freedom ’s medium , the Internet .
We can win .
But we ca n’t play our central role if we are off the air .
In this , the great crisis and opportunity of the new century , LRC ’s voice must not be stilled .
You can help make sure it is n’t .

Dems Shy Away from Iraq Money Fight Despite posing some tougher - than - usual questions at hearings on George W. Bush ’s open - ended Iraq
War strategy , congressional Democrats have signaled they will give the President $ 100 billion more in war spending without insisting on timetables for bringing U.S. troops home .

Printer friendly Democratic leaders , who vowed in 2006 and 2007 to deny Bush any more “ blank checks ” for the war , now concede that a new supplemental war appropriation bill will almost surely pass without any meaningful constraints on Bush ’s war policies .
Rather than challenge Bush over that funding , Democratic leaders fired off a letter asking Bush to reconsider his approach .
“ The current Iraq strategy has no discernible end in sight and requires the United States to spend additional hundreds of billions of dollars despite urgent national needs in education , health care , and infrastructure improvement , and when high oil prices have provided the Iraqi government with billions in additional revenue that could pay for their own redevelopment and security , " says the letter , signed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois .
“ This strategy is neither sustainable nor in our broader national security or economic interest , ” the Democratic leaders said .
“ We are deeply concerned that you and the congressional Republican leadership are intent on staying the current course throughout your administration and then handing the Iraq war off to future presidents . ”
Not surprisingly , Bush did not respond to the letter .
However , his two top officials in Iraq – Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker – made clear in testimony to the House and Senate this week that Bush has no intention of changing course .
Petraeus said he would recommend to Bush that the post - surge troop drawdown stop with about 140,000 U.S. soldiers still in Iraq .
That means the American troop levels will be about 8,000 higher than the 132,000 U.S. troops in Iraq in early 2007 when the “ surge ” began .
Both Bush and congressional Democrats appear to be pushing the Iraq War issue off until after the November elections .
While Bush hopes Sen. John McCain will win the presidency and keep the war going , Democrats are counting on winning larger majorities in the House and Senate and putting a Democrat in the White House who then will move to end the war .
' Power of the Purse ' Still , if Democratic lawmakers were serious about changing the direction of U.S. military operations in Iraq now , they have several legislative options at their disposal , according to a recent 52 - page report from the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) , the investigative arm of Congress .
The report , “ Congressional Authority to Limit U.S. Military Operations in Iraq , ” says that “ Congress ’s ability to deny funds for the continuation of military hostilities is not contingent upon the enactment of a positive law , though such a denial may take the form of a positive enactment . ”
In other words , Congress can compel an end to a conflict simply by refusing to appropriate money for it .
That approach would circumvent the threat of a presidential veto , which requires two - thirds majorities to override .
“ Although the President has the power to veto legislative proposals , he cannot compel Congress to pass legislation , including bills to appropriate funds necessary for the continuation of a military conflict , ” the report says .
The report notes that “ a simple majority of a single House could prevent the appropriation of funds necessary for the continuation of a military conflict , ” but it suggests that legislation might be needed to prevent the President from shifting funds from other operations .
( Theoretically , Bush ’s Iraq War funding could even be stopped by a Democratic filibuster in the Senate , which would require only 41 of the 100 senators to block a new appropriations bill . )
However , with the presidential campaign in full swing and with bitter memories of “ soft on national security ” taunts , Democratic leaders are unwilling to confront Bush on war funding .
Still , the CRS report is a reminder that Congress has the authority to contest Bush ’s assertions that his commander - in - chief powers allow him to do almost whatever he wants when it comes to fighting wars .
“ There has been some suggestion in the past that the President ’s responsibility to provide for troops in the field justifies further deployments without prior authorization from Congress , with some arguing that the President has an independent implied spending power to carry out these responsibilities , ” says the CRS report .
“ These arguments do not easily square with Congress ’s established prerogative to limit the scope of wars through its war powers , and do not conform with Congress ’s absolute authority to appropriate funds . ”
The CRS report , issued last Feb. 28 , continues : “ At least two arguments support the constitutionality of Congress ’s authority to limit the President ’s ability to increase or maintain troop levels in Iraq .
“ First , Congress ’s constitutional power over the nation ’s armed forces provides ample authority to legislate with respect to how they may be employed .
Secondly , Congress has virtually plenary constitutional power over appropriations .
“ Article I provides that ‘ No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . ’
It is well established , as a consequence of these provisions , that ‘ no money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress ’ and that Congress can specify the terms and conditions under which an appropriation may be used . ”
In past wars , Congress has succeeded in forcing an administration to change its military strategy by using the “ power of the purse , ” the CRS report says .
“ In cases of significant differences with the President over foreign policy , especially deployments of U.S. military forces abroad , Congress has generally found that use of its constitutionally - based ‘ power of the purse ’ to be the most effective way to compel a President to take actions regarding use of U.S. military force overseas that he otherwise might not agree to . "
CRS notes that historically Congress has imposed limits on presidential war - making powers through legislative constraints : " Two well - known proposals – the McGovern - Hatfield amendment and the Cooper - Church amendments – were also part of this jockeying between the administration and Congress .
“ The first prohibited expenditure of previously appropriated funds after a specified date ‘ in or over Indochina , ’ except for the purpose of withdrawing troops or for protection of U.S. troops during the withdrawal , while the second prohibited the expenditure of any funds after July 1 , 1970 , to retain troops in Cambodia unless specifically authorized by law …
“ Overall , funding restrictions have generally proven more effective than the War Powers Act , which has been challenged by the Executive Branch on constitutional grounds . "
Timid Democrats
But key Democrats , such as Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , have ruled out an Iraq War showdown with Bush if it involves a possible cutoff of war funding .
Levin has insisted that the only acceptable course for Congress ending the war is through legislation that sets a timetable for troop withdrawals .
However , that approach can be blocked by a Republican filibuster or Bush can veto the bill , as happened in 2007 .
Once a timetable bill is stopped by a filibuster or vetoed ( with the Democrats lacking the votes for an override ) , the Levin strategy leaves no alternative but to surrender and give Bush the war funding he demands without strings .
That was the end result of legislative battles in 2007 .
In a conference call with reporters last Friday , Levin indicated that he expects a similar result this time .
" I expect most of our troops to still be there " until at least the end of the year , Levin said .
" Until there 's either a big enough majority in the Senate or a change in the president 's ( strategy ) , I do n't see a significant improvement " in the situation in Iraq .

Forget about Hamas , the wall , Gaza and the occupied territories .
There can be no peace in the Middle East until Israel and the Palestinians deal with one key issue : the Palestinian demand that Israel recognize their right of return .
That demand is based on the Arab charge that the Zionist state created the refugee problem in the war of 1948 - 49 by a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing .
It ’s an accusation that Israel ’s leaders have consistently rejected .
Jewish soldiers could never commit such crimes .
It was the Arabs themselves , they say , who created the refugees .
It has become increasingly evident , however , that the Israeli position is , in fact , a self - serving myth created when the Jewish state was born , perpetuated ever since by the country ’s leaders and still blandly accepted by Washington .
The myth goes like this :
In 1948 , when the Arabs attacked the newly declared state of Israel , the Arab population fled by the hundreds of thousands .
They left not because of attacks by Israeli soldiers but because of the calls of their own Arab leaders , who guaranteed them a speedy return once the Arab armies had triumphed over the upstart Jewish state .
Indeed , they fled despite the attempts of many Israelis — as was movingly portrayed in the film “ Exodus ” — to convince their Palestinian neighbors to remain .
Why should such treacherous people have the right to return ?
Not to mention the fact that their return by the millions would spell the end of Israel as a Jewish state .
This is the story that Israel ’s leaders and Jews throughout the Diaspora have clung to for more than half a century .
But since the early 1990s a new generation of Israeli historians and investigative journalists — drawing on formerly classified documents as well as recollections of Israeli leaders of the War of Independence — has demolished the traditional Israeli position .
According to their research , the Palestinians fled their villages not in response to a call from Arab leaders but because of a concerted campaign of terror — including massacres and rape — perpetrated by military units of the newly declared Israeli state .
As Gideon Levy , a leading columnist from Haaretz , put it , “ 1948 was Israel ’s finest hour , the culmination of a mad dream : the formation of an independent Jewish state . ”
At the same time he declared , “ it was our darkest hour , in which we committed war crimes on a large scale .
And did so in all good conscience . ”
The key point , often overlooked , is that in 1948 ,
Resolution 181 of the U.N. General Assembly did n’t just call for the creation of the single state of Israel from the British mandate of Palestine .
In fact , it recommended dividing Palestine into two separate countries — one predominately Arab , the other Jewish — to be joined by an economic union .
According to Sylvain Cypel , a leading correspondent for Le Monde , the full version of that U.N. resolution was never published in its entirety in Hebrew .
The reason for that may be simple .
From the beginning Israel ’s future leaders were determined that the Jewish state , carved out of the British mandate , would be just a first step toward the eventual takeover of all the land of Palestine .
As David Ben Gurion , who would become Israel ’s first prime minister , confided to Labor Party members in 1941 , “ As soon as we gain power , once our state is established we ’ll annul [ the partition ] and will spread out over all the territory of Israel . ”
There was , however , an obvious demographic hitch to such ambitions .
If the Palestinians were allowed to remain on their lands , their numbers would overwhelm the Jews — the Jewish state would be stillborn .
In fact , according to
Benny Morris , one of the first of the new Israeli historians , European Zionist leaders had secretly discussed plans for transferring the Arab population out of Palestine as far back as 1937 in Zurich .
They had few illusions that the relocation of up to 500,000 Arabs could be peacefully achieved .
“ It is hard to imagine a transfer without recourse to force , ” Ben Gurion later wrote in 1941 .
Such blunt talk was for internal use only .
Outwardly , a different myth was already being prepared .
“ They lied , oh , how they lied , ” thundered Gideon Levy .
“ The Arabs were always the bad guys , and we were the just , absolute , and sole victims .
That ’s what we ’ve been told . ”
Indeed , after thoroughly researching Israeli archives , Morris found that not only was there no evidence that Arab leaders had called upon their people to flee in 1948 - 49 , but that records revealed exactly the opposite : “ In no case did a Palestinian population abandon its homes before an attack . ”
To the contrary , Israeli intelligence services had actually intercepted calls from Arab leaders asking Palestinians either to remain in their homes or to return if they had already fled .
Morris and other Israeli historians concluded that the Palestinians ’ flight was — as the Arabs had long claimed — the result of a purposeful policy of Israeli forces , whose communiqués at the time spoke openly of “ cleansing ” or “ purifying ” the conquered Arab villages .
According to Gen. Yigal Allon , in May 12 , 1948 , as his men approached each Arab town , they tossed in tracts with the message in Arabic , “ if you do n’t flee immediately , you will all be slaughtered , your daughters will be raped . ”
Those were not empty threats .
“ The reality , ” writes Cypel in his newly published book ,
“ Walled , ” “ is that the expulsion was desired , coordinated , and accomplished by systematic atrocities against , and killing of , civilians , with town properties razed on order ( at first on a very unequal fashion from one area to another ) , and that nearly half of this expulsion was carried out even before the Arab states attacked Israel . ”
Another Israeli historian , Gail Ehrlich , concluded that a dozen massacres of more than 50 victims each were committed during Israel ’s War of Independence , apart from about 100 killings of smaller groups and individuals .
He described a “ conspiracy of silence ” surrounding those massacres , which were carried out by elite Israel troops and continued even after the creation of the state of Israel .
“ When the first expulsions were undertaken no local officer received an order to stop them , ” says Cypel , who lived for 12 years in Israel and served in the army .
“ Everyone understood from then on what direction was to be followed , without any need for an explicit formulation . ”
In 2004 , Benny Morris wrote a new study concluding there had been far more “ ethnic cleansing ” — far more massacres and rapes than he had originally thought .
The Israeli fighters had been given explicit orders “ to uproot the villagers , expel them and destroy the villages themselves . ”
In October 1948 in the Galilee , he said , “ There was an unusually high concentration of executions of people against a wall or next to a well in an orderly fashion .
This ca n’t be chance .
It ’s a pattern . ”
The orders for expulsion followed the visit of Prime Minister Ben Gurion to the headquarters of the units that undertook them .
According to Cypel , “ Of the 875,000 Palestinians who found themselves in the expanded State of Israel at the end of the war , only 150,000 were left after the new expulsions following the cease fire with the Arab states .
The others , that is 82 percent , were driven out , half of them by military force , the rest under the combined influence of threat , terror , and a deep feeling of abandonment and powerlessness . ”
What sealed their fate was the decision of the Israeli government in 1948 to refuse to allow any Palestinians who had fled — no matter what their motive — to return to their homeland .
At the same time , Israeli residence was offered to anyone in the world who could claim Jewish ancestry .
As if to destroy evidence of the Palestinian past , over the following years some 400 out of 500 Palestinian towns and ancestral villages were burned , dynamited and bulldozed , obliterated from the maps of Israel .
When the war in Kosovo broke out in 1999 an Israeli editorialist wryly wrote , “ How lucky we were then there was no CNN in 1948 or the whole world would have been able to see in Palestine the images we are seeing today . ”
The particular irony in all this is that it has traditionally been Israel demanding that other countries acknowledge their own past moral failings , specifically with regard to the Holocaust .
There is , of course , no comparison between the horrors of the Shoah and the campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians .
But that fact , say some Israeli writers , should not absolve the Zionist state from recognizing the less than glorious episodes in its own history .
“ Maybe we had to act as we did , ” says Gideon Levy .
“ Maybe there was no other way possible .
But why lie all these years ?
Why not say , ‘ One right came up against another , one victim came up against another , and the result was inevitable .
We had to drive them out .
It was them or us . ’
That would be much more persuasive than the lie .
It would also lead to peace . ”
Most Israelis are still unwilling to take that step .
They cite the fear of being overwhelmed and annihilated by a flood of returning Palestinians .
But most Palestinian and Arab leaders are under no illusions that Israel would ever open its doors to the 4 million refugees .
What they ask from Israel is formal recognition of what actually happened in 1948 - 49 — a recognition that would entail the Zionist state ’s assuming some responsibility for finally resolving the refugee problem .
The great majority of Palestinians , they acknowledge , would never return .
That was the kind of deal that Yasser Arafat sought in the ill - fated Camp David talks of 2000 : a face - saving accord that would have allowed him to claim victory , even though he and everyone knew there would not be a real right of return .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak , however , refused to cede any ground on the issue .
The claim that Israel ’s offer at the time was more than generous , says Cypel , was false — another case of Israeli myth making .
In fact , negotiations in following years between leading Israelis and Palestinians made it clear that a compromise on the issue was very much within reach .
Six months after the failed Camp David talks , for instance , at Taba , Barak ’s former minister of justice , Yossi Beilin , submitted a draft proposal acknowledging that “ the nascent state of Israel was drawn into the War of 1948 - 1949 , which had its victims and led to suffering on both sides , including the displacement and expropriation of the civilian Palestinian population . …
Since that time the refugees have for decades lived without dignity , citizenship , or property . ”
Israel , he promised , “ will be an active partner in closing this terrible chapter . ”
The proposal offered the refugees several options : return to Israel within limits to be agreed on , repatriation to a future Palestinian state , or relocation in their current host countries or elsewhere , much of this to be underwritten by additional international financing .
“ For the first time , ” says Cypel , “ Israel was admitting the illegitimacy of its demand that the Palestinians forget their own history . ”
Speaking to his fellow Israelis , Beilin attempted to make them understand that “ it is impossible to ask the Palestinians to give up the right of return .
If we ask them , there will be no final record . ”
Ehud Barak , however , broke off the Taba talks .
Similar draft negotiations two years later in Geneva , which resulted in the Palestinians agreeing to limits on their right of return and Israel undertaking to compensate the heirs of Palestinians it had expelled , ended after the talks were denounced by Ariel Sharon .
Four years later , Israeli leaders and the great majority of its people still refuse to accept responsibility for the refugee problem .
It boils down , says Cypel , to a question of appearances .
Despite Israel ’s great accomplishments , he says , there is still widespread apprehension among Israelis about any questioning of the country ’s self - image of moral superiority and perpetual victim of aggression .
“ The revelation of the slightest flaw , the revelation of the least stain , whether in the past or … the present , seems to evoke such fear that it challenges not only the existence but the very legitimacy of this society in the eyes of a large majority of its own members . ”
While Israel ’s difficulty in dealing with its own past may thus make some sense , much more remarkable is how successful the Israelis have been in convincing American leaders to play along with their founding myth .
Nearly two decades ago , the city ’s crack - cocaine epidemic led to headlines about gang wars , semiautomatic gunfire in schoolyards and a police blotter that showed more than six homicides a day , on average .
This year , with 428 killings logged through Sunday — 412 actual killings plus 16 crime victims who have died this year from injuries sustained long ago — the average number of killings is a bit more than one a day .
The numbers on file from before 1963 are not considered reliable for comparison because until then , many homicides were not recorded until an arrest was made and the case was closed , but ever since , they have been recorded as they occurred .
There were 390 homicides recorded in 1960 , fewer than this year , but any comparison would be faulty .
The killings that have seized the headlines this year appear to have personal motives at their core :
An assistant has been charged with killing her boss , Linda Stein , inside Ms. Stein ’s Fifth Avenue penthouse after a vicious argument ; a Queens orthodontist , Daniel Malakov , was gunned down , and a relative of his estranged wife , whom he was fighting in divorce and child custody proceedings , has been charged .
In contrast to the 35 cases this year in which officials have found that victim and assailant were strangers , there were 121 in the whole of last year , officials said .
The motives in the remainder of the killings this year are still being analyzed .
The dropping homicide rate raises a question of whether other types of crime are on the rise .
But police statistics , which are subject to an internal auditing system in use since the early 1990s , show dips in six of the seven major crime categories , according to the department ’s latest reports .
As of Sunday , overall crime was down 6.47 percent , compared to the same period last year .
In addition to the homicide rate , the number of rapes , robberies , burglaries , grand larcenies and car thefts are all on the decline .
One Embryo from Three Parents A controversial technique may be the answer for fatal disease .
Feb. 5 , 2008  --
British researchers today are reporting a potential new technique to spare thousands of children each year from a group of deadly inheritable diseases known collectively as mitochondrial disease .
These diseases might be prevented by altering human embryos , which are the product of two mothers and one father , the researchers said .
Isabelle Christenson , 9 , has mitochondrial disease , which is passed from mother to child via the egg .
Mitochondria -- the parts of cells that convert food into energy -- have their own DNA which is separate from that in a cell 's nucleus .
Isabelle has already suffered a stroke and undergone a kidney transplant , a stomach transplant and a liver transplant .
" Isabelle has about a year to live , the doctors told us about a week and a half ago , barring no more complications , " her mother , Michelle Christenson , said .
Researchers can theoretically prevent the passing of mitochondrial disease in a child by extracting nuclear DNA from a mother with mitochondrial disease and a father , then injecting that DNA into a donor egg from a woman without mitochondrial disease .
The resulting embryo , in effect , had three parents but was disease - free .
It inherited all the physical characteristics from Mom and Dad but received its healthy mitochondrial DNA from the woman providing the " donor egg . "
Altering eggs is not a new idea but the groundbreaking development is the technique to actually prevent genetic disease .
Researchers say the next step is to let these " three parent embryos " grow beyond a few days , to see if they can actually become healthy babies .
But for families like the Christensons , it 's about preventing future generations from enduring this disease ever again .

Bill Clinton hints ' popular vote ' should be key factor David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008

Print This Email This Former President Bill Clinton displayed a relaxed attitude towards the presidential primary campaign in his most recent interview , telling ABC's Robin Roberts , " If we just chill out here and let all the voters have their say , my gut is it 's going to come out all right . "
Roberts asked Clinton about Nancy Pelosi 's statement that " if the votes of super - delegates overturn what happened in the elections , it would be harmful to the Democratic Party . "
Clinton replied , " I think we need to let all the people vote .
But it is now , I think , almost mathematically impossible for ... either one of them , to get a majority of the pledged delegates .
If we had the Republican system of winner - take - all in the big states , then Hillary would have a prohibitive lead in the delegates , because she won the preponderance of the big states . "
Clinton focused on the significant of the popular vote totals , saying , " If Senator Obama wins the popular vote , then the choice would be easier .
But if Hillary wins the popular vote but can't quite catch up in the delegate vote , then you just have to ask yourselves which is more important and who 's more likely to win in November . "
The Obama campaign has made a strong point of his lead in the popular vote .
He is ahead at this point by about 800,000 votes , or perhaps more depending on how the caucuses are tallied .
( That figure would fall by 300,000 if Florida , where Obama did not actively campaign , were included . )
Obama himself recently stated , " I 've won more of the popular vote than Senator Clinton .
I have more delegates than Senator Clinton .
So I do n't know how somebody who 's in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who 's in first place . "
However , Bill Clinton emphasized to ABC that he does not see the campaign as destructive to the Democratic Party .
" This has been a fairly mild election , " he stated .
" I just think that these things happen .
It 's just politics , it 's not that big a deal . "
He added , " Do I think Hillary is more electable ?
I do .
But on today 's facts ... I think they would both win . "
Clinton also asserted that he meant " no disrespect to Senator Obama " by his remark about Jesse Jackson having won the South Carolina primary as a black candidate , but that " they thought they could hurt me with that so they put a bizarre spin on it and it worked for awhile . "

Transcript via closed captions :: now the race for ' 08 .
an interview with a major player in the game next to the candidates themselves , of course , former president bill clinton .
while he weighed in heavily on the presidential race , i caught up with him in the lower ninth ward of new orleans where he was taking his outreach people to young people , the global initiative university . :: they 're just so young and in acolleges across the world that have access to technology and have great new ideas and i think they can play a great new role in citizen service around the world . :: reporter : president clinton took a break from his hectic campaign to launch his global youth movement .
politics of the day , never too far from his mind . :: if we just chill out here and let all the voters have their say , my gut is it 's going to come out all right . :: on " this week with george stephanopoulos , " nancy pelosi said -- :: if the votes of superdelegate overturn what happened in the elections , it would be harmful to the democratic party . :: that was her word , harmful to the democratic party .
do you agree ? :: i think we need to let all the people vote .
but it now , i think , almost mathematically impossible for any of them , either one of them , to get a majority of the pledge delegates .
if we had the republican system of winner take all in the big states then hillary would have a prohibitive lead in the delegates because she won the preponderance of the big states .
if senator obama won it , it would be easier .
if hillary does and can't quite catch up in the delegate vote then you just have to ask yourselves which is more important and who is more likely to win in november ?
and i do n't know it will be an easy decision but that 's what leaders sign up for . :: people say it's also the potential to be destructive to the democratic party , the things that are being said . :: i think it 's important not to overreact here .
this has been a fairly mild election .
i just think that these things happen .
it 's just politics , it 's not that big a deal .
it 's nothing like -- bob kerrey said in ' 92 when i was running in georgia that the voters would open me up like a worm peanut .
that 's pretty tough , and we 're great friends .
now , do i think hillary is more electable ?
ido. but on today 's facts , i think given i'd say a six - week campaign , i think they would both win .
i think the republicans did a very smart thing to nominate senator mccain .
i think he is clearly not only their most electable candidate but quite possibly the only candidate who could have won a general election .
i expect a spirited election in the fall no matter what happens but we should just let the democrats decide .
this is a tough choice for them .
they have two candidates .
they basically like them both and they have different strengths and have to decide which skill set and -- is more important , number one , for the country 's welfare over the long run and which one is more likely to be elected . :: politically charged incidents have flared up in the democratic campaign .
geraldine ferraro's comments on obama 's qualifications , obama 's pastor , reverend jeer remiah wright 's comments on race in america . :: no , no , no .
not god bless america , goddamn america . :: you say chill out , but geraldine ferraro , reverend wright , both sides things being said by surrogates .
people point back to south carolina and the comments that were made at that point . :: jesse jackson winning south carolina twice in ' 84 and ' 88 , and he ran a good campaign and senator obama has run a good campaign here . :: they made up a race story out of that .
there was no disrespect to senator obama in that .
so i think that our side got a bum rap for what was said about south carolina , but the point is , that 's political tactics .
they thought they could hurt me with that so they put a bizarre spin on it and it worked for awhile .
will there be more animosity as it goes on , yes , it ca n't be helped .
in it 's nowhere near the worst campaign i've ever seen in america .
in terms of the personal stuff and the press has been pretty responsible , i think , in handling that .
notwithstanding the disparity in coverage there has n't been unduly negative and everybody -- it ought to be hard to be nominated .
everybody ought to be subjected to the same amount of scrutiny . :: no doubt he 's hoping the scrutiny of his own role in the campaign is less harsh as he focuses his attentions on the pore popul trademark former president issues like this youth initiative . :: if you look at where america is going , look at these kids out here , look at the interdepen dense of our society and our inter interdependence in the world .
our side , our party has the better argument on the side of the economics and the way we ought to relate to each other at home and role in the world so i'm basically very optimistic .
your future is very likely to be bright indeed .
thank you and god bless you all .
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - An affiliate of U.S. - based buyout firm Carlyle Group has defaulted on about $ 16.6 billion of debt and expects its lenders to seize remaining assets as the global credit crunch tightens around leveraged investors .
David Rubenstein , Co-Founder and Managing Director of The Carlyle Group , speaks at the " M& A Outlook 2008 " conference in New York November 7 , 2007 .
An affiliate of The Carlyle Group has defaulted on about $ 16.6 billion of debt and expects its lenders to seize remaining assets as the global credit crunch tightens around leveraged investors .

The Carlyle Group said in a statement on Thursday that as Carlyle Capital Corp CARC .AS , a fund listed in Amsterdam , was unable to reach a deal with lenders it expected those lenders to take possession of the fund 's remaining residential mortgage - backed securities assets .
Carlyle said it had worked “ exhaustively ” to assist Carlyle Capital and took “ extraordinary measures ” to help it through its liquidity crisis .
It stressed that Carlyle Capital Corp ( CCC ) was a separate legal and business entity , and that it believed CCC would not have a measurable impact on Carlyle ’s other funds , investments and portfolio companies .
Carlyle Group said that Carlyle Capital ’s defaults did not trigger cross-defaults for any Carlyle borrowings .
The Carlyle Group , based in Washington , DC , has more than $ 75 billion under management .
One of the world ’s largest private equity firms , it owns companies including TV ratings firm Nielsen , doughnut seller Dunkin ’ Brands and former General Motors unit Allison Transmission .
Carlyle Capital said in New York late on Wednesday that talks with lenders deteriorated after a decline in the value of its mortgage investments , which it said would result in margin calls of $ 97.5 million on top of the $ 400 million it was already facing .
A “ successful refinancing is not possible , ” Carlyle Capital said , after trying for the past week to work out a deal with lenders to stave off bankruptcy .
The credit crisis , triggered last year when subprime mortgages made to risky U.S. borrowers went sour , has put increasing pressure on lenders to tighten credit and made it difficult to value collateralized debt , mortgage portfolios and other fixed - income securities -- the investments that Carlyle Capital was set up to invest in .
“ We ’ve been expecting , for a while , for the hedge funds to get into trouble , ” said Andrea Cicione , a credit strategist at BNP Paribas , one of Carlyle Capital ’s lenders .
“ We are in a vicious spiral of unwinding years of increasing leverage in the space of a few weeks , ” he said , and no one can say how much leverage must be wrung out before the unwinding comes to an end .
Carlyle Capital , based in Britain ’s offshore dependency of Guernsey , said the only assets it has left are AAA - rated residential mortgage - backed securities , and it expected lenders to foreclose on that collateral .
“ It has become apparent to the company that the basis on which lenders are willing to provide financing against the company ’s collateral has changed so substantially that a successful refinancing is not possible , ” Carlyle Capital said .
Its shares sank 87 percent to 35 cents , a fraction of their $ 20 debut price last July .
Dutch market regulator AFM said it was monitoring developments closely .
SUPPLY WORRIES
Among the counterparties for Carlyle ’s repurchasing agreements , Deutsche Bank , Merrill Lynch & Co and Bear Stearns Cos have sold off assets , the Wall Street Journal reported .
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Credit Suisse has started selling its CCC assets .
CCC had invested in U.S. prime mortgage - backed securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which are high - rated and carry the implicit backing of the U.S. government .
Spreads on these bonds have been widening , however , on fears that investors could dump supply into a saturated market .
Managers at U.S. - based buyout firm The Carlyle Group own about 15 percent of Carlyle Capital Corp , which listed in July 2007 as the credit crisis began spreading through the global financial system .
The Carlyle Group actively participated in the negotiations with lenders and last year extended a $ 150 million credit line to its affiliate .
According to CCC ’s annual report , counterparties for its repurchasing agreements as of the end of 2007 were Bank of America , Bear Stearns , BNP Paribas , Calyon , Citigroup , Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank , ING , JP Morgan , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and UBS .
CCC is the latest fund or trading firm to encounter problems as a result of the credit market crisis .
New York - based fixed income trader Drake Management said on Wednesday it was considering liquidating all three of its hedge funds .
Sources said on Tuesday that hedge fund Blue River Asset Management ’s main municipal bond fund was liquidating after a sell - off in the bond market .
London - based Peloton Partners , which had held $ 3 billion in assets , told investors earlier this month it was liquidating its two funds .
World 's Hardest Easy Geometry Problem
Using only elementary geometry , determine angle x .
Provide a step - by - step proof .
You may use only elementary geometry , such as the fact that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees and the basic congruent triangle rules ( side - angle - side , etc . ) .
You may not use trigonomery , such as sines and cosines , the law of sines , the law of cosines , etc .
This is the hardest problem I have ever seen that is , in a sense , easy .
It really can be done using only elementary geometry .
This is not a trick question .

World 's Second - Hardest Easy Geometry Problem
Using only elementary geometry , determine angle x .
Provide a step - by - step proof .
This is a variation of the problem above .
This is also a very hard problem that is , in a sense , easy .
Here is a very small hint .
Here is a small hint .
These hints are not spoilers .
Sorry , but I 'm not giving the answer nor the proof here .
You will just have to work on it until you either solve it or are driven insane .
If you email me at k.enevoldsen@wlonk.com , I may give you a bigger hint ( if I feel like it ) .
If you think you have solved it , you can ask me if your answer is correct , but please also tell me how you got the answer .
The proof may be written informally , but you need to tell me all the steps , or at least the key steps , in your solution .
It is helpful if you also send me a diagram .
Try to persuade me that you are not just guessing .
I have additional small , medium , and large hints , but you must first show your efforts to convince me that you have struggled valiantly .
Please do n't search the the web for the answer — that 's cheating .
You will only deprive yourself of many hours of delicious frustration .
Of the proofs posted on other websites , some are valid proofs and some are not .
I did not invent these problems .
After I first read problem 1 , I worked on it for many hours over several days before I eventually figured it out .
A couple of years later I came back to the problem , but I had forgotten my proof .
It took me many hours to figure it out again !
Problem 2 also took me many hours to solve .
How hard are these problems ?
Any teenage student can understand the proof , but very very few are able to discover the proof on their own .
Of the people who have emailed me ( more than a thousand ) , fewer than five percent ( mostly math professionals and college students ) have provided valid proofs without significant hints .
( The hints given above are not significant hints . )
Based on my emails , most people who think they have found a proof are wrong .
Most do not even have the correct answer for angle x .
Of those that have the correct answer , the proofs they send me are usually wrong ( incorrect or incomplete ) .
People who say " it only took me a few minutes " almost never have a valid proof .
These problems have been published in many places .
Problem 2 first appeared here : Langley , " A Problem " , Mathematical Gazette , 1922 .
Dr. Gary Gruber says his high school teacher showed him problem 1 in about 1955 .
Tom Rike says problem 1 first appeared in print here : Harry Schor , The New York State Mathematics Teachers ' Journal , 1974 .
It also appeared here : " Problem 134 " , Eureka ( now Crux Mathematicorum ) , 1976 .
Dr. Gruber popularized problem 1 in several papers ( such as " The Genius Test " ) which appeared in newspapers throughout the 1990s ( Universal Press Syndicate and Los Angeles Times Syndicate ) .
That 's where I discovered it .
Notice that I call this the " world 's hardest easy geometry problem " , not the " world 's hardest geometry problem " .
The world 's hardest geometry problem would be something really hard , like the Poincaré conjecture .

Mitzi ’s future in West New York , N.J. , where she lived in a down - and - out pocket of town , did n’t look particularly bright .
She might have ended up on the street , like so many of her peers , if she had n’t caught the eye of a beloved New York hair colorist named Grato Longoria .
Within a year of that chance encounter , she was living on upper Madison Avenue , rolling around in 330 - thread - count Matouk sheets and maintaining a meticulous grooming regimen .
Given her youth , she ’s remarkably proficient in her work as a professional house cat .
“ She ’s got the loudest purr I ’ve ever heard , ” said Gene Kennedy , who looks after Mitzi with his wife , Peggy Kennedy , an ash - blond artist who met Mitzi through her colorist , Mr. Longoria .
Every so often , a fairy tale story like Mitzi ’s hits New York  consider the legend of Natalia Vodianova , the young Russian model who went from selling fruit on the street to modeling for Vogue , marrying into a British real estate fortune and owning a huge chunk of TriBeCa property , all within a matter of a few years .
Ms. Vodianova ’s story , of course , is one in a million ; if you ’re a cat or dog living in West New York , your odds of a rags - to - riches transformation are much higher .
THE HEALTHCARE INSURANCE BIZ … .
Tyler Cowen argues against healthcare mandates :
The way most goods and services become excellent — I mean really excellent — is through competition .
Yes , right now health insurance has lots of screwy incentives , most of all cost shedding .
But if you stifle competition and write off hope of getting a better - functioning private insurance market … well …
I believe you have not thought long and hard enough about just how much of the social value on Planet Earth has come , ultimately , from competition in the provision of goods and services .
….
If someone needs covering , for whatever reason , give them some stuff .
If need be give them some government stuff .
Some kind of plan .
Give them whatever .
But do n’t overregulate private insurance companies and take them off the table as a source of future productivity improvements and super cheap coverage , however partial it may be .
Here ’s what I do n’t get .
If you were to argue that we should do away with group insurance entirely and move back to a 19th century model in which people simply pay doctors and hospitals for their services directly , I ’d get it .
I would n’t be in favor of it , but at least I ’d understand the argument : namely that this sets up a competitive industry with plenty of price signalling , and competitive industries are , in the long run , the most efficient and most innovative .
But that ’s not what ’s on the table .
Instead , Tyler is arguing for keeping the insurance industry competitive .
But I simply do n’t see what that buys us .
Even if the health insurance industry were dramatically improved , this would n’t especially make healthcare any more efficient .
It would only make the insurance industry more efficient .
That would be nice , but hardly earthshaking — and in any case , many decades of keeping healthcare insurance regulation at a modest level have produced one of the least efficient industries on the planet .
What makes us think that ’s going to change anytime in the near future ?
Competitive industries , generally speaking , are good things .
But right now in the United States we have a Rube Goldberg system that gives us the worst of both worlds : the administrative inefficiencies and lack of universality that comes from a private system , combined with the bureaucracy and lack of effective price signalling that comes from shielding consumers from having to pay for healthcare directly .
The former could be addressed with national healthcare , which is difficult but at least feasible .
The latter , conversely , could be addressed only by getting rid of employer - supported healthcare and forcing consumers to buy either health insurance or health services directly with their own money .
That ’s just flatly not going to happen .
It ’s an absolute political nonstarter .
It seems to me that libertarians would be better off accepting that , and instead spending their time figuring out the best possible way to construct a national health plan that still retains elements of competitiveness and incentives to innovate .
It would n’t be perfect from their point of view , but it would be better than banging their heads against a wall that just gets higher and harder every year .
Healthcare is an unusual market , and it ’s one in which “ insurance , ” which is something of a misnomer in the first place , simply has n’t produced either innovation or lower costs , and probably never will .
Why keep fighting for it ?
UPDATE : Matt unpacks
“ It ’s an absolute political nonstarter ” here and makes the appropriate point a little more plainly than I did : a more efficient health insurance industry might be a good thing in some purely economic sense , but it would produce results that are wildly unacceptable to the electorate .
It ai n’t gonna happen .

The Stipa - Caproni prototype aircraft was basically a venturi tube fitted with 120 hp de Havilland Gypsy III engine and a propeller at the front end of the tube .
It was built by Caproni in 1932 but it never went into mass production because …well , it did n’t really fly ; the original test report says the strange plane only flew for a distance of 500 m at a height of 5/6 meters .
A unique replica of the odd looking flying machine is owned by Lynette Zuccoli , from Brisbane , Australia .

The first real steps towards building a microscopic device that can construct nano machines have been taken by US researchers .
Writing in the peer - reviewed publication , International Journal of Nanomanufacturing from Inderscience Publishers , researchers describe an early prototype for a nanoassembler .
In his 1986 book , The Engines of Creation , K Eric Drexler set down the long - term aim of nanotechnology - to create an assembler , a microscopic device , a robot , that could construct yet smaller devices from individual atoms and molecules .
For the last two decades , those researchers who recognized the potential have taken diminutive steps towards such a nanoassembler .
Those taking the top - down approach have seen the manipulative power of the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , a machine that can observe and handle single atoms , as one solution .
Those taking the bottom - up approach are using chemistry to build molecular machinery .
However , neither the top - down nor the bottom - up approach is yet to fulfill Drexler 's prophecy of functional nanobots that can construct other machines on a scale of just a few billionths of a meter .
Jason Gorman of the Intelligent Systems Division at the US government 's National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) concedes that , " Nanoassembly is extremely challenging . "
Yet the rewards could be enormous with the ultimate potential of creating a technology that can construct almost any material from atoms and molecules from super - strong but incredibly lightweight construction materials to a molecular computer or even nanobots that can make other nanobots to solve global problems , such as food , water , and energy shortages .
Gorman and his colleagues at NIST have taken a novel approach to building a nanoassembler and reveal details in a forthcoming issue of the International Journal of Nanomanufacturing .
" Our demonstration is still a work in progress , " says Gorman , " you might describe it as a ' proto - prototype ' for a nanoassembler . "
AFM is the most commonly employed approach for top - down nanomanipulation research , explains Gorman .
However , AFM suffers from a number limitations , as the nanoparticles stick together during manipulation and cannot be lifted from the substrate .
This means that nanodevices constructed using AFM may be aesthetically pleasing and provide insights into what might be achievable but it cannot build practical nano machines .
The NIST system consists of four Microelectromechanical Systems ( MEMS ) devices positioned around a centrally located port on a chip into which the starting materials can be placed Each nanomanipulator is composed of positioning mechanism with an attached nanoprobe .
By simultaneously controlling the position of each of these nanoprobes , the team can use them to cooperatively assemble a complex structure on a very small scale .
" If successful , this project will result in an on -chip nanomanufacturing system that would be the first of its kind , " says Gorman .
" Our micro - scale nanoassembly system is designed for real - time imaging of the nanomanipulation procedures using a scanning electron microscope , " explains Gorman , " and multiple nanoprobes can be used to grasp nanostructures in a cooperative manner to enable complex assembly operations . "
Importantly , once the team has optimized their design they anticipate that nanoassembly systems could be made for around $ 400 per chip at present costs .
This is thousands of times cheaper than macro- scale systems such as the AFM .
Gorman points out that it should be possible to have multiple nanoassemblers working simultaneously to manufacture next generation nanoelectronics .
At the moment , his team is interested in developing the platform for scientists and engineers to make cutting edge discoveries in nanotechnology .
" Very few effective tools exist for manipulation and assembly at the nano - scale , thereby limiting the growth of this critical field , " he says .
" The work described in the IJNM paper is somewhat preliminary and focuses on the design and characterization of the micro- scale nanomanipulator sub-components , " adds Gorman , " We are currently fabricating a somewhat revised micro - scale nanoassembly system that we believe will be capable of manipulating nanoparticles by the end of the summer , " Gorman says , " We will publishing those results once they are available . "

I previously blogged ( here and here ) Todd Zywicki ’s contention that in their book , The Two - Income Trap : Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers are Going Broke , Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi wrongly blamed rising mortgage and health care costs for the increasing strain on family budgets despite the growing incomes earned by two - income couples .
Zywicki argues , using Warren and Tyagi ’s own figures , that increases in family tax burdens far outstripped increases in mortgage and health care costs .
In a Sunday Washington Post op - ed , Do n’t Blame All Borrowers , Robert Frank resurrects The Two - Income Trap thesis in explaining the current mortgage and housing crisis :
Hints of how things began to go awry appeared in The Two - Income Trap , a 2003 book in which Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi posed this intriguing question :
Why could families easily meet their financial obligations in the 1950s and 1960s , when only one parent worked outside the home , yet have great difficulty today , when two - income families are the norm ?
The answer , they suggest , is that the second incomes fueled a bidding war for housing in better neighborhoods .
Zywicki takes
Frank to task for ignoring the far greater influence of rising tax burdens on families :
Isolating just the mortgage burden , according to Warren & Tyagi ’s figures the percentage of family income dedicated to mortgage payments actually declined from the 1970s to 2000s , from 14 % of household income ( $ 5310 of $ 38,700 ) to 13 % of household income ( $ 9000 of $ 67,800 ) .
Again , this is using Warren & Tyagi ’s own figures .
I learned after writing the column that there is some dispute about the source of the rising tax burden .
I followed Warren and Tyagi ’s lead from the book and attributed the growth in the tax burden primarily to the second - earner bias .
Subsequently I found that there is some dispute about the extent to which the growth in the tax burden is attributable to income taxes rather than state and local taxes ( including state income taxes ) .
What has not been questioned is that Warren and Tyagi ’s own numbers show that the growth in the overall household tax burden overwhelms the growth in home mortgage expenses with respect to its impact on the household bottom line .

As the Beijing Olympic flame is carried through the streets of San Francisco today , what happens could be a triumphant acknowledgement of the power of peaceful protest or a blow to " our reputation as a country , " according a top Olympic official worried about a repeat of disrupted torch events in Paris and London .
Thousands of protesters are expected to line the route and hold rallies to raise awareness of China 's human - rights record .
Hundreds of police officers and security officials are expected to surround the torch runners to keep them safe .
And contingency plans have been drafted so the torch 's route can be shortened or changed if the event starts to get out of hand .
" The only concern is our reputation as a country , " U.S. Olympic Committee President Peter Ueberroth said after meeting with Mayor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday .
" Can we very , very powerfully say we believe in dissent , all dissent , that we believe in people 's freedoms and we can still operate as a city and respect our own athletes and our own people as they participate in the Olympic movement ? "
Ueberroth met with Newsom at City Hall to go over planning for the 6 - mile waterfront relay , which is to begin at 1 p.m. with an opening ceremony at McCovey Cove and end at Justin Herman Plaza .
Newsom said the route along San Francisco 's waterfront is likely to be changed as a result of protests , even as the relay is under way .
Although he said the changes to the route would not be drastic , he also urged spectators to gather near the Ferry Building in case organizers decide to make last - minute changes .
" The likelihood that things will change is greater than the likelihood that things will not change , " Newsom said .
Conference call to London
The mayor spent the day on a conference call with London 's police chief and in a City Hall meeting with France 's ambassador to the United States , he said , to learn about security protocols in Paris and " what went right and what went wrong " in those two cities , where protesters nearly tackled torchbearers along the route and forced security officials to snuff out the flame several times .
Police Chief Heather Fong said officers , including some who will run with torchbearers , have watched events unfold in other countries and are adjusting their strategy .
" What is most important is at the end of the day the people are peaceful and safe and it's a successful situation , " Fong said .
" If there 's violence and people get hurt , then it hurts every opinion that is out there . "
Relay organizers said one torchbearer , a 14 - year - old San Francisco girl , backed out of the relay over concerns about security on the route .
Though San Francisco officials have spent months preparing for the Olympic torch relay , Newsom conceded on Tuesday he had no idea pro-Tibetan groups would be such a force .
Pro-Tibet rally and march
Hundreds of protesters gathered Tuesday at a pro-Tibet rally and march that began at United Nations Plaza and moved on to City Hall and the Chinese Consulate building in the Western Addition neighborhood .
By evening , thousands assembled at U.N. Plaza for a candlelight vigil and speeches by actor Richard Gere and Archbishop Desmond Tutu .
On Monday , three people scaled the Golden Gate Bridge and unfurled banners supporting Tibetan independence .
" We knew that Tibet was going to be an issue , " said Newsom , who has been under pressure to make a public statement critical of China 's human - rights record .
" We did n't expect it to be as acute . "
One influential Chinatown group denounced protesters on Tuesday .
Mel Lee of the fraternal organization known as the Chinese Six Companies , a coalition of business leaders , said his group represents " the silent majority " in its support for the torch coming to San Francisco .
" Human rights is something that you have to deal with , " Lee said .
" These people protesting are using that as an excuse to protest against China .
...
If there 's any discrepancy , they should go through the U.N. "
The city 's Board of Supervisors passed a resolution last week sharply critical of China 's record .
Newsom has yet to sign it and said Tuesday that he had raised concerns during a meeting with China 's ambassador to the United States but that he would not make any formal comments on human rights during today 's ceremonies .
Even members of the International Olympic Committee - who met in Beijing on Monday with 206 Olympic committees from around the world - have been caught off guard by the loud protests and violent reaction to the torch run , said Anita DeFrantz , senior U.S. member of the international committee , who is in San Francisco as the committee 's representative .
" I think it 's fair to say that it 's not so much a surprise as shock that people would go so far , " said Frantz , who said members of the executive team of the international committee will meet today to discuss the remainder of the torch route .
The torch is to leave San Francisco for Buenos Aires .
" There probably have been protests before , but not someone actually attacking a person carrying the torch to wrest it out of their hands and trying to douse it .
What is that about ? " she said .
Li Ping , a spokeswoman for the torch relay , said she hopes everything goes well in San Francisco but said the relay will continue regardless of the outcome .
" We will not give up our travel .
We will carry on our travel and we look forward to celebrating the Olympics with people in other countries , " she said .
In addition to the thousands of pro-Tibetan protesters expected to turn out for the relay , members of a broad coalition of other activists have said they also plan to protest .
Those include Burmese monks , dressed in red robes , who will march on the Golden Gate Bridge to denounce China 's support of Burma 's military junta ; animal - rights groups protesting what they say is China 's practice of killing dogs and cats for their fur ; and human - rights activists who want to call attention to labor issues in China , including to support workers who made the official Olympics apparel .

Canada 's broadcast regulator has long acknowledged that Canadians enjoy limited competition for high - speed Internet services .
In response , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission has supported independent Internet service providers , or ISPs , by requiring incumbents such as Bell Canada to provide wholesale broadband Internet service at regulated rates .
While it is difficult to compete on price – the Bell wholesale pricing creates an effective minimum price – independent ISPs such as Chatham - based Teksavvy and Ottawa 's National Capital FreeNet have carved a niche in the Canadian market through attention to customer service , innovative bundling approaches , targeted network investments and community ownership .
Last week , this important piece of the Canadian Internet connectivity puzzle learned its future viability has been put at risk due to Bell 's plans to " throttle " its wholesale services .
Last year ,
Bell began installing so - called deep - packet inspection capabilities into its network .
The DPI capabilities , which allow ISPs to identify the type of content that runs on their networks , did not go unnoticed by the independent ISPs since such inspection is also used to , as the terminology goes , throttle Internet content by scaling back the amount of bandwidth allocated to particular applications .
While Bell employed these throttling technologies with its own Sympatico customers , some independent ISPs sought assurances it would not be applied to the wholesale services .
Sources advise Bell responded positively that its plans were limited to its own customers .
That was consistent with its 2003 assurance to the CRTC that it would only engage in limiting bandwidth for wholesale services " in cases of troubleshooting or to protect the network infrastructure from congestion resulting from malfunctioning or misconfigured equipment or malicious hacking . "
Notwithstanding those commitments , earlier this month Internet chat boards began to buzz with rumours of throttling among independent ISPs .
A Google Maps mashup was created , documenting instances of reduced bandwidth that stretched across the province .
The Toronto Star has learned that John Sweeney , Bell 's senior vice - president of carrier services , sent a letter to the independent ISPs last Friday acknowledging that Bell has implemented bandwidth management from 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. for its wholesale customers .
Sweeney admitted that peer - to - peer applications will not work as fast during this period , but argued that " a majority of end users will experience an increased level of satisfaction . "
While much of the initial commentary has focused on the implications for consumer rights , that discussion misses the more important aspect of this story , namely that Bell 's plans undermine the Internet 's competitive landscape by raising three concerns .
The effect on ISP competition , particularly in Ontario and Quebec , points to the first competition issue .
Simply put , wholesale level throttling lessens the ability for independent ISPs to differentiate their services and therefore compete in the marketplace .
Indeed , critics argue that this is intentional since Bell 's decision to throttle its own residential customers enabled the independent ISPs to attract dissatisfied subscribers .
By throttling everyone , Bell may be trying to recapture lost customers .
The second competition concern is the effect on ISP services such as the secure virtual private networks used by companies and video streaming employed by many broadcasters .
With DPI and throttling in place , Bell may soon be positioned to implement premium pricing for services that business currently takes for granted , thereby raising costs and cutting independent ISPs out of the picture .
The third competition concern brings a cultural dimension to the issue .
The major ISPs claim that throttling is needed to ensure better quality of service to all customers , yet it also has a significant impact on the video marketplace .
Cable and satellite companies have begun to sell new video on demand services to consumers , which compete directly with video distributed over the Internet .

For example , last week the CBC used BitTorrent to distribute one of its programs , yet some subscribers reported that the episode took hours to download .
The slow speeds were no accident .
Rather , they were a direct result of ISPs limiting available bandwidth , something they do not do for their own video services .
These conflicts point to the need for action from Canada 's regulators .
Recent regulatory attention to the issue in the United States has paved the way for commitments to treat content equally .
Canadians deserve – and should demand – nothing less .
Almost two - thirds of people in Britain fear race relations are so poor tensions are likely to spill over into violence , a BBC poll has suggested .
Of the 1,000 people asked , 60 % said the UK had too many immigrants and half wanted foreigners encouraged to leave .
But the proportion of people describing themselves as " racially prejudiced " was down to 20 % , compared with 24 % in 2005 .
Equality and Human Rights Commission head Trevor Phillips said the findings were " alarming " .
Britain 's last serious race riots - when violent clashes erupted between white and Asian youths in northern England - happened seven years ago .
Despite this , the poll , carried out by Mori , found three out of four people thought there was now a great deal or a fair amount of tension between races and nationalities .
And almost two in three feared tension was certain or likely to lead to violence , although it is not clear whether people are imagining full - blown street riots or minor scuffles .
Mr Phillips told BBC
News : " What worries me is if that friction starts to catch fire - if people do genuinely believe it 's going to catch fire then we 're in trouble .
" This finding may reflect not what is happening today but the story that 's been told of the last 40 years - that if you get people of different kinds together then eventually there 's going to be trouble . "
The survey was commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of Enoch Powell 's infamous " rivers of blood " speech , in which he described the indigenous population 's " sense of alarm and resentment " over immigration .
Speaking of his foreboding , he said : " Like the Roman , I seem to see the river Tiber foaming with blood . "
BBC home editor Mark Easton says Powell 's words , spoken to a small gathering in Birmingham 's Midland hotel , still echo down the decades .
How this question has been answered since 1983
He says the effect of Powell 's speech was in fact to force the issue of immigration off the political agenda , with any politician who ventured to broach the subject risking being accused of playing the race card .
This situation still exists 40 years later , our correspondent says .
Five months ago , a Tory candidate in Birmingham , Nigel Hastilow , was forced to step down by David Cameron for saying Powell was right that uncontrolled immigration would change Britain irrevocably .
However , the BBC poll finds many people share that view .
Asked if they thought immigration meant their local area did n't feel like Britain any more , a quarter of the sample agreed - double the amount who felt this three years ago .
Six out of 10 said immigration had made parts of Britain feel like a foreign country .
When Tory leader Michael Howard suggested communities could n't cope with the pace of immigration during the 2005 general election campaign , he was accused of racism .
However , our correspondent says immigration is now back on the political agenda .
He says : " One reason politicians can debate it again , perhaps , is that the latest wave of immigration is different .
" The million Eastern Europeans who 've come to the UK in the last three or four years are not looking to settle for good .
Their motives are economic .
And perhaps most importantly they are white .
" Forty years after Enoch Powell , the issues of race and immigration have been separated once more . "
Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said the government knew immigration was a top concern among voters .
He said : " That is why 2008 sees the biggest shake - up to immigration and border security in 45 years , with a points system like the one in Australia and new rules to make people earn their stay in the UK , including speaking English and abiding by our rules .
" That is what is going to make our immigration system fit for the future . "

What are these ?
Is it better for a country if its people shared similar customs or traditions ?
In many ways that question goes to the heart of many debates we have in this country , right ?
The people who think the country is going to hell in a hand - cart usually do so because they ’re worried about people who might look or act somewhat differently to them .
So a bunch of scientists decided to do a study asking that question : “ It is better for a country if almost everyone shares the same customs and traditions ? ” for Americans and Europeans .
The result ( pdf ) is somewhat surprising .
Seen as somewhat insular and inward looking , the Americans actually come out the best - with less than 30 % agreeing that cultural homogeneity was a good thing .
So you ’d think that the more open a country to immigration , as America is , the more open they are to diversity .
Well , Switzerland comes next , and then Sweden , and then Germany ( !!! ) .
UK is way down the list .
See this chart
In many ways this also shatters the theory , advanced a lot by David Goodhart of Prospect magazine , that a culturally homogeneous country such as Sweden may want to preserve that sense of identity .
It actually looks like the Swedes are more open minded than the Brits on diversity .
Who would have thought eh ?
( via the Monkey Cage )
There ’s also a chart on who wants religious diversity , again the results are very curious .
Famous Dead Nontheists
A list of famous dead people who have rejected God and religion .
These are people throughout history who have advocated living life without deference to a transcendent power .
The list is in order of birth date .
The purposes of this list are to combat the pervasive myth that atheists are terrible , immoral people and to convince the undecided that it is OK to be an atheist .
Just like any other large group of people , some of these people lived exemplary lives and others did not .
The point is not that these people are all heroes , but simply to notice that there are more nontheists out there than most people realize .
For a list of living celebrity atheists , I highly recommend Reed Esau 's excellent , Celebrity Atheist List .

Confucius , Chinese philosopher ( 551-479 BCE ) .
Confucius ' teaching can be considered a noteworthy Chinese variant of humanism .
Although Confucianism is often followed in a religious manner by the Chinese , argument continues over whether to refer to it as a religion because it makes little reference to theological or spiritual matters ( God(s ) , the afterlife , etc. ) .
Anaxagoras , Greek philosopher ( 500 ? - 428 ? BCE ) .
" . . . probably the first freethinker we know of to be condemned for his beliefs . "
" He regarded the conventional gods as mythic abstractions endowed with anthropomorphic attributes .
His writings led him to a dungeon , charged with impiety , probably about the year 450 B.C.E . "
Only the intervention of the great statesman and orator Pericles saved Anaxagoras from a death sentence .
He had to pay a fine and , according to some accounts , was banished .
He lived his final years in exile .
Diagoras " the Atheist " of Melos , Greek poet , ( 5th cent .
BCE ) .
Threw a wooden image of a god into a fire , remarking that the deity should perform another miracle and save itself .
The uproar this caused in Athens prompted Diagoras to flee for his life . "
Athens outlawed him and offered a reward for his capture dead or alive .
He lived out his life in Spartan territory . "
Protagoras , Greek philosopher ( 481?-411 BCE ) .
" As to the gods , I am unable to say whether they exist or do not exist "
Democritus , Greek philosopher ( 460 ? -357 BCE ) .
The father of Materialism .
Argued that mechanical relationships or arrangements of the atoms account for various characteristics of nature , the intimation here being that the natural order of the world resulted from chance .
Even morality , the soul , and all mental life are reducible to mechanistic terms with physical imperceptible atoms as their basic structure .
Spiritual reality does not exist ; what appears to be spiritual is attributed simply to subperceptible atomic structure or else to mere superstition .
Hence , the Democritan philosophy of mechanistic Materialism is complete , self - sufficient , and self - contained .

Epicurus , Greek philosopher ( 341-270 BCE ) .
As a Materialist , Epicurus accepted the idea that the soul consists of atomic material which disintegrates at death , at which time all sensation ceases .
Consequently , he said , death need not be a matter of anxious concern , inasmuch as it is merely the state in which all sensation ceases .

In On the Nature of Things he wrote " human life lay foul before men's eyes , crushed to the dust beneath religion 's weight . "
Leah Kronenberg tells me that Lucretius was a dedicated Epicurean , and thus gods do exist , but have no interest in human affairs .
His writings are full of invective against religion .

John of Lackland , English King ( 1199 - 1216 ) ( 1167 ?-1216 ) .
John may not have been a bonafide atheist , but he moved farther in that direction than was common in medieval times .
From the biography , Eleanor of Aquitaine ( John 's mother ) by Alison Weir , p. 234 : " John 's bad press in the monastic chronicles may be attributed to his failures as a king * and his cynical contempt for religion * ; he quarrelled with the Church during his reign and was excommunicated .
' He led such a dissipated life that he ceased to believe in the resurrection of the dead and other articles of the Christian faith ... '( Medieval chroniclers Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris ; quoted in Weir ) .
Once , upon seeing a buck slaughtered , at the end of a hunt , remarked ' You happy beast , never forced to patter prayers nor dragged to Holy Mass . ' "

Francois Marie Arouet " Voltaire " , French author and playwright ( 1694 - 1778 ) .
Perhaps never really an atheist , nonetheless , Voltaire changed late in life into a fearless crusader against religious cruelty and injustice .
" Every sensible man , every honorable man , must hold the Christian sect in horror . "
" Christianity is the most ridiculous , the most absurd and bloody religion that has ever infected the world . "
" If we believe absurdities , we shall commit atrocities . "
" Superstition , born of paganism and adopted by Judaism , invested the Christian Church from earliest times .
All the fathers of the Church , without exception , believed in the power of magic .
The Church always condemned magic , but she always believed in it : she did not excommunicate sorcerers as madmen who were mistaken , but as men who were really in communication with the devil . "

" Doubt is not a pleasant condition , but certainty is absurd . "
Jean Meslier , French erstwhile priest ( 1678 - 1733 ) .
A country priest who led an exemplary life , he died an atheist .
He left behind a memoir which was circulated by Voltaire .
This expressed his disgust with humanity and his inability to believe in God.
Newton 's infinite space , Meslier believed , was the only eternal reality : nothing but matter existed .
Religion was a device used by the rich to oppress the poor and render them powerless .

Thomas Paine , English born American author and revolutionary leader ( 1737-1809 ) .
Labeled an atheist , but actually a deist , raised by Quakers , who was extremely critical of organized religion .
According to Carl Sagan in The Demon Haunted World , " later generations reviled him for his social and religious views .
Theodore Roosevelt called him a ' filthy little atheist .' . . .
He is probably the most illustrious American Revolutionary uncommemorated by a monument in Washington , D.C. "
Paine wrote in The Age of Reason , " Whenever we read the obscene stories , the voluptuous debaucheries , the cruel and torturous executions , the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible [ by which Paine means the Old Testament ] is filled , it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of God .
It is a history of wickedness , that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind ; and , for my own part , I sincerely detest it , as I detest everything that is cruel . "
The Age of Reason also attacks Christianity as a system of superstition that " produces fanatics " and " serves the purposes of despotism . "
When the book reached England , several sellers were convicted of blasphemy and jailed .
" Persecution is not an original feature in any religion ; but it is always the strongly marked feature of all religions established by law . "

Pierre Simon de Laplace , French mathematician and astronomer ( 1749 -1827 ) .
His major contribution to science was a detailed study of gravitation in the universe ; his conclusions were published in his five - volume Traite de mechanique celeste ( Celestial Mechanics ) ...
Laplace presented an early copy of this work to Napoleon , who studied it very carefully .

Ludwig Andreas von Feuerbach , German philosopher ( 1804 - 1872 ) .
Feuerbach was a prominent materialist philosopher of the nineteenth century .
His book ,
The Essence of Christianity , quickly became a classic of freethought literature .
In that book he argued that religion is the projection of human wishes and is a form of alienation .
He began his philosophical career as a Hegelian idealist but soon moved in the direction of materialism thus encouraging the Young Hegelians with whom he was associated to similiarly move .
The Essence of Christianity electrified the Young Hegelians , particularly influencing the youthful Karl Marx who adopted and extended its theory of alienation .
Other thinkers were also influenced by Feuerbach including Nietzsche and Freud .
Interestingly enough despite the fact that he was ( or perhaps because he was ) a leading atheist a number of twentieth century theologians have taken an interest in his thought including Karl Barth , Martin Buber , Paul Tillich , and Karl Rahner amongst others .

[ The Essence Of Christianity ]
Elizur Wright , American ( 1804 - 1885 ) .
Elizur Wright was a life long social reformer .
He was reared in an evangelical Congregationalist family in Connecticut and Ohio .
As a young man he attended Yale with the intention of preparing for a career in the ministry .
While at Yale he became interested in the anti-slavery cause .
He graduated from Yale with growing doubts about entering the ministry but he did spend some time working for the American Tract Society and worked as a school teacher .
Later he took a position as a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Western Reserve College .
There he became further involved in the abolitionist movement moving from support for gradual emancipation and colonization of ex-slaves in Africa to support for the more radical position of immediatism .
After he became a more committed Abolitionist he eventually resigned his position at Western Reserve to work as secretary for the American Anti-Slavery Society .
It was while working for the Abolitionist movement that Wright gradually became disillusioned with the Christian churches and their perceived tolerance for slavery and their general hypocrisy over this issue .
His disillusionment with the churches on moral grounds gradually led down the road towards freethought and atheism while still retaining the moral fervor of his evangelical background .
In 1847 he wrote " Christianity is itself a total failure ... so far as it is a plan of saving souls for a future life without saving souls and bodies for this . "
In 1860 he wrote to his friend Beriah Green - -" I do n't believe in the God of books ... I do n't believe in anything but facts appreciated by some degree of evidence . "
Wright in his old age worked actively on behalf for freethought causes .
He worked for the National Liberal League in association with such prominent freethinkers as Robert Ingersoll .
Towards the end of his life Wright openly described himself as an " infidel , " an " atheist , " and a " pagan . "
He called himself a " materialist " in the tradition of Spinoza , Paine , Darwin , and Huxley .
He was quite partial to the Positivism of August Comte .
Abolitionism and freethought were by no means the only causes that Wright devoted himself to .
He used his mathematical training to establish himself as an insurance actuary and this led him to one of other favorite causes -- that of life insurance reform .
His efforts in that field eventually led to his being appointed commissioner of life insurance in Massachusetts .
As commissioner he sought to place the industry on sound scientific actuarial principles .
Another cause that he devoted himself to was that of conservation .
He successfully fought for the establishment of the Middlesex Fells Reservation ( the Fells are a wooded plateau in and around Medford , Massachusetts ) to preserve the forested lands there from encroaching real estate pressures .
Wright 's Pond and Wright 's Boulder are named for him .

Charles Robert Darwin , English naturalist ( 1809 - 1882 ) .
From the age of forty he was , to use his own words , a complete disbeliever in Christianity .
He professed himself an Agnostic , regarding the problem of the universe as beyond our solution , " For myself , " he wrote , " I do not believe in any revelation .
As for a future life , every man must judge for himself between conflicting vague probabilities . "
" It appears to me ( whether rightly or wrongly ) that direct arguments against christianity and theism produce hardly any effect on the public ; and freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds which follows from the advance of science . "
[ Quoted in How We Believe : The Search for God in an Age of Science by Michael Shermer .
Abraham Lincoln , American president ( 1809 - 1865 ) .
In 2000 Years of Disbelief by James A. Haught , Lincoln is mentioned on pages 125 through 127 .
From the material presented it would seem that Lincoln as a young man was an avid anti-christian and most likely an atheist .
In his later years , he came to believe in God , but was still anti-religious in the sense that he rejected organized religion .
Some selections from Haught :
John T. Stuart , Lincoln 's first law partner : " He was an avowed and open infidel , and sometimes bordered on Atheism ... He went further against Christian beliefs and doctrines and principles than any man I ever heard . "
Joseph Lewis quoting Lincoln in a 1924 speech in New York : " The Bible is not my book nor Christianity my profession .
I could never give assent to the long , complicated statements of Christian dogma . "
Lincoln in a letter to Judge J.S. Wakefield , after the death of Willie Lincoln : " My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures have become clearer and stronger with advancing years , and I see no reason for thinking I shall ever change them . "
As a young man Lincoln apparently wrote a manuscript that he planned to publish , which vehemently argued against the divine origin of the Bible and the Christian scheme of salvation .
Samuel Hill , a friend and mentor , convinced him to drop it , considering the disastrous consequences it would have on his political career .
William H Herndon , a former law partner , wrote a biography on Lincoln titled : The True Story of a Great Life .
In it Herndon discusses Lincoln 's religious views extensively .
Gordon Leidner has collected some quotations from Lincoln 's later years in which he invokes God , and he makes the argument that Lincoln became a sincere believer .
It seems to me he did come to believe in God but never accepted organized Christianity .
Edgar Allan Poe , American writer ( 1809 - 1849 ) .
" No man who ever lived knows any more about the hereafter ... than you and I ; and all religion ... is simply evolved out of chicanery , fear , greed , imagination and poetry . "
" The idea of God , infinity , or spirit stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception . "
Mikhail Bakunin , Russian anarchist leader and writer ( 1814 - 1876 ) .
For Bakunin religion represented an impoverishment of humanity .
Religion according to Bakunin was a weapon of the state that must be abolished to make human self - determination possible .
" A jealous lover of human liberty , and deeming it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in humanity , I reverse the phrase of Voltaire , and say that if God really existed , it would be necessary to abolish him . "

Elizabeth Cady Stanton , American suffragist ( 1815 - 1902 ) .
Stanton was described at her funeral as " a fearless , serene agnostic . "
She was tireless in her criticism of religion and the Bible , decrying their denigration of women .
She wrote of the Bible , " I found nothing grand in the history of the Jews nor in the morals inculcated in the Pentateuch .
Surely the writers had a very low idea of the nature of their god .
They made him not only anthropomorphic , but of the very lowest type , jealous and revengeful , loving violence rather than mercy .
I know of no other books that so fully teach the subjection and degradation of women . "

Her own religious beliefs evolved over the course of her life .
As a young woman , she was briefly under the spell of fundamentalist religion .
Her family led her out of that by taking her on a trip and giving her sensible things to read .
She said , " That disabused my mind of hell and the devil and of a cruel , avenging God , and I have never believed in them since . "
[ Interview , Chicago Record , June 29 , 1897 , quoted in Women Without Superstition ]
Her early political addresses were sprinkled generously with references to God , but as she found her own voice , increasing in confidence and battle - scarred by denunciations against her sacrilege in the popular press , invocations lessened .
When such references occurred , " Nature " and " God " became interchangeable .
[ Women Without Superstition ]
Elizabeth 's daughter , Margaret Stanton Lawrence , recalled , " We children have only pleasant memories of a happy home , of a sunny , cheerful , indulgent mother , whose great effort was to save us from all the fears that shadow the lives of most children .
God was to us sunshine , flowers , affection , all that is grand and beautiful in nature .
The devil had no place at our fireside , nor the Inferno in our dreams of the future . "
Late in her life , Elizabeth wrote , " I can say that the happiest period of my life has been since I emerged from the shadows of superstitions of the old theologies , relieved from all gloomy apprehensions of the future , satisfied that as my labors and capacities were limited to this sphere of action , I was responsible for nothing beyond my horizon , as I could neither understand nor change the condition of the unknown world .
Giving ourselves , then , no trouble about the future , let us make the most of the present , and fill up our lives with earnest work here . "
[ " The Pleasures of Age , " in The Boston Investigator , Feb. 2 , 1901 , quoted in Women Without Superstition ]
In her book on the Bible , the Woman 's Bible , Stanton hailed the changes since the Bible had been written , when " rationalism took the place of religion and reason triumphed over superstition . "
Elizabeth Cady Stanton lived her life without deference to a higher power and advocated such living for others .
Her criticism of religion was not limited to " organized religion , " which is popularly disparaged today .
She decries " superstition , " which probably indicates all religious belief , and trumpets rationalism and reason .
Her identification of God with nature is a way of celebrating the purely secular without directly denouncing the religious beliefs of others .
She is in the camp of other freethinkers of her time , such as Robert Green Ingersoll .

Consequences will take care of themselves . "
" Henceforward , I might hope to hear no more of the assertion that we [ Agnostics ] are necessarily Materialists , Idealists , Atheists , Theists , or any other ists , if experience had led me to think that the proved falsity of a statement was any guarantee against its reputation .
And those who appreciate the nature of our position will see , at once , that when Ecclesiasticism declares that we ought to believe this , that , and the other , and are very wicked if we do n't , it is impossible for us to give any answer but this :
We have not the slightest objection to believe anything you like , if you will give us good grounds for belief ; but , if you cannot , we must respectfully refuse , even if that refusal should wreck morality and insure our own damnation several times over .
We are quite content to leave that decision to the future .
The course of the past has impressed us with the firm conviction that no good ever comes out of falsehood , and we feel warranted in refusing even to experiment in that direction " [ essay " Agnosticism and Christianity " ]

Sir Leslie Stephen , English writer and thinker ( 1832-1904 ) .
Sir Leslie Stephen was one of Britain 's most famous agnostics of the nineteenth century .
In fact while Thomas Huxley was the person who coined the term agnostic it was Stephen who popularized it .
Leslie Stephen was born into a family of prominent Evangelicals of the Clapham Sect .
He was educated at Eton and at Trinity Hall , Cambridge .
At Cambridge he was made a fellow which in those days required taking holy orders and he was ordained an Anglican priest .
By 1862 his developing religious doubts led him to resign his fellowship and by 1864 he left Cambridge for good .
He married Thackeray 's daughter , Harriet Marian in 1867 but she died in 1875 leaving him one child .
He later married Julia Jackson Duckworth and had four children including his best known child the novelist Virginia Woolf .
After abandoning his academic career he made his living as a journalist and writer .
He edited the Dictionary of National Biography .
He also wrote extensively on history , religion , and philosophy .
Leslie Stephen 's agnosticism was rooted in considerations of the problem of evil .
Attempts to resolve this problem by emphasizing the transcendence and incomprehensibility of God was to him simply evasiveness .
Such apologetics was in his view simply a disguised skepticism .
The rejection of belief in God for Stephen raised the question of how to ground morality if there is no deity .
That is he sought to answer the Dostoyevskian question " If there is no God is not everything permitted ? "
Stephen sought to answer this question in his book The Science of Ethics .
There he proposed a scientific ethics in which J.S. Mill 's utilitarianism would be synthesized with evolutionary theory .
In addition to The Science of Ethics , Stephen wrote many other works including Essays on Freethinking and Plainspeaking ( 1873 ) , An Agnostic 's Apology and Other Essays ( 1893 ) , as well as History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century ( 1876 ) , and The English Utilitarians ( 1900 ) .

" O Lord our God , help us tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells ; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead ; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of their wounded , writhing in pain ; help us to lay waste their humble homes with a hurricane of fire ; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief ; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst , sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter , broken in spirit , worn with travail , imploring
Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it . . . "

[ The Twilight of the Idols and The Antichrist ]
He had encouraged people to fear their bodies , their passions and their sexuality and had promoted a puling morality of compassion which had made us weak .

" It would be very nice if there were a God who created the world and was a benevolent providence , and if there were a moral order in the universe and an after - life ; but it is a very striking fact that all this is exactly as we are bound to wish it to be . "
" In the long run , nothing can withstand reason and experience , and the contradiction religion offers to both is palpable . "
" The whole thing is so patently infantile , so foreign to reality , that to anyone with a friendly attitude to humanity it is painful to think that the great majority of mortals will never be able to rise above this view of life . "
Freud certainly regarded belief in God as an illusion that mature men and women should lay aside .
The idea of God was not a lie but a device of the unconscious which needed to be decoded by psychology .
A personal god was nothing more than an exalted father - figure : desire for such a deity sprang from infantile yearnings for a powerful , protective father , for justice and fairness and for life to go on forever .
God is simply a projection of these desires , feared and worshipped by human beings out of an abiding sense of helplessness .
Religion belonged to the infancy of the human race ; it had been a necessary stage in the transition from childhood to maturity .
It had promoted ethical values which were essential to society .
Now that humanity had come of age , however , it should be left behind .

Jose P. Rizal , Philippine national leader ( 1861-1896 ) .
Rizal , the greatest son and hero of the Philippines and pride of the Malay race , whose writings attacking the Catholic church and the friars inspired the religious and political revolution against Spanish colonial theocracy .
He is considered the first modern Asian rational humanist whose role in the liberation of the Philippines from the grip of priesthood paralled that of Tom Paine whose writings inspired the 1776 revolution in the US .
Rizal was condemned to death for treason and sedition in 1896 by the Spanish colonial government and executed on December 30 of that year .
The Spanish friars then libeled Rizal 's good name by circulating a forged document entitled " Retraction of Errors " where Rizal supposedly retracted his affiliation with the Masons and admitted his errors in all writings where he revealed the abuses of the Spanish friars .
On the eve of his execution , Rizal finished and succeeded in smuggling out prison a poem he wrote popularly known as his " Ultimo Adios " or " Last Farewall " which is considered even by Spanish literary critics as one of the most poignant poems ever written in the Spanish language .

Joseph McCabe , English anti-religion campaigner ( 1867-1955 ) .
One of the giants of not only English Atheism , but world Atheism , Joseph McCabe left a legacy of aggressive Atheist and antireligious literature that remains fresh and insightful today .
His many works -- he wrote nearly 250 books -- could constitute a library of Atheism by themselves .
Born in 1867 , Joseph McCabe became a Franciscan monk at the age of nineteen .
But disgusted with his fellow monks and the Christian doctrine , he left the priesthood for good on February 19 , 1896 .
Not long afterwards , he began to write -- first against the priesthood itself and then for the position of Atheism .
He was one of the founding members of Britain 's Rationalist Press Association , and was a prolific writer for Haldeman - Julius Publications .
He was also a much - respected speaker , giving , by his own estimate , three or four thousand lectures in the United States , Australia , and Great Britain by the age of eighty .
Still fighting against the injustices and dishonesties of religion , he died on January 10 , 1955 , at the age of eighty - seven .
The epitaph he requested was " He was a rebel to his last day . "

Diego Rivera , Mexican muralist painter ( 1886-1982 ) .
From his autobiography , My Art , My Life : An Autobiography by Diego Rivera Gladys March narrating an encounter with bigots at a church : " Stupid people !
You reek of dirt and stupidity !
You are so crazy that you believe that if I were to ask the portrait of my father , hanging in my house , for one peso , the portrait would actually give me one peso .
You are utter idiots .
In order to get pesos , I have to ask someone who has pesos to spare and is willing to give some to me .
You talk of heaven , pointing with your fingers over your head .
What heaven is there ?
There is only air , clouds which give rain , lightening which makes a loud sound and breaks the tree branches , and birds flying .
There are no boys with wings nor any ladies or gentlemen sitting on clouds .
Clouds are water vapor which goes up when the heat of the sun 's rays strikes the rivers and lakes .
You can see this vapor from the Guanajuato mountains .
It turns to water which falls in drops , and so we have rain .
At the entrance of this place , I saw boxes to collect money , and a man asking for more money .
I also know the priest who comes often to our house to drink my aunt 's good chocolate and glasses of liquor .
With the money he collects for the church , he pays the painters and sculptors to paint all these lies and puppets .
He does this to get more money to make stupid people like you believe that these are truths and to make you fear the Virgin Mary and God .
In order to have the priest appease these idols to spare you because you are cruel , dirty , and bad people , you give this money to the priest .
Does that fear stop the beggars , the poor people , and the jobless miners from sneaking into the houses of the rich people , the grocery stores , the clothing stores of the gabachos , and the haciendas of the gringos , and taking from them a little of what they need ?
What about you , you old fool ?
If there really is a Holy Virgin or anyone up in the air , tell them to send lightening to strike me down or let the stones of the vault fall on my head .
If you are unable to do that Mr. Priest , you 're nothing but a puppet taking money from stupid old women .
You 're no better than the clown in the circus coaxing coins from the public .
If God does n't stop me , then there must be no God .
Get out of here !

( Though at the time he was apparently still a church - going Catholic . )

Here are extracts from Lovecraft ; A Biography by L. Sprague De Camp :
" H. P. Lovecraft was strongly influenced , not only by his mother but also by the books he read .
. . .
At five , he . . . ( read ) . . . a junior edition of The Arabian Nights .
He at once fell in love with the glories of medieval Islam and spent hours playing Arab .
. . .
One effect of dabbling in non-Christian traditions was to make Lovecraft skeptical of the faith of his fathers .
Before he reached his fifth birthday anniversary , young Lovecraft announced that he no longer believed in Santa Claus .
Further private thought convinced him that arguments for the existence of God suffered the same weaknesses as those for Santa .
" At five , Lovecraft was placed in the infant class of the Sunday school of the venerable First Baptist Meeting House on College Hill .
The results were not what the elders expected .
When the feeding of Christian martyrs to the lions came up , Lovecraft shocked the class by gleefully taking the side of the lions .
He wrote :
The absurdity of the myths I was called upon to accept and the sombre greyness of the whole faith compared with the Eastern magnificence of Mahometanism , made me definitely an agnostic ; and caused me to become so pestiferous a questioner that I was permitted to discontinue attendance .
. . .
My grandfather had travelled observingly through Italy , and delighted me with long , first - hand accounts of its beauties and memorials of ancient grandeur .
I mention this aesthetic tendency in detail only to lead up to its philosophical result - my last flickering of religious belief .
" . . .
His skeptical view of the supernatural - his nontheism - and his love of the Classical world were not the only lasting passions formed in his childhood .
" . . . he embraced eighteenth - century rationalism , which confirmed him in his atheistic materialism . "

Rudolf Carnap , German - American philosopher ( 1891 - 1970 ) .
A central figure of the Vienna Circle which was devoted to the philosophy of logical positivism .
In his Intellectual Autobiography printed in The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap ed. by Paul Schilpp ( La Salle , Illinois : Open Court , 1963 ) he described the basic worldview he shared with the rest of the Circle in the following terms :
" . . . the first is the view that man has no supernatural protectors or enemies . . .
Second , we had the conviction that mankind is able to change the conditions of life in such a way that many of the sufferings of today may be avoided . . . the third is the view that all deliberate action presupposes knowledge of the world , that the scientific method is the best method of acquiring knowledge and that therefore science must be regarded as one of the most valuable instruments for the improvement of human life .
In Vienna we had no names for these views ; if we look for a brief designation in American terminology for the combination of these three convictions , the best would seem to be ' scientific humanism . ' "
Josip Broz , " Tito " , Yugoslavian statesman ( 1892-1980 ) .
I do n't have good evidence that Tito was an atheist , but it seems likely .
Despite being raised in a Croat Catholic family , he became a communist and , when he achieved power , he interrupted relations witht he Vatican , accusing them of collaborating with the Nazis in Croatia during the war .
At the end of the war , he condemned Bishop Stepinac - who was really old by then - to forced labor in jail .
His problems with Vatican lasted at least until the seventies .

As Hayek confesses , he " felt that if somebody really wanted religion , he had better stick to what seemed to be the ' true article , ' that is , Roman Catholicism .
Protestantism always appeared to me a step in the process of emancipation from a superstition -- a step which , once taken , must lead to complete unbelief " ( 41 ) . "

Ernest Hemingway , American author ( 1899 - 1961 ) .
" All thinking men are atheists . " [ A Farewell to Arms ]
On page 144 of Paul Johnson 's book Intellectuals , it states that despite being raised in a strict Congregationalist houshold , Ernest " did not only not believe in God but regarded organized religion as a menace to human happiness " , " seems to have been devoid of the religious spirit " , and " ceased to practise religion at the earliest possible moment . "
Other 's have pointed out to me that Hemingway used the non-existence of God as a theme in his books .

Corliss Lamont , humanist philosopher and civil liberities activist ( 1902 - 1995 ) .
Karl Popper , Austrian / British philosopher ( 1902 - 1994 ) .
He was the author of such well - known works as The Logic of Scientific Discovery , The Open Society and Its Enemies , The Poverty of Historicism , Conjectures and Refutations , and many others .
He was particularly influential in the philosophy of science for his defense of fallibilism and his critique of induction .
Popper described himself as an agnostic , and he was a member of the Academy of Humanism .
The magazine , Skeptic Vol. 6 , No. 2 ( 1998 ) features a 1969 interview with Karl Popper - " Karl Popper On God : The Lost Interview " by Edward Zerin .
In this interview Popper discusses his agnosticism , his attitudes towards both Judaism and Christianity , the reasons for his disbelief which he combined with a respect for the moral teachings of both religions etc .
Interestingly enough the interviewer , Edward Zerin , is a rabbi .
Sidney Hook , American philsopher ( 1902 - 1989 ) .
Sidney Hook did his undergraduate studies at City College in New York City and his graduate work at Columbia University where he studied under John Dewey and Frederick Woodbrige .
He wrote his thesis The Metaphysics of Pragmatism under Dewey 's direction .
After receiving his doctorate he pursued further studies in Berlin and Munich and at the Marx - Engels Institute in Moscow .
In 1933 he returned to the U. S. to teach philosophy at New York University as one of the first Marxist professors in the U. S. During the 1930's he attempted to synthesize Marxism with Dewey 's pragmatism - a project that I would consider to be of still great relevence .
He treated philosophy as the development of a critical and scientific intelligence to the clarification of human values and concrete social problems - a view he retained all his life .
In the late 1920's he prepared an English translation of Lenin 's Materialism and Empiro - criticism , Lenin 's polemic agaist Ernst Mach .
In the 1930's he wrote Towards the Understanding of Karl Marx and he wrote From Hegel to Marx which even today still stand as the most significant pieces of Marxist scholarship produced in America .
In the early 1930 's he was very close to if not an actual member of the Communist Party but later in the decade he took a strong anti-Stalinist position .
He was a founder of the American Worker 's Party and later of the Socialist Worker 's Party .
By the 1940's his polit- ical views began moving somewhat to the right .
He supported Norman Thomas ' Socialist Party .
By the 1950's he had become a staunch anticommunist and argued for the expulsion of Communist professors and students from the universities .
As a member of the " New York Intellectuals " his political and philosophical views carried considerable weight amongst academics .
Regardless of what one might think of Hook 's political views it seems he was regarded as a great teacher and many of his students rose to prominence in philosophy and other fields .
Among his most well known students rank Delmore Schwartz who was a poet and critic , union leader Albert Shanker president of the American Federation of Teachers , and philosopher Paul Kurtz .
Sidney Hook was an outspoken humanist and atheist .
He was active in such humanist organizations as the AHA and CODESH ( which his former student Paul Kurtz founded .
Hook also wrote for the magazines , The Humanist and Free Inquiry .

Margaret Knight ( 1903 - 1983 ) .
George Orwell ( 1903 - 1950 ) .
Orwell 's biography calls him an atheist .
His books also have themes that are explicitly and / or suggestively anti-religious .
In Animal Farm , the parody was a raven named Moses who told the animals stories about a great mountain in the sky that they would go to when they died , called Sugar Candy Mountain .
In 1984 , the concept of Big Brother is a parody of God :
You never see him , but the fact of him is drilled into so many people 's minds that they become robots , almost .
Plus , if you speak bad against Big Brother , it 's a Thoughtcrime .
From A Clergyman's Daughter , 1935 :
" When I eat my dinner I do n't do it to the greater glory of God ; I do it because I enjoy it .
The world 's full of amusing things - books , wine , travel , friends - everything .
I 've never seen any meaning in it all , and I do n't want to see one .
Why not take life as you find it ?. "
Burrhus Frederick " B. F. " Skinner , American Psychologist ( 1904 - 1990 ) .

He replied , " I do n't believe in God , so I 'm not afraid of dying . "
Joseph Campbell , American mythologist ( 1904 - 1987 ) .
" . . . god is a metaphor for that which trancends all levels of intellectual thought .
It 's as simple as that . "
" Too many of our best scholars , themselves indoctrinated from infancy in a religion of one kind or another based upon the Bible , are so locked into the idea of their own god as a supernatural fact - something final , not symbolic of transcendence , but a personage with a character and will of his own - that they are unable to grasp the idea of a worship that is not of the symbol but of its reference , which is of a mystery of much greater age and of more immediate inward reality than the name - and - form of any historical ethinic idea of a deity , whatsoever . . . and is of a sophistication that makes the sentimentalism of our popular Bible - story theology seem undeveloped . "
Howard Hughes , American manufacturer , film producer , and recluse ( 1905 - 1976 ) .
Joseph Fletcher American ethicist ( 1905 - 1991 ) .
Known for his situation ethics .
In the 1960's , Fletcher , while still a Christian and still teaching at the Episcopal Theological School , published his famous book Situation Ethics in which he challenged conventional thinking in both moral theology and secular moral philosophy .
He rejected the traditional approach to solving moral problems by appealing to well validated moral priciples .
Instead he proposed a kind of act utilitarianism in which agapean love was seen as the highest good rather than pleasure and the avoidance of pain .
Back in the 1960's the mainline Protestant churches seemed receptive to Fletcher 's ideas but later on as the churches became more conservative the term " situation ethics " acquired negative connotations .
Situation ethics became widely portrayed as a way of rationalizing immoral actions .
In reality Fletcher had developed situation ethics as a method for dealing with such difficult issues in medical ethics as abortion , euthanasia , the question of whether severely brain damaged newborn infants should be allowed to die , etc .
Fletcher showed that in dealing with such issues , appeal to well validated moral priciples was likely to yield answers that are profoundly inhumane .
Joseph Fletcher eventually left the Christian faith and became a humanist , annoucing that he was an agnostic .

Charles P. Helin , American inventor and businessman ( 1905 - 1979 ) .
This testimonial was received from Charles ' son , Wally :
My father is known primarily to fisherman across the world .
As a poor man with a ninth grade education , my father invented the " Flatish " fishing lure and in 1937 started the Helin Tackle Company .
He started selling millions of them across the world .
The Flatish is still today one the best selling artificial fishing lures .
By 1942 , he was a self - made millionaire and was living in a 37 room mansion by 1944 .
He was well known in the Grosse Pointe , Michigan area for his " rags to riches " story .
He was , as far as I know , a lifetime atheist and I was raised as such .
He used to tell me that when he died , I could " sweep his carcass off the back porch " and then go on about my business .

Sartre insisted that even if God existed [ which he did not believe ] , it was still necessary to reject him , since the idea of God negates our freedom .
Traditional religion tells us that we must conform to God 's idea of humanity to become fully human .
Instead , we must see human beings as liberty incarnate .

" History does not record anywhere or at any time a religion that has any rational basis .
Religion is a crutch for people not strong enough to stand up to the unknown without help .
But , like dandruff , most people do have a religion and spend time and money on it and seem to derive considerable pleasure from fiddling with it . "

Gene Kelly , American dancer , singer , actor , and director ( 1912 -1996 ) .
From the biography , Gene Kelly : A Life of Dance and Dreams p. 58
" Somehow , driving through Mexico , observing the poverty of the peasants in abject prayer at the churches , rich with gold and silver jewels , he was sickened by the contrast .
He abhorred the role of the Church in supporting the fascist Franco against the Spanish Republic .
Now , seing it firsthand , the failure of the Church , his church , to come to grips meaningfully with the physical and spiritual needs of the poor opened his eyes to the hypocrisy of what he called " organized religion . "
Feeding into his consciousness were his recent meetings with simpatico contacts who had influenced him with their outspoken attitudes - Robeson , Comden , Green , and many left - wing intellectuals .
On the return trip , long before they saw Pittsburgh looming in the distance , he made it plain to his father that he was now a complete agnostic .
His father could tell Harriet [ Gene 's mother ] or not , as he chose .
But no longer would Gene Kelly be dominated by the wishes and preferences of his mother . "

" I regret my disbelief in God . "
" To abdicate from the rule of reason and substitute for it an authentication of belief by the intentness and degree of conviction with which we hold it can be perilous and destructive .
Religious beliefs give a spurious spiritual dimension to tribal enmities ... " .
" It goes with the passionate intensity and deep conviction of the truth of a religious belief , and of course of the importance of the superstitious observances that go with it , that we should want others to share it - and the only certain way to cause a religious belief to be held by everyone is to liquidate nonbelievers .
The price in blood and tears that mankind generally has had to pay for the comfort and spiritual refreshment that relion has brought to a few has been too great to justify our entrusting moral accountancy to religious belief . "

Isaac Asimov , Russian - born American author ( 1920 - 1992 ) .
" I am an atheist , out and out .
It took me a long time to say it .
I 've been an atheist for years and years , but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say that one is an atheist , because it assumed knowledge that one did n't have .
Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or agnostic .
I do n't have the evidence to prove that God does n't exist , but I so strongly suspect that he does n't that I do n't want to waste my time . "
Gene Roddenberry , Creator of Star Trek ( 1921-1991 ) .
See statements by Roddenberry in the March / April 1991 issue of The Humanist magazine , and the fall 1992 issue of Free Inquiry magazine .
In these he explains how his purpose with Star Trek was to create a god - free , humanistic view of the universe .
" I condemn false prophets , I condemn the effort to take away the power of rational decision , to drain people of their free will -- and a hell of a lot of money in the bargain .
Religions vary in their degree of idiocy , but I reject them all .
For most people , religion is nothing more than a substitute for a malfunctioning brain . "
" We must question the story logic of having an all - knowing all - powerful God , who creates faulty Humans , and then blames them for his own mistakes . "
William M. Gaines , American publisher ( 1922-1992 ) .
Founder and publisher of Mad magazine .
He was quite definitely an atheist , according to Frank Jacobs 's biography , The MAD World of William M. Gaines .

When asked at a press conference in 1966 " Why do you deal with religious themes , you yourself being an unbeliever ? " , Pasolini replied : " If you know that I am an unbeliever , then you know me better than I do myself .
I may be an unbeliever , but I am an unbeliever who has a nostalgia for a belief .
" For biographical information see The Internet Movie Database or this page dedicated to Pasolini .
Charles Schulz , American cartoonist ( 1922-2000 ) .
In an interview in 1999 , Schulz described how his philosophical views had evolved over the years .
He had once been a very active Christian , even doing some preaching in the Church of God in Minneapolis .
But , by the time of this article , he was able to conclude , " the term that best describes me now is ' secular humanist . ' "
It would appear from the article that he continued to be sympathetic to the Christian point of view , but he went on to criticize narrow - minded and shallow takes on Christianity , saying , " I despise those shallow religious comics .
Dennis the Menace , for instance , is the most shallow .
When they show him praying -- I just can't stand that sort of thing , talking to God about some cutesy thing that he'd done during the day .
I do n't think Hank Ketcham [ Dennis ' creator ] has any deep knowledge of things like that . "
Schulz cringed at the mention of Family Circus , the strip by Bill Keane that is strewn with cutesy references to Jesus ( who wants to protect children on school buses , but ca n't because of laws about separation of church and state ! ) and those sickly - sweet images of invisible deceased grandparents looming protectively over the kids .
" Oh , I ca n't stand that , " Schulz laughed .
" You could get diabetes reading them , could n't you ? "
Madalyn Murray O'Hair , American atheist activist ( 1923-1995 ) .
O'Hair challenged prayer in the schools in the US Supreme Court ( Murray vs. Curlett ) and won .
She went on to found American Atheists and became perhaps America 's most infamous and outspoken atheist .
When asked , " Do you support religious freedon , " she responded , " Oh , absolutely !
I feel that everyone has a right to be insane .
And that they can do this any place at all .
If they want religious schools , build them !
My only problem with that is , do not ask for the land to be tax - free .
Do not ask for a government grant to build them .
Do not ask for money for teacher 's salaries , or more books , or anything else .
Just go ahead and do your thing , and do it yourself .
Just exactly the same as if you were a nudist .

Marcello Mastroianni , Italian actor ( 1924-1996 ) .
Escaped from a Nazi labor camp during World War II and later became known for his roles as a harried " Latin lover . "
From an interview with the actor at Cannes 96 in Le Monde :
Q : - Do you still have as much desire to act ?
A : - I keep getting proposals .
My friends tell me that I 'm incredibly lucky and it 's true .
I love life and life has been generous to me .
When I was young , I used to watch my mother go to church for confession and I would ask her , " Why do you go to confession ?
You work from morning to night and when things are miserable , Father slaps you .
When do you ever sin ? "
She told me that it was God 's will and we must accept it .
I did n't like that .
I do n't believe in God but in life .
But in the end , my attitude is not far from my mother's .
I accept things as they come .
When you 're a star everybody makes a fuss over you and everybody loves you .
The acting profession is one of the best around and on top of it , you 're paid well .
And yet we still complain .
I am amazed when I hear American stars talk about the pain and terrible effort acting requires .
What pain ?
Paul Van Buren , American theologian ( 1924-1998 ) .
In the book , The Secular Meaning of the Gospel , he claimed that it was no longer possible to speak of God acting in the world .
Science and technology had made the old mythology invalid .
Simple faith in the Old Man in the Sky was clearly impossible , but so was the more sophisticated belief of the theologians .
We must do without God and hold on to Jesus of Nazareth .
The Gospel was " the good news of a free man who has set other men free . "

Richard Burton , Welsh actor ( 1925 - 1984 ) .
According to the Denver Post , Richard Burton wrote this in his diary in 1969 : " The more I read about man and his maniacal ruthlessness and his murderous envious scatological soul , the more I realize that he will never change .
Our stupidity is immortal , nothing will change it .
The same mistakes , the same prejudices , the same injustice , the same lusts wheel endlessly around the parade ground of the centuries .
Immutable and ineluctable .
I wish I could believe in a god of some kind but I simply cannot . "

After having asked Chancellor whether he feared death to which he replied " not as much as I would have thought ... "
Thomas then asked what he thought would happen to him after death .
Chancellor replied " I 've been an agnostic for as long as I can remember ... so I do n't know where we go .
But if it turns out that the lights are just turned off and nothing happens , well , that 's OK . "
Olof Palme , Swedish prime minister ( 1927 -1986 ) .
Palme is said to be partly responsible for the current state of wide - spread disbelief in Sweden .
He had conflicts with the Church of Sweden during his administration , because he wished to separate it completely from the state .
He said , " human beings will find a balanced situation when they do good things not because God says it , but because they feel like doing them . "
George C. Scott , American Actor ( 1927-1999 ) .

Brigid Brophy , author ( 1929 - ? ) .
Anton Szandor LaVey , American ( 1930 - 1997 ? ) .
Here is some information about LaVey , provided by Aaron Jacques :
LaVey
Was most definitely an anti-christian , and despite his recommendation of " using " various gods , I am quite certain he was atheist .
He formed the Church of Satan , not only to frighten the status quo , but more as an alternative to secularism .
He wrote that it was necessary for man to have a fantasy element in his life .
LaVey 's satanism provides this in the form of rich ceremonies .
The idea behind which is not that one is praying to an actual being but is unleashing mental / emotional / physical energies which have the power to alter the state of one 's existence .
Most satanists do n't believe in satan or any other deity in a physical sense but more as a force of nature .
In the introduction to The Satanic Bible , Burton H. Wolfe recalls a story told to him by LaVey about his youth , when he worked in a traveling carnival :
" On Saturday night , I would see men lusting after half - naked girls dancing at the carnival , and on Sunday morning when I was playing organ for tent - show evangelists at the other end of the carnival lot , I would see these same men sitting in the pews with their wives and children , asking God to forgive them and purge them of carnal desires .
And the next Saturday they'd be back at the carnival or some other place of indulgence .
I knew then that the Christianchurch thrives on hypocrisy , and that man 's carnal nature will out no matter how much it is purged or scoured by any white - light religion "
However , some claim that The Church of Satan is nothing more than a scam cooked up by an " old carnie " to take people 's money ( there is a $ 100 membership fee ) .

Carl Sagan , American astronomer and author ( 1934 -1996 ) .
There was an article , " In the Valley of the Shadow " in the March 10 , 1996 issue of Parade Magazine in which Sagan discussed his atheistic beliefs in the face of his own death .
In a March 1996 profile by Jim Dawson in the Minneapolis Star - Tribune , Sagan talked about his then - new book The Demon Haunted World and was asked about his personal spiritual views .
" My view is that if there is no evidence for it , then forget about it , " he said .
" An agnostic is somebody who does n't believe in something until there is evidence for it , so I 'm agnostic . "
When asked how he would explain a " genuine mystical experience , " Sagan responded : " Your question presupposes the existence of a genuine mystical experience and I 'm not sure what that is .
People have vivid hallucinations .
How do you distinguish between altered states of consciousness ?
" If someone who has had an experience that tells us something about the universe that we did n't know and that later turns out to be true , then we'd have to say , ' My goodness . ' "
But that , he said , " would have to be more than the anecdotal reports that typically are used to support religious experiences . "
Turan Dursun , Turkish writer ( 1934-1990 ) .
According to his son , Yücel Dursun , Turan Dursun was an Islamic holy man before he became an atheist , rejecting religion and God .
After rejecting religion he wrote several books on the Qur'an and on religion in general .
He claimed that Islam is not consistent with reason and science , and he argued that holy books did n't come from God .
His books include : Din Bu I - IV ( This is Religion ) , Kutsal Kitaplarin Kaynaklari ( Resource of Holy Books ) , Kur'an Ansiklopedisi I -VIII ( Qur'an Encyclopedia ) .
He also wrote several shorter papers on religion .
He was shot and killed by terrorists .

And I wo n't be laughing at the lies when I 'm gone
And I can't question how or when or why when I 'm gone
Ca n't live proud enough to die when I 'm gone
So I guess I 'll have to do it while I 'm here

Douglas Adams , British author ( 1951 -2001 ) .
Author of Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , and other books .
From an interview with Adams in American Atheist magazine : " ... I really do mean Atheist .
I really do not believe that there is a god - in fact I am convinced that there is not a god ( a subtle difference ) .
I see not a shred of evidence to suggest that there is one .
It 's easier to say that I am a radical Atheist , just to signal that I really mean it , have thought about it a great deal , and that it 's an opinion I hold seriously .
It 's funny how many people are genuinely surprised to hear a view expressed so strongly . "
Adams espoused his atheism on his own web site , www.douglasadams.com.
Here is a sample .
Mike Mentzer , American body - builder ( 1951-2001 ) .
Mike Mentzer was a famous body - builder of the 1970's and later .
In an interview , he said :
Q : Do you believe in God ?
MM : If I believed in heaven and hell , I 'd have to believe in God .
I do n't believe in God .
I have no doubt there 's not a God .
Therefore , there 's no heaven or hell .
I 'm an objectivist , a student of the philosophy of Ayn Rand , whose basic tenet is that one must be fully committed to reason and reality .
It 's good reason that in reality it 's impossible for there to be a God .
There 's no way , in the nature of things , for God to exist , at least as He is commonly defined .

Rationale for Selection
The meanings of words like atheist have changed over time .
Throughout history , people have had many different belief systems that varied in subtle ways .
Frequently , deciding whether or not a person is a nontheist is not a simple question .
My basic criteria has been to select people who advocate living life without deference to any transcendent power .
Agnostics are certainly included , and I have included some deists since they generally consider God as historically necessary for creation but otherwise irrelevant .
Because of the variety and complexity of the views expressed by these people , and because a single label can never capture the belief system of a complex person , I have tried to include quotations that demonstrate their particular views whenever possible .

the " food crisis " issue has been popping up more regularly , and it is not part of my imagination
In the past months , I have been posting regularly about the global food crisis :
Those of you who have been following this blog for a while know I work for a humanitarian agency , so automatically my view of news articles is biased : scanning news bulletins I am rather sensitive to possible lurking crisis , be it armed conflicts , natural disasters or plain economic issues that could cause humanitarian problems .
Plus of course , this is our job , this is what we do for a living : trying to spot , mitigate and react to humanitarian crisis in the making or unfolding .
On top of this , working for aaid agency , the issue of raisingprices , the dilemma of biofuel production versusproduction , changing weather patterns decreasing theproduction are automatically issues which catch my eyes faster .
So I have been asking myself the question : " Is the global food crisis really that big an issue , or is it blown out of proportion by the media , amplified by my built - in sensitivity to food aid issues ? " .
Over the past weeks , I have been scanning the media rigorously .
A few months ago , I set up a Pageflakes newsfeed tool which takes RSS feeds from about 100 news sources : Western and non-Western media , citizen journalism and social bookmarking sites .
My Pageflakes tool gives me , in three screens , at a glance , an overview of ten news posts per news site , resulting in about 1,000 article headlines which are automatically updated as new headlines are released .
Scanning those articles , I can state objectively :
The worrying factor is also a trend I have seen : Starting from " early warning " signs from humanitarian agencies , more and more reports come up about food riots in different countries , to - and that is what is really worrying me - articles that predict the potential global food supply shortages or inaccessibility of food ( due to the sharply inflated prices ) , might lead governments to act in a drastic way .
Government steps being taken are to close their borders for food exports , containing food prices by extensive subsidies , or cancelling these due to the long term unsustainability , and bilateral agreements between countries to ' ensure a secure food supply ' ...
Worrying .
Reminds me of the same measures countries take to secure the supply of oil resources .
Now the apotheose of it all , and what causes me nightmares is the more frequent recurring link being made between food shortages ( and all the related issues like global warming decreasing food production , biofuel consuming food , etc.. ) , security and armed conflicts .
And it not merely in titles like " Food Fights " , but also in contents .
Some examples :
And then you might think I am going completely nutter to quote Nostradamus : " Famine and fighting will set in .
Countries will fight with each other over surplus food : India and China will march to seize the corn and wheat fields of Russia and eastern Europe . "
So tell me : am I a doomsday preacher or are we really heading for a period of armed conflicts , not as part of the " War on Terror " , or the " War for Oil " , but a " War for Food " ?
Update April 23 2008 :
- " The World Bank now believes that some 33 countries are in danger of being destabilised by food price inflation " ( Article )
- " Climate change could cause global conflicts as large as the two world wars but lasting for centuries unless the problem is controlled , a leading defence think tank has warned . "

Hackers have succeeded in breaking into the computer systems of two of the U.S. ' most important science labs , the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) in Tennessee and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
In what a spokesperson for the Oak Ridge facility described as a " sophisticated cyber attack , " it appears that intruders accessed a database of visitors to the Tennessee lab between 1990 and 2004 , which included their social security numbers and dates of birth .
Three thousand researchers reportedly visit the lab each year , a who 's who of the science establishment in the U.S .
The attack was described as being conducted through several waves of phishing emails with malicious attachments , starting on Oct. 29 .
Although not stated , these would presumably have launched Trojans if opened , designed to bypass security systems from within , which raises the likelihood that the attacks were targeted specifically at the lab .
ORNL director , Thom Mason , described the attacks in an email to staff earlier this week as being a " coordinated attempt to gain access to computer networks at numerous laboratories and other institutions across the country . "
" Because of the sensitive nature of this event , the laboratory will be unable for some period to discuss further details until we better understand the full nature of this attack , " he added .
The ORNL has set up a web page giving an official statement on the attacks , with advice to employees and visitors that they should inform credit agencies so as to minimize the possibility of identity theft .
Less is known about the attacks said to have been launched against the ORNL 's sister - institution at Los Alamos , but the two are said to be linked .
It has not been confirmed that the latter facility was penetrated successfully , though given that a Los Alamos spokesman said that staff had been notified of an attack on Nov. 9 - days after the earliest attack wave on the ORNL - the assumption has to be that something untoward happened there as well , and probably at other science labs across the U.S .
The ORNL is a multipurpose science lab , a site of technological expertise used in homeland security and military research , and also the site of one of the world 's fastest supercomputers .
Los Alamos operates a similar multi-disciplinary approach , but specializes in nuclear weapons research , one of only two such sites doing such top - secret work in the U.S .
Los Alamos has a checkered security history , having suffered a sequence of embarrassing breaches in recent years .
In August of this year , it was revealed that the lab had released sensitive nuclear research data by email , while in 2006 a drug dealer was allegedly found with a USB stick containing data on nuclear weapons tests .
" This appears to be a new low , even drug dealers can get classified information out of Los Alamos , " Danielle Brian , executive director of the Project On Government Oversight ( POGO ) , said at the time .
Two years earlier , the lab was accused of having lost hard disks
The possibility that the latest attacks were the work of fraudsters will be seen by some as optimistic - less positive would be the possibility of a rival government having been involved .
Given the apparently coordinated nature of events , speculation will inevitably point to this scenario , with the data theft a cover motivation for more serious incursions .

Buffy 's Romp : Marketing Ploy or Part of the Plot ?
Buffy finds herself in bed with another woman in the latest issue of the comic .
March 6 , 2008  -- Buffy Summers has now done it all .
After spending nearly a decade slaying vampires and demons and carefully juggling her schoolwork with her budding teen romances , Buffy of " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " now also knows what it 's like to have a one - night stand -- with a woman .
In the latest installment of the comic book series " Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight " -- which continues the saga that began in a 1993 film and then continued during seven seasons of a hit television series --
Buffy takes a break from her vampire duties to jump into bed with Satsu , a fellow slayer .
" Wow , " says Buffy in the comic , hand on sweaty brow , naked body wrapped in tangled bed sheets .
" That was ... that was ... Wow . "
" ' That was wow ' pretty much covers it , " responds Satsu , who , also dripping with sweat , clutches Buffy 's 20 - something body .
The comic 's illustrators -- seemingly inspired by the sexy narrative -- litter the bedside with discarded bras and panties .
While the scene , which was first reported by The New York Times , may initially come across as a little too sexy and a little too soft porn , Joss Whedon , executive producer of the strip , told ABCNEWS.com that the story line flowed naturally and is nothing to gape at .
" We had already established that there was this character , Satsu , was in love with Buffy and that Buffy was kind of lonesome , " said Whedon .
" [ We decided ] it would be fun if they just went ahead and did it , rather than have it be a ' will they wo n't they ' situation . "
Despite Whedon 's assertion that Buffy 's adventurous sexuality is nothing new -- after all , her best friend on the show , Willow , came out in Season 4 -- industry insiders still are n't convinced that the latest plot twist is n't anything more than a marketing ploy .
Buffy 's Lesbian Encounter : Groundbreaking or Marketing Ploy ?
Having gay characters in comic books is not a new concept , according to comic guru Matthew McAllister , but central characters who stray from heterosexuality may be .
" We 've definitely seen gay characters in mainstream comics over the past 10 to 15 years , " said McAllister , who co-edited the book " Film and Comics . "
" But usually those tend to be secondary characters , not leads . "
Dark Horse Comics , the publisher of Buffy 's comic strip , estimates that since the comic 's inception in March 2007 , more than 1 million issues have been sold , approximately 120,000 each month .
While according to the publisher the audience includes " lovers of television and comics of all ages , " McAllister says that Dark Horse is known for aiming its material more toward older teens and readers in their mid-20s .
Because the comic was the spawn of a popular movie and television series , McAllister bears on the side of Whedon , who asserts that Buffy 's gay romp was more about character development than revenue .
" It 's not like Buffy has n't explored these issues before , so in a way it goes with the basic sensibility of the characters and the universe of Buffy , " McAllister said .
" ' Buffy ' is a metaphor for teenage life , and one of the issues teenagers face is the questioning of sexuality .
Now [ Dark Horse ] is trying to explore it a little bit more . "
A representative from The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation familiar with the comic welcomed the plot twist , lauding it as yet another example of the " Buffy " enterprise including " multidimensional lesbian characters in the Buffy universe . "
" ' Buffy the Vampire Slayer ' has always been an inclusive series , both on screen and now on the page , " said Damon Romine , the entertainment media director for GLAAD , in a statement e-mailed to ABCNEWS.com .
" We look forward to seeing how Buffy 's emotional and physical connection with Satsu plays out , since the creators always take us in surprising and compelling directions . "
" It made logical , emotional sense and it was an opportunity for drama and character exploration , " said Whedon , who told ABCNEWS.com that while Buffy has not " all of a sudden turned gay " she is not " completely cut off from that particular enjoyment . "
But for Stephen Krensky , author of " Comic Book Century : The History of American Comic Books , " it 's not so clear that Buffy 's gay romp was a true advancement of her character and not just a way to freshen up the comic and keep it from its demise .
" Comic books are competing now with video games , DVDs and ' Guitar Hero ' for the attention of the audience that , let 's face it , they had [ during the 1960s ] , " said Krensky .
" Now it 's , ' how do we get attention ' and ' how do we find a niche ? ' "
Buffy is not the first comic to stray from its original form , Krensky said , and he added that sometimes he wishes comic writers would let the story " run its course " rather than go off on endless tangents .
" Superman " writers , said Krensky , went as far as developing " Superpets " to extend the comic 's story line .
" This is just the latest installment of [ a comic ] pushing the envelope , " said Krensky , who was once a fan of the " Buffy " television show .
" It disappoints me if the only reason they do it is because they 're looking for new wrinkles to just have something to write about . "
Whedon says that 's just not the case -- and that he would n't continue writing storyboards for " Buffy " if he did n't think it was truly advancing the story .
" I do n't need to push the envelope .
The reason I 'm [ still writing it ] is that we love it and we could n't stop telling these stories , " Whedon said .
He said he 's confident fans wo n't stray from the comic and will understand Buffy 's desire to experiment .
" We have a glut of ideas , but that does n't mean everyone is going to like them , " Whedon said .
" But eventually , if the comic does n't feel like it 's artistically valid or if it's not selling , then we 'll stop making it . "
When we learned Windows Vista would come in three consumer editions , we were surprised : was n't two enough ?
New evidence supports the possibility that the birth of the most controversial of these — Windows Vista Home Basic — was rooted in an attempt to sell aging hardware and survive yet another holiday season without a new release of Windows .
While this remains just a hypothesis for now , it is clear that Microsoft made compromises to what it considered the minimum specifications for full Vista support in order to accommodate Intel .
Ars has covered the progress of the " Windows Vista Capable " lawsuit several times since it was filed in April 2007 .
The lawsuit has recently been given the green light as a class action .
At issue is what customers had a right to expect from a so - called " Vista Capable " system .
Despite its defense of the Vista Capable program , Redmond , it seems , had doubts .
A number of internal Microsoft e-mails that pertain to the case have recently been unsealed by court order , and they paint a picture of a company divided .
Microsoft 's stated goal for Windows Vista was to " raise the bar " for an OS experience .
That 's a lofty goal , but it does n't necessarily track well with OEM sales targets and price points .
By August of 2005 , Microsoft knew what hardware specs would be required for a system to qualify for a " Vista Ready " label .
According to the company 's projections , however , only 20 to 30 percent of the systems on the market would qualify as Vista Ready by the spring of 2006 .
This low qualification rate was a significant source of worry for OEMs .
Both Microsoft and its various partners were concerned that announcing Vista in the early part of 2006 could create a stall in the PC market as buyers held off on purchases until the new OS was available .
The " Vista Ready " campaign was meant to prevent or lessen the impact of such a stall , just as the " XP Ready " campaign did in the murky past of 2000 .
But with Vista there was a difference : it seems that everyone knew that Vista was delayed , and Microsoft was n't able to pull off a pre-holiday 2006 launch for its consumer versions .
The end result was that Microsoft launched Vista for business in late 2006 , but the holiday shopping season would come and go without Vista being on the retail scene .
This half - launch terrified OEMs and Microsoft .
The marketing campaign was thus even more important than one might normally expect .
To make matters more complex , Microsoft had created a new video driver model for its new operating system and required any laptop with a " Vista Ready " sticker to include an integrated graphics module capable of supporting WVDDM ( Windows Vista Device Driver Model ) and all the advanced graphical features of Aero , including Aero Glass and Flip 3D .
Windows Vista Capable , meanwhile , was meant to apply to systems that could run Windows Vista without all the advanced graphical features .
Crucially , however , as originally defined , a " Windows Vista Capable " system was a system that used a WVDDM - compatible video solution .
A trail of e-mail
The distinction is nontrivial .
The dominant chipset ( mobile and desktop ) in mid-2005 was Intel 's 915 , which did n't support WVDDM .
Intel had a WVDDM - compliant solution on the market in the form of the 945 chipset , but it was significantly more expensive than the 915 and available in lower quantities .
This presented something of a problem for OEMs who wanted to market their systems as " Vista Capable . "
HP , in particular , had concerns in this regard .
A January 31 , 2006 , e-mail from Mike Ybarra , Microsoft director of product management , demonstrates :
I was surprised to learn of the changes to the Windows Capable program ( no WDDM requirement now ) .
In our August 7x7 with
HP you both committed to HP that we would not move off the WDDM requirement and HP made significant product roadmap changes to
support graphics for the full Vista experience .
Ramano specifically told Jim that HP will invest in graphics if MS would give him
100 % assurance that we would not budge for Intel .
This goes beyond desktop for HP as their mobile guys moved off 915 early for the
same reasons .
The bundled e-mails contain additional references and documentation of Microsoft 's plans to require WVDDM support for any Vista Capable products , but the company 's resolve not to waver on this requirement had melted away by January 2006 , due to apparent pressure from Intel .
None of the available documents cover any discussions between the two companies , but Intel evidently saw the 915 's ineligibility as a threat to its sales in 2006 .
Sometime in late January , 2006 , Microsoft decided to redefine " Vista Capable . "
This time , the company recommended a WVDDM driver , but did n't require one .
The change was controversial .
It also came just weeks before Microsoft announced the SKUs for Windows Vista .
Jim Allchin ( then co-president of Microsoft's Platform Products and Services Group ) was decidedly unhappy with this development , partly because it threw HP under a bus .
He wrote : " We really botched this .
I was not involved in this decision process and I will support it because I trust you thinking through the logic .
BUT , you guys have to do a better job with our customers than what was shown here .
This was especially true because you put me out on a limb making a commitment .
This is not ok . "
Ybarra expressed his own discontent in stronger terms in an e-mail to Allchin , saying : " We are caving to Intel .
We worked hard the last 18 months to drive the UI experience , and we are giving this up .
The OEMs are behind us here , we have the support , we need to drive this experience on today 's hardware .
We are really burning HP ...
We are allowing Intel to drive our consumer experience . "
Proof of Intel 's involvement rests on more than Ybarra 's e-mails .
On February 26 , 2007 , general manager John Kalkman sent an e-mail discussing the changes to the " Vista Capable " definition .
" In the end , we lowered the requirement to help Intel make their quarterly earnings so they could continue to sell motherboards with 915 graphics embedded .
This in turn did two things :
1 . Decreased focus of OEM 's planning and shipping higher end graphics for Vista ready programs and 2 .
Reduced the focus by IHV's to ready great WHQL qualified drivers .
We can see this today with Intel 's inability to ship a compelling full featured 945 graphics driver for Windows Vista . "
Microsoft 's e-mails are a veritable goldmine of interesting information ; Intel 's influence on the OS qualification process is only one example .
In this particular case , Microsoft 's plans to create a compelling next - generation graphic interface were partially blocked by available and shipping hardware , and partially by its own decision to " help Intel make their quarterly earnings . "
Most interesting of all , however , is the degree of back - and - forth discussion that went on at the software giant .
Those accustomed to viewing Microsoft as a monolith might be surprised at the number of dissenting voices , and at the number of people who cited a desire to " do the right thing " by the company 's customers .
Now it appears as though a court will decide that issue .
More on this story as it unfolds ...
Passengers ask for water for their instant noodles inside a train stranded at a railway station due to snowfall in Nanjing , in Jiangsu province , January 28 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Sean Yong
BEIJING ( Reuters ) -
An advertisement on Beijing ’s subway proclaiming “ Squeezed in ?!
Go and buy a car then ! ” has angered passengers who said it only encourages traffic jams , a state newspaper said Friday .
The advertisement , written in large white letters on a red background , is also contrary to the Beijing city government ’s aim of getting more people to take public transport , the official Beijing Daily said .
“ Is n’t this out of tune with environmental protection ? ” it quoted a subway passenger surnamed Yang as saying .
“ The company sees subway passengers as potential customers , but the scornful tone of the advertising language exposes a lack of interest in human feelings behind a meticulous design , ” a female passenger surnamed Liu added .
Some Internet users have come up with their own versions of the advertisement ’s slogan , the newspaper said , proposing : “ Stuck in a traffic jam ?
Then take the subway !. ”
But the storm of criticism against the advert , which does not identify the company or organization behind it , may have just the effect the advertisers were looking for , the report added .
“ If they only cared about getting eyeballs rather than the impact it would have on people and society , has it not been effective ? ” the newspaper quoted unnamed experts as saying .
Beijing is spending billions of dollars expanding and upgrading its subway network ahead of this year ’s Olympic Games , and wants to encourage more people to take trains and buses to help deal with worsening road congestion .
If you are a part of what is considered Generation X , you know that you probably have anywhere from 25 - 35 years until retirement — or at least that ’s what the government and most pension plans suggest as a retirement age .
Since we ’re currently focused on other aspects of our lives such as building careers , starting families , and trying to accumulate wealth , why would I bring up a topic that is seemingly more appropriate for someone closing in on retirement ?
To answer this , all you have to do is ask yourself if you plan on retiring at 65 - 67 or later just because that is what is expected of you .
I ’m guessing that you would rather “ retire ” earlier and then have the freedom to pursue your dreams before reaching this predetermined age .
For some , this may be starting a second career , others may want to travel the world , and some of you may simply want to have the flexibility of working on your own terms .
Whatever your dreams are , it does n’t make any sense to begin to seriously plan for them in the ten or so years before you plan on retiring .
There are plenty of steps you can take today that will position yourself for making the moves necessary to achieve your goals plenty of time in advance .
As a retirement planning counselor , I am often asked what kinds of books or resources are available to help people begin planning for the rest of their lives .
I ’m not just talking about money and investing for retirement , we do enough of that already .
Many people are looking for much more — they are already maxing out their retirement accounts , they have paid off all of their debt , so there has to be some greater goal .
Luckily , there are a lot of resources available to help you put things into perspective and begin thinking about what matters most in your life .
So , I have compiled a list of 20 of the top books in this category that can , and probably will change your life and how you view retirement .

The Number : What Do You Need for the Rest of Your Life and What Will It Cost ? by Lee Eisenberg .
We all know that money is an important part of life , and even more important if you want to live a comfortable retirement .
Eisenberg , the former editor of Esquire magazine , bridges the gap between preparing financially for retirement and the importance of creating a life plan that identifies where the money will actually be spent .
We always hear numbers and rules of thumb that allow you to estimate how much money you ’ll need to have in retirement , and while a good start , they are only estimates .
This book attempts to go beyond the money basics and emphasizes the importance of life planning alongside financial planning .

California ( TGW ) – Ausra , a California - based solar thermal energy provider , has published a peer reviewed study showing that over 90 % of the United State ’s electric grid and auto fleet ’s energy needs could be met by solar thermal power .
Solar thermal power stations use fields of mirrors to capture the sun 's energy as heat to boil water and drive steam turbines .
" The U.S. could nearly eliminate our dependence on coal , oil and gas for electricity and transportation , drastically slashing global warming pollution without increasing costs for energy , " said David Mills , chief scientific officer and founder at Ausra .
Mills is the inventor of the absorber surfaces used in the majority of the world 's solar hot water heaters .
Converting the nation ’s electric grid to solar thermal would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % .
The combination of plug - in hybrids and solar thermal power would eliminate the importation of 13 million barrels of fuel per day .
A plant for such a solar thermal facility would cover 9600 square miles , about the size of Vermont .

Yuan sets new record against dollar ( chinadaily.com.cn )
Updated : 2008-03-20 16:32
China 's currency , the yuan , will continue its ascent in value against the US dollar , and market watchers predict it wo n't be many days before one dollar trades less than 7 yuan , a new milestone .

The People 's Bank of China , the central bank , set the central parity exchange rate at 7.0512 yuan against the greenback on Thursday , rising 136 basic points from Wednesday .
The yuan has gained 3.3 percent in value since the beginning of 2008 .
The majority of Chinese economists as well as policy - makers believe a strong yuan will help reduce the country 's massive trade surplus , mop up excessive liquidity on the market , and curb domestic inflation , which rose to a 11 - year high of 8.7 percent in February .
The recent accelerated appreciation of the yuan underscores the Chinese government 's determination to rein in big domestic prices rises .
Some analysts said Beijing has resorted to a two - pronged approach to fighting inflation : rapid yuan revaluation and rein in of liquidity on the money market .
On Tuesday the central bank ordered the reserve ratio that commercial banks are required to deposit in the central bank , be raised to 15.5 percent , effective on March 25 .
The measure is expected to recover 210 billion yuan from the credit market .
The yuan advanced 7 percent against the greenback in 2007 , twice as fast as the previous year .
Others say the latest acceleration in the rise of the yuan might be the beginning of the country 's efforts to narrow the trade imbalance , while better meeting domestic consumption demands with more imports .
However , the new challenges many Chinese exporters face include not only a more expensive local currency but also stringent environmental standards , rising wage levels , and weakening external demand .

I love my homemade yogurt with different jams full of artificial sweeteners and lots of fruit so you can imagine my surprise ( and horror ) when I read that a recent study has found artificial sweeteners seem to cause you to GAIN weight , not lose it !
And how did they come to this startling conclusion ?
Times Online published an article “ How artificial sweeteners may be making slimmers put on weight ” stating ;
“ [ Scientists in the US ] have suggested that people who choose diet drinks containing artificial sweeteners tend to overcompensate and consume more calories than those who do not . ”
“ They found that rats fed on yoghurt sweetened with saccharine ate more calories , gained more weight and put on more body fat than rats that were given yoghurt sweetened with glucose . ”
My first thought was , they tested it on rats ?
My next thought was , that makes a lot of sense !
Going to one of Australia ’s largest University ’s , I ca n’t help but notice the number of overweight people my age !
And what ’s worse is seeing what they eat .
Besides large potions of everything , they justify what they drink as diet or sugar free .
The only real sugar free drink you can have is water but with so many products out on the market , both food and drink , claiming to be healthy alternatives when really it is full of artificial sweeteners and preservatives , the fight for us to loose or keep a healthy weight is compromised .
All I can say is , it ’s about time they proved it !
To see the actual paper written on the research , click here .
What is interesting is the use of yogurt and how plain yogurt verses sugared yogurt verses artificially sweetened yogurt effected the rats .
Imagine what the different sugars to our bodies .
So what have we learned from this research and in particular how it will effect us making home made yogurt ?
Artificial sweeteners are even worse than normal sugar as we tend to overcompensate to get the same benefits of sugar .
If looking for a way to loose weight , forgo any sugar in your yogurt or add nuts and pieces of fruit instead of sugar and sweetener .
Sugar is n’t bad !
But as my mum always says , “ Anything in excess is bad for you . ”
I hope I ’ve given you all something to ponder .

Turkey has begun preparations for a cross - border operation
Barham Saleh told the BBC such action could destabilise the region and prompt other neighbouring states to step in .
Turkey has said its patience has run out over the handling of Kurdish rebels based in northern Iraq .
It is seeking parliamentary permission for a cross - border operation to pursue Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) members .
The government must put a thick wall between themselves and the terrorist organisation
Tayyip Erdogan
Turkish Prime Minister
Profile : PKK rebel group
Ankara argues the group is a terrorist organisation responsible for the deaths of at least 15 Turkish soldiers earlier this month , and says the Kurdish separatists enjoy freedom of movement in northern Iraq .
Baghdad has called for " urgent negotiations " over Turkey 's threat and has sent Iraqi Vice - President Tareq Hashemi to Ankara .
" We can understand Turkey 's anger but what I 'm aiming to achieve during my visit is a common understanding , " Mr Hashemi said ahead of talks with Turkish leaders .
Iraq alarmed
Mr Saleh warned that any cross - border operation could have destabilising effects .
Ankara says the PKK are terrorists who move freely in northern Iraq
" Any unilateral action by the Turkish military in violation of Iraqi border will be a terrible precedent for everybody , " he said in the BBC interview .
" If Turkey as a neighbour of Iraq allows itself the right to intervene militarily in Iraq , what is there to prevent other neighbours from intervening ? "
Meanwhile , the head of the UN refugee agency said he was deeply concerned that the Turkish action could lead to big displacements of people .
UNHCR chief Antonio Guterres said the " relatively stable " area had until now acted as a haven for Iraqis displaced from other parts of the country .
The US has also warned Ankara against ordering any incursions into Iraq .
The Turkish province of Sirnak is at the heart of the 23 - year - old conflict between the military and PKK guerrillas .
No rush
Mr Erdogan 's AK Party , which has a parliamentary majority , is expected to vote in favour of the motion on Wednesday .
If passed , the vote will authorise cross - border operations for one year with the government deciding on the timing , scope and frequency of any incursions .
Turkey hopes it will not be forced to resort to military action , even if its motion gained approval in parliament , Mr Erdogan said on Tuesday .
" Passage of this motion does not mean an immediate incursion will follow , " he said .
Mr Erdogan called on Iraq 's government and the regional administration in the country 's north to crack down on the rebels , saying they should " build a thick wall between themselves and terrorist organisations " .
He added that any military operation would respect Iraq 's territorial integrity and only target the rebels .
Jamal Abdallah , a spokesman for the government of Iraqi Kurdistan , told the BBC there was no co-operation with the PKK .
" We have not helped the PKK and we are not helping it , " he said .
LISBON ( Reuters ) - Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi , visiting Europe after decades of ostracism by the West , on Friday condemned the “ dictatorship ” of the U.N. Security Council which he blamed for terrorism and world tensions .
Libya's President Muammar Gaddafi talks to the audience before their EU - Africa summit at Lisbon 's University December 7 , 2007 .

Speaking at Lisbon University on his first ever official visit to Portugal , Gaddafi also criticized the fact that only a few select countries in the world were allowed to have nuclear weapons while the rest , including his own , were not .
It was a tough speech by the flamboyant leader , who was once branded “ mad dog of the Middle East ” in the 1980s by then U.S. President Ronald Reagan because of his backing of terror groups .
His ties with the West have warmed rapidly in recent years after he abandoned support for terrorism and plans to build weapons of mass destruction and agreed compensation for families of victims of mid-air bombings of U.S. and French airliners .
Gaddafi , whose country is opening up to western investment in oil and infrastructure , is in Portugal to attend a European Union / African Union summit at the weekend .
After Portugal he will be visit France and Spain after several decades of not being welcome .
Escorted by muscular female bodyguards dressed in desert - colored khaki and caps , Gaddafi criticized the current United Nations structure in which five countries -- the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia -- have veto powers .
He said the U.N. General Assembly , at which virtually all of the world ’s states are represented , should be the executive body of the global organization , not the smaller Security Council .
“ Why are we asking for democracy in countries , when there is dictatorship in the U.N. ( and ) if we ca n’t establish democracy in the world parliament , ” he told academics and diplomats .
Dressed soberly in black , Gaddafi blamed this lopsided distribution of global power for fomenting tension and terrorism , such as the September 11 , 2001 , attacks against the United States which he described as “ frightening ” .
“ It was an act of madness but those who committed it were not mad ... it was carried out so perfectly that it shook even the United States , ” said the Libyan leader .
In an apparent rebuke to the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq and Washington ’s war on terror , Gaddafi said military responses and legal prosecution were not enough to deal with terrorism .
“ POLITICAL BANKRUPTCY ”
Criticizing what he called the “ political bankruptcy ” of global politics , Gaddafi said the fate of the world was being decided by around a dozen individuals .
“ So why are we surprised if there is a reaction .
...
Some choose to bang their heads against walls but others hijack planes and do what we have seen , ” he said , referring to the 2001 attacks in New York and Washington .
Gadaffi , who likes to portray himself as a champion of Africa , also called on former colonial powers to pay compensation to the countries they once ruled .
“ If we do n’t confront reality , we must pay the price ... terrorism , migration , revenge , ” he said .
Fond of making a splash at international events , Gaddafi has pitched a Bedouin Arab tent inside a 16th century fortress on the Tagus estuary near Lisbon , where he receives visitors .
Rights campaigners urged Western leaders to raise the human rights situation in Libya when they engaged Gaddafi .
“ Let ’s not forget that in Libya there is no free press , no independent organizations , widespread torture of detainees and the continued detention of political prisoners , ” Reed Brody of U.S. - based Human Rights Watch told Reuters .
In his speech , Gaddafi said he would prefer a world free of nuclear arms .
“ We want to live in real peace in the shade of an olive tree and not in the shadow of nuclear weapons , ” he said .
The fussy , hedged , inconclusive complexity of Robert Frank ’s latest NYT column about income and happiness shows just how hard it is for an intellectually honest guy to make a strong case against the income - happiness link , given the complexion of the evidence .
In order to get as far as he does , which is not very far , Frank seems to me to nonetheless rely on a tendentious and , one would think , outdated interpretation of the happiness data :
This assumption [ “ that absolute income levels are the primary determinant of individual well - being ” ] is contradicted by consistent survey findings that when everyone ’s income grows at about the same rate , average levels of happiness remain the same .
Yet at any given moment , the pattern is that wealthy people are happier , on average , than poor people .
Together , these findings suggest that relative income is a much better predictor of well - being than absolute income .
The first finding , the flat trend , is contested .
Veenhoven and Hagerty argue it is not flat at all .
In any case , there is plenty of reason to think that ( 1 ) the subjective criterion people use to report how happy they are changes somewhat as their expectations change , and so objective gains in real welfare are likely to be underestimated by survey methods .
That is to say , the phrase “ pretty happy ” may not tracking the exact same feeling over five decades ; “ pretty happy ” may refer to something a bit happier than it did 50 years ago , just like “ pretty tall ” refers to something a bit taller than it did 50 years ago .
And there is plenty of reason to think that ( 2 ) comparing the bounded life satisfaction survey scale against the unbounded income scale likely leads objective gains in real welfare to be underestimated by survey methods .
So , scale renorming plus a kind of methodological error leaves us with the conclusion that the extent of the absolute gains are likely concealed by the measurement method .
The second finding , that wealthier people tend to say they are happier than poorer people , on its face suggests that it feels better to be rich than to be poor .
Part of this is surely absolute .
Having a bit more money increases your sense of control and decreases your sense of anxiety .
Have you ever had bill collectors calling you constantly ?
I have .
It helps a lot to have enough money to pay your bills .
And it ’s not just about avoiding poverty .
If you ’ve ever had the good fortune to move up one quintile from the middle , the reduction in economic anxiety is palpable .
That ’s the effect of an absolute gain .
Which is not to say that relative concerns are unimportant .
It ’s nice to be doing better than the people you compare yourself to .
But there is no evidence that people are uniformly comparative .
That is , some people have a weaker or stronger “ social comparison orientation ” than others .
And there is no evidence that , when people do compare , the relevant comparison class is the set of U.S. residents .
The claim that the very strong within - society relationship between income and happiness is due primarily to a preference for higher relative income ( within the U.S. distribution ) is mainly bluff .
Maybe it is , maybe it is n’t .
So how is it that these two finding taken together suggest relative income is a better predictor of well - being than absolute income ?
They do n’t .
Maybe Frank would like to explain the Deaton result .
All the evidence for strong comparative effects are very local .
It matters how I ’m doing relative to friends , neighbors , and co-workers .
As far as I know there is no evidence that the comparison class is global .
I suppose you could try to take the fact that average national income is a strong predictor of average national happiness as evidence that the relevant comparison class is global , but that would just beg the question in the worst way while showing a weird determination to avoid the obvious importance of absolute income .
Why not say something along the lines of happiness guru Ruut Veenhoven :
Another reason to doubt the Easterlin Paradox is the theory behind it , which assumes that happiness is “ calculated ” cognitively by comparing one ’s condition with local standards of the good life .
According to this theory , one can be happy in Hell if one does not know any better — or if one ’s companions are in an even hotter spot .
The available data fit better with the theory that happiness is “ inferred ” from the quality of affective experience , which reflects the gratification of basic needs .
This “ needs theory ” of happiness fits a wider functional perspective on affective guidance in higher animals , and predicts that we will live happily in conditions that suit human nature well .
Now , I do n’t think this has to be an either / or thing ( and I criticized Veenhoven for assuming happiness is necessarily evidence of “ natural ” environmental fit ) .
But Frank here is overselling the evidence for the unimportance of absolute wealth , even though he knows too much not to hedge lot .
I was going to say something about GDP , but this blog post is long enough .
Before he endorsed Barack Obama , before he drew the wrath of the Clintons and was likened to Judas , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson nearly endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton for president .
But Richardson hesitated , and as the Democratic campaign turned ugly , he grew angry .
There was that “ 3 a.m. ” TV ad , in which Clinton questioned Obama ’s personal mettle .
“ That upset me , ” Richardson said .
There were some ham - fisted phone calls from Clinton backers , who questioned Richardson ’s honor and suggested that the governor , who served in President Clinton ’s Cabinet , owed Hillary Clinton his support .
“ That really ticked me off , ” Richardson said .
Advertisement
Still , even as he moved from Clinton toward Obama -- “ the pursuit was pretty relentless on both sides ” -- Richardson wrestled with the question of loyalty .
After 14 years in Congress and a measure of fame as an international troubleshooter , Richardson was named Clinton ’s U.N. ambassador , then Energy secretary : “ two important appointments , ” Richardson said .
He finally concluded that he had settled his debt to the former president :
He had worked for Clinton ’s election in 1992 , helped pass the North American Free Trade Agreement as part of his administration , stood by him during the Monica S. Lewinsky sex scandal , and rounded up votes to fight impeachment .
“ I was loyal , ” Richardson said during an extended conversation over breakfast this week at the governor ’s mansion in Santa Fe .
“ But I do n’t think that loyalty is transferable to his wife .
. . .
You do n’t transfer loyalty to a dynasty . ”
He was impressed by the mostly positive tone of Obama ’s campaign , and grew to appreciate the substance and depth of their private conversations .
The more Richardson heard from the Washington heavyweights backing Clinton , the more convinced he became of the need for a change inside the Beltway .

It has been three weeks since Richardson embraced the Illinois senator , an endorsement that continues to rankle and resonate -- the significance , it would seem , going far beyond the preference of a governor from a poor , rural state .
But this is a family fight , between kin of the Clinton years , so perhaps the raw emotions should n’t be surprising .
“ They ’re very similar in personality , ” said Art Torres , chairman of the California Democratic Party and a friend of both Bill Clinton and Richardson .
“ There was a bond established , and I think [ the former president ] feels a little hurt . ”
Attention to the endorsement might have quickly passed but for the strenuous protest of Bill Clinton and others .
Speaking for the campaign , advisor Mark Penn suggested Richardson ’s endorsement came too late to be much help to Obama .
“ Everyone has their endorsers , ” he said .
But then James Carville , the pundit , strategist and Clinton loyalist , hurled a lightning bolt by comparing Richardson to Judas and his surrender of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver .

Soon after came an odd back - and - forth concerning a private conversation in which , supposedly , either Hillary Clinton or Richardson dismissed Obama as unelectable .
( Neither party will discuss particulars , but Richardson said he never made that statement . )
Days later , just when interest in the endorsement seemed to wane , former President Clinton exploded in a rant about Richardson at the California Democratic Party convention .
He later apologized , but his tirade in a closed - door session with superdelegates rekindled the story for several more days .
People close to Clinton said he views the governor ’s action as a personal betrayal .
“ I think [ Richardson ] really owes a big chunk of his success and his career to the Clintons , ” said an associate who has discussed the matter with the former president and requested anonymity to speak candidly .
“ Look , ” Richardson responded , “ I was a successful congressman rescuing hostages before I was appointed .
I was a governor afterward , elected on my own . ”

Even more than the endorsement , Clinton ’s associate said , the former president was angry because he thought Richardson broke his word .
The two men watched the Super Bowl together at the governor ’s mansion -- Clinton made a special trip from California in bad weather -- and the former president walked away convinced that Richardson would endorse his wife or , at least , stay neutral .
Richardson was , in fact , close to backing the New York senator that day , though his advisors -- many of whom backed Obama -- urged him to wait .
“ I remember talking to the president and saying , ‘ I ’m leaning .
But I ’m not there yet . ’
He denied pledging neutrality if he changed his mind .
“ Sometimes people hear what they want to hear , ” Richardson said .
Normally the most gregarious of politicians , the governor during the interview this week was subdued as he slowly worked his way through a plate of scrambled eggs , bacon and green chiles .
His voice was soft , and he rarely smiled .
His endorsement had been highly coveted , due largely to his stature as one of the country ’s most prominent Latino leaders .
The pursuit began soon after Richardson quit the presidential race on Jan. 10 .

He retreated to New Mexico and the governor ’s adobe mansion .
He sulked a bit , grew a beard , rode his quarter horse and tended to state business .
“ I did n’t want anything to do with national politics , ” Richardson said , figuring he would keep out of the nominating fight until it was over .
But slowly he reengaged , watching the debates and fielding calls from Clinton , Obama and their surrogates .
Their manner of courtship -- one wooing , the other arm - twisting -- seemed to reflect the candidates ’ different personalities and campaign styles , he said .
Obama preferred the soft sell , calling Richardson every three days or so -- “ dialing the phone himself , no operator ” -- for long discussions about policy and campaign issues .
The two developed a bantering relationship , building on the camaraderie they shared off - camera during debates , when they would roll their eyes at some of their rivals ’ statements .
Clinton was more persistent and tactical .
There were eight or more phone calls a day , Richardson said : “ Bill calling , Hillary calling , friends of mine that were in the Clinton administration , Clinton operatives , Clinton Hispanic operatives , New Mexico Clinton Hispanic operatives . ”

Some callers , who suggested Richardson had an obligation to back Clinton , did more harm than good .
“ I think the Clintons have a feeling of entitlement . . . that the presidency was theirs , ” Richardson said , and the persistent lobbying from “ Washington establishment types ” convinced him of a need for some fresher faces on the scene .
He began admiring Obama back when they were rivals , and the sentiment grew the more they talked about foreign affairs , the environment and other issues .
“ I saw real growth in the guy , ” Richardson said , “ a tremendous growth in policy and expression and experience . ”
And no , Richardson said , there was never talk of the vice presidency , or any other job in an Obama administration .
“ I never say never in politics , but I ’m not pining for it , ” he said .
( Nor , he suggested , would he settle for just any Cabinet post , having served before . )
With his mind made up , and dreading the conversation , Richardson called Sen .
Clinton a few hours before his endorsement of the Illinois senator was announced .
He sat in his den , smoking a cigar with ESPN in the background .
Their discussion , Richardson said , “ was proper but heated . ”

The two have not spoken since .
Nor has he heard from Bill Clinton , who told people he was upset that Richardson did not call him as well .
( The governor said he tried but never got through . )
The response from the Clinton camp -- “ the ferocity , the intensity ” -- has surprised him , Richardson said , though he knew he risked fracturing his relationship with the couple .
His wife , Barbara , had warned him , he said : Richardson moved his hands apart , as if to signify a break .
“ She also has great affection for the Clintons , ” the governor said -- she decorated their home with photos of the two couples together .
“ He ’s very much a part of my life , ” Richardson said of the former president .
The pictures are still hanging in the mansion ’s private quarters .

REYKJAVIK , Iceland 
Life on this rugged , windswept island has always swung between famine and feast  dependent on the fish in its icy waters and the luck of its fishermen .
But little could have prepared Iceland for the reversal of fortune it has suffered in the last few months .
The country ’s long economic boom has ended in a painful bust , with a collapsing currency , rising inflation , double - digit interest rates and predictions of its first recession since 1992 .
“ As a citizen , you have to wonder what ’s going to happen to this country , ” said Eggert Benedikt Gudmundsson , the head of Iceland ’s largest fishing company , HB Grandi .
“ We always tend to go to extremes , ” he added , as the wind rattled the windows of his seafront office .
To many Icelanders , their country is the victim of foreign speculators , circling like sharks smelling blood .
To outside investors , Iceland is the victim of its own excesses .
Ratings on video games are an important part of making sure the art form is able to grow up .
The more information given to consumers and parents about what is in a game , the less likely that game will wind up in the hands of someone who is n't old enough to play it .
The question of which children should be playing what games is ultimately an open one ; the ratings are merely guidelines , and parents have the final say about what their children play — exactly how it should be .
So what are parents concerned about when looking at what games to buy for their children ?
An unscientific poll on What They Play suggests that parents have a few hot - button issues but are most concerned about sex .
Reports from those on the front lines of the gaming retail industry support the poll results .
In the poll — which was conducted on the site , not among a broader body of game buyers — people were asked what would be most offensive in a video game : a severed head , men kissing , usage of a harsh profanity , or heterosexual sex .
The sex between a man and a woman was considered to be the most offensive thing at 37 percent , with two men kissing coming in second at 27 percent , and a severed head at 26 percent .
The F - bomb was n't as bad , according to parents : only ten percent would have found that most offensive .
" Parents see two things as being in games : sex and violence , and [ those two things ] are simple , " a GameStop manager told me on the condition I not use his name .
" I try to say what kind of sex and how heavy the violence is in a game , and adults cut me off .
Everyone seems to think , if the game has sex at all , then no .
If the game has violence , even if it 's like , things you could barely get into an R - rated movie , then it 's probably okay . "
I asked another manager what he does when he feels uncomfortable selling someone a game and got a long sigh in return .
" It 's not my job to argue , " he told me .
One of the first large - scale controversies in gaming began because in a game where graphic violence is common and morals are nonexistent , someone released a hack to show some poorly - rendered sex .
This is n't a new issue .
" I worked on Fahrenheit ( known as Indigo Prophecy in the States ) and had to cut the sex scenes out of the game for the US , " said Constantine Hantzopoulos , an industry veteran who was the senior producer of Condemned : Bloodshot .
" Yes , I was the guy that did that .
It sucked because I do n't believe in that , right .
But you 've got to do what you 've got to do . "
Indigo Prophecy was a game aimed squarely at adults with a number of thought - provoking themes and breathtaking set pieces .
The sex was n't gratuitous and happened in one of the rare moments of peace in the life of a character who was beginning to feel he was doomed .
It added to the story , but again , sexuality in the United States is nearly impossible to address without running into controversy .
It 's not an issue that 's confined to video games .
Most of the complaints made to the Federal Communications Commission about inappropriate content on TV by groups such as the Parents Television Resource Council have to do about sexual content .
In turn , recent decisions to fine broadcasters have hinged on fleeting f- bombs and pixelated naughty bits rather than violent content .
While depicting rampant or casual sex may be seen as devaluing humans by turning them into objects , I would argue that allowing violence while avoiding sex in many ways achieves the same goal of dehumanizing the characters in games .
While there may be some merit to both views , we need to think carefully about which images are actually harmful to young minds , and why .
Black - and - white thinking on sex in games might be appropriate for young kids , but it may also prevent adult gamers from experiencing the full power of the interactive stories games can tell .
Report profiles gay couples
The study finds the number of same - sex pairs rising in Hawaii
Same - sex couples across the state are a growing segment of the population , and likely face the same economic pressures as married couples , according to a new study released this week .
The study by the Williams Institute , part of the University of California , Los Angeles , said same - sex couples who are raising children are also on the rise across the state .
" The key point , I think , is ... that same - sex couples are very similar to married couples , " said Adam Romero , Public Policy Fellow and one of the authors of the paper .
" Ultimately , we hope the report better informs the discussion about ( lesbian , bisexual , gay and transgender ) people and their rights , which seem to proceed in many ways on the assumption that LBGT people are all affluent and well - off , " Romero added in an e-mailed response to questions .
According to the Williams Institute report , which culled data from the U.S. Census Bureau , about 3,262 same - sex couples were identified in the census report , and constitute about 1 percent of the coupled households in the state .
That 's up from 2,389 couples identified in the 2000 census data , the Williams Institute report stated .
And more same - sex couples are raising children , as well -- from 502 couples with kids identified in 2000 , to 685 in 2005 , Romero said .
As of 2005 , an estimated 1,164 Hawaii children are being raised in same - sex households .
But , according to the census numbers , men in same - sex couples earn roughly 30 percent less than married men and the median income of women in same - sex couples is 17 percent less than that of married women .
And those averages are despite the fact that people in same - sex couples are significantly more likely to have a college degree :
Some 41 percent of individuals in same - sex couples and 28 percent of married individuals have earned a college degree , according to the report .
Also , despite the military 's current policies , 11 percent of individuals in same - sex couples in the state are veterans , according to the report .
The data , the report states , are contrary to the popular stereotype that only well - to - do gay and lesbian couples raise children .
" This is the first time we -- or anyone , as far as I know -- has put out reports such as this at the state level , " Romero said .
" We hope these reports give a better picture of the real people directly affected by the outcomes of those debates " over gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender rights , which often take place at the state level , he added .
There are 41,785 gay , lesbian and bisexual people ( single and coupled ) living in Hawaii , according to the report .

Imagine two detectives working on a murder case , each having to solve the same crime independently , with each only having access to half the clues : it sounds like a great recipe for a mystery novel .
Unfortunately , the murder in the Noord - Brabant town of Baarle - Nassau last week was anything but fictional .
Early last week a 26 - year - old Belarusian woman was found dead in a former bank building straddling the border .
Police detectives from the two countries each had to look for clues in their own half ; they feared that if they literally overstepped their boundaries , any case they might have against a suspect could later be thrown out on a technicality .
Nevertheless , the Dutch Departement of Justice said last Friday that the cooperation with its Southern neighbours had been excellent , forgetting for a moment that the Belgians had let the main suspect escape , the victim ’s 26 - year - old husband .
The Dutch DoJ then issued an international arrest warrant against the Dutch man who is still on the run with the couple ’s four - year - old daughter .
The case is now fully in Dutch hands because the body was found in the Dutch half of the building , and the main suspect is Dutch .
Although there are many more buildings in the world built across borders , the Baarle - Nassau case is special because half of the town , called Baarle - Hertog , is a Belgian enclave within the Netherlands .
Wikipedia says that the municipality of Baarle consist of 22 Belgian exclaves in the Netherlands , and 5 Dutch ones in Belgium .

The effort to squeeze the dollar out of Russian oil sales marks another project with swagger and ambition by the Kremlin , which has already wielded its energy wealth to assert influence in Eastern Europe and in former Soviet states .
Russia , the world ’s second - largest oil - exporting nation after Saudi Arabia , has been quietly preparing to switch trading in Russian Ural Blend oil , the country ’s primary export , from the dollar to the ruble .
But the change , if it comes , is still some time off , industry analysts and officials said .
The Russian effort began modestly this month , with trading in refined products for the domestic market .
Still , the effort to squeeze the dollar out of Russian oil sales marks another project with swagger and ambition by the Kremlin , which has already wielded its energy wealth to assert influence in Eastern Europe and in former Soviet states .
“ They are serious , ” said Yaroslav Lissovolik , the chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Moscow .
“ This is something they are giving priority to . ”
Oil trading is now nearly always denominated in dollars , the de facto common currency of the petroleum business .
When Kuwait sells oil under a futures contract to India , for example , the price is set in dollars .
Similarly , Russia ’s large trade with Western Europe and the former Soviet states in crude oil and natural gas is conducted in dollar - denominated contracts .
Gazprom , the natural gas monopoly , set the price of natural gas in Ukraine at $ 176 per 1,000 cubic meters in 2007 , for example .
There are no proposals yet to switch natural gas pricing away from dollars .

WASHINGTON — Never do I want to hear again from my conservative friends about how brilliant capitalists are , how much they deserve their seven - figure salaries , and how government should keep its hands off the private economy .
The Wall Street titans have turned into a bunch of welfare clients .
They are desperate to be bailed out by government from their own incompetence , and from the deregulatory regime for which they lobbied so hard .
They have lost “ confidence ” in each other , you see , because none of these oh - so - wise captains of the universe has any idea what kinds of devalued securities sit in one another ’s portfolios .
So they have stopped investing .
The biggest , most respected investment firms threaten to come crashing down .
You ca n’t have that .
It ’s just fine to make it harder for the average Joe to file for bankruptcy , as did that wretched bankruptcy bill passed by Congress in 2005 at the request of the credit card industry .
But the big guys are “ too big to fail ” because they could bring us all down with them .
Enter the federal government , the institution to which the wealthy are not supposed to pay capital gains or inheritance taxes .
Good God , you do n’t expect these people to trade in their BMWs for Saturns , do you ?
In a deal that The New York Times described as “ shocking , ” J.P. Morgan Chase agreed over the weekend to pay $ 2 a share to buy all of Bear Stearns , one of the brand names of finance capitalism .
The Federal Reserve approved a $ 30 billion — that ’s with a “ b ” — line of credit to make the deal work .
I do n’t fault Ben Bernanke , the Fed chairman , for being so interventionist in trying to save the economy .
On the contrary , Bernanke deserves credit for ignoring all the extreme free market bloviation .
He does n’t want the economy to collapse on his watch , so he is willing to violate all the conservatives ’ shibboleths about the dangers of government intervention .
As a voter once told the legendary political journalist Richard Rovere : “ Sometimes you have to forget your principles to do what ’s right . ”
But if this near meltdown of capitalism does n’t encourage a lot of people to question the principles they have carried in their heads for the last three decades or so , nothing will .
We had already learned the hard way — in the crash of 1929 and the Depression that followed — that capitalism is quite capable of running off the rails .
Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal was a response to the failure of the geniuses of finance ( and their defenders in the economics profession ) to realize what was happening or to fix it in time .
As the economist John Kenneth Galbraith noted of the era leading up to the Depression , “ The threat to men of great dignity , privilege and pretense is not from the radicals they revile ; it is from accepting their own myth .
Exposure to reality remains the nemesis of the great — a little understood thing . ”
But in the enthusiasm for deregulation that took root in the late 1970s , flowered in the Reagan era and reached its apogee in the second Bush years , we forgot the lesson that government needs to keep a careful watch on what capitalists do .
Of course , some deregulation can be salutary and the market system is , on balance , a wondrous instrument — when it works .
But the free market is just that : an instrument , not a principle .
So now the bailouts begin , and Wall Street usefully might feel a bit of gratitude , perhaps by being willing to have the wealthy foot some of the bill or to acknowledge that while its denizens were getting rich , a lot of Americans were losing jobs and health insurance .
I ’m waiting .
At the very least , the die - hard defenders of unregulated capitalism could accept a truth spoken to me back in 1996 by William Cohen , when he was a Republican senator from Maine .
He was talking about a plane crash and the public grousing about whether the government ’s safety regulators should have kept a more careful eye on the airline in question .
But he could have been talking about the financial system right now .
“ We have been saying for so long that government is the enemy , ” Cohen said .
“ Government is the enemy until you need a friend . ”
Then he added : “ Is the public ready to say : ‘ Let the private sector handle everything ’ ?
Clearly not . ”
All Wall Street firms should be required to carve Cohen ’s words into their foundations before they crumble .

It seems as if Santa ’s work has been done for him this year .
His naughty and nice list , at least for some of the top celebrities in Hollywood , has been plastered all over newsstand practically since last Christmas !
The American public probably knows more about the personal lives and social fiascos of their favorite big screen star than they do about wars and natural disasters happening on the other side of the globe !
Just ask the kids …
Who ’s Tops the Naughty List ?
Ask any boy or girl , even some as young as two years old , who tops Santa ’s naughty list this year .
You may be surprised !
They are less likely to name classic villains such as Darth Vader or the Grinch from Dr. Seuss ’s classic , How the Grinch Stole Christmas , or even Swiper the Fox from popular children ’s show Dora the Explorer , and will instead recite names from the recent covers of the magazines in the grocery story check - out aisles .
Britney Spears claimed the number one spot on the list .
Joining her at the top of the list is fellow “ bad girl ” Paris Hilton , who was plastered on the front page for her three weeks spent in , and for a short time out , of jail .
Farther down the list come Lindsay Lohan and Beyonce .
Bad Behavior
While kids recognize that Britney ’s been bad , they probably do n’t understand exactly why .
Her risqué pictures , time in rehab , and custody battle for her children have won her all sorts of negative publicity , but kids have more general definitions for bad behavior .
According to our children , Santa will put you on the naughty list for “ not listening to parents , ” “ bullying , ” and “ being mean . ”
These problems are those more often encountered by kids in their day - to - day lives ; thankfully they ’re not dealing with those issues that their idols and role models face .
Who ’s Been Nice ?
The kids are also keeping tabs on their competition on the nice list .
To earn a spot on the coveted list , kids cite such criteria as “ cleaning up , ” “ doing chores , ” “ sharing , ” and “ being polite . ”
Younger kids put Hannah Montana at the top of the Nice list , and older kids and teenagers chose Angelina Jolie , another familiar face from the newsstands .
How About You ?
While most of us keep our lives out of the headlines , there ’s no hiding from Santa .
After all , he knows when you are sleeping and he knows when you ’re awake !
He knows if you ’ve been bad or good , so which list is he going to put you on ?
Have you driven courteously and held the door for the person coming in after you ?
Or have you cheated on your diet and called in sick to work when really you ’d rather sleep in ?
In the spirit of the holidays , while you ’re circling the parking lot looking for a spot , why not give the closer spot to the mom wrangling three kids , and take one farther back .
That simple gesture might just save you from the company of Brittany and Paris on Christmas morning .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Seven out of 10 seriously delinquent subprime mortgage borrowers are still not getting the help they need to keep their homes , according to a report released Tuesday by state officials working to stem the foreclosure crisis .
" We 're still way behind , " said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller , who helped form the State Foreclosure Prevention Working Group , a coalition formed last year by 11 state attorneys general and bank regulators .
The coalition is working with lenders and companies that service mortgages to try to keep people from losing their homes .
It drew its statistics from 13 of the 20 major servicer companies , which handle about 58 % of all subprime loans .
More than 1 million of those loans , or nearly 25 % of the total , were delinquent as of Jan. 31 .
And foreclosure proceedings have begun on 300,000 of them - an 8 % increase since October .
Mortgage servicing companies , which manage accounts and process payments , play a key role in efforts to help delinquent borrowers work out affordable mortgages .
Workouts can take the form of simple repayment plans or more comprehensive loan modifications that involve reductions in balances or interest rates .
Many subprime loans are adjustable rate mortgages , meaning their interest rates jump after an introductory period .
Borrowers who had not fallen behind on their payments before their rates reset can benefit from a simple freeze of their rates .
Many subprime borrowers took out loans they could not really afford - making workouts more complicated .
The report showed that 28.5 % of subprime adjustable rate mortgages that wo n't reset until spring 2009 are already delinquent .
About 21 % of these same loans were delinquent in October .
One step forward , two steps backward
The state officials said Tuesday that workouts have not kept pace with the rising tide of foreclosures .
" Our collaborative efforts to date have failed to prevent a large number of unnecessary foreclosures , " said Mark Pearce , North Carolina deputy commissioner of banks .
" We need to find solutions that fit the size of the problem we are facing . "
The report , which surveyed efforts by lenders and servicers and programs like Hope Now , found that the number of borrowers getting help each month has increased to nearly 261,000 in January from about 210,000 in October .
But because the ranks of troubled borrowers is growing so quickly - to over 1 million at the start of the year from 820,000 last fall - the proportion of mortgage rescues has remained essentially unchanged .
Mortgage industry leaders are looking at the data with more of a glass - half - full perspepctive .
" We 've helped more than 1.2 million people through the process .
That is a significant accomplishment , " said Paul Richman , the vice president for government affairs with the Mortgage Bankers Association .
" But we still have a big problem reaching out to borrowers . "
Many at - risk borrowers still do not respond to the efforts of mortgage servicers to contact them , according to Richman .
When they finally do ask for help , they may have fallen way behind in payments , complicating any rescue plan .
Currently , the preferred remedy for lenders is to allow borrowers time to make up missed payments .
For seriously delinquent borrowers , loan modifications are the only viable answer .
Only 27 % of the workouts completed in January , little more than 24,000 borrowers , involved modifications .
But of the loans that were still being worked out as of January , 53 % were headed for a comprehensive modifications rather than less effective repayment plans .
Too many loans to work out
One reason why mortgage servicers have fallen behind in workouts is that they are overwhelmed , unable to cope with the sheer numbers of delinquent loans , according to the report .
About two - thirds of all mortgage modification efforts take more than six weeks to complete .
" We 're finding the servicing system can't manage and re-underwrite millions of loans , " Pearce said .
" The case - by - case approach [ they 're using now ] was not designed to handle the numbers of loans they 're dealing with . "
The report said that delinquent loans are " clogging up " the system , slowing the pace of modification efforts and possibly adding to the number of vacant homes in many communities .
The Working Group made two recommendations to improve the rate of mortgage modifications :
Slow down the foreclosure process to give servicers more time to find solutions for individual borrowers , and take a more systematic approach to modifying loans .
That would eliminate some of the intensive counseling that is now the rule for nearly every borrower .
Many seriously delinquent borrowers are in the same boat , more or less , and servicers should be able to take a uniform approach to their workouts , according to Richard Neiman , the New York superintendent of banks .
Applying a streamlined workout model toward a large percentage of the borrowers would free up staff to address the borrowers facing thornier issues .
It 's not only staffing problems that have slowed mortgage modifications ; there 's also reluctance on the parts of some servicers to act .
" Some servicers fear that if they modify loans down , they run the risk of litigation somewhere down the road if the borrower eventually defaults , " said Neiman .

I apologize for any confusion , and I 'm sorry to say that this is not planned to be the next Ubuntu theme .
It has been passed it up to the art team , and there 's a lot of work ahead for this theme .
If you are visiting and you do have ideas or suggestions , please post them here !
There 's an entire sub - wiki just for your input !
From " edible " to " post - eaten " the mixed reactions say this theme can be improved ; a list of improvements are being gathered from various comments sections - but please post and encourage posting in the ideas section to make sure comments & suggestions are n't skipped !

Current theme rendition ( 3.3 )
Basic
Ideals aims to be an interface with only the purpose to be the usable and intuitive by design .
The most basic user is to open this interface , and know what each element does , what to expect from it , and how to do what they want .
This is a full - scale mockup that represents all the elements of the Basic Ideals theme at this moment ;
This is the second version of the large mock - up .
Questions , comments and suggestions are strongly encouraged - please post them in the ideas section !

Design
Concept
The " Basic Ideals " concept is not the search for an ultra-cool theme that blows away ' competition ' .
The idea of this theme and the upgrades that would become necessary for it to be supported only have the purpose to create the most usable user interface .
Elements of cool and amazing designs are only second to ease - of - use .
Each element in the theme , from buttons to scrollbars , should be self explanatory .
Everything should be considered in the design of an element .
Should a button be pill shaped , like OS X ?
Should they be square with rounded corners , like Windows ?
Should they change colour , light up , cast shadows ?
Reflect ?
Glow ?
Have markings or decals ?
What will feel natural , what would feel unnatural ?
Going to the bare basics , how to elements compare to their real - life counterparts ?
Where does light come from ?
How will your grandmother interpret it ?
How will you interpret it ?
If sounds are present , what would it sound like ?
If animations are present , how would they move ?
Hopefully , with solid guidelines and coherence , the theme will look good on it's own , without needing to resort to gimmicks .
Additionally , some of the effects mentioned also require Compiz and Emerald ;
So an alternate version of this theme would need to be made for lower - spec computers .
Basic Theme Guidelines
A good theme should have consistent cues to tell the user what an object can do .
This is a basic list of guidelines this theme will ultimately follow .
General Rules
In addition to this list , there is an explanation on each of some of these rules within the different sections as well .
Light sources : Light comes from the same source as Gnome Icon Spec .
Basically , from the top of the icon , slightly leaning to the left .
This means the shadow would lean to the bottom right .
Every element that rests over other elements should cast a shadow .
Outlines : Outlines will be the most prevalent on the outside of the window , and become subtle as you move to the inside of a window .
This means the windowframes and panels will have the thickest outlines , divisions within the chrome will have thinner outlines , and buttons will have outlines that are barely visible .
This will let users know what belongs to what if they glance at the screen , and more easily navigate the gui .
Because there are 2 interface colours ( Chocolate and Tan , more info on the next point ) the outline on the thickest lines should always be the opposite colour .
So Chocolate elements have Tan outlines , and Tan elements have Cholocate outlines .
Nutshell : Panels & Windowframes = ~2px solid inverted colour , high contrast .
Chrome= ~1 px solid .
Widgets= ~1 px subtle .
Gradients =~1 px , subtle , gradient .
Colours : Colours will help guide the user to what 's really important , or active .
Tans and Beige colours are for areas that contain content or are unimportant - as they do not distract the eye .
Browns and Chocolate are for elements farther away from content , contain important content , or selected widgets .
Orange colours are for active widgets to show either what you are interacting with , or what option you have selected .
Only the most important widgets will permanently have orange , as would be a highlighting colour .
Icons and user - customizable elements ( not necessarily ingrained within the interface ) should remain orange .
Nutshell : Tan=Content .
Brown=Not Content .
Orange=Objects , Highlights & Activity .
Transitions :
Anything that is connected with another , related object of a different colour will be blended in a gradient .
This is to lead users through the interface and provide a smooth feel .
This does not apply to anything highlighted in orange , as users could be led to believe elements connected to whatever is highlighted might be affected .
Transparency : Anything that rests on top of content should have a subtle level of transparency , to show there is content underneath .
If it 's going to cover the desktop , it should only be slightly transparent ( Maybe ~ 10 % ) , but if it 's covering window content , it should be less opaque ( maybe ~ 20 % transparent ) .
Rounded Corners : Corners should be rounded whenever they are unattached to any other element , and if possible , inside corners should be rounded too .
For example , when dropping down from a toolbar , the toolbar button will ( because of the gradient ) take a corner to transition into the dropdown .
The other 3 corners would be rounded .
Rounded corners should be subtle .
Only enough to look softer than harsh square corners - if rounded too much they begin to look almost toy - like , and not very solid .
Either 2 pc or 4px of rounding .
Active Elements & Orange :
Any element that is active and being manipulated should be highlighted in orange .
Because smaller items may be covered by the mouse ( small buttons , check - boxes , etc ) and we want consistency in the theme , elements should use an outer " Glow " effect , not dis-similar to the Windows Vista min/restore / close buttons .
This will let users see very easily what elements they are working with .
Small single - click elements like buttons or check - boxes should glow on mouse - over .
Elements like scroll - bars should have arrows / icons that would glow on mouseover , and afterwards have the entire element glow when scrolling .
The glow should pulsate on a click if possible .
Widgets will still highlight in orange on the widget itself in nearly identical locations as the Feisty Fawn widgets .
Chrome
Chrome contains every major widgets and piece of content users will interact with .
Think like some mixing board you 'd see in a sound studio .
The chrome itself will have subtle transparency , however this is the definition of subtle : only 2 - 5 % .
If there is a toolbar embedded in the chrome , the toolbar will be chocolate , as it contains important functions .
If the element separates several objects ( tabs , dividers ) they should fade out towards the bottom to avoid crowding and to show that the element is part of the chrome .
Panels
Panels are both the most persistent , and customizable parts of the interface .
You set up panels your way and they are omnipresent , they are the ultimate part of user customization
Top and bottom panels will be more opaque as they contain any content with text ( vertical panels are anemic when it comes to text because of how narrow they are )
Side panels will be more transparent , as side panels tend to be used more for widgets . \
Side panels should have improved support , as in general themes tend to ignore vertical - panels and it harms th possibility of using them .
Window Frames
Frames are far less common in the real world when you look at what window frames actually are / do , and there are trade - offs no matter what style we go with .
The window frame should cover the top and bottom , as well as the sides .
There is more functionality in the frame when users can easily grab it .
Because windowframes are away from content , and contain useful widgets and information , they should be Chocolate .
Windowframes should have subtle transparency when nearing the outline , as windows always rest on top of other windows or the desktop .
The material should blend into the contents of the frame , as they are a connected element .
Subtle lines should divide the frame so users know where the frame ends and the chrome begins .
The outside of the frame should have a clear outline , as it contains all elements .
Only panels have lines this thick .
Windows will have a drop - shadow on Composited machines .
Any thoughts , additions , inconsistence or anything else on this should be expressed please .
Widgets
In real life , a often buttons are raised , made from a different material , they might have a light behind them , and they always have some sort of instruction on them .
Widgets will glow when moused - over .
It would be a halo - style glow and preferably " splash " over the nearby area for the best visibility .
grouped widgets will pulsate to illustrate their relation .
This spec is subject to change
Media
More media will become available as work is refined and created .
Please post errors or inconsistencies in the " Suggestions / Issues / Corrections " section below .

First - Version mockup
A mini-rendition of a desktop using the theme following the spec .
The bars below can be substituted in place of the thicker - outline ( or will be able to be ) by the end user ;
But this is what the theme might look like by default .
Compiz Acceleration ?
Four unique styles of panel .
The top two are for non-compiz enabled machines with lower hardware requirements .
The second two are more flashy versions that follow the guidelines above , and up the users experience .
Comment on which panel style might be preferred ( dark or light border ? ) ;
The dark borders are easier on the eyes , but light borders follow the guidelines perfectly .
Zoomed in Panel
The massive benefit of SVG graphics ;
They can be zoomed in for disabled users , polish high - resolution displays and make resolution - independent interfaces .
Archived Concept Images
These are Pre-SVG images are no longer relevant .
They remain here for completeness and for design reference .
The images below DO NOT reflect the current theme .

Mock - Up 1 of Compiz - Enabled Panels .
( Pre -SVG series ) Dropdown Example
What a drop - down might look like .
There are 2 mouse cursors on this mock - up , one orange , one brown .
Orange technically fits the spec ( as it is always active ) however it is less visible than brown .
The default white cursor theme might be more appropriate .
( Pre -SVG series ) Mockup of alternate wallpapers
Several alternate wallpapers .
Suggestions / Requests no longer considered
After several updates to the theme , several requests are surfacing that would regress to the styles of previous versions .
At this point , some portions on the theme have officially hit the " Happy Medium " , to the point where any changes would just have suggestions to be reversed .
Further changes to the listed below will either need to be applied personally , or at the authors lone discretion .
Basic colour pallet : Ubuntu 's official colours are Brown , Beige and Orange .
Black , Green , Blue , Silver and other colours would necessitate alternate colour schemes entirely .
Brown Saturation / Hue / Lightness
Beige Saturation / Hue / Lightness
Gradients from Brown to Beige

This is a really cool idea .
It 's things that I 've thought about and would like to do .
If possible would I be able to help you ?
-- Lmessenger 2007-11-20 02:16:45
For sure !
At this point I 'm to mocking up window frames and a list of different widgets ( scrollbars , buttons , tabs , etc ) and a couple " Action shots " with the elements ;
Once that 's done , if you would like , list everything I 've done wrong , anything that does n't follow the guidelines , could be improved or added to , looks crowded or hurts the eye .
Additionally , if you would like , start an " Ideas " section in the meantime and list everything you feel will make the interface more intuitive and consistent .

Apologies !
I just finished an update a short while ago and noticed several people watching this page ; Apologies about the ( probably many ) emails you 've received .
I believed I was the only one interested in this page .
I 'll slow down / stop the smaller edits and make single larger updates at nights end when I have several updates ready .
Thank you for your interest , I 'll try not to disappoint .
If anyone wants to reach me personally , my email is vermette@gmail.com -- Ken Vermette , " Kver3 "
Kver3 ,
Your theme looks great , but I feel that for Ubuntu to look and feel ahead of the pack , it has to move away from the Web 2.0 aesthetic .
I find that this article provides a good baseline on what to do .

Best , BramPitoyo
Thank you for the input ;
The presentation and related material hold excellent materials and design philosophy .
The concept links in the powerpoint presentation were great , but inappropriate for a general - purpose operating system theme ;
The purpose of this theme is n't to make the new " Look " or break some design barrier , but to provide a familiar and intuitive environment for beginning users .
This theme is based on strict rules , so ideally any suggestions will get specific .
For example : " Any sliders or scollbar widgets must have a visible analog track line " .
As long as it makes some kind of sense it will probably be incorporated .
Anyway , I 'm ecstatic to hear you find the theme worthwhile enough to suggest this could pull ahead of the pack ;
Keep throwing ideas into the pot !
If you have any specific ideas ( there will be widgets coming tomorrow to comment on ) please post ;
It 's greatly appreciated .
-- Ken Vermette
Right now updates are a little bit ( read : very ) slow because I 'm re-making this theme in vector - format , so I 'm finicking with Inkscape , Xara eXtreme and other programs ( the theme right now was made in the Gimp ) .
When the time comes , this theme can be ahead of the curve with zooming and resolution technologies .
On that note , if you are experienced vector artist , please post here ; we could use you .
Also , should there be a blue version of this theme for the Blubuntu users out there ?
-- Ken
I created an idea page for those that would like to add their own ideas to this theme .
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Hardy/Alternate/BasicIdeals/Ideas
Thanks , Lucas ( Lmessenger )
Excellent !
I was n't aware you could do that , Kudos !
I 've added another section to the top of the page where your link will be more visible ( and also to have a place where we can put more links and sub - pages should we find ourselves needing more room )
I 'll move some of the content we already have to the new page when I get the chance .
Right now I 'm trying to find a way to get Xara to export SVG ( made the dock in vector , but Xara apparently does n't play nice with SVG ) .
-- Ken
SVG panels added , plus one panel zoomed in .
I 'll add the dropdowns and a few different wallpapers tomorrow or the day after .
I 've been holding out of widgets for too long , so I 'll try to get even a button and scrollbars posted when possible .
Inkscape used to build the vector graphics , GIMP used for export & low - rez font rendering ( more accurate ) .
SVG source files will be available in the attachments .
Thank you .
-- Ken
Wow , these new images are looking great !
I personally like the frames with the darker color , due to the fact that the light takes away from the whole idea .
If you could make the light smaller ( thiner line ) , then it seriously look great .
Just remember , I am just expressing my own opinion and that others may disagree with me .
Thanks ,
Lucas Calder Messenger ( Lmessenger )
Updated images , the usual .
I figure it will be user option to switch the panels out for the darker variations , however going ' by the spec ' the thicker panels will be used in images and mockups .
Thank you .
-- Ken
I like the new screen shots that you put up , but I just noticed that in comparison to the image with 4 bar that the bar on this is darker than what the other ones look like .
Just a personal thing I noticed and thought I could mention it .
-- Lmessenger 2007-11-28 05:58:03
It looks like the transparent bars are darker ; it 's probably because I reduced the opacity of the " gloss " so that the background would more readily show through , I 'll correct it .
You should be able to see the updates when I upload the next round of images ( Fri 30th Nov )
-- Ken
There has been a delay ;
The new images will be postponed until tomorrow .
Apologies .

Sorry for the suspense on updates for this theme .
After attending the art meeting and listening to the path the main OS is taking , I think there 's room for this theme provided a few minor changes are made .
Generally speaking , in the new look the gloss would be nixed , gradients would be positioned differently and it would overall have a more simple look - and - feel and really drive - home usability .
I already have several concepts on - the - go , but I 'd like input before posting them here in this wiki .
Should this theme be revamped ( along with the spec ) and have the current work go into a historic - reference section ;
Or should we keep this page as - it - is and create a new mini - wiki with a new spec ?
( I would no longer update this wiki , but every source and reference I have would be uploaded if others wanted to take over )
I really would like to go with a more streamlined look after carefully examining ( literally ) over hundreds of other themes and skins .
BramPitoyo , this would n't quite be an amazing artistic thing , but the new concepts really seem to break away from that web2.0 look .
And the spirit of the theme ( sheer usability ) would be strengthened .
Thoughts ?
Keep this wiki as - is and start anew , use this wiki as a base , or keep the theme as - is and keep going with it ( posting the new art as concepts ) ?
-- Ken. ( Fri Dec 7th , 11:36 pm : Pacific Time - 8:00 )
I think at in terms of design i have nothing to say , i just have to point that the gtk - clearlooks package which the ubuntu human theme is based on , seens rather limited for this .
I would recommend using the the murrine engine , which uses the cairo engine , which is SVG Based , instead of the clearlooks ( http://murrine.netsons.org/ ) .
See the example of Xubuntu , it switched from tango clearlooks to murrinastormcloud , and the desktop is now more apealing and fast .
If we want to implement these type of effects we should select the gtk - murrine for the base .
-- racoqster
Finally ! an update !
Sorry for the lateness , I 've had several delays recently .
Racoqster : I 'll definitely be taking a good look at what Murrine can do , odds are if it 's SVG - based it 's what I 'll be using when the time comes .
Thank you !
-- Ken Vermette
Early update , as usual please post feedback in the ideas section !
Later updates will depend on any changes , so I figured I 'd post early before the hole is dug too deep .
Added dark " strips " where the gloss used to be in panels to create depth .
Hopefully it 's not too reminiscent of gloss .
Added a panel docked to the side of the screen .
The same as a regular panel , except more transparent .
Better for widget usage .
The brown will remain the same hue & saturation ;
After tinkering , nothing of notable difference looks better .
SHIFT will be updated when widgets are complete , widgets will arrive after a few days of feedback on the windows .
The ideas section from the main page is being moved to the ideas sub-section .
And I just want to say thanks to everyone for the participation in this project !

Well , this IS a nice job .
However , Ubuntu is said to be heading towards black and orange .
So , maybe replacing chocolate by some black , mat ( in french , I do n't know what the right word in english is for " non-glossy " ) tint .
Could you try it and post a quick mockup ?
I really LOVE the theme ( except for its shitf variation , green does n't match blue very well ... even if it 's original ) .
Keep up with the theme , we 're waiting for a real release , now - Nico
Hello Nico !
I 'm going to be creating a second sub - wiki with alternate colour combonations once the primary theme is solidified .
Orange and Black is in demand , so one of the alt - themes will be orange and black .
Below is actually a list of sub - themes I 'm considering , and what will probably be their names :
Blue / Lime ( Shift )
Black / Orange ( Halloween )
White / Green ( Pearl Mint )
Black / Aqua ( Studio )
Thanks you .
I think this theme looks really , really good .
Personally , I like it better than your other theme , Union .
I justed wanted to mention that the buttons you created for the 3.3 mockup look a lot better than the ones that were used before , the sort of general ones ( I mean e.g. the + instead of the square for maximizing )
I also looked through some people 's blogs , and I found that people would really like to see this theme have a blue brother ( but you seem to be preparing for that )
This is the theme that will attract many new users !
Keep up the good work !!
- Gwijde
Hey Ken ,
Sorry to have been neglecting this forum for almost a month .
Yes , seems like all the UIs are heading toward flatter appearances ( vs. plasticky / transparent . )
But do n't throw all those rounded corners yet .
Right now ,
What I liked the most about your theme is its subtle touches , like how you did the active menu selection ( inverted rounded corners and 1 px white ' strips ' on the top and bottom ) , the Tooltip ( downward arrow ) and the menu separator ( the white ' strips ' seen between ' Search for Files and ' Recent[ly ] Opened Files ' . )
The window transparency and the borders could be good , but I think that you should figure out a way to reduce them to a minimum .
For instance , I would try decreasing the overall opacity even further and see if the design can still work .
The last thing that I would suggest is playing around with the Minimize , Maximize and Close button .
Your idea is unique ( separation between Minimize– Maximize and Close ) but the gradient does n't look quite ' right . '
Overall , I think that you 're taking the right step forward in improving usability and steering away from Web 2.0 fad by reducing gloss and emphasizing subtle gradients .
Keep it moving , and best of luck !
- BramPitoyo
Great Work so far , I hope we get something that looks this good .
I just wanted to say , keep some gloss .
too flat and it starts to look outdated , too glossy and it hurts to look at .
Finally , I have a question , I understand these are mock - ups , but are they currently possible ?
( I mean the transparency on the menus and such ) or will there need to be a lot of heavy programing work to get here ?
- AG
Hi there ,
I was just thinking , should n't we move this idea ( + Union ) to the Intrepid Ibex Artwork wiki ?
I mean , seeing as Hardy 's been released , I think we should :

FREE EXCHANGE has frequently argued that a good way to solve problems associated with overconsumption of natural resources is to price those resources appropriately .
I 've made this point specifically with regards to the ongoing drought in the American southeast .
Lake levels there remain at historical lows , and weather patterns have not gotten any more helpful of late .
Despite a few large storms in the past month , many areas of North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia just bid farewell to one of the driest Novembers on record .
After months of pleading for conservation , at least one southern leader appears ready to heed our advice .
According to the News & Observer , daily newspaper for Raleigh , North Carolina , the mayor of the capital city is prepared to introduce tiered rates for water usage under which the biggest consumers will pay the most for their water .
What led to consideration of such a novel idea ?
Not our speechifying , unfortunately , but instead success under such plans in neighboring jurisdictions :
According to UNC - Chapel Hill 's School of Government , rate structures are used to encourage conservation in about one in five water systems in the state -- including two in the Triangle .
Water - rich Cary has relied on tiered water rates since 1999 .
Its leaders credit the rates with reducing the fast - growing town 's water consumption per person .
Greensboro and other cities have also seen consumption drop since they switched to tiered rates .
And the Orange Water and Sewer Authority enacted varying rates Oct. 1 , also to encourage water conservation .
" The board wanted to send a stronger pricing signal to customers to conserve water , " said Ed Kerwin , executive director of the Orange County utility .
" Even before this drought , we wanted to be sure we 're using wisely a limited resource .
We have found that pricing is an effective tool . "
Indeed .
There are two other interesting points contained in the story linked above .
First , it 's explained that some areas face constraints on their ability to increase water rates , because utility revenues from water customers are statutorily committed to the payment of local utility bonds .
At a certain level , water rates will cause overall utility revenue to decline leaving those bonds illegally underfunded .
I suspect that level is higher than any utility is considering , but the point does demonstrate the conflict between a tax designed to reduce a negative externality and a tax meant to collect revenue .
As we consider the role of a carbon tax in reducing greenhouse gas emissions , we should remember that committal of carbon tax revenues to dedicated funding priorities could limit our ability to raise the carbon tax to necessary levels .
Finally , I 've also argued that widespread pricing of resources at appropriate levels should give a locational advantage to places that can accommodate lots of development .
Water - rich places should have cheap water rates , deserts should have expensive water , and population patterns should adjust accordingly .
As it turns out , there 's evidence this could work :
Construction contractor Chuck Clark , 40 , who recently moved to Cary from Buffalo , N.Y. , said the tiered rates have pushed his monthly water bills far above what they were up North .
" I can tell you , it 's too much money .
I 'm very upset about it , " he said .
" I was going to call to ask about it . "
People often assume that economic weakness is solely responsible for relative population decline in the midwest .
To the contrary , that weakness is due in no small part to out - migration of workers , motivated by too - cheap water , roads , electricity , and emissions in the nation 's southern half .
Using a novel radiotherapy technology called helical tomotherapy — in essence , the marriage of a computerized tomography ( CT ) scanner and a radiotherapy linear accelerator — James Welsh , associate professor of medical physics and human oncology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , and a group of colleagues have created images of fossil specimens of various types and ages .
TomoTherapy , Inc.'s
Hi -Art radiation machine , developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison , is designed to treat cancer patients with intensity - modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) .
The CT component provides images of tumor position right before each daily treatment session so that doctors can target malignancies while avoiding healthy cells .
The Hi-Art device is designed to rotate around a patient , delivering narrow , potent and precise doses of radiation to tumors without harming healthy tissue nearby — a process that takes 15 to 25 minutes .
" I was fortunate to be the first MD to ever treat a patient with this technology , " Welsh says .
" I suspect these are the world 's first megavoltage CT images of rocks and fossils from such a unit . "
The use of image - guided IMRT technology has shown promise in treating cancer , and TomoTherapy is expected to soon have competitors .
Sharp Grossmont Hospital in La Mesa , Calif. , offers patients access to a Hi -Art system , but there are only about 30 medical facilities in the country using helical tomotherapy .
This is expected to change after Varian Medical Systems , Inc. , in Palo Alto , Calif. , gets Food and Drug Administration approval to sell its RapidArc IMRT system .
Elekta , AB , in Sweden also offers comparable image - guided radiation therapy technology .
Research is currently being conducted on other possible uses for these devices .
" I plan to obtain more images and continue a scientific evaluation of the potential of this clinical machine for paleontological and geological purposes , " Welsh says .
" I expect a peer - reviewed manuscript will be ready by midyear . "

Raw Story : ( h/t Existentialist Cowboy )
Hope Steffey 's night started with a call to police for help .
It ended with her face down , naked , and sobbing on a jail cell floor .
Now , the sheriff 's deputies from Stark County , Ohio who allegedly used excessive force during a strip search 15 months ago face a federal lawsuit , and recently released video wo n’t help their case .
Steffey 's ordeal with the Stark County sheriff 's deputies began after her cousin called 9 - 1 - 1 claiming Steffey had been assaulted by another one of their cousins .
When a Stark County police officer arrived , he asked to see Steffey 's driver 's license .
But instead of handing over her own ID , she mistakenly turned over her dead sister 's license , which she contends she keeps in her wallet as a memento .
That 's when the situation became complicated .
Read on ...
There ’s a widespread belief that quantum mechanics is supposed to be confusing .
This is not a good frame of mind for either a teacher or a student .
And I find that legendarily “ confusing ” subjects often are not really all that complicated as math , particularly if you just want a very basic — but still mathematical — grasp on what goes on down there .
I am not a physicist , and physicists famously hate it when non-professional - physicists talk about quantum mechanics .
But I do have some experience with explaining mathy things that are allegedly “ hard to understand . ”
I wrote the Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning because people were complaining that Bayes ’s Theorem was “ counterintuitive ” — in fact it was famously counterintuitive — and this did not seem right .
The equation just did not seem complicated enough to deserve the fearsome reputation it had .
So I tried explaining it my way , and I did not manage to reach my original target of elementary school students , but I get frequent grateful emails from formerly confused folks ranging from reporters to outside academic college professors .
Besides , as a Bayesian , I do n’t believe in phenomena that are inherently confusing .
Confusion exists in our models of the world , not in the world itself .
If a subject is widely known as confusing , not just difficult … you should n’t leave it at that .
It does n’t satisfice ; it is not an okay place to be .
Maybe you can fix the problem , maybe you can ’t ; but you should n’t be happy to leave students confused .
The first way in which my introduction is going to depart from the traditional , standard introduction to quantum mechanics , is that I am not going to tell you that quantum mechanics is supposed to be confusing .
I am not going to tell you that it ’s okay for you to not understand quantum mechanics , because no one understands quantum mechanics , as Richard Feynman once claimed .
There was a historical time when this was true , but we no longer live in that era .
I am not going to tell you : “ You do n’t understand quantum mechanics , you just get used to it . ”
( As von Neumann is reputed to have said ; back in the dark decades when , in fact , no one did understand quantum mechanics . )
Explanations are supposed to make you less confused .
If you feel like you do n’t understand something , this indicates a problem — either with you , or your teacher — but at any rate a problem ; and you should move to resolve the problem .
I am not going to tell you that quantum mechanics is weird , bizarre , confusing , or alien .
Quantum mechanics is counterintuitive , but that is a problem with your intuitions , not a problem with quantum mechanics .
Quantum mechanics has been around for billions of years before the Sun coalesced from interstellar hydrogen .
Quantum mechanics was here before you were , and if you have a problem with that , you are the one who needs to change .
Quantum mechanics sure wo n’t .
There are no surprising facts , only models that are surprised by facts ; and if a model is surprised by the facts , it is no credit to that model .
It is always best to think of reality as perfectly normal .
Since the beginning , not one unusual thing has ever happened .
The goal is to become completely at home in a quantum universe .
Like a native .
Because , in fact , that is where you live .
In the coming sequence on quantum mechanics , I am going to consistently speak as if quantum mechanics is perfectly normal ; and when human intuitions depart from quantum mechanics , I am going to make fun of the intuitions for being weird and unusual .
This may seem odd , but the point is to swing your mind around to a native quantum point of view .
Another thing :
The traditional introduction to quantum mechanics closely follows the order in which quantum mechanics was discovered .
The traditional introduction starts by saying that matter sometimes behaves like little billiard balls bopping around , and sometimes behaves like crests and troughs moving through a pool of water .
Then the traditional introduction gives some examples of matter acting like a little billiard ball , and some examples of it acting like an ocean wave .
Now , it happens to be a historical fact that , back when students of matter were working all this stuff out and had no clue about the true underlying math , those early scientists first thought that matter was like little billiard balls .
And then that it was like waves in the ocean .
And then that it was like billiard balls again .
And then the early scientists got really confused , and stayed that way for several decades , until it was finally sorted out in the second half of the twentieth century .
Dragging a modern - day student through all this may be a historically realistic approach to the subject matter , but it also ensures the historically realistic outcome of total bewilderment .
Talking to aspiring young physicists about “ wave / particle duality ” is like starting chemistry students on the Four Elements .
An electron is not a billiard ball , and it ’s not a crest and trough moving through a pool of water .
An electron is a mathematically different sort of entity , all the time and under all circumstances , and it has to be accepted on its own terms .
The universe is not wavering between using particles and waves , unable to make up its mind .
It ’s only human intuitions about quantum mechanics that swap back and forth .
The intuitions we have for billiard balls , and the intuitions we have for crests and troughs in a pool of water , both look sort of like they ’re applicable to electrons , at different times and under different circumstances .
But the truth is that both intuitions simply are n’t applicable .
If you try to think of an electron as being like a billiard ball on some days , and like an ocean wave on other days , you will confuse the living daylights out of yourself .
Yet it ’s your eyes that are wobbling and unstable , not the world .
Furthermore :
The order in which humanity discovered things is not necessarily the best order in which to teach them .
First , humanity noticed that there were other animals running around .
Then we cut them open and found that they were full of organs .
Then we examined the organs carefully and found they were made of tissues .
Then we looked at the tissues under a microscope and discovered cells , which are made of proteins and some other chemically synthesized stuff .
Which are made of molecules , which are made of atoms , which are made of protons and neutrons and electrons which are way simpler than entire animals but were discovered tens of thousands of years later .
Physics does n’t start by talking about biology .
So why should it start by talking about very high - level complicated phenomena , like , say , the observed results of experiments ?
The ordinary way of teaching quantum mechanics keeps stressing the experimental results .
Now I do understand why that sounds nice from a rationalist perspective .
Believe me , I understand .
But it seems to me that the upshot is dragging in big complicated mathematical tools that you need to analyze real - world situations , before the student understands what fundamentally goes on in the simplest cases .
It ’s like trying to teach programmers how to write concurrent multithreaded programs before they know how to add two variables together , because concurrent multithreaded programs are closer to everyday life .
Being close to everyday life is not always a strong recommendation for what to teach first .
Maybe the monomaniacal focus on experimental observations made sense in the dark decades when no one understood what was fundamentally going on , and you could n’t start there , and all your models were just mysterious maths that gave good experimental predictions … you can still find this view of quantum physics presented in many books … but maybe today it ’s worth trying a different angle ?
The result of the standard approach is standard confusion .
The classical world is strictly implicit in the quantum world , but seeing from a classical perspective makes everything bigger and more complicated .
Everyday life is a higher level of organization , like molecules versus quarks — huge catalogue of molecules , six quarks .
I think it is worth trying to teach from the perspective of the quantum world first , and talking about classical experimental results afterward .
I am not going to start with the normal classical world and then talk about a bizarre quantum backdrop hidden behind the scenes .
The quantum world is the scene and it defines normality .
I am not going to talk as if the classical world is real life , and occasionally the classical world transmits a request for an experimental result to a quantum - physics server , and the quantum - physics server does some peculiar calculations and transmits back a classical experimental result .
I am going to talk as if the quantum world is the really real and the classical world something far away .
Not just because that makes it easier to be a native of a quantum universe , but because , at a core level , it ’s the truth .
Finally , I am going to take a strictly realist perspective on quantum mechanics — the quantum world is really out there , our equations describe the territory and not our maps of it , and the classical world only exists implicitly within the quantum one .
I am not going to discuss non-realist views in the early stages of my introduction , except to say why you should not be confused by certain intuitions that non-realists draw upon for support .
I am not going to apologize for this , and I would like to ask any non-realists on the subject of quantum mechanics to wait and hold their comments until called for in a later essay .
Do me this favor , please .
I think non-realism is one of the main things that confuses prospective students , and prevents them from being able to concretely visualize quantum phenomena .
I will discuss the issues explicitly in a future essay .
But everyone should be aware that , even though I ’m not going to discuss the issue at first , there is a sizable community of scientists who dispute the realist perspective on quantum mechanics .
Myself , I do n’t think it ’s worth figuring both ways ; I ’m a pure realist , for reasons that will become apparent .
But if you read my introduction , you are getting my view .
It is not only my view .
It is probably the majority view among theoretical physicists , if that counts for anything ( though I will argue the matter separately from opinion polls ) .
Still , it is not the only view that exists in the modern physics community .
I do not feel obliged to present the other views right away , but I feel obliged to warn my readers that there are other views , which I will not be presenting during the initial stages of the introduction .
To sum up , my goal will be to teach you to think like a native of a quantum universe , not a reluctant tourist .
Embrace reality .
Hug it tight .
To my untrained economic eye , no one has been more instructive — and right — about our economic situation than Paul Krugman .
He ’s been very tough on the presidential candidates , including Obama , and is again today .
But , he really lets McCain have it in today ’s column .
When Krugman tells me who the biggest culprits are in this current economic crisis , I believe him .
Krugman today :
Given the risks to the economy if the financial system melts down , this rescue mission is justified .
But you do n’t have to be an economic radical , or even a vocal reformer like Representative Barney Frank , the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , to see that what ’s happening now is the quid without the quo .
Last week Robert Rubin , the former Treasury secretary , declared that Mr. Frank is right about the need for expanded regulation .
Mr. Rubin put it clearly :
If Wall Street companies can count on being rescued like banks , then they need to be regulated like banks .
But will that logic prevail politically ?
Not if Mr. McCain makes it to the White House .
His chief economic adviser is former Senator Phil Gramm , a fervent advocate of financial deregulation .
In fact , I ’d argue that aside from Alan Greenspan , nobody did as much as Mr. Gramm to make this crisis possible .
So , McCain has Gramm .
Who does Hillary Clinton want back in the mix ?
Alan Greenspan :
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and other economic experts should determine whether the U.S. government needs to buy up homes to stem the country ’s housing crisis , Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will propose on Monday .
This might help Clinton get better coverage from NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell , who is married to Greenspan , but it ’s hard to see how this helps the economy .
The first name on Clinton ’s list should be Paul Krugman , not Alan Greenspan .
J A N U A R Y 2 0 0 1 Historically speaking , the " ancient " rituals of the Goddess movement are almost certainly bunk by Charlotte Allen
W ICCA , sometimes known as the Goddess movement , Goddess spirituality , or the Craft , appears to be the fastest - growing religion in America .
Thirty years ago only a handful of Wiccans existed .
One scholar has estimated that there are now more than 200,000 adherents of Wicca and related " neopagan " faiths in the United States , the country where neopaganism , like many formal religions , is most flourishing .
Wiccans -- who may also call themselves Witches ( the capital W is meant to distance them from the word 's negative connotations , because Wiccans neither worship Satan nor practice the sort of malicious magic traditionally associated with witches ) or just plain pagans ( often with a capital P ) -- tend to be white , middle - class , highly educated , and politically involved in liberal and environmental causes .
About a third of them are men .
Wiccan services have been held on at least fifteen U.S. military bases and ships .
Many come to Wicca after reading The Spiral Dance : A Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess ( 1979 ) , a best - selling introduction to Wiccan teachings and rituals written by Starhawk ( née Miriam Simos ) , a Witch ( the term she prefers ) from California .
Starhawk offers a vivid summary of the history of the faith , explaining that witchcraft is " perhaps the oldest religion extant in the West " and that it began " more than thirty - five thousand years ago , " during the last Ice Age .
The religion 's earliest adherents worshipped two deities , one of each sex : " the Mother Goddess , the birthgiver , who brings into existence all life , " and the " Horned God , " a male hunter who died and was resurrected each year .
Male shamans " dressed in skins and horns in identification with the God and the herds , " but priestesses " presided naked , embodying the fertility of the Goddess . "
All over prehistoric Europe people made images of the Goddess , sometimes showing her giving birth to the " Divine Child -- her consort , son , and seed . "
They knew her as a " triple Goddess " -- practitioners today usually refer to her as maiden , mother , crone -- but fundamentally they saw her as one deity .
Each year these prehistoric worshippers celebrated the seasonal cycles , which led to the " eight feasts of the Wheel " : the solstices , the equinoxes , and four festivals -- Imbolc ( February 2 , now coinciding with the Christian feast of Candlemas ) , Beltane ( May Day ) , Lammas or Lughnasad ( in early August ) , and Samhain ( our Halloween ) .
This nature - attuned , woman - respecting , peaceful , and egalitarian culture prevailed in what is now Western Europe for thousands of years , Starhawk wrote , until Indo - European invaders swept across the region , introducing warrior gods , weapons designed for killing human beings , and patriarchal civilization .
Then came Christianity , which eventually insinuated itself among Europe 's ruling elite .
Still , the " Old Religion " lived , often in the guise of Christian practices .
Starting in the fourteenth century , Starhawk argued , religious and secular authorities began a 400 - year campaign to eradicate the Old Religion by exterminating suspected adherents , whom they accused of being in league with the devil .
Most of the persecuted were women , generally those outside the social norm -- not only the elderly and mentally ill but also midwives , herbal healers , and natural leaders , those women whose independent ways were seen as a threat .
During " the Burning Times , " Starhawk wrote , some nine million were executed .
The Old Religion went more deeply underground , its traditions passed down secretly in families and among trusted friends , until it resurfaced in the twentieth century .
Like their ancient forebears , Wiccans revere the Goddess , practice shamanistic magic of a harmless variety , and celebrate the eight feasts , or sabbats , sometimes in the nude .
Subject to slight variations , this story is the basis of many hugely popular Goddess handbooks .
It also informs the writings of numerous secular feminists -- Gloria Steinem , Marilyn French , Barbara Ehrenreich , Deirdre English -- to whom the ascendancy of " the patriarchy " or the systematic terrorization of strong , independent women by means of witchcraft trials are historical givens .
Moreover , elements of the story suffuse a broad swath of the intellectual and literary fabric of the past hundred years , from James Frazer 's The Golden Bough and Robert Graves 's The White Goddess to the novels of D. H. Lawrence , from the writings of William Butler Yeats and T. S. Eliot to Jungian psychology and the widely viewed 1988 public - television series The Power of Myth .
In all probability , not a single element of the Wiccan story is true .
The evidence is overwhelming that Wicca is a distinctly new religion , a 1950s concoction influenced by such things as Masonic ritual and a late - nineteenth - century fascination with the esoteric and the occult , and that various assumptions informing the Wiccan view of history are deeply flawed .
Furthermore , scholars generally agree that there is no indication , either archaeological or in the written record , that any ancient people ever worshipped a single , archetypal goddess -- a conclusion that strikes at the heart of Wiccan belief .
I N the past few years two well - respected scholars have independently advanced essentially the same theory about Wicca 's founding .
In 1998 Philip G. Davis , a professor of religion at the University of Prince Edward Island , published Goddess Unmasked : The Rise of Neopagan Feminist Spirituality , which argued that Wicca was the creation of an English civil servant and amateur anthropologist named Gerald B. Gardner ( 1884-1964 ) .
Davis wrote that the origins of the Goddess movement lay in an interest among the German and French Romantics -- mostly men -- in natural forces , especially those linked with women .
Gardner admired the Romantics and belonged to a Rosicrucian society called the Fellowship of Crotona -- a group that was influenced by several late - nineteenth - century occultist groups , which in turn were influenced by Freemasonry .
In the 1950s Gardner introduced a religion he called ( and spelled ) Wica .
Although Gardner claimed to have learned Wiccan lore from a centuries - old coven of witches who also belonged to the Fellowship of Crotona , Davis wrote that no one had been able to locate the coven and that Gardner had invented the rites he trumpeted , borrowing from rituals created early in the twentieth century by the notorious British occultist Aleister Crowley , among others .
Wiccans today , by their own admission , have freely adapted and embellished Gardner 's rites .
In 1999 Ronald Hutton , a well - known historian of pagan British religion who teaches at the University of Bristol , published The Triumph of the Moon .
Hutton had conducted detailed research into the known pagan practices of prehistory , had read Gardner 's unpublished manuscripts , and had interviewed many of Gardner 's surviving contemporaries .
Hutton , like Davis , could find no conclusive evidence of the coven from which Gardner said he had learned the Craft , and argued that the " ancient " religion Gardner claimed to have discovered was a mélange of material from relatively modern sources .
Gardner seems to have drawn on the work of two people : Charles Godfrey Leland , a nineteenth - century amateur American folklorist who professed to have found a surviving cult of the goddess Diana in Tuscany , and Margaret Alice Murray , a British Egyptologist who herself drew on Leland 's ideas and , beginning in the 1920s , created a detailed framework of ritual and belief .
From his own experience Gardner included such Masonic staples as blindfolding , initiation , secrecy , and " degrees " of priesthood .
He incorporated various Tarot - like paraphernalia , including wands , chalices , and the five - pointed star , which , enclosed in a circle , is the Wiccan equivalent of the cross .
Gardner also wove in some personal idiosyncrasies .
One was a fondness for linguistic archaisms : " thee , " " thy , " " ' tis , " " Ye Bok of ye Art Magical . "
Another was a taste for nudism : Gardner had belonged to a nudist colony in the 1930s , and he prescribed that many Wiccan rituals be carried out " skyclad . "
This was a rarity even among occultists : no ancient pagan religion is known , or was thought in Gardner 's time , to have regularly called for its rites to be conducted in the nude .
Some Gardnerian innovations have sexual and even bondage - and - discipline overtones .
Ritual sex , which Gardner called " The Great Rite , " and which was also largely unknown in antiquity , was part of the liturgy for Beltane and other feasts ( although most participants simulated the act with a dagger -- another of Gardner 's penchants -- and a chalice ) .
Other rituals called for the binding and scourging of initiates and for administering " the fivefold kiss " to the feet , knees , " womb " ( according to one Wiccan I spoke with , a relatively modest spot above the pubic bone ) , breasts , and lips .
Hutton effectively demolished the notion , held by Wiccans and others , that fundamentally pagan ancient customs existed beneath medieval Christian practices .
His research reveals that outside of a handful of traditions , such as decorating with greenery at Yuletide and celebrating May Day with flowers , no pagan practices -- much less the veneration of pagan gods -- have survived from antiquity .
Hutton found that nearly all the rural seasonal pastimes that folklorists once viewed as " timeless " fertility rituals , including the Maypole dance , actually date from the Middle Ages or even the eighteenth century .
There is now widespread consensus among historians that Catholicism thoroughly permeated the mental world of medieval Europe , introducing a robust popular culture of saints ' shrines , devotions , and even charms and spells .
The idea that medieval revels were pagan in origin is a legacy of the Protestant Reformation .
Hutton has also pointed out a lack of evidence that either the ancient Celts or any other pagan culture celebrated all the " eight feasts of the Wheel " that are central to Wiccan liturgy .
" The equinoxes seem to have no native pagan festivals behind them and became significant only to occultists in the nineteenth century , " Hutton told me .
" There is still no proven pagan feast that stood as ancestor to Easter " -- a festival that modern pagans celebrate as Ostara , the vernal equinox .
Historians have overturned another basic Wiccan assumption : that the group has a history of persecution exceeding even that of the Jews .
The figure Starhawk cited -- nine million executed over four centuries -- derives from a late - eighteenth - century German historian ; it was picked up and disseminated a hundred years later by a British feminist named Matilda Gage and quickly became Wiccan gospel ( Gardner himself coined the phrase " the Burning Times " ) .
Most scholars today believe that the actual number of executions is in the neighborhood of 40,000 .
The most thorough recent study of historical witchcraft is Witches and Neighbors ( 1996 ) , by Robin Briggs , a historian at Oxford University .
Briggs pored over the documents of European witch trials and concluded that most of them took place during a relatively short period , 1550 to 1630 , and were largely confined to parts of present - day France , Switzerland , and Germany that were already racked by the religious and political turmoil of the Reformation .
The accused witches , far from including a large number of independent - minded women , were mostly poor and unpopular .
Their accusers were typically ordinary citizens ( often other women ) , not clerical or secular authorities .
In fact , the authorities generally disliked trying witchcraft cases and acquitted more than half of all defendants .
Briggs also discovered that none of the accused witches who were found guilty and put to death had been charged specifically with practicing a pagan religion .
If Internet chat rooms are any indication , some Wiccans cling tenaciously to the idea of themselves as institutional victims on a large scale .
Generally speaking , though , Wiccans appear to be accommodating themselves to much of the emerging evidence concerning their antecedents : for example , they are coming to view their ancient provenance as inspiring legend rather than hard - and - fast history .
By the end of the 1990s , with the appearance of Davis 's book and then of Hutton 's , many Wiccans had begun referring to their story as a myth of origin , not a history of survival .
" We do n't do what Witches did a hundred years ago , or five hundred years ago , or five thousand years ago , " Starhawk told me .
" We 're not an unbroken tradition like the Native Americans . "
In fact , many Wiccans now describe those who take certain elements of the movement 's narrative literally as " Wiccan fundamentalists . "
A N even more controversial strand of the challenge to the Wiccan narrative concerns the very existence of ancient Goddess worship .
One problem with the theory of Goddess worship , scholars say , is that the ancients were genuine polytheists .
They did not believe that the many gods and goddesses they worshipped merely represented different aspects of single deities .
In that respect they were like animistic peoples of today , whose cosmologies are crowded with discrete spirits .
" Polytheism was an accepted reality , " says Mary Lefkowitz , a professor of classics at Wellesley College .
" Everywhere you went , there were shrines to different gods . "
The gods and goddesses had specific domains of power over human activity : Aphrodite / Venus presided over love , Artemis / Diana over hunting and childbirth , Ares / Mars over war , and so forth .
Not until the second century , with the work of the Roman writer Apuleius , was one goddess , Isis , identified with all the various goddesses and forces of nature .
As Christianity spread , the classical deities ceased to be the objects of religious cults , but they continued their reign in Western literature and art .
Starting about 1800 they began to be associated with semi-mystical natural forces , rather than with specific human activities .
In the writings of the Romantics , for example ( John Keats 's " Endymion " comes to mind ) , Diana presided generally over the woodlands and the moon .
" Mother Earth " became a popular literary deity .
In 1849 the German classicist Eduard Gerhard made the assertion , for the first time in modern Western history , that all the ancient goddesses derived from a single prehistoric mother goddess .
In 1861 the Swiss jurist and writer Johann Jakob Bachofen postulated that the earliest human civilizations were matriarchies .
Bachofen 's theory influenced a wide range of thinkers , including Friedrich Engels , a generation of British intellectuals , and probably Carl Jung .
By the early 1900s scholars generally agreed that the great goddess and earth mother had reigned supreme in ancient Mediterranean religions , and was toppled only when ethnic groups devoted to father gods conquered her devotees .
In 1901 the British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans excavated the Minoan palace at Knossos , on Crete , uncovering colorful frescoes of bull dancers and figurines of bare - breasted women carrying snakes .
From this scant evidence Evans concluded that the Minoans , who preceded the Zeus- venerating Greeks by several centuries , had worshipped the great goddess in her virgin and mother aspects , along with a subordinate male god who was her son and consort .
Throughout the 1920s and 1930s archaeologists excavating Paleolithic and Neolithic sites in Europe and even Pueblo Indian settlements in Arizona almost reflexively proclaimed the female figurines they found to be images of the great goddess .
The archaeologists drew on the work of late - nineteenth - century anthropologists .
A belief that Stone Age peoples ( and their " primitive " modern counterparts ) did not realize that men played a role in human procreation was popular among many early British and American anthropologists .
Female fertility was an awesome mystery , and women , as the sole sources of procreation , were highly honored .
This notion -- that hunter - gatherer societies could n't figure out the birds and the bees -- has since been discredited , but " it was very intriguing to people mired in Victorianism , " according to Cynthia Eller , a professor of religious studies at Montclair State University , in New Jersey , who is writing a book on the subject .
" They wanted to find a blissful sexual communism , a society in which chastity and monogamy were not important , " Eller says .
It was the same general impulse that led Margaret Mead to conclude in the 1920s that Samoan adolescents indulged in guilt - free promiscuity before marriage .
Archaeological expeditions even in the latter half of the century bolstered the notion of a single goddess figure from antiquity .
In 1958 a British archaeologist named James Mellaart made a major find : a 9,000 - year - old agricultural settlement that once housed up to 10,000 people at Çatalhöyük , one of the largest of several mounds near the modern - day town of Konya , in southern Turkey .
Mellaart unearthed a number of female figurines that he deemed to be representations of the mother goddess .
One was a headless female nude sitting on what appears to be a throne and flanked by leopards , with a protuberant belly that could be interpreted as a sign of pregnancy .
The Çatalhöyük settlement contained no fortifications , and its houses were nearly all the same size , seemingly implying just the sort of nonviolent , egalitarian social system that Goddess - worshippers believe prevailed .
Çatalhöyük became the Santiago de Compostela of the Goddess movement , with hundreds of pilgrims visiting the settlement annually .
The enthroned nude is a revered Goddess - movement object .
Mellaart 's conclusions were bolstered by the work of the late Marija Gimbutas , a Lithuanian - born archaeologist who taught at the University of California at Los Angeles until 1989 .
Gimbutas specialized in the Neolithic Balkans .
Like Mellaart , she tended to attach religious meaning to the objects she uncovered ; the results of her Balkan digs were published in 1974 under the title The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe .
In 1982 Gimbutas reissued her book as The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe , and she began seeing representations of the Goddess , and of female reproductive apparatus ( wombs , Fallopian tubes , amniotic fluid ) , in a huge array of Stone Age artifacts , even in abstractions such as spirals and dots .
In 1993 Ian Hodder , a Stanford University archaeologist , began re-excavating Çatalhöyük , using up - to - date techniques including isotopic analysis of the skeletons found in the graves .
" Your bones reflect what you eat , even if you died nine thousand years ago , " Hodder says .
" And we found that men and women had different diets .
The men ate more meat , and the women ate more plant food .
You can interpret that in many ways .
A rich protein diet is helpful for physical activity , so you could say that the men ate better -- but you could also argue that the women preferred plant food .
What it does suggest is that there was a division of labor and activity " -- not necessarily the egalitarian utopia that Goddess worshippers have assumed .
Hodder 's team also discovered numerous human figurines of the male or an indeterminate sex , and found that the favorite Çatalhöyük representation was not women but animals .
None of the art the team uncovered conclusively depicts copulation or childbirth .
Hodder , along with most archaeologists of his generation , endeavors to assess objects in the context of where they were unearthed -- a dramatic change from the school of archaeology that was in vogue at the time of Mellaart 's and Gimbutas 's excavations .
He points out that almost all the female figurines at Çatalhöyük came from rubbish heaps ; the enthroned nude woman was found in a grain bin .
" Very little in the context of the find suggests that they were religious objects , " Hodder says .
" They were maybe more like talismans , something to do with daily life . "
Furthermore , excavations of sites in Turkey , Greece , and Southeastern Europe that were roughly contemporaneous with the Çatalhöyük settlement have yielded evidence -- fortifications , maces , bones bearing dagger marks -- that Stone Age Europe , contrary to the Goddess narrative , probably saw plenty of violence .
Lynn Meskell , an archaeologist at Columbia University who has published detailed critiques of Gimbutas 's work , complains that Gimbutas and her devotees have promoted a romanticized " essentialist " view of women , defining them primarily in terms of fecundity and maternal gentleness .
" You have people saying that Çatalhöyük was this peaceful , vegetarian society , " says Meskell .
" It 's ludicrous .
Neolithic settlements were not utopias in any sense at all . "
The research of archaeologists like Hodder and Meskell has sparked heated rebuttals from Goddess theorists .
" We know that even in the West most of art is religious art , " says Riane Eisler , the author of the best seller The Chalice and the Blade ( 1987 ) .
" Do n't tell me that suddenly these are dolls .
Give me a break !
You have a woman at Çatalhöyük sitting on a throne giving birth , and you want to call it a doll ? "
In her introduction to a new edition of The Spiral Dance , Starhawk -- who is working on a film about Gimbutas -- complains about " biased and inaccurate " academic scholarship aimed at discrediting her movement .
Perhaps the most painful attack , as far as many Wiccans are concerned , came last June , with the publication of Cynthia Eller 's The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory .
In 1993 Eller had published a sympathetic sociological study of feminist spirituality , Living in the Lap of the Goddess , which many in the movement put on their required - reading lists .
Her recent work thus carries a tinge of betrayal , inasmuch as it puts her firmly in Hodder and Meskell 's camp .
Eller points out that almost no serious archaeologist working today believes that these ancient cultures were necessarily matriarchal or even woman - focused , and most do not interpret any of the things unearthed by Mellaart and Gimbutas as necessarily depicting goddesses or genitalia .
Despite their ire , both Starhawk and Eisler , along with many of their adherents , seem to be moving toward a position that accommodates , without exactly accepting , the new Goddess scholarship , much as they have done with respect to the new research about their movement 's beginnings .
If the ancients did not literally worship a mother goddess , perhaps they worshipped her in a metaphoric way , by recognizing the special female capacity for bearing and nourishing new life -- a capacity to which we might attach the word " goddess " even if prehistoric peoples did not .
" Most of us look at the archaeological artifacts and images as a source of art , or beauty , or something to speculate about , because the images fit with our theory that the earth is sacred , and that there is a cycle of birth and growth and regeneration , " Starhawk told me .
" I believe that there was an Old Religion that focused on the female , and that the culture was roughly egalitarian . "
S UCH faith may explain why Wicca is thriving despite all the things about it that look like hokum : it gives its practitioners a sense of connection to the natural world and of access to the sacred and beautiful within their own bodies .
I am hardly the first to notice that Wicca bears a striking resemblance to another religion -- one that also tells of a dying and rising god , that venerates a figure who is both virgin and mother , that keeps , in its own way , the seasonal " feasts of the Wheel , " that uses chalices and candles and sacred poetry in its rituals .
Practicing Wicca is a way to have Christianity without , well , the burdens of Christianity .
" It has the advantages of both Catholicism and Unitarianism , " observes Allen Stairs , a philosophy professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in religion and magic .
" Wicca allows one to wear one 's beliefs lightly but also to have a rich and imaginative religious life . "
" Diotima Mantineia , " age forty - eight , is the associate editor of the Web site The Witches ' Voice , found at witchvox .com ( she would not divulge her real name , partly because she lives in a southern town that she believes is unfriendly to neopagans ) .
She summed up her feelings on the debunking of the official Wiccan narrative this way : " It does n't matter to me how old Wicca is , because when I connect with Deity as Lady and Lord , I know that I am connecting with something much larger and vaster than I can fully comprehend .
The Creator of this universe has been manifesting to us for all time , in the forms of gods and goddesses that we can relate to .
This personal connection with Deity is what is meaningful .
For me , Wicca works to facilitate that connection , and that is what really matters . "

The subject of metamaterials is mad science at its finest – researchers trying to create materials with properties that do n’t exist in nature , and that can not be made with ordinary atoms .
Metamaterials possess nano - scale structures and special effects that can only be created in the lab , which can lead to a variety of interesting applications .
For example , some metamaterials have a negative refractive index , meaning they refract incoming light waves “ through ” themselves rather than back to the source of the light , and act as “ invisible cloaks . ”
Now , researchers from Imperial College London are doing something a little different with metamaterials .
In a recent study published in Nature Materials , Fridrik Magnus , et al. , have fabricated the first non-resonant metamaterial that operates with light waves of zero frequency .
This goal is somewhat different than most studies with metamaterials , which focus on higher frequencies like microwaves and visible light .
For one thing , the scientists could use the metamaterial as a building block for a magnetic invisibility cloak .
Such a cloak could hide magnetism by guiding an applied magnetic field around a cloaked region .
“ It is already possible to protect a region of space from magnetic fields ; simply surrounding it with a strongly magnetic material will do the job , ” coauthor Ben Wood of Imperial College London told PhysOrg.com .
“ However , a magnetic cloak would go further – it would keep magnetic fields out of the inner region without disturbing the fields outside the cloak . ”
In the zero - frequency regime , the wavelength is very large , and magnetism and electricity become decoupled .
This decoupling allows the researchers to concentrate on the magnetic properties without worrying about the electric ones when designing devices like the cloak .
“ When we say that ours is a zero - frequency metamaterial , we mean that it behaves as intended only at very low or zero frequency , ” Wood explained .
“ It will interact with light at higher frequencies , but not in a useful way . ”
The new metamaterial consists of layers of stacked lattices , which themselves are composed of 10 x 10 arrays of thin lead plates .
One of the defining properties of a metamaterial is that its lattice spacing must be smaller than the wavelength of light it interacts with .
For light with zero frequency , the wavelength is large and diverges , so that this constraint is easily met .
The individual lead plates in the design are 300 nanometers thick and 167 micrometers across , with the lattices spaced 100 micrometers apart .
The researchers then applied a magnetic field to the metamaterial , “ pushing ” the field through the gaps between the lead plates .
The metamaterial showed a diamagnetic response – a weak magnetic repulsion .
The strength of the repulsion depended on the ratio between the size of the lead plates and the lattice spacing .
For the scientists , this connection was significant : it meant that they could tune the metamaterial ’s magnetic properties .
The researchers explain that the non-resonant metamaterial could have some advantages over those that consist of resonant structures and have a negative refractive index .
The negative refractive index is one way to achieve optical invisibility , but it comes at the price of high loss and frequency dispersion .
The researchers plan to use non-resonant metamaterials for other purposes .
For instance , a design paradigm called transformation optics tells scientists what properties are needed to achieve a certain effect .
Because these properties always have non-negative refractive indices , non-resonant metamaterials can provide the required properties .
“ Transformation optics is a way to design devices , ” Wood explained .
“ It allows us to mimic transforming space for light , and gives us a prescription for the electromagnetic properties we need to achieve a given effect , like cloaking .
However , these properties are not usually found in natural materials , and this is where metamaterials can help .
They allow us to make the devices that we design using transformation optics . ”

Few people have heard of the mite harvestman , and fewer still would recognize it at close range .
The animal is a relative of the far more familiar daddy longlegs .
But its legs are stubby rather than long , and its body is only as big as a sesame seed .
To find mite harvestmen , scientists go to dark , humid forests and sift through the leaf litter .
The animals respond by turning motionless , making them impossible for even a trained eye to pick out .
“ They look like grains of dirt , ” said Gonzalo Giribet , an invertebrate biologist at Harvard .
As frustrating as mite harvestmen may be , Dr. Giribet and his colleagues have spent six years searching for them on five continents .
The animals have an extraordinary story to tell : they carry a record of hundreds of millions of years of geological history , chronicling the journeys that continents have made around the Earth .
The Earth ’s land masses have slowly collided and broken apart again several times , carrying animals and plants with them .
These species have provided clues to the continents ’ paths .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Practicing a particular type of meditation twice a day can significantly reduce blood pressure , according to an analysis of existing research on the technique .
The blood pressure reductions associated with regular practice of transcendental meditation , or TM , would translate to a 12 - 15 percent reduced risk of dying from cardiovascular causes and a 15 - 20 percent lower risk of stroke , Dr. James W. Anderson , the study ’s lead author , told Reuters Health .
In TM , a person sits in a comfortable chair for 20 minutes twice a day and attempts to quiet the mind by focusing on a mantra , Anderson explained .
“ It ’s fairly simple but you need training to get into it , ” he added .
“ It allows you to get below the kind of ‘ cocktail chatter ’ that ’s always going on in your brain . ”
There are a number of different types of meditation and relaxation techniques , Anderson pointed out , but he said TM has a unique ability to bring the practitioner into a “ quiet zone ” that acts as a kind of “ sanctuary ” for a person , refreshing them and reducing stress .
Some research on TM has been criticized as being biased and of poor quality , the researcher and his colleagues at the University of Kentucky in Lexington note in their report in the American Journal of Hypertension .
To better understand the real benefits of the practice for people with high blood pressure , they looked at nine trials that compared blood pressure changes in a group of patients practicing TM versus a “ control ” group .
The researchers limited their analysis of the findings to the three clinical trials they rated as being high quality .
Based on these three studies , TM reduced systolic blood pressure ( the top number in a blood pressure reading ) by 4.7 points , and diastolic blood pressure ( the bottom number ) by 3.2 points .
“ Sustained blood pressure reductions of this magnitude are likely to significantly reduce the risk of heart disease , ” Anderson and his team conclude .

BAGHDAD  Doah Mohammed played a trick on her mother - in law on Tuesday .
She called her and told her that her son , Ms. Mohammed ’s husband , had been arrested by American and Iraqi soldiers .
When she got the news , Ms. Mohammed ’s mother - in - law gasped and said she was about to faint .
So Ms. Mohammed quickly told her that it was only a prank , and the two women laughed  it was , after all , April Fools ’ Day .
Before 2003 , the traditional day of tricks and practical jokes  known here as Kithbet Neesan , or April Lie , and imported from the West decades ago  was observed much as it is in the United States .
The teasing was biting , but ultimately tame .
A man might try to convince a friend that he had gotten a visa to go to America , for example , or a mother might tell her son that his father had bought him a new car .
Even Saddam Hussein ’s son Uday had joined in .
On April 1 , 1998 , his newspaper published a front - page story saying that President Clinton had called for the United Nations sanctions against Iraq to be lifted .

Leah Robbins has certainly made quite a splash in the world of swimming .
The three - year - old not only passed her 50 m badge when she was just 13 months old , but the pint sized toddler has now become one of the youngest swimmers ever in this country to be awarded a badge for swimming 400m .
The waterbaby wonder now has her sights set on a professional career and the Olympics when she grows up after achieving her latest amazing milestone .

Natural : Three - year - old Leah Robbins has become the youngest person to receive the 400 m badge
Little Leah is already looking to add the 800 m badge to her growing collection of swimming achievements .
The supertot 's proud mum , Kay Masters , 27 , said : " Leah was recognised by the Guinness Book of Records , although they wo n't publish it because they do n't want parents trying to beat it and chucking their kids in the pool when they are really young .
" We think it 's excellent , because it 's a natural achievement - we do n't push her , she does it because she loves it . "
She added : " Leah 's quite an adamant little girl and if she did n't want to do it , she would n't .
" She actually swam 500 m , even though it was for the 400m .
Leah , of Gorleston , near Great Yarmouth , Norfolk , started swimming when she was just four months old at her local pool in Pontin 's Holiday Park , Hemsby .
Leah , who swims front crawl and backstroke , goes swimming at least once a week .
And it seems a love of swimming runs in the family - her brother Luke , now seven , passed his two - mile badge when he was just six .

Little Leah already has ambitions to become the next big thing in swimming
Miss Masters said : " Leah used to go and watch Luke when he started swimming lessons and wanted to go in herself .
" She took her 10 m , 25 m and 50 m and 100 m badges when she was two .
" I think we encourage each other - they probably got into swimming because of me , but I have got more into swimming because the children are . "
The mum - of - three added : " My other son , Rhys , who is one , likes swimming , too , but unfortunately he can't go as much because he has asthma . "
An Amateur Swimming Association spokesman said : " It 's great that Leah has swum such a distance at only three years of age .
" What is important now is that she continues her development through the new National Plan for Teaching Swimming to make further progress .
" We hope that she is enjoying her time being active in the water and continues to do so . "
Leah has also been chosen as the face of the new website of nappy firm Huggies , www.littleswimmers.com, which aims to encourage children to take the plunge at their local swimming pool .
A press release from the Department of Education gives a few more details about the hearing being held Monday in Orlando about the state science standards .
Monday , February 11 , 2008
10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m .
Orlando Hyatt
Orlando International Airport
9000 Airport Boulevard
Orlando
Of special note is that there will be a live feed of the meeting over the Internet , and that the Board of Education members are supposed to be watching .
Any individuals wishing to address the State Board of Education regarding the proposed science standards are invited to speak at the hearing .
Speakers will be allotted three minutes each .
State Board of Education members will view the hearing via live Web cast or will be presented with a video recording of the entire meeting .
Apparently , there will be a link to the feed at the Florida Department of Education website that day .
Unfortunately , many people ( especially teachers ) will be at work during this hearing .
I know I will be .
So , who can take the time to attend and speak up for sound science education ?
Many Americans still wonder why we went to war against Iraq .
Perhaps it was mistaken intelligence .
Others have suggested it was initiated to control oil supplies .
Even if oil was not the covert casus belli the Iraq war has , and will continue to have , marked effects on U.S. oil imports .
Another struggle – perhaps over oil – looms in Africa .
Whether this will involve us in hostilities or not depends on leaders in Washington and in China .
At the moment humanitarian concerns are focused on the Darfur region of Sudan .
Many have forgotten that a bloody and protracted war was fought only a little earlier in Sudan , between northern and southern regions .
The southern region is largely non-Arab with English speaking elites .
When Britain granted independence to Sudan the Muslim Arab northern region , with the capital in Khartoum , dominated the southern region .
Civil war between the regions broke out in 1955 and continued for 17 years .
In 1972 the Addis Abba Accords granted the southern region much more internal autonomy but peace did not last long .
In 1982 Khartoum imposed strict Islamic Sharia law in the south as in the rest of Sudan , and suspended constitutional guarantees .
A second civil war broke out .
Almost 2 million people , mostly in the south , died in this war , many were taken north into slavery , and 4 million displaced .
This war was fought until January , 2005 , when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed .
This was not just a war about ethnic differences ; it was also about resources .
The south is not only less arid ; it has 80 percent of the proven oil reserves of the country .
The Peace Agreement stipulated that oil revenue would be divided equally between north and south .
It also stipulated that at the end of six years a referendum would be held in the south : independence or continued union with the north .
That is three years from this January 9 and the maneuvering has begun .
The referendum requires a census of the population and that census cannot take place until the border between north and south is clearly drawn .
But the Khartoum government has refused to withdraw troops from the disputed region .
The southerners also claim that the Khartoum government has sidelined southern ministers and has not handed over 50 percent of the oil revenues .
In September the southerners pulled out of the unity government .
The big , new kid in the neighborhood , displacing Egypt , Russia , and the U.S. , is China .
Not really new to the area but newly voracious for oil .
Sudan is not the only place in Africa that China has established a major presence in its quest for oil and other resources as well as for markets .
China continues to invest billions of dollars in many sub-Saharan countries using foreign exchange gleaned from their exports .
Since 1996 China has signed on to approximately 30 oil and gas deals , involving 14 African countries , ranging from building refineries to importing crude oil .
They are pushing hardest to control the oil of Sudan and have helped build the Sudanese military .
During the Clinton administration Osama bin Laden was based in Khartoum and Sudan was considered a major backer of terrorist activities .
In 1996 the U.S. provided $ 20 million in military equipment – supposedly non-lethal – through Ethiopia , Eritrea and Uganda – to support groups trying to overthrow the Khartoum government .
This included support materiel for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army of the south .
During this tumultuous time American oil companies moved out of Sudan and China moved in .
China has had little regard for human rights issues in the countries in which they wish to expand their interests .
They have supported tyrants such as Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe .
When questioned about this , Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Wenzhong is quoted as saying " Business is business . "
The phrase and the attitude are borrowed directly from 1890s capitalists .
This has paid off for the Chinese on a short - term basis but may not do so in the long run .
Much of China 's activity in Africa can be treated as normal commercial competition although big - power relationships are involved .
Such activities need not lead to hostilities .
In Sudan the situation is different .
Talks between the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement ( SPLM ) in the south and the Khartoum government broke off in September .
The SPLM has promised to start civil disobedience protests on January 9 unless there is more progress on revenue sharing and the independence referendum .
Some SPLM leaders now talk of allying with Darfur rebels in a potential assault on the Khartoum government .
Conflict is likely .
Let us hope China 's leaders and our leaders are exerting themselves to head off such conflict .
Otherwise we will be pulled into supporting opposite sides in another very nasty war very soon .
Many Americans still wonder why we went to war against Iraq .
Perhaps it was mistaken intelligence .
Others have suggested it was initiated to control oil supplies .
Even if oil was not the covert casus belli the Iraq war has , and will continue to have , marked effects on U.S. oil imports .

It has become a deeply entrenched belief among the public - drink at least eight glasses of water a day to maintain health and wellbeing .
Bottled water companies often repeat the claim to boost their sales but it is bunkum .
There is no evidence that drinking eight glasses of water a day improves skin tone , aids dieting or prevents headaches ( except those induced by hangovers ) , scientists say .
US researchers who reviewed the evidence concluded most people do not need to worry about their water consumption , as they will be getting plenty of fluid in other ways – from tea , coffee and other drinks and from the food they eat .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The misunderstanding is believed to have arisen from a 1945 recommendation that adults should consume 2.5 litres of water daily , one millilitre for every calorie consumed , which was highlighted by the British Medical Journal in December .
The crucial part of the recommendation , however – " most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods " – is usually ignored .
That error is compounded by the belief that caffeinated drinks such as tea , coffee and cola , and alcohol do not count towards the total .
But that , too , is baseless .
Tea and coffee and weak alcoholic drinks such as beer can contribute to the daily total , in moderation , despite being mildly diuretic ( stimulating the production of urine ) .
Less well known are the dangers of drinking too much water , which can be dangerous , resulting in water intoxication , hyponatraemia ( low salt levels ) and even death .
The obsession with maintaining hydration has led to an increasing rate of collapse among distance runners in the last decade who drink so much they suffer water intoxication .
The review of research by Dan Negoianu and Stanley Goldfarb , from the University of Pennsylvania , in Philadelphia , found not a single study included the recommendation to drink eight 8 oz glasses of water a day .
Although one small study suggested that drinking water could result in fewer headaches , the results were not statistically significant .
The benefits of drinking a pint of water before bed after a night 's drinking to ward off a hangover are , separately , well established .
No studies showedany benefit to skin tone as a result of increased water intake .
Dehydration can make skin less plump , but there was no solid evidence to back up the claim water helps people maintain a youthful appearance .
The authors also found no evidence that drinking lots of water benefits the body 's organs .

During the ice age it adorned a fearsome woolly mammoth .
Reappearing from the mists of time , the 4ft - long piece of tusk was washed up on a Yorkshire beach .
Scroll down for more ...
Connor Clark , Blousy Haorang and Arachai Haorang hold the woolly mammoth tusk they found at Spurn Point in Yorkshire
There it was spotted by Arachai Haorang , 13 , his sister Blousy , nine , and their cousin Connor Clark , ten , during a family walk along Spurn Point .
At first they thought it was a piece of driftwood but when it was too solid to break on a rock , one of them suggested it could be a dinosaur or whale bone .
To their amazement , they were n't far off .
They carried the tusk - weighing around 60lb - to a nearby visitor centre and the site warden knew immediately they had discovered a historical treasure .
Andrew Gibson , from the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust , said : " I knew instantly what it was .
I could tell from its size , weight and curvature that it was a tusk .
" It 's incredible to think that when they picked it up they would have been the first in
50,000 years to have touched it . "

Mammoth tusk : Dates back to the last Ice Age when the North Sea was land and Mammoths grazed there
The tusk is between 12,000 and 75,000 years old and a conservator who is now carrying out preservation work on it has estimated that it comes from the " older end of the time period " .
Mr Gibson said a ten - inch piece of tusk was found in 1996 at Spurn Point , a three mile - long finger of land at the mouth of the Humber Estuary .
But discovering such a huge section of woolly mammoth was " extremely rare " .
'" It dates back to the last ice age when the North Sea was land and woolly mammoths grazed there , " he said .
Arachai and Blousy 's mother , Diane Haorang , 37 , as well as her her brother and father , were all present when the tusk was found .
Mrs Haorang , who runs a carpet cleaning business with her Thai - born husband , said : " The children are all very excited about making such an amazing discovery . "
A more complete but similar length Siberian mammoth tusk was sold two years ago by Sotheby 's for £ 6,000 .
The Spurn Point tusk will be returned to the wildlife trust 's visitor centre for future generations to appreciate .
Meanwhile , the young beachcombers have become keen treasure hunters .
The next weekend they returned to the same area and found a bone , thought to come from an ice age elk .
Washington Post Style editor killed gossip piece on New Orleans madam , columnist says
A Washington Post Style editor killed a story on a New Orleans madam who alleged she arranged trysts for Louisiana senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) , a Post gossip columnist says .
Post gossip guru Amy Argetsinger arranged an interview with a madam in New Orleans after Vitter admitted his name appeared on the phone records of a DC madam .
Speaking to the Washington City Paper 's Erik Wemple in an article published Friday , she said her editor , Steve Reiss , " spiked the story on sourcing grounds . "
 Reiss was aware that everyone else was writing about her but said that we cant use that as an excuse in essence , that the Post had to take the higher moral ground ,  Argetsinger said in an email .
The next day , she said she found an article on the Post 's website which reported the same allegations in an Associated Press story .
The DC gossip maven was n't mad , according to the interview .
 I guess I was arguing , look , the Posts already tainted here ,  she said -- but claims the the Post 's executive editor Len Downie agreed with Weiss .
The tidbit , which appeared in a larger story about the Post , was first caught by BigHeadDC , a Washington , D.C. blog .
Interesting :
Dread is a powerful force .
The problem with dread is that it leads to terrible decision - making .
Slovic says all of this results from how our brains process risk , which is in two ways .
The first is intuitive , emotional and experience based .
Not only do we fear more what we can’t control , but we also fear more what we can imagine or what we experience .
This seems to be an evolutionary survival mechanism .
In the presence of uncertainty , fear is a valuable defense .
Our brains react emotionally , generate anxiety and tell us , “ Remember the news report that showed what happened when those other kids took the bus ?
Do n’t put your kids on the bus . ”
The second way we process risk is analytical : we use probability and statistics to override , or at least prioritize , our dread .
That is , our brain plays devil ’s advocate with its initial intuitive reaction , and tries to say , “ I know it seems scary , but eight times as many people die in cars as they do on buses .
In fact , only one person dies on a bus for every 500 million miles buses travel .
Buses are safer than cars . ”
Unfortunately for us , that ’s often not the voice that wins .
Intuitive risk processors can easily overwhelm analytical ones , especially in the presence of those etched - in images , sounds and experiences .
Intuition is so strong , in fact , that if you presented someone who had experienced a bus accident with factual risk analysis about the relative safety of buses over cars , it ’s highly possible that they ’d still choose to drive their kids to school , because their brain washes them in those dreadful images and reminds them that they control a car but do n’t control a bus .
A car just feels safer .
“ We have to work real hard in the presence of images to get the analytical part of risk response to work in our brains , ” says Slovic .
“ It ’s not easy at all . ”
And we ’re making it harder by disclosing more risks than ever to more people than ever .
Not only does all of this disclosure make us feel helpless , but it also gives us ever more of those images and experiences that trigger the intuitive response without analytical rigor to override the fear .
Slovic points to several recent cases where reason has lost to fear :
The sniper who terrorized Washington D.C. ; pathogenic threats like MRSA and brain - eating amoeba .
Even the widely publicized drunk - driving death of a baseball player this year led to decisions that , from a risk perspective , were irrational .
Tom Daschle : First Lady experience does n't qualify Hillary David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Sunday March 9 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Former Senate Majority Leader , Tom Daschle , spoke on NBC's Meet the Press about whether or not Hillary Clinton 's experience as First Lady gave her an edge over Barack Obama .
" I know what a good First Lady she was , but it would be hard for me to draw some degree of connection between being a First Lady and having experience to be the Commander in Chief , " Daschle said .
" She served in the Senate , she 's been on the Armed Services Committee and I give her credit for that , but in terms of numbers of years of elected office , the number of years served , Barack Obama has more years served than Hillary Clinton . "
He added , " So it 's a specious argument .
The fact is , both of them are qualified .
They 're good candidates .
They both would make great leaders .
I do believe that Barack offers a lot more in the capacity of leadership , but i do n't think anyone can look at her experience as First Lady and say , for some reason , that qualifies her to run for President of the United States . "

CBS , the home of the most celebrated news division in broadcasting , has been in discussions with Time Warner about a deal to outsource some of its news - gathering operations to CNN , two executives briefed on the matter said Monday .
Over the last decade , CNN has held intermittent talks with both ABC News and CBS News about various joint ventures .
But during the last several months , talks with CBS have been revived and lately intensified , according to the executives who asked for anonymity because of the confidential nature of the negotiations .
Broadly speaking , the executives described conversations about reducing CBS ’s news - gathering capacity while keeping its frontline personalities , like Katie Couric , the CBS Evening News anchor , and paying a fee to CNN to buy the cable network ’s news feeds .
Another possibility , these people said , would be for CBS to keep its correspondents in certain regions but pair them with CNN crews .
After saying she found her “ voice ” in New Hampshire , she has turned into Sybil .
We ’ve had Experienced Hillary , Soft Hillary , Hard Hillary , Misty Hillary , Sarcastic Hillary , Joined - at - the - Hip - to - Bill Hillary , Her - Own - Person - Who - Just - Happens - to - Be- Married - to - a- Former - President Hillary , It ’s - My - Turn Hillary , Cuddly Hillary , Let ’s - Get - Down - in - the - Dirt - and - Fight - Like - Dogs Hillary .
Just as in the White House , when her cascading images and hairstyles became dizzying and unsettling , suggesting that the first lady woke up every day struggling to create a persona , now she seems to think there is a political solution to her problem .
If she can only change this or that about her persona , or tear down this or that about Obama’s .
But the whirlwind of changes and charges gets wearing .
By threatening to throw the kitchen sink at Obama , the Clinton campaign simply confirmed the fact that they might be going down the drain .
Hillary and her aides urged reporters to learn from the “ Saturday Night Live ” skit about journalists having crushes on Obama .
“ Maybe we should ask Barack if he ’s comfortable and needs another pillow , ” she said tartly in the debate here Tuesday night .
She peevishly and pointlessly complained about getting the first question too often , implying that the moderators of MSNBC  a channel her campaign has complained has been sexist  are giving Obama an easy ride .
Beating on the press is the lamest thing you can do .
It is only because of the utter open - mindedness of the press that Hillary can lose 11 contests in a row and still be treated as a contender .
Hillary and her top aides could not say categorically that her campaign had not been the source on the Drudge Report , as Matt Drudge claimed , for a picture of Obama in African native garb that the mean - spirited hope will conjure up a Muslim Manchurian candidate vibe .
As the U.S. death toll neared 4,000 in Iraq  four more killed this weekend  President Bush gave the country another pep talk this week on staying the course , while continuing to argue that history will wash the blood off his hands .
Nothing has changed in his claim that when humans , or God , look back at this episode , it will seem like only a " comma . "
Back in September 2006 , I was first to trace the derivation of this " comma " reference ( and a chapter about it appears in my new book on Iraq and the media ) .
CNN had aired an interview with President Bush conducted by Wolf Blitzer , who asked about the latest setbacks in Iraq and indications that civil war may be at hand .
Bush , with a slight smile , replied , " Yes , you see  you see it on TV , and that ’s the power of an enemy that is willing to kill innocent people .
But there ’s also an unbelievable will and resiliency by the Iraqi people .
I like to tell people when the final history is written on Iraq , it will look like just a comma because there is  my point is , there ’s a strong will for democracy . "
Even for Bushisms , this was an odd one .
Maybe he meant " coma . "
No , that would be too negative .
A comma as a metaphor perhaps ?
If so , for what ?
All that bloodshed as merely a comma  a pause in a long sentence  leading to a hopeful phrase or conclusion ?
Comma , " and they all lived happily ever after " ?
Or maybe , comma , " and then we bombed Iran " ?
Of course , one can think of other punctuation that might be apt , including " ? " for the 150,000 Americans still deployed there , " ! " for the cries of the gravely injured , and " $ " for Halliburton and other contractors .
Or perhaps , as in the comics pages , when an angry character really wants to curse : " !@# %^&*( ) # *"
Like many others , I was initially confused  though appalled  when President Bush stated that the Iraq war will be viewed as " just a comma . "
Perhaps he meant to say " asterisk " but did not know how to pronounce it .
Or maybe he meant " blip " or " footnote "  though that would n’t make the sentiment any less revolting , especially for the thousands of dead .
That sent me Googling in search of an answer , which I soon found .
This is it :
He did n’t quite finish his thought , and meant to state that the Iraq war will be viewed as " just a comma , not a period . "
Not surprisingly , this is rooted in current Christian teaching , often in reference to Jesus ’s death , or more generally as " Do n ’t put a period where God puts a comma . "
Where does this come from ?
Not directly from the Scripture , apparently .
A quote by comedienne Gracie Allen is cited on many religious Web sites : " Never place a period where God has placed a comma . "
United Church of Christ parishes in Massachusetts were recently urged to put that quote on banners during Lent and color in the words as the weeks went by .
Of course , many of us of a certain age remember Gracie Allen , the actual and TV wife of the legendary George Burns .
Memo to the president :
She was the batty one who often talked nonsense .
Or as a minister at a United Church of Christ in Los Angeles recently put it , admiringly : " She would have said whatever came to her mind in a full voice , and lived out its conviction . "
Sound familiar ?
An article in the St. Petersburg Times in November 2005 , described a new TV commercial by the UCC  not a conservative , but a progressive church  which featured a large comma .
" Weighing in on the commercial , " the article concluded , " evangelist Pat Robertson is said to have remarked , ‘ Never place a comma where God has placed a period .
God has spoken ! ’ "
And so has the president .
Did he fail to finish his thought  linking the comma to the period  for fear of invoking his Christianity in discussing a murderous war ?
Or did he want to avoid being linked to Gracie Allen ?
In any case , the death toll represented by this little old " comma , " now stands at almost 4,000 .
Period .
Today , the United States Department of Agriculture spends $ 8.3 billion a year to provide free and reduced - priced lunches for 30.6 million children whose families are at or below 130 percent of the national poverty level , about $ 26,845 for a family of four .
The program also provides reduced - priced meals for students who are between 130 percent and 185 percent of the poverty level , or $ 38,203 for a family of four .
Some schools use money raised from à la carte foods to support their subsidized lunch program , often adding choices to the federally financed menu .
A Government Accountability
Office report found that 90 percent of public schools in 2004 sold à la carte foods .
While many have quit selling sodas and sweets , the separate lines remain .
“ Anywhere you sell à la carte foods , that automatically means kids who ca n’t afford to purchase them are being identified , ” said Kate Adamick , a lawyer , chef and food systems consultant based in New York .
Most elementary - school children like free lunches , school officials say , but by the time they enter middle school , social status intervenes .
And at lunchtime , as students choose with whom to associate , many students from poor families either pay cash or go hungry if they do not bring lunches from home .
“ I know kids need to eat but they do n’t want to be identified with free food , ” said Kenneth Block , a track coach and security guard who oversees the lunch shift at Balboa High .
Attention to the matter in San Francisco came almost by chance .
Last year , Dr. Rajiv Bhatia , director of occupational and environmental health for the San Francisco Department of Public Health , was campaigning to improve the nutritional value of food in schools when he encountered the two - tier system .
Dr. Bhatia grew up in Oklahoma City , where he said he experienced and observed discrimination in the public schools , including students hurling insults at his Indian heritage .
He said he was shocked to find that students in San Francisco were facing similar challenges in the lunch line .

Intel could face a large fine
Chuck Mulloy , a spokesman for Intel , said the regulators raided the company 's office in Munich , Germany .
Mr Mulloy said Intel was co-operating with the investigators .
Intel has been accused of trying to abuse its dominant market position by selling its products below cost price and making cash payments to customers .
Unannounced inspections
" I can confirm that there has been a raid on our offices in Munich , " Mr Mulloy said .
We are fully cooperating with the inspection
PC World owner DSG
" As is our normal practice , we are co-operating with authorities , " he added .
The European Commission has yet to name Intel , but confirmed that officials had carried out " unannounced inspections " at the premises of a chipmaker .
Commission spokesman Jonathan
Todd said it had reason to believe the firm in question had violated European laws on restrictive business practices .
A number of Intel 's main suppliers have also had their offices visited by inspectors .
UK retailer DSG International , which owns PC World and Currys , said Commission officials had visited its offices in Hertfordshire .
" We are fully cooperating with the inspection , " said a DSG spokesman .
Rival complaint
The investigation started after a complaint from Intel 's smaller rival AMD .
The initial findings of a probe by the Commission unveiled last summer concluded that the chip firm engaged in anti-competitive action to thwart AMD .
It accused the world 's largest chipmaker of giving rebates to customers provided they bought Intel products and offering incentives to companies to delay or cancel products containing AMD technology .
Intel faces a closed hearing in Brussels on 11 and 12 March on the charges .
European regulators have the power to fine Intel up to 10 % of annual turnover if they find it guilty of stifling competition .
Intel has said it is " confident " it had acted lawfully .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Barring some unexpected boardroom generosity by JPMorgan Chase & Co , executives at Bear Stearns Cos may find that their walking away money has been crunched by the credit crisis .

Cayne in a file photo .
Barring some unexpected boardroom generosity by JPMorgan Chase , executives at Bear Stearns may find that their walking away money has been crunched by the credit crisis .
Back in November , when Bear 's shares traded at around $ 153 , the market value of unvested equity awarded to Cayne was $ 47.5 million REUTERS / Chip East
Bear stock soared to a record high of $ 172.61 in January last year as Wall Street ’s mortgage and buyout booms peaked , but those shares have plunged as the bank played a leading role in fueling a subprime mortgage crisis that continues to inflict damage on financial markets .
Bear Stearns ’ shares , which sank to $ 30.85 Friday on worries the bank was quickly running out of cash and needed a Federal Reserve bailout , now fetch just $ 2 each under JPMorgan ’s bailout late on Sunday .
The plunging shares , plus a lack of the normal payout expected when a company is taken over , known as ‘ golden parachutes ’ , delivers a serious blow to the bankers , traders and other executives worldwide at a firm that has long encouraged its above - average levels of inside ownership .
“ The current stock ownership by executive officers reflects a significant personal investment in the company by those who are most responsible for the company ’s future success , ” the bank said in a proxy statement .
Employees own around 30 percent of the bank .
Yet loyalty to the firm has cost employees as Bear ’s fortunes turned south .
According to Bear ’s recent proxy statement , the executive committee members at the fifth - largest U.S. investment bank owned about 9 percent of the firm ’s outstanding stock at the end of January .
Based on shares outstanding in January , shares held by the top handful of executive officers plunged in value from about $ 1.8 billion 14 months ago to just $ 22 million today .
Bear Stearns officials were not immediately available for comment on compensation related to the JPMorgan takeover .
NO PARACHUTES
The proxy also revealed that Bear does not offer golden parachutes for executive officers in the event of it being taken over .
Bear offers a Capital Accumulation Plan and a Stock Award Plan , yet both possess a “ double - trigger provision , ” which means awards and all benefits are not accelerated unless the participant is fired without cause by the new company or resigns for a good reason .
These plans also suffered from Bear ’s plunging market value .
Back in November , when Bear ’s shares traded at around $ 153 , the market value of unvested equity awarded to Chairman James “ Jimmy ” Cayne was $ 47.5 million , while shares awarded to CEO Alan Schwartz were valued at $ 44.9 million , the proxy said .
Schwartz replaced Cayne as CEO in January as shareholders , upset by Cayne ’s hands - off approach during a serious financial crisis , pushed the long - time chief to step aside .
That said , JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh late Sunday said taking over Bear would generate about $ 6 billion in merger - related costs .
JPMorgan has not broken down those figures , but much of that will be earmarked for severance pay and potential exit packages for top executives like Schwartz .
A person familiar with the transaction told Reuters that roughly $ 1 billion of those costs would be earmarked for severance and retention .

While the Canadian Government takes great care to ensure its own safety against the dangers of asbestos , you ’ll probably never hear them make too big a fuss about it –what with Canada being a leading exporter of the patient killer –it just would n’t any sense , economically , to draw attention to it .
So instead they ’re using tax - payers dollars and their own embassies to actively promote the sale and distribution of asbestos to countries like India and Pakistan .
On top of that , the government is actively trying to sabotage the U.N. Rotterdam Convention , which aims to protect life and the environment by controlling the hazardous chemical and pesticide trade industry .
To mark World Health Day , April 7 , 2008 , a handful of organizations from India wrote a letter ( pdf ) asking Canadians to help stop the government from exporting asbestos to India and the global south .
The letter reads ,
We urgently request your solidarity with workers in India and the Global South .
We appeal to you to please ask your government to stop exporting asbestos .
95 % of Canada ’s asbestos is exported to India and other countries where it is handled by desperately poor workers under dangerous conditions and is creating a public health tragedy of disease and death .
Over 100,000 workers are exposed to asbestos daily in India and are falling sick and dying from Canadian Chrysotile asbestos .
And it is not just the workers who suffer ; their families bear the burden of the disease too by losing their sole bread winner and are left destitute .
We appeal to you to listen to our plea and support the health and lives of workers in India and the Global South .
We have few protections and we need your help .
On 5th February 2008 , all the major trade unions of India and labour support groups including the All India Trade Union Congress , Centre for Indian Trade Union , New Trade Union Initiative representing workers in India called for a ban on asbestos .
Please listen to the voices of workers in India .
The government of South Africa , which was a major supplier of chrysotile asbestos , [ has ] banned it .
If the government of South Africa can put the lives of people ahead of the interests of the asbestos industry , why can not the Canadian government do the same ?
Perhaps it ’s because Canadians think there is n’t any real danger with asbestos — a bizarre insight that Daily Show ‘ reporter ’ Aasif Mandvi encountered , when we interviewed Bernard Coulombe , president of Jeffrey Mine Inc . .
Coulombe told Aasif that Indians could handle the toxic pollution because of their “ natural antibodies . ”
On the subject of asbestos , there ’s another issue you should be aware about :
That being the presence of asbestos in government - funded houses on reserves across Canada .
It was a “ hot issue ” a good four years ago , thanks to the tireless efforts of Raven Thundersky , who grew up in one of those government “ free ” houses .
Thundersky has lost a total of SIX family members to asbestos - related diseases , both her parents and four sisters .
She rightfully tried to sue the US company that made the insulation , W.R. Grace company .
But she failed time and again , because Canadian government stopped her .
In 2008 , W.R. Grace had a total of 112,000 lawsuits layed against them , on behalf of American citizens who were negatively impacted by their own exposure to asbestos .
To avoid a ruling , W.R. Grace ultimately agreed to a settlement , a a $ 2.9 billion settlement for the 112,000 victims .
If Canada had n’t interfered , Thundersky probably would ’ve been among them ; but she was n’t .
If she had her way , Raven would take her case to the Hauge , where Canada could be embarrassed “ in front of the whole world . ”
WASHINGTON  Although NASA is concerned about last weekend ’s rough , off - target landing of a Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying three astronauts , an agency official expressed confidence on Tuesday that the Russians would solve the problem .
The Soyuz capsule , carrying a crew home from the International Space Station , made a steeper - than - normal re-entry early Saturday and landed in Kazakhstan about 260 miles short of its target .
Russian and American officials said the astronauts  Dr. Peggy A. Whitson of NASA ; the Russian capsule commander , Col. Yuri I. Malenchenko ; and a South Korean bioengineer , Yi So - yeon  had been exposed to twice the normal stresses of gravity , but were not harmed .
They remain in Russia for normal postflight debriefings and examinations .
William Gerstenmaier , NASA ’s associate administrator for space operations , told reporters Tuesday that the incident was “ clearly a concern ” to the agency but that it was too early to judge the impact on future space flights .
Airline passengers are to be screened with facial recognition technology rather than checks by passport officers , in an attempt to improve security and ease congestion , the Guardian can reveal .
From summer , unmanned clearance gates will be phased in to scan passengers ' faces and match the image to the record on the computer chip in their biometric passports .
Border security officials believe the machines can do a better job than humans of screening passports and preventing identity fraud .
The pilot project will be open to UK and EU citizens holding new biometric passports .
But there is concern that passengers will react badly to being rejected by an automated gate .
To ensure no one on a police watch list is incorrectly let through , the technology will err on the side of caution and is likely to generate a small number of " false negatives " - innocent passengers rejected because the machines cannot match their appearance to the records .
They may be redirected into conventional passport queues , or officers may be authorised to override automatic gates following additional checks .
Ministers are eager to set up trials in time for the summer holiday rush , but have yet to decide how many airports will take part .
If successful , the technology will be extended to all UK airports .
The automated clearance gates introduce the new technology to the UK mass market for the first time and may transform the public 's experience of airports .
Existing biometric , fast - track travel schemes - iris and miSense - operate at several UK airports , but are aimed at business travellers who enroll in advance .
The rejection rate in trials of iris recognition , by means of the unique images of each traveller 's eye , is 3 % to 5 % , although some were passengers who were not enrolled but jumped into the queue .
The trials emerged at a conference in London this week of the international biometrics industry , top civil servants in border control , and police technology experts .
Gary Murphy , head of operational design and development for the UK Border Agency , told one session : " We think a machine can do a better job [ than manned passport inspections ] .
What will the public reaction be ?
Will they use it ?
We need to test and see how people react and how they deal with rejection .
We hope to get the trial up and running by the summer .
Some conference participants feared passengers would only be fast - tracked to the next bottleneck in overcrowded airports .
Automated gates are intended to help the government 's progress to establishing a comprehensive advance passenger information ( API ) security system that will eventually enable flight details and identities of all passengers to be checked against a security watch list .
Phil Booth of the No2 Id Campaign said : " Someone is extremely optimistic .
The technology is just not there .
The last time I spoke to anyone in the facial recognition field they said the best systems were only operating at about a 40 % success rate in a real time situation .
I am flabbergasted they consider doing this at a time when there are so many measures making it difficult for passengers . "
Gus Hosein , a specialist at the London School of Economics in the interplay between technology and society , said : " It 's a laughable technology .
US police at the SuperBowl had to turn it off within three days because it was throwing up so many false positives .
The computer could n't even recognise gender .
It 's not that it could wrongly match someone as a terrorist , but that it wo n't match them with their image .
A human can make assumptions , a computer can't . "
Project Semaphore , the first stage in the government 's e-borders programme , monitors 30 m passenger movements a year through the UK .
By December 2009 , API will track 60 % of all passengers and crew movements .
The Home Office aim is that by December 2010 the system will be monitoring 95 % .
Total coverage is not expected to be achieved until 2014 after similar checks have been introduced for travel on " small yachts and private flights " .
So far around 8 m to 10 m UK biometric passports , containing a computer chip holding the carrier 's facial details , have been issued since they were introduced in 2006 .
The last non-biometric passports will cease to be valid after 2016 .
Home Office minister Liam Byrne said : " Britain 's border security is now among the toughest in the world and tougher checks do take time , but we do n't want long waits .
So the UK Border Agency will soon be testing new automatic gates for British and European Economic Area [ EEA ] citizens .
We will test them this year and if they work put them at all key ports [ and airports ] . "
The EEA includes all EU states as well as Norway , Switzerland and Iceland .
Prosthetic Delta [ Image : 3d - printing new deltas into existence , courtesy of New Scientist ] .
If we could divert certain segments of the Lower Mississippi River into subsidiary canals , we'd " create up to 1000 square kilometres of new wetlands between New Orleans , Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico , forming a vital storm surge buffer against hurricanes , "
It 's prosthetic deltas as the future of landscape design :
The proposed diversion would cut breaches into a levee some 150 km south of New Orleans , Louisiana , and 30 km above where the river empties into the Gulf of Mexico .
With the diversions in place , flooding would cause the river to empty into shallow saltwater bays on either side of the river , releasing sediment - rich water to produce new deltas .
As land bank , will help protect New Orleans and its surrounding parishes from future hurricane damage .
[ Image : Courtesy of the Center for Land Use Interpretation ] .
But I 'm left wondering if this might not also imply some new form of 3D printing , using river sediments as ink and machine - controlled deltas as printheads : you open certain valves , gates , and locks according to predetermined schedules , in some massive inhabitable printhead complex run by the local flood control board , and you can print deltaic land into existence , at will , moving peninsulas here and there , forming islands , atolls , archipelagos , all through the directed sediments of the Mississippi River ...
It 'd be a kind of horizontal spray - gun , bringing terra nova into existence .
For what it 's worth , meanwhile , my wife and I have co-authored a chapter in a forthcoming book called outlandish .
Finally , do n't miss the show up now at the Center for Land Use Interpretation , The end of the Mississippi River Delta – the Birdfoot – is a national landscape of disintegration , a fractal labyrinth of dendritic channels , a blend of water and earth , bisected and rerouted by linear , engineered forms of pipeline canals and levees .
The people who live and work here , beyond the reach of roads , do so tenuously , in a delicate , disappearing place that is battered by hurricanes , and eroding into the sea .
The closing date for the exhibition is not available .
If we could divert certain segments of the Lower Mississippi River into subsidiary canals , we'd " create up to 1000 square kilometres of new wetlands between New Orleans , Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico , forming a vital storm surge buffer against hurricanes , " New Scientist reports .

As Robert Twilley of Louisiana State University phrases it : " You keep the sediment within the coastal boundary current that keeps it running along the shoreline , whereas now it gets ejected into the Gulf . "
This thus constructs " new delta land " instead of uselessly shooting all that sediment over the continental shelf – and that newly aggregated land , like a literal , will help protect New Orleans and its surrounding parishes from future hurricane damage .
But I 'm left wondering if this might not also imply some new form of 3D printing , using river sediments as ink and machine - controlled deltas as printheads : you open certain valves , gates , and locks according to predetermined schedules , in some massive inhabitable printhead complex run by the local flood control board , and you can , at will , moving peninsulas here and there , forming islands , atolls , archipelagos , all through the directed sediments of the Mississippi River ...
It 'd be a kind of horizontal spray - gun , bringinginto existence .
For what it 's worth , meanwhile , my wife and I have co-authored a chapter in a forthcoming book called What Is A City ? , published by the University of Georgia Press , in which we talk at great length about these sorts of post - Katrina hydrological projects – including the use of genetically - modified marshgrasses to anchor artificially dredged fill , in a more or less complete deterrestrialization of the earth 's surface .
Or , to use a bad pun , you could say that these projects are literally Finally , do n't miss the show up now at the Center for Land Use Interpretation , Birdfoot : Where America 's River Dissolves Into The Sea

26 - Year - Secret Bob Simon reports on two lawyers who , bound by the client - attorney privilege , kept the secret that their client had committed a murder while an innocent man went to jail for the crime .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) -
When dancers at San Francisco ’s Lusty Lady turned the exotic club into an egalitarian co-op , they found it tough to reconcile their lofty ideals with the aesthetic realities of the sex trade .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
One of the first things the dancers did was to toss out rules about maintaining the same body type as the day they were hired , and ones regarding height - weight proportion .
A list of acceptable hair colors was scrapped , along with a policy regulating the quantity and location of tattoos .
Now , larger dancers and those who might not be stereotypically “ pretty ” are welcome on the Lusty stage , but this emphasis on inclusion has brought difficulties for the 60 or so dancer - owners .
The performers -- many of whom take on stage names -- run from tall to short , and thick to thin .
Lilah Mayhem is pale with long dark hair and a thin frame , while Cinnamon Rose has shorter , red - streaked hair and a darker complexion .
Wendy works the stage in striped pink knee socks and glasses , while another dancer wears old wedge sandals and a cheerfully curling brown wig .
Many sport multiple piercings and tattoos .
After buying the club for $ 400,000 in 2003 , the next step was to put themselves through guerilla business school .
The Lusties , as they call themselves , enlisted the help of other local co-ops such as Rainbow Grocery and Good Vibrations , a local female - run sex - toy shop .
They learned the ins and outs of running a collective business and hammered out articles of incorporation within days .
Seven committees were created to oversee mundane but necessary business items such as insurance and licensing , finance , incorporation , bylaws and media relations .
All new proposals , from bylaw modifications down to buying new carpets , would need approval from general co-op membership and the board of directors .
Every worker , whether support staff or performer , had the right to submit a proposal , and decisions would be made by majority vote via paper ballot .
But the theater ’s mission statement , which seeks to break down hierarchy , made the creation and enforcement of managerial policies difficult .
“ It ’s hard , because we ’d elect people to enforce our performance standards , but we had n’t yet decided on what those are , ” said former dancer Lili Marlene , who was involved in the transition .
“ Hygiene rules are easier . ”
Dancers learned how to take disciplinary action against each other via new policies such as peer - based performance reviews .
Each week performers evaluate their onstage colleagues , considering general appearances , customer interaction , and levels of eye contact .
The first years of self - governance were the most difficult .
“ On a good day , it ’s like Peter Pan , ” said Lili Marlene .
“ On a bad day , it was like Lord of the Flies .
We can do whatever we want , and there ’s nobody to tell us what to do . ”
IN the 1890s , a New York surgeon named William Coley tested a radical cancer treatment .
He took a hypodermic needle teeming with bacteria and plunged it into the flesh of patients .
After suffering through weeks of chills and fevers , many showed significant regression of their tumors , but even Coley himself could not explain the phenomenon .
His experiments were sparked by the observation that certain cancer patients improved after contracting infections .
One patient experienced regression in a tumor in her arm after developing Saint Anthony ’s fire , a streptococcus skin infection .
Doctors at the time considered Coley ’s bacterial mixtures to be more black magic than medicine , and with the advent of radiation therapy , the well - meaning doctor was soon consigned to the annals of quackery .
But today , some scientists think Coley had it right : Germs can teach our bodies how to fight back against tumors .
Dr. John Timmerman , a cancer immunotherapy expert at UCLA ’s Jonsson Cancer Center , says this revolution has produced “ the most exciting sets of compounds in cancer immunology . ”
These scientists have not yet proved their case .
But new studies are revealing that certain cancers may be reduced by exposure to disease - causing bacteria and viruses , and pharmaceutical companies are testing anticancer treatments that capitalize on the concept by using bacterial elements to boost the body ’s natural immunity .
The studies also imply that our cleaner , infection - free lifestyles may be contributing to the rise in certain cancers over the last 50 years , scientists say , because they make the immune system weaker or less mature .
Germs cause disease but may also fortify the body , a notion summed up in a 2006 report by a team of Canadian researchers as “ whatever does not kill me makes me stronger . ”
Almost a century after Coley , in the 1980s , dermatologists began noticing that patients with severe acne , which is caused by another type of bacterium , have reduced rates of skin cancer , lymphoma and leukemia .
According to a paper by Dr. Mohammad Namazi at the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Iran , studies showed that these bacteria , when injected into animals , appear to stimulate the immune system and shrink tumors .
More recent evidence for this phenomenon comes from studies on cotton and livestock workers , who are constantly breathing endotoxins , a component of bacterial cell walls that causes swelling of lung tissue .
In reports published in the last two years , Harvey Checkoway , a University of Washington epidemiologist , has found that female cotton workers in Shanghai have a 40 % to 60 % lower risk of lung , breast , and pancreas cancer than other factory workers .
Other recent studies by Giuseppe Mastrangelo at the University of Padua in Italy found that dairy farmers exposed to high levels of manure dust are up to five times less likely to develop lung cancer than their colleagues who work in open fields .
For the dairy farmers and cotton workers , “ it ’s good news and bad news , ” Checkoway says .
They have lower rates of cancer but tend to have higher rates of other respiratory problems .
Sniffing cotton dust or inducing pimples is never going to be a therapy , he says , but studying the body ’s reactions to bacteria could explain why cancer rates go down upon endotoxin exposure .
And that might help in developing anticancer drugs .
Dr. Arthur Krieg , chief scientific officer of the Boston - based Coley Pharmaceutical Group , thinks the success of Coley ’s toxins comes largely from a difference between DNA of humans and bacteria and viruses .
In 1995 , Krieg was at the University of Iowa working with strands of DNA created in the lab , hoping to find a way to turn off genes involved in the autoimmune disease lupus .
To his surprise , this DNA stimulated the immune cells he was studying in lab dishes .
“ I got interested , and I got puzzled , ” he says .
His synthetic DNA contained several regions called CpGs .
In humans , that region has a kind of chemical “ cap ” on it , but bacteria -- and Krieg ’s synthetic DNA -- lack that cap .
Thus , in effect , exposure to that CpG makes the body “ think ” it ’s being assaulted by pathogens , and triggers the immune system to shift into attack mode -- and , in doing so , more effectively battle cancer cells .
Krieg saw medical potential : Maybe one could design small drugs with CpGs in them and use them as immunity boosters .
After patenting the method , he left his university job and founded Coley Pharmaceutical Group , which was acquired by the New York - based drug company Pfizer in January .
Five years after his discovery , Krieg ’s first compound has proved safe in early trials but has not yet been proved effective .
Last year , the injected compound failed to increase survival time in a trial of 1,600 lung cancer patients also undergoing chemotherapy .
But Krieg thinks it will prove effective in other patients : “ It ’s just a matter of finding the right way to use it , ” he says .
Timmerman is a strong believer in CpGs , and has been using them with the antibody drug Rituximab in his lab research on mice .
Finding the right drug combination is key , he says : “ It ’s very naive to think that a single off - the - shelf immune stimulant is going to magically treat cancer . ”
Krieg ’s CpG - based chemicals have proved useful in another arena .
Because CpGs boost the immune system , they also can enhance certain vaccines .
In a trial sponsored by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , one of Krieg ’s chemicals , VaxImmune , accelerated the body ’s response to anthrax vaccine by a factor of two -- from 40 days to 20 .
Other collaborations are exploring using CpG - containing DNA to develop hepatitis B vaccines and anti-asthmatic drugs .
( The company has many CpG compounds , four in clinical trials . )
But Don MacAdam , chief executive of MBVax Bioscience in Ancaster , Canada , is not sure that the healing properties of Coley ’s fluids are due to a short strand of DNA .
“ The immune system is very complicated , ” he says , “ Any of these therapies that are doing one little thing are very likely to fail . ”
And so MacAdam wants to revive the formulation that Coley himself found most effective -- a mixture of two kinds of bacteria , Streptococcus and Serratia .
Such an extract would contain naturally occurring CpGs , endotoxins and other bacterial components that may have therapeutic potential .
MacAdam has solved Coley ’s major difficulty : maintaining consistency of the brew from batch to batch .
His preparation has been tested on terminal cancer patients outside the U.S. and Canada , and he contends that 24 in 38 patients have shown signs of tumor regression , although nothing is published yet .
Dr. Vikas Sukhatme , a professor at Harvard Medical School , says he hopes to run clinical trials once the product has been manufactured according to Food and Drug Administration guidelines .
Other groups have been experimenting with injections of other types of heat - killed bacteria , including Myobacterium vaccae , a tuberculosis relative .
In two studies in January ’s European Journal of Cancer , researchers report that these bacteria may help fight certain lung and renal cancers .
The first study is a reanalysis of a trial with 162 patients who received heat - killed bacteria ( and chemotherapy ) .
In the original study , the treatment did n’t seem to improve survival and in 2004 , the company developing the therapy , London - based Silence Therapeutics , gave up on Mycobacterium .
But John Stanford , a shareholder in the company and a researcher at University College London , says these studies were poorly designed and analyzed .
When he and collaborators re-analyzed the results , they found that Mycobacterium injections could increase survival of adenocarcinoma patients by four months .
Stanford believes that part of the bacterial cell wall switches the body from producing ineffective antibodies to sending out cancer - killing blood cells .
In the second study , researchers reported that 60 renal cancer patients injected with Myobacterium survived just as long as those treated with standard chemotherapy .
Stanford has formed a company , Immodulon Therapeutics , and wants to run trials with a stricter and more intense injection regime , to repeat the results and , hopefully , extend patients ’ lives longer .
Although both Krieg and Timmerman are inspired by Coley ’s work , they question the philosophy behind reviving Coley ’s preparation and using other bacterial extracts .
But , Krieg says , “ as a physician you have to maintain a sense of humility and avoid being overly skeptical . ”

Supporters of the detained Saudi Arabian blogger Fouad al - Farhan are marking the start of his third month in jail by quoting him in their own blogs .
Campaigners are posting messages of support on Fouad 's blog
They are determined to keep the 32 - year old , who is affectionately nicknamed the " dean " of Saudi bloggers , in the public eye .
Fouad al - Farhan was prepared to criticise aspects of life in Saudi Arabia he did not like and - unusually - wrote his Arabic blog ( http://www.alfarhan.org/ ) under his real name .
He was arrested in Jeddah on 10 December 2007 .
" It 's still not clear why they have detained him , " another Saudi blogger , Ahmed al - Omran , told the BBC News website .
" The Ministry of the Interior is refusing to provide any details about any charges against him " .
Ahmed , like Fouad , writes his Saudi Jeans blog under his own name .
He is a student in Riyadh and writes in both Arabic and English .
" The Ministry of the Interior is refusing to provide any details about any charges against him . "
Political prisoners
Anyone posting a blog which is critical of life in Saudi Arabia is running a risk .
The country 's ruling Saud family does not tolerate opposition .
" The content and even the tone Fouad posted in is not too different from mine , " says Ahmed .
" I guess what did it is a blog he wrote about political prisoners - and the fact he visited them in jail . "
Fouad himself knew officials wanted to question him about his support for Saudi Arabia 's political prisoners .
He wrote to friends saying he did not want to be forgotten in jail .
His arrest a few days later still shocked them .
One , Ahmed Omar , told the BBC News website from his home in Saudi Arabia that Fouad 's detention had prompted him to follow suit and blog under his real name :
Ahmed Omar does not believe in hiding behind names
" I always had a healthy respect for Fouad 's openness and what he wrote about .
" I had thought about using my own name when I started blogging three years ago .
After he was arrested , I felt I had to too .
Ahmed is a 35 - year old engineer from Dhahran who writes his blog Living in KSA in Arabic .
" I am honest in what I write , but at the same time careful , " he says .
" If you really care about your country and believe in what you write , if you really want change , hiding behind names does not support your cause . "
Caution
Ahmed says he feels that going public carries its own protection .
Others in Saudi Arabia are not so confident .
Ftat al - Amal ( The Girl of Hope ) explains in her blog why she does not express herself freely .
" Blogging has almost become our only outlet ... which enables youth to express their opinions , criticisms and dreams , " she said , quoted by the blogging digest Global Voices .
" When this outlet becomes monitored , we put our hands on our hearts .
" When Fouad al - Farhan was arrested , I imagined myself in his place .
Jailing bloggers is n't restricted to Arab countries like Egypt , for instance , which has jailed a sizeable number of them .
" I have political ideas and I wo n't deny that I do n't blog about politics because I do n't want to face Fouad al - Farhan 's destiny . "
Prison visit
So far Fouad , a father - of - two , has been allowed just one family visit .
His father - in - law spent an hour with him at Jeddah 's Dahban Prison on 5 January .
The family reported that he was in good physical shape , but was being kept in solitary confinement .
For now , Ahmed Omar in Dhahran says he wants to make sure that Fouad 's fears of being forgotten in jail are unfounded .
" The plan is that bloggers can help keep Fouad on the radar . "
One hundred and fifty years ago this June , a lanky Illinois lawyer turned politician gave a speech that changed the way Americans talked about the great racial issues of their day .
The lawyer was Abraham Lincoln , and the speech was the famous “ House Divided ” address with which he accepted the Republican Party ’s nomination as a candidate for the U.S. Senate .
Lincoln lost to Stephen Douglas , but the address changed the national conversation on slavery and , two years later , Lincoln was on his way from Springfield to the White House .
America ’s political story is studded with such addresses -- historical signposts that divide that which went before from all that followed on an issue of crucial national importance .
Franklin Roosevelt ’s
“ The only thing we have to fear is fear itself ” speech fundamentally changed Americans ’ expectations of their government in times of social and economic crisis .
John F. Kennedy ’s address on Catholicism and politics to the Greater Houston Ministerial Assn. in 1960 forever altered the way we think about religion and public office .
Sen . Barack Obama , another lanky lawyer from Illinois , planted one of those rhetorical markers in the political landscape Tuesday , when he delivered his “ More Perfect Union ” speech in Philadelphia , near Independence Hall .
The address was meant to dampen the firestorm of criticism that has attached itself to the senator ’s campaign since video clips of race - baiting remarks by his Chicago church ’s former pastor began circulating last week .
Advertisement
But instead of offering a simple exercise in damage control , Obama chose to place his discussion of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright ’s incendiary comments in a wider consideration of race in America -- and the results were , like those Kennedy achieved in Houston , historic .
Just as every seasoned political hand in 1960 knew that , sooner or later , Kennedy would have to tackle the question of his Catholicism head - on , it ’s been clear for some time that Obama would have to speak explicitly to the question of race in this campaign .
Still , polished orator that he may be , no one could have predicted an address of quite this depth and scope .
“ That was the most sophisticated speech on race and politics I ’ve ever heard , ” said CNN ’s Bill Schneider , the only network pundit who actually has taught American political history at elite universities .
It was all the more remarkable because , while Kennedy presided over what may have been the greatest speech - writing team in electoral history , Obama -- like Lincoln -- wrote his address himself , completing the final draft Monday night .

Obama did what he had to do , unequivocally repudiating Wright ’s extreme rhetoric .
But what was truly radical about his analysis was his implicit demand that black and white Americans accept the imperfection of each other ’s views on race .
Embedded in such acceptance is the seed of that “ more perfect union ” toward which this country -- unquestionably great but itself imperfect -- must strive .
It was a concept that Obama subtly invoked near the beginning of the speech by pointing to the fact that although the Constitution “ was stained by the original sin of slavery , ” the “ answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution -- a Constitution that had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law ; a Constitution that promised its people liberty and justice , and a union that could be and should be perfected over time . ”
Theologically , original sin is the source of man ’s fallen nature and the root of his imperfection .
Obama went on to build on that concept , invoking the authority of his own mixed heritage -- son of a black immigrant father and white mother , raised by a loving white grandmother -- and refusing to reject either Wright , a man of good works as well as extreme rhetoric , or his loving grandmother , who was prone to racial stereotypes .
Obama demanded that black anger make an allowance for white anxiety and that white resentment make a place for black grievance .
No candidate for national office has ever spoken so candidly or realistically about race as it is lived as a fact of life in America .
As he put it Tuesday , “ The profound mistake of Rev. Wright ’s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society .
It ’s that he spoke as if our society was static ; as if no progress has been made ; as if this country ... is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past . ”

The Courage Campaign sent out an email on 1-30 - 08 stating that :
“ President Bush 's attempt to give retroactive immunity to telecom companies has stalled in the Senate .
Again .
Late last night , under intense pressure from the grassroots and netroots , Congress extended the so - called " Protect America Act " for 15 more days .
New deadline : February 16 . … ”
We should call Congress immediately to put the pressure on to dump the telecom immunity - granting Act altogether .
But before we do that , we might as well know something about the misnamed Protect America Act .
Because the more we know , the more we will have to say when calling Congress .
ACLU Analysis of the Protect America Act
08/29/2007
“ In effect , the government may now scoop up all communications coming into or out of the United States , as long as it is targeting no one American in particular and the program is “ directed at ” the foreign end of the communication .
Whether the target or not , American phone calls , emails and internet use will be recorded by our government , and without any suspicion of wrongdoing . “
It ’s no accident that the ACLU calls this bill the “ Police America Act ” :
The “ Police America Act " allows the Attorney General ( AG ) to issue program warrants for international calls without court review .
This new program grants the AG — not a court or independent body — the authority to issue year - long program warrants for surveillance of people reasonably believed to be outside of the United States .
The secret intelligence court that has been overseeing such activities for the last thirty years is cut out of the process , leaving the executive branch unchecked … .
The law is silent on how to treat these American phone calls and emails — leaving the administration to decide how to collect , store , datamine and use Americans ’ private communications . ”
Which means that the Attorney General himself may decide what to do with YOUR calls and e-mails .
“ But they have to protect us from terrorism .
And we ’ve got to trust someone ” is a typical American response I have heard .
Fill in the blanks : Create your own rebuttal to this common attitude and please write about it in letters to the editor !
John Adams said it very well :
“ There is danger from all men .
The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with the power to endanger the public liberty " .
The ACLU continues its analysis of the Protect America Act :
“ The “ Police America Act " provides only a phony court review of secret procedures .
The Attorney General is directed to submit to the intelligence court the procedures by which this new program will operate .
However , the report to the court only need detail how the program is directed at people reasonably believed to be overseas — it does not require the AG to explain how it treats Americans ’ calls or emails when they are intercepted .
The court will have no information about how extensive the breach of American privacy is , nor the authority to remedy it . ”
Which , of course , assures utmost secrecy when abusing powers .
“ Go for it ” :
That is the sub - text of this bill and any other secrecy - assuring legislation .
It ’s no accident that secrecy is the cornerstone of abuse , and it ’s also no accident that the Constitution was drafted by our founding fathers to prevent such abuse by means of deliberate transparency .
Here are the details concerning the so - called warrants , called “ basket warrants ” by the ACLU which “ really are n’t warrants at all ” :
Section 105B “ Additional Procedure for Authorizing Certain Acquisitions ” : Subsection ( a ) puts the new carve out into effect as it permits the Attorney General or the DNI to issue year long program orders to obtain “ foreign intelligence information from or with the assistance of a communications service provider ” that “ concern ” a person outside of the U.S .
The requirements are that ( 1 ) there are reasonable procedures in place for determining that the information concerns person outside of the U.S. , ( 2 ) that it is not otherwise defined as electronic surveillance under FISA , ( 3 ) the information is gathered from a communications company , custodian or other person in control of the communication or record , ( 4 ) a significant purpose is gathering foreign intelligence information , and ( 5 ) the minimization procedures under 50 USC 1801 ( h ) apply .
Subsection ( b ) states that these new orders need not even specify the “ facilities , places , premises or property ” at which the information collection will be directed .
This is simply an unconstitutional program warrant that does n’t state with specificity the things to be searched or seized .
Such warrants – whether issued by a court or an executive official , have long been held unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment .
The flaw is exacerbated by the fact that there is no court supervision whatsoever . ”
Of course many Americans understand that wiretapping is of deep concern .
Alas , many Americans also do n’t “ get it ” and are inclined to make statements such as the ones below , which have been said to me more than once or twice :
Just let them wiretap me .
I have done nothing wrong , so I have nothing to hide ” .
“ As long as they keep me safe , I am happy .
Go ahead , listen away ” .
An attitude like that , of course , is exactly what gives permission to the rise of fascism in the USA , and encourages Congresspeople and The Great Dictator to fulfill their lust for power .
And that ’s just why it is important ---- terribly important ---- that we activists rebut those thoughts in peoples ’ heads .
In a statement which I hope readers will quote in letters to the editors all over the country , Al Gore has the response to the common American belief above , in his book The Assault on Reason :
Why should we be alarmed about such eavesdropping ?
Recall that for the last several years of his life , Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was illegally wiretapped ----- one of hundreds of thousands of Americans whose private communications were intercepted by the U.S. Government during this period .
The FBI privately called King “ the most dangerous Negro leader in the country ” and vowed to “ take him off his pedestal ” .
The government even attempted to destroy his marriage and allegedly tried to blackmail him into committing suicide .
This campaign continued until Dr. King ’s murder .
In fact , it was the discovery that the FBI had conducted a long - running and extensive campaign of secret electronic surveillance designed to infiltrate the inner workings of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , and to learn the most intimate details of Dr. King ’s life , that helped persuade Congress to enact new statutory restrictions on wiretapping in the first place .
The result of these and other similar abuses was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which was enacted previously to ensure that foreign intelligence surveillance would be presented to an impartial judge to verify that there is a sufficient cause for the surveillance . ” ( Emphasis added ) .
Though he does n’t come out and mention the “ impeachment ” word , Gore ’s further words in The Assault on Reason add fuel to the fires for impeachment causes :
During the period when this eavesdropping was still secret , the president went out of his way to reassure the American people on more than one occasion that , of course , judicial permission is required for any government spying on American citizens and that , of course , these constitutional safeguards were still in place .
“ The president ’s soothing statements turned out to be knowingly false .
Moreover , as soon as this massive domestic spying program was uncovered by the press , the president not only confirmed that the story was true , but also declared that he had no intention of bringing these wholesale invasions of privacy to an end ” .
It ’s not only American individuals , but probably ( in the long run ) free speech itself , which will be adversely affected by expanded government eavesdropping .
As hard as this may be for some American cross-sectors to believe , we have to learn from history : Wiretapping and surveillance in dictatorships is what , historically , has led to free speech - based arrests and even worse .
The ACLU makes concerned statements for the sake of businesses as well :
How The Protect America Act Will Affect Business ( 8/29/2007 )
www.aclu.org/safefree/general/31502leg20070829.html
" Congress gave the government this eavesdropping authority not to listen to terrorists , but rather to collect “ foreign intelligence , ” which is loosely defined in FISA to mean any information that “ relates to ” the conduct of U.S. foreign affairs .
Make no mistake , this means business .
Any businessperson can easily see the ramifications of such unwarranted surveillance .
How are trade secrets going to be protected ?
Are negotiations regarding government contracts being conducted in good faith , or are they being compromised by intercepted communications ?
How are confidential relationships - employer / employee ; attorney / client ; journalist / source ; doctor / patient ; priest / penitent ; husband / wife - going to be protected ?
How are these captured communications going to be used against Americans and their businesses ?
The answer is nobody knows because it ’s all being conducted behind a massive cloak of secrecy . "

To sound a note of hope , the Courage Campaign writes on 1-30 - 08 :
P.S. Your calls matter and your activism is making a difference .
Just read what Senator Dodd said on the Senate floor :
" For several months now , I 've listened to the building frustration over this ( telecom ) immunity and this administration 's campaign of lawlessness .
I 've seen it in person , in mail , online -- the passion and eloquence of citizens who are just fed up .
They 've inspired me more than they know . "
This should reinforce the reality to us all , that Congresspeople do take note of our concerns .
At least , the good ones do .
With as many of us Americans who feel depressed and disillusioned , believing that our phone calls and letters to Congress will make zero difference , Sen .
Dodd ’s statement should give us renewed encouragement .
As should Barak Obama ’s statement quoted in the Courage Campaign ‘s email :
“ A grassroots movement of Americans has pushed this issue to the forefront .
You have come together across this country .
You have called upon our leaders to adhere to the Constitution .
You have sent a message to the halls of power that the American people will not permit the abuse of power -- and demanded that we reclaim our core values by restoring the rule of law .
It 's time for Washington to hear your voices , and to act . "
And the Courage Campaign adds :
As Senator Obama said above , it 's because of you .
You stopped the Senate , at least temporarily , from giving President Bush and the telecom giants legal cover for spying on Americans .
… From Courage Campaign members flooding Senator Dianne Feinstein 's phone lines to CREDO Mobile supporters filling the email boxes of swing - vote Senators to blogging communities like FireDogLake , Daily Kos and Open Left mobilizing a nation of netroots activists , our growing progressive movement is shifting power to the people .
But our work is not over , not by a longshot .
Without your constant pressure , telecom immunity would now be the law of the land .
Now we have 15 more days to kill it for good . “
Fortunately for us all , the extension of the Protect America Act to February 16th gives us time to hear the voice of Congress via its stalling of the vote for telecom immunity , and to act ourselves :
a ) Call Congress and follow up with a hard - copy letter .
Because , according to the ACLU , while phone calls and emails are good , the most effective form of communication with Congress , by far , is the hand - signed snail mail letter .
b ) Letters to the editor are the most - read pages in the newspaper , according to the ACLU and Moveon.org , and are read by politicians as indicators of popular opinion .
To write a letter can help to influence public opinion and stir proactivity .
Here are tips for writing letters to the editor :
c ) For anybody who is concerned that his / her letter to the editor will not be printed , try house letter - to - the - editor - writing parties .
Because as participants read their letters out loud and get feedback from the group , the result is sure to be a cutting - edge product .
Plus it could be fun , with munchies and dancing , music et al afterward !
d ) Write chain letters by e-mail , asking recipients to send them out to at least ten like - minded individuals , urging them to call Congress and ask them to “ Just Say No ” to renewing the misnamed Protect America Act .
Be sure to include notes of encouragement , such as the ones above or others of your own choosing .
Depression governs our masses and to assure proactivity , encouragement is vital .
e ) Do n’t forget how successful house parties have been .
You can organize a speaker event in your home , provide educational materials obtained from the ACLU ’s and other websites , have group discussions and strategize together about ways to spread word / spawn proactivity .
f ) Here is an article with tips for how to spread word even if we never have access to the Internet .
Included are tips for arranging a speaker meeting , very simple strategies to spread word which every individual can do , etc :
g ) Do n’t forget that Qwest ( Internet and phone service provider ) and Credo ( formerly called Working Assets , a long distance phone , mobile and cell phone company ) have both pledged in writing not to wiretap without court warrant .
It ’s absolutely important to spread word :
To side - step the warrantless wiretapping program is important for reasons above and
beyond protecting our privacy .
Warrantless
Anything , by definition , means undercutting the power of the Judiciary as a fundamental arm of government whose function is to put a “ Check ” on government power ( and the abuse thereof ) .
Thus , by supporting the two telecom companies above , you are :
~ Protecting free speech
~ Supporting the role of the Judiciary
~ Undercutting the ability of the Executive and the FBI / CIA / police to target Americans at random , ie to abuse their power
~ Boycotting the corporations in cohoots with the government ’s plans to topple the Constitution

I suggest that writing about Qwest and Credo in letters to the editor is the best thing to do for the sake of the general public .
However , it might be wise to check with the companies first for permission , to assure that the Feds do n‘t go after them and undermine the cause on some manufactured “ legal ” level , due to the public exposure .

Oh , and one last very important ps .
If Congress passes the Police America Act as the ACLU calls it , then we ’d better start asking ourselves ---- and others , in letters to the editor ---- whether or not Congress is deliberately and calculatedly converting the USA to a dictatorship .
Because power corrupts .
And if so , the best thing for us all to do is to work to unseat about 75 % of this Congress , no matter how daunting a task that might be .
Pruning Sheers and Clean Sweep have a very hot idea :
Set up qualified individuals to campaign for Congressional seats , so as to challenge the targeted seats in Congress .

A giant frog fossil from Madagascar dubbed Beelzebufo or ' the frog from Hell ' has been identified by scientists from University College London and Stony Brook University , New York .
The discovery of the 70 million year - old fossil frog , of a kind once thought unique to South America , lends weight to a new theory that Madagascar , India and South America were linked until late in the Age of Dinosaurs .
The new frog resembles living Horned toads ( ceratophryines or ' pac - man frogs ' ) in having a squat body , huge head and wide mouth .
With a body length ( not counting the legs ) of up to 40 cm -- longer than a rugby ball - and a weight of around four kilos ( 10 pounds ) , it is more than twice the size of its largest living relatives .
The fossil , published in the journal PNAS , enters the Malagasy history books alongside meat - eating dinosaurs , plant - eating crocodiles and giant snakes , all very different from the present day animals of Madagascar .
Professor Susan Evans of the UCL Department of Cell & Developmental Biology says : " This frog , a relative of today 's Horned toads , would have been the size of a slightly squashed beach - ball , with short legs and a big mouth .
If it shared the aggressive temperament and ' sit - and - wait ' ambush tactics of living Horned toads , it would have been a formidable predator on small animals .
Its diet would most likely have consisted of insects and small vertebrates like lizards , but it 's not impossible that Beelzebufo might even have munched on hatchling or juvenile dinosaurs .
" Beelzebufo appears to be a very close relative of a group of South American frogs known as ' ceratophyrines , ' or ' pac - man ' frogs , because of their immense mouths , " said Krause .
The ceratophryines are known to camouflage themselves in their surroundings , then ambush predators .
" The finding presents a real puzzle biogeographically , particularly because of the poor fossil record of frogs on southern continents , " said Stony Brook University paleontologist David Krause , who led the research .
" We 're asking ourselves , ' What 's a ' South American ' frog doing half - way around the world , in Madagascar ? ' "
He said that because frogs " are not adept at dispersal across marine barriers , and since the few fossil frogs that are known from the Late Cretaceous in Africa are unrelated to Beelzebufo , one possibility is that there was a land connection between South America and Madagascar during that period . "
Some geoscientists have suggested a lingering physical link between South America and Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous Period -- a link involving Antarctica .
Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous was much warmer than it is today .
" The occurrence of this frog in Madagascar and its relatives ' existence in South America provides strong evidence that the supercontinent Gondwana ' disassembled ' during the latest part of the Cretaceous , " said Richard Lane , program director in NSF 's Division of Earth Sciences .
" Madagascar has a mainly endemic frog fauna whose history has generated intense debate , fuelled by recent phylogenetic studies and the near absence of a fossil record .
Our discovery of a frog strikingly different from today 's Madagascan frogs , and akin to the Horned toads previously considered endemic to South America , lends weight to the controversial paleobiogeographical model suggesting that Madagascar , the Indian subcontinent and South America were linked well into the Late Cretaceous .
It also suggests that the initial spread of such beasts began earlier than that proposed by recent estimates . "

Fonza Luke had worked as a nurse for Baptist Health System ’s Princeton Medical Center in Birmingham , Alabama , for 26 years when the human resources department summoned her to a meeting about a new “ dispute resolution program . ”
Nurses , housekeepers , and lab techs crammed into a conference room where hospital administrators presented a form and told them to sign .
Signing meant agreeing to submit any future employment - related complaints to an arbitrator hired by the hospital and waiving the right to sue in court .
Refusing to sign meant they ’d be fired .
Luke had known the arbitration agreement was coming , and she did n’t like the idea one bit — ” I just think it ’s unfair to be made to do something like that , ” she says .
So before going to the conference room , she slipped away to a pay phone and called her lawyer .
He said , “ Do n’t sign it .
You ’ll be signing your rights away , ” she recalls .
Luke turned in the form without a signature in quiet protest .
A few weeks later , the hospital again ordered her to sign , and again she refused .
Despite repeated threats , the hospital did n’t fire her , at least not then .
Three years later , Luke traveled to Atlanta for a continuing - education class recommended by her coworkers .
When she returned , the hospital fired her for “ insubordination ” because she had been cleared to take just one day off , not two .
For 30 years , Luke had been an exemplary employee .
Her personnel file was full of praise for her performance ; a review three weeks before the firing called her a “ role model . ”
Many of the younger , white nurses Luke worked with had taken unapproved leave , she observed , and kept their jobs .
So Luke filed a race and age discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( eeoc ) , which conducted a lengthy investigation , upheld her complaint , and recommended that Luke file a civil rights suit in federal court , which she did in 2003 .
That ’s when the surprise came : Baptist Health argued that Luke had given up her right to sue back in 1997 when the hospital presented the arbitration agreement — even though she ’d refused to sign .
Simply by continuing to show up for work , Baptist ’s lawyers said , she ’d agreed to the terms .
Acting contrary to established contract law , which requires both parties to consent to a contract before it becomes binding , a federal judge accepted the hospital ’s argument .
Luke was forced to take her civil rights case before Baptist ’s hired arbitrator , who dismissed it in short order .
She had no right to appeal .
She ’d lost not only her job but , because she had n’t yet reached retirement age , part of the pension she ’d worked toward for most of her adult life .
Now Luke works night shifts at two health care facilities to make up her lost salary .
You Ca n’t Sue Us !
Some of the companies that use arbitration clauses in contracts with employees or customers Hooters • Applebee ’s • kfc • Friendly Ice Cream Corporation • Circuit City • Neiman Marcus • Nordstrom • Hallmark Cards • Merrill Lynch • Citigroup • First usa • Ameriquest • Discover • Blue Cross Blue Shield • Aetna • Kaiser Permanente • AT&T • Ford • Daimler AG • Toyota • Clear Channel • General Electric • Halliburton • Bechtel • Rent -a- Center
Mandatory - arbitration provisions like the one forced upon Luke are not rare .
In fact , agreements not to sue are becoming a ubiquitous facet of commercial life , governing everything from employment to used - car sales .
On job - related matters alone , the National Employment Lawyers Association ( nela ) estimates that 30 million Americans , or roughly a fifth of the nonunion workforce , have been forced to sign away the right to bring civil claims before a judge or jury .
( The practice had a moment in the spotlight recently when a kbr contractor named Jamie Leigh Jones , who said she ’d been raped by coworkers in Iraq , had to take her sexual assault and harassment case to an arbitrator hired by her employer rather than a civil jury after the Justice Department failed to prosecute her alleged attackers . )
The root of the arbitration trend is an obscure 1925 law called the Federal Arbitration Act .
At the time of its passage , lawmakers stipulated that it only applied to “ merchants ” involved in contract disputes .
But in 1984 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Congress had created a “ national policy favoring arbitration , ” thus opening the door to far wider use .
The decision prompted a dramatic increase in mandatory binding arbitration , which proponents claimed would help clear overcrowded judicial dockets and cut back on excessive legal expenses .
Since then , judges have used the Supreme Court ruling to legitimize and further expand the use of mandatory arbitration , even though , as Justice Hugo Black once observed , arbitrators can be “ wholly unqualified ” to oversee complicated cases .
Indeed , private arbitrators are n’t required to follow the law or established precedent , or even issue written decisions .
Many have legal backgrounds , but there is no standard dictating that they be lawyers or credentialed in any way — yet their decisions ca n’t be appealed .
In 1992 , the California Supreme Court ruled that an arbitration decision can stand even if it is legally wrong and causes “ substantial injustice . ”
In 2006 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit declared that courts should n’t review arbitrators ’ decisions even when they are “ wacky . ”
Also in 2006 , the 11th Circuit appellate court went so far as to suggest that people who try to challenge arbitration awards in court ought to be sanctioned .
Says Cliff Palefsky , a San Francisco employment lawyer and cofounder of nela , “ Courts have created the fiction that docket clearing is public policy . ”
Judges have another reason to love arbitration :
The growth of private justice has created for them a new and lucrative job market .
U.S. district court judges earn $ 165,200 a year , less than some second - year law firm associates .
Private arbitrators can make $ 10,000 in a day .
Some judges now even seek coaching on how best to tailor their résumés for future arbitration jobs .
Lucie Barron , the founder of Action Dispute Resolution Services in California , encourages judges to keep lawyers ’ business cards for use in marketing their arbitration services to the legal community later on .
The trend has become so pronounced that in December , a judge in California reportedly refused to accept a move from civil to criminal court because it would impact his ability to get a job as an arbitrator .
National arbitration companies recruit heavily among sitting judges , many of whom have at one time or another been called upon to rule in a challenge to an arbitration clause .
In fact , the California Supreme Court justice who wrote the 1992 opinion allowing unjust arbitration decisions to stand now works as a private arbitrator charging $ 6,500 a day .
With little hope of progress in the courts , consumer advocates and employment lawyers have turned to Congress .
They are banking on a bill introduced last July by Senator Russell Feingold ( D - Wis. ) that would outlaw mandatory - arbitration clauses in consumer and employment contracts .
In December , Fonza Luke flew to Washington to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Having once successfully petitioned the pope to intervene when she thought her daughter had been mistreated in Catholic school , Luke held her own on a witness panel dominated by lawyers and law professors .
“ I did everything I could to keep my right to go to federal court , ” she told the committee , “ but the courthouse doors were closed when I got there . ”
Sitting down the table from Luke was Mark de Bernardo , an attorney representing employers who dubbed Feingold ’s measure a “ mandatory - litigation bill . ”
De Bernardo argued that doing away with forced arbitration would lead more people to choose court hearings and “ impose a death penalty ” on alternative dispute resolution in America .
Yet to Feingold and others , that ’s exactly the point — people should be able to choose .
As F. Paul Bland Jr. , a staff lawyer with Public Justice in Washington , D.C. , put it , “ It is a pretty grim idea that the only way you could have arbitration is to force people into it . ”
Alyssa Musselman was a 7 year old girl with a bubbly personality who enjoyed going to the neighbors to see his horses .
The school principal has described her as a good kid and a great student .
The neighbor describes her as nice and polite .
Alyssa Musselman lived with her parents Frank and Amy Musselman and her little 3 year old brother .
Yesterday about 11:20 am , sheriff ’s deputies were dispatched to the home to investigate a report of a shooting on the request of Frank Musselman .
What they found was little Alyssa Musselman dead of a gunshot wound , Amy Musselman with a gunshot wound to the chest .
The little three year old boy was not physically injured .
Amy Sue Musselman was transported to one hospital then transferred to another hospital where she is reported to be in stable condition .
Reportedly police interviewed her at the hospital and they say this appears to be a murder / suicide attempt with Amy Musselman using a small caliber rifle to shoot her daughter before turning the weapon on herself .
Law enforcement believe the shooting may have happened several hours before the 911 call was made .
The sheriff has said that they do n’t believe there are any outside suspects and that the focus of their investigation now is to find out how and why .

She was 7 years old .
Likely her thoughts and speech were mainly concerned with the immediate events in her life , thoughts of starting back to school , maybe things like what her Halloween costume would be , her Christmas , when would she be able to go pet the horses again .
Probably sprinkled in her conversation would have been phrases like ‘ my friend says ’ and ‘ my teacher says ’ .
Though children are born with their own personalities , it is about this age that they start developing their own individualty and separatness from their family .
Now she is silent .
She was not given a chance to decide what she wanted to be when she grew up , did she want to be a wife and a mother .
Did she want to have a career or a vocation .
Replacing her sweet conversation will be ugly words , like coroner , autopsy , loss , funeral , prosecution , and courts .
Alyssa was supposed to be in school yesterday .
Likely her absence received no special notice as children are absent from school from time to time .
But today that empty chair will be the focus , as her teachers and schoolmates try to absorb what has happened .
Many of those children would have had little experience with death .
Some of those that had some experience probably thought that was what happened to ‘ old ’ people .
At their young age , they ’ve been slapped with a reality that no one ever wanted them to know .
And they are receiving that reality through the loss of one of their own .
I wish I could offer words of comfort to the family .
Yet I know there are no words that can be offered that will bring comfort right now .
They have spent the last 24 hours trying to find the answers to big questions , like what happened , how it happened , what led up to it , and the biggest two - why it happened and why her ?
They will analyse every word and action connected to the family .
They will cling to every scrap of information on what happened , read every report .
But there are some things that just should not have happened and cannot be understood .
As usual , my thoughts are with the littlest .
He is thought to have been in the home at the time of the shooting and to have been there for several hours before they were found .
At 3 he would have been old enough to know that something was wrong , yet too young to know how to reach out to get assistance .
My thoughts and prayers are with the family , even knowing as I do that at times like this they bring little comfort .

Alyssa is remembered as the child with the bright smile and the long brown hair .

A Tax System that Matches Oregon Values
Commentary
This tax season , a minimum wage worker who was employed full - time last year and raising one child will pay about $ 321 in state income taxes .
That ’s equivalent to the cost of about a month ’s worth of food based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data .
For a single parent working at minimum wage $ 321 is a lot of money , especially when you compare it to the income tax bill that Intel Corporation , with $ 9 billion in profits , likely paid last year : 10 bucks .
Why is Intel , with $ 9 billion in profits , probably paying only 10 bucks ?
Because over the last decade the actions of Oregon ’s legislature have not matched the values of Oregonians .
Intel has n’t always paid a pittance in state income taxes .
In 1997 , the company paid over $ 50 million in income taxes to Oregon .
The company boasted at the time that it was the state ’s best corporate income taxpayer .
Today , though , thanks to huge corporate tax breaks handed to it by the Oregon legislature , Intel likely has joined the ranks of the majority of Oregon ’s corporations , who get off paying just 10 bucks a year in income taxes on their profits .
That ’s right , Intel , with $ 9 billion in profits , probably paid about three pennies for every dollar in state income taxes paid by a young working mother trying to raise a child on an annual income of about $ 16,200 .
The story does n’t stop with Intel , either .
Most corporations operating in Oregon pay three cents for every dollar paid in taxes by a minimum wage worker .
Two - thirds of the corporations operating in Oregon , including 20 corporations with profits of $ 1 million or more , get away with paying just 10 bucks a year in state income taxes .
It would take 32 of those corporations to match the income taxes we ask that young mother working at minimum wage to pay .
It ’s time for Oregon legislators to establish a new set of priorities for Oregon , priorities that better match the values of Oregonians .
Oregon legislators wrongly shifted more of the costs of public structures away from big corporations and onto minimum wage workers and the rest of us .
Let ’s build a tax system that better matches Oregon values .
Oregon could eliminate income taxes on the minimum wage working mother by increasing the state Earned Income Credit .
Such an increase would help that mother keep food on her family ’s table , instead of sending a month ’s worth of her family ’s food budget to Salem to help pay for public structures — universities and state police , for instance — that Intel and other corporations operating in this state rely upon every day and get essentially for free .
What would it cost to eliminate the income tax on the minimum wage family ?
A little less than $ 50 million a year , or roughly the amount that Intel proudly paid in state income taxes a decade ago .
Oregonians believe hard - working families deserve food on the table .
Next year , the legislature should better match its actions with Oregon values by increasing the state Earned Income Credit and raising the minimum corporate income tax so that corporations like Intel pay something similar to what they used to pay .
Think about it .
Profitable Intel could once again proudly proclaim itself to be the state ’s best taxpayer , and families struggling to make ends meet by working at a minimum wage job could open their cupboards and find that Salem had decided to leave them a little more to eat .
Michael Leachman is a policy analyst at the Oregon Center for Public Policy , which does in - depth research and analysis on budget , tax , and economic issues with the goal to improve decision making and generate more opportunities for all Oregonians .
The U.S. Department of Defense is like a lot of other big energy consumers : over - budget and under the gun .
Energy prices are so high , the DoD is mulling opening up some U.S. military installations to outside exploration for traditional energy sources like oil and natural gas as way to install even more renewable energy , reports EnergyWashington ( sub reqd . )
At the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee hearings last week , a Pentagon official said the DoD wants to broaden existing law to allow more than just geothermal ...
THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY ….
Over the past few days there ’s been a huge fracas over accusations that Hillary Clinton ’s campaign deliberately darkened Barack Obama ’s face in an ad they ran in Texas .
It started with a post over at Daily Kos on Tuesday and has been spread far and wide since then .
The problem is that it ’s impossible to compare color tones using YouTube clips because their compression process does n’t preserve color fidelity .
However , FactCheck.org got hold of a high - quality recording of the ad as it appeared on station KCEN in Waco , Texas , and then compared it to MSNBC ’s streaming version of the debate from which the clip was taken .
Here it is ( the ad is on the left , the original debate is on the right ) :
In the ad version , Obama ’s face has been desaturated ( i.e. , there ’s less color tone ) but it does n’t look any darker than the original .
Nor has his face been widened to make Obama ’s nose more prominent , as the original posters also suggested .
That was yet another YouTube artifact .
Darkening images is fairly standard practice in attack ads , and FactCheck suggests that the Clinton campaign may have done it here .
But if they did , it ’s pretty damn subtle when you compare the original source material instead of stuff that ’s been sent through the YouTube mill .
Hillary Clinton is running a rough campaign , and I ’m pretty unhappy with some of her tactics , but that ’s no reason to start hauling out all the old Clinton - hating artillery we came to know and love in the 90s .
This ad is n’t evidence of race - baiting or anything else .
Time to move on .
UPDATE : Spencer Ackerman points out that Factcheck does , in fact , say the images in the ad are darker than the images in the debate footage : “ When we compared the frames in the ad to frames from the debate video using the ‘ eyedropper ’ tool in Photoshop image - processing software , we found that the frames in the Clinton ad are uniformly darker . ”
I do n’t have the entire video to compare , but I did load the two frames above into Photoshop , and I got exactly the opposite result .
When you look solely at brightness , not hue or saturation , the two images are mostly identical .
Where they are n’t , the frame from the ad is a little bit brighter , not darker .
I just do n’t see any evidence of darkening at all .
Let ’s not go down the rabbit hole of 90s - era Clinton hatred , where any accusation that gets tossed out is presumed true unless it ’s conclusively proven otherwise .
That ai n’t right .
If someone has credible evidence of dirty tricks , based on high quality recordings of both videos , that ’s one thing .
But until then , there ’s just nothing here .
Here 's the X - Finger in action , an amazing artificial finger that can replace a real finger without any kind of electronics .
As the video shows , it allows amputees to recover their full grip to do anything they want , from typing on a keyboard to playing golf and — my favorite part , this — using a cocktail shaker .
The device 's mechanism is quite simple and ingenious .
To start with , it does n't require any batteries , as it uses the force of the body 's own muscles .
They are activated " by moving the residual finger when available , or the opposing finger when needed . "

Thanks to its artificial tensors and the articulation 's design , moving the residual fingers triggers a natural motion on its artificial phalanges , making it look as you are flexing a real finger .
This means that the X - Fingers can be controlled independently , giving you a grip that is strong enough to do almost every normal task .
The fingers , which weigh less than 10 grams on their own and about 30 grams when covered with a silicon skin , are custom - made to fit the patient 's anatomical characteristics and can be easily put on or removed .

And of course , they will allow some patients to give people the finger , which along with the cocktail shaking , to me is reason enough to rabidly applaud the invention .

Tackling a dilemma right out of a science fiction novel , the state Senate passed legislation Thursday that would bar employers from requiring workers to have identification devices implanted under their skin .
State Sen. Joe Simitian ( D - Palo Alto ) proposed the measure after at least one company began marketing radio frequency identification devices for use in humans .
The devices , as small as a grain of rice , can be used by employers to identify workers .
A scanner passing over a body part implanted with one can instantly identify the person .
“ RFID is a minor miracle , with all sorts of good uses , ” Simitian said .
“ But we should n’t condone forced ‘ tagging ’ of humans .
It ’s the ultimate invasion of privacy . ”

Simitian said he fears that the devices could be compromised by persons with unauthorized scanners , facilitating identity theft and improper tracking and surveillance .
The bill has been approved by the state Assembly and now goes to the governor .
Nine senators opposed the measure , including Bob Margett ( R - Arcadia ) , who said it is premature to legislate technology that has not yet proved to be a problem .
“ It sounded like it was a solution looking for a problem , ” Margett said .
“ It did n’t seem like it was necessary . ”
One company , VeriChip , has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration to sell implanted identification devices , and about 2,000 people have had them implanted , Simitian said .
A representative of the firm did not return calls seeking comment Thursday .

CityWatcher.com , a Cincinnati video surveillance company , has required employees who work in its secure data center to have a microchip implanted in an arm .
Similar technology has been used for years to help identify lost pets .
Meanwhile , the Assembly approved a bill that would allow Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and other law enforcement officials to put thousands of inmates on detention in their homes , with electronic monitoring equipment attached to their ankles .
Baca sought the legislation to help relieve overcrowding in L.A. County jails and said he would assign about 2,000 inmates with low - level offenses to involuntary home detention if the governor signs the bill .
Currently , inmates must volunteer for home detention .
The Senate has passed the bill ; the governor has not taken a public position .

In other legislative action Thursday :
* The Senate passed SB 655 , previously approved by the Assembly , which allows a $ 1,000 fine for county jail inmates found possessing a cellphone , as well as a $ 250 fine for inmates found with tobacco in county jails where possession is outlawed .
Baca sponsored the measure .
* The Senate gave final approval to SB 924 , which would place a measure on the February ballot asking voters whether they support the immediate and orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq .
The governor has not taken a public position on the bill .
* The Senate gave final approval to SB 33 , which prohibits people younger than 18 from using cellphones or text message devices while driving .
The governor has not taken a public position on the measure .

* The Assembly Appropriations Committee recommended passage of SB 974 , which allows a $ 60 fee on each filled 40 - foot container in the ports of Los Angeles , Long Beach and Oakland to pay for programs to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution caused by port activity .
The committee amended the bill , which now goes to the full Assembly , to allow a local panel of officials to decide how to spend the 50 % of the revenues that would go to traffic congestion relief .
It did not adopt an amendment sought by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa that would have allowed some of the money to be spent on the replacement of two large bridges .

In the Federal Reserve ’s battle to keep the U.S. economy from a severe downturn , the beleaguered dollar is getting walloped anew .
That is going to worsen the sticker shock for Americans headed overseas or buying some of their favorite imported goods .
But it also will underpin the current boom in U.S. exports , which has helped to offset some of the economic pain of the housing bust .
The euro currency jumped to a record high against the dollar Wednesday , reaching $ 1.512 from $ 1.497 on Tuesday .

Six years ago , 1 euro cost less than 87 cents .
The dollar also fell to its lowest level in years against the Australian dollar , the Swiss franc , the Brazilian real , the Russian ruble and a number of other currencies .
The latest plunge in the buck ’s value followed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’s testimony on Capitol Hill , where he described the economy as “ distinctly less favorable ” and all but assured Congress that the central bank would continue to cut short - term interest rates .
To currency traders worldwide , that was a signal to dump the dollar again , deepening what has been a losing trend for the greenback since 2001 .

Generally , the weaker a country ’s economy is and the lower its interest rates , the weaker its currency gets as some global investors opt to take their money elsewhere -- in the process selling one currency to buy another .
Wall Street appears convinced that the Fed will slash its benchmark rate to 2.5 % from 3 % when the central bank ’s policymakers meet March 18 .
By contrast , the European Central Bank has held its key rate at 4 % since June and shows no sign of wanting to join the Fed in easing credit .
Higher European rates support the euro ’s value at the dollar ’s expense .
For the Fed , “ their first concern is to lessen the damage to the U.S. economy , not to strengthen our currency , ” said David Kotok , chairman of investment firm Cumberland Advisors in Vineland , N.J .

Even as the euro surges , some analysts believe it could be nearing a peak .
If the global economy follows the U.S. into a slowdown , Europe ’s central bank and others abroad may be forced to follow the Fed in lowering interest rates this year , said Meg Browne , a currency strategist at banking firm Brown Bros .
Harriman & Co. in New York .
That could hammer their currencies while bolstering the dollar .
The greenback could rebound further if investors believed the U.S. economy would be the first to emerge from a global funk , Browne said .
But in the near term , by letting the dollar sink , the Fed is eroding Americans ’ purchasing power and risking higher inflation .

The falling dollar has been no friend to Lonnie Kane , president of Vernon - based Karen Kane Inc. , which makes higher - end women ’s clothing .
Kane buys much of his fabric from designers in Italy and France , and the rising euro has made those fabrics much more expensive -- while his American customers such as Bloomingdale ’s and Nordstrom are n’t willing to accept price hikes .
“ Europe is raising prices based on the dollar , and we either have to absorb the price increase or get the hell beat out of us for trying to pass them along , ” Kane said .
“ At some point we see no choice but that apparel prices are going to have to rise . ”
Still , American consumers have been largely spared dramatic increases in import prices despite the dollar ’s slide over the last six years .

At Fletcher Jones Motorcars in Newport Beach , the biggest Mercedes - Benz dealer in the country , General Manager Garth Blumenthal said Germany - based Mercedes has been holding the line on prices of cars shipped to the U.S. , preferring lower profit to the risk of losing sales to other luxury brands .
Germany is one of 15 European nations that have adopted the euro as their currency .
“ We ’re in an economy that ’s fairly tough , and all the manufacturers are fighting for their share of the market , ” Blumenthal said .
“ They ’re all doing the same thing : pricing very carefully to maintain their market share and not lose out to competitors . ”
Mercedes ’ efforts have made Benzes sold in the U.S. a bargain compared with its cars marketed in some other parts of the world , Blumenthal said .
Lately , the dealership has been fielding calls from auto brokers in Russia , China and other countries who are seeking to profit from the price differential :
They are looking to buy vehicles in the U.S. and ship them back to their home markets .

Of course , even as the shrinking dollar squeezes U.S. importers , it buoys exporters by making their goods less expensive in countries with rising currencies .
U.S. exports surged 12 % to a record $ 1.62 trillion last year , government data show .
At the same time , a slowdown in import demand narrowed the U.S. trade deficit -- the difference between the value of imports and exports -- to $ 712 billion , down 6.2 % from 2006 and the biggest percentage decline since 1991 .
The dollar ’s slide also could bring a new wave of foreign tourists to U.S. shores as their purchasing power grows .
Los Angeles saw a 10 % increase in European arrivals through LAX last year compared with 2006 , which translated into 50,000 additional visitors and $ 38 million to $ 48 million in spending , said Mark Liberman , chief executive of LA Inc. , the city ’s convention and visitors bureau .

“ It ’s great news , absolutely great news for us , ” Liberman said of the dollar ’s renewed slump .
Christine Silvestri , owner of Urban Shopping Adventures , said she saw a 10 % to 15 % increase in international travelers booking her company in 2007 for shopping tours that included Robertson Boulevard , Melrose Avenue and the downtown fashion district .
“ They come to L.A. specifically to shop , ” Silvestri said .
“ They bring lots of money , and they spend from $ 1,000 to several thousand apiece . ”
Longer term , a key risk to the U.S. economy is that foreign investors could tire of seeing their dollar - denominated holdings devalued by the sinking greenback and could shift their assets elsewhere en masse .
But warnings that foreign investors could flee the U.S. in huge numbers have been heard frequently since the 1980s .
So far , they have not come true .

Although the dollar ’s decline reflects a higher regard , and demand , for other currencies by some investors and traders , many market professionals remain sanguine about the long - term appeal of U.S. assets .
“ The U.S. is still the best place to invest because it has the deepest , most open markets , ” said John McCarthy , director of foreign - exchange trading at ING Financial Markets .
Jay Bryson , a global economist at banking giant Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte , N.C. , said European investors who have watched the euro soar from its all - time low of 83 cents in 2000 are n’t likely to be unnerved by its move from $ 1.46 at the start of the year to the current $ 1.51 .
“ If they have n’t dumped the dollar by now , they are n’t going to , ” he said .

The US tycoon wants to create a links complex at the Menie Estate
The US billionaire , who wants to build a golf complex and housing development at the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire , said he was surprised by the decision .
The controversial project was given outline planning approval last week , but then went to Aberdeenshire Council 's infrastructure committee .
It rejected the plans on the chairman 's casting vote after a tied vote .
I think we have been very frank all along - we do have options elsewhere in the UK and we will sit down now and look at that
George Sorial
The Trump Organisation
Trump 's spokesman
A spokeswoman for Mr Trump told BBC Scotland : " We are surprised by the decision , it would have been a great development .
" We are considering an appeal , and also considering doing something very spectacular in another location .
Sadly , it will not be in Scotland . "
Earlier , the Trump Organisation 's head of international development , George Sorial , said after more than two - and - a - half hours of debate : " Obviously we are very disappointed .
" It is our position that the council has failed to adequately represent the voice and opinion of the people of Aberdeen and the Shire who are ultimately the losers here . "
' Too high '
Mr Sorial said that they were " not sure " if they would appeal against the decision .
" I think we have been very frank all along - we do have options elsewhere in the UK and we will sit down now and look at that , " he said .
" We have n't made a formal decision yet . "
Opposition to the scheme has included environmental groups , such as RSPB Scotland , and some local residents .
Protesters have claimed that the resort would have a major impact on wildlife and destroy a beautiful part of Scotland .
Opponents have fears about the environmental impact of the plans
An RSPB spokesperson said : " The destruction of part of Aberdeenshire 's beautiful unspoilt coastline has been recognised as too high a price to pay for this development .
" We hope that Scotland will continue to offer and promote the best golf courses in the world , but not at this expense . "
One of the most high - profile opponents to the resort was Michael Forbes , who said he would not sell his 23 acres near Balmedie to Mr Trump .
His wife Sheila said she was " surprised " but happy with the decision .
Business backing
" I thought it would go through , but I was keeping my fingers crossed it would n't , " she said .
" There were a lot of folk against it .
We are staying put .
We have said that all along . "
Mr Trump had revealed he had the backing of leading business and tourism figures .
The chairman of Aberdeen City and Shire Economic Forum ( Acsef ) , Patrick Machray , said : " The future of our economy is based on sustaining a vibrant business base by building on oil and gas and growing our other key sectors of food and drink , life sciences and tourism .
" The Trump development provides us with a golden opportunity to boost leisure tourism and raise our profile around the world .
" The decision is therefore a blow to the local economic forum 's vision for the long - term prosperity of our region . "
' Momentary setback '
Geoff Runcie , the chief executive of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce , said : " The prize of a world - class golf development and related resort appears to have been completely missed by a group of experienced councillors who , it might have reasonably been expected , would have been able to grasp this economic prize .
" The chamber sincerely hopes that , following this momentary setback , the Trump Organisation will feel inclined to appeal the decision with a view to delivering their world - class development . "
The Trump International Links scheme includes two championship golf courses and 1,500 homes .
The US tycoon claimed he needed to build the houses to pay for the development , which he wants to construct over the next five years at the 1,400 acre site near Balmedie .
Councillors on the Formartine area committee backed the plans last week by seven votes to four .
The development then went to the more powerful infrastructure services committee .
Michael Jukes and Daniel Buck had been to a friend 's party
Two men who swam in the sea with a dolphin after a night out have been found guilty of harassing the animal .
Michael Jukes , 27 , and Daniel Buck , 26 , were found guilty of intentionally or recklessly disturbing a wild animal at Sandgate , Kent in June last year .
Dover magistrates heard they had touched and stroked Dave the dolphin , which had become a tourist attraction spotted regularly near Folkestone .
They were each ordered to carry out 120 hours community service .
A lack of recent sightings has led to speculation that Dave , who was actually female , has now died .
The court heard that during the incident on 9 June a witness heard one of the men shout : " People pay hundreds of pounds to do this in Florida and I 'm doing it in Folkestone . "
Drinking heavily Civil engineer Buck , from Church Road , Folkestone , admitted during the trial he was pulled along by the dolphin after he grabbed its fin .
Pipe fitter Jukes , from Castle Hill Avenue , Folkestone said he had stroked its belly .
The pair had decided to have a swim at around 0500 BST after attending a party at a friend 's house where they had both been drinking heavily .
They said they had not realised they were doing anything wrong and thought the animal had enjoyed swimming with them .
Summing up , chairman of the bench John Offord said a number of experts had demonstrated the dolphin 's normal pattern of behaviour was disturbed .
DVD footage of the incident filmed by a witness captured the dolphin swimming towards the men head on and breaching the water , signs which showed the animal was distressed .
Mr Offord said there had been a number of discrepancies between what Buck and Jukes had told police when they were questioned initially and their evidence in court .
And he said they had refused to leave the water even after police ordered them to come out .
However , he said they had acted recklessly , rather than intending to disturb Dave .
Each was also ordered to pay £ 350 costs .

What are these ?
In 1971 , biologists moved five adult pairs of Italian wall lizards from their home island of Pod Kopiste , in the South Adriatic Sea , to the neighboring island of Pod Mrcaru .
Now , an international team of researchers has shown that introducing these small , green - backed lizards , Podarcis sicula , to a new environment caused them to undergo rapid and large - scale evolutionary changes .
“ Striking differences in head size and shape , increased bite strength and the development of new structures in the lizard ’s digestive tracts were noted after only 36 years , which is an extremely short time scale , ” says Duncan Irschick , a professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .
“ These physical changes have occurred side - by - side with dramatic changes in population density and social structure . ”
Results of the study were published March 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Researchers returned to the islands twice a year for three years , in the spring and summer of 2004 , 2005 and 2006 .
Captured lizards were transported to a field laboratory and measured for snout - vent length , head dimensions and body mass .
Tail clips taken for DNA analysis confirmed that the Pod Mrcaru lizards were genetically identical to the source population on Pod Kopiste .
Observed changes in head morphology were caused by adaptation to a different food source .
According to Irschick , lizards on the barren island of Pod Kopiste were well - suited to catching mobile prey , feasting mainly on insects .
Life on Pod Mrcaru , where they had never lived before , offered them an abundant supply of plant foods , including the leaves and stems from native shrubs .
Analysis of the stomach contents of lizards on Pod Mrcaru showed that their diet included up to two - thirds plants , depending on the season , a large increase over the population of Pod Kopiste .
“ As a result , individuals on Pod Mrcaru have heads that are longer , wider and taller than those on Pod Kopiste , which translates into a big increase in bite force , ” says Irschick .
“ Because plants are tough and fibrous , high bite forces allow the lizards to crop smaller pieces from plants , which can help them break down the indigestible cell walls . ”
Examination of the lizard ’s digestive tracts revealed something even more surprising .
Eating more plants caused the development of new structures called cecal valves , designed to slow the passage of food by creating fermentation chambers in the gut , where microbes can break down the difficult to digest portion of plants .
Cecal valves , which were found in hatchlings , juveniles and adults on Pod Mrcaru , have never been reported for this species , including the source population on Pod Kopiste .
“ These structures actually occur in less than 1 percent of all known species of scaled reptiles , ” says Irschick .
“ Our data shows that evolution of novel structures can occur on extremely short time scales .
Cecal valve evolution probably went hand - in - hand with a novel association between the lizards on Pod Mrcaru and microorganisms called nematodes that break down cellulose , which were found in their hindguts . ”
Change in diet also affected the population density and social structure of the Pod Mrcaru population .
Because plants provide a larger and more predictable food supply , there were more lizards in a given area on Pod Mrcaru .
Food was obtained through browsing rather than the active pursuit of prey , and the lizards had given up defending territories .
“ What is unique about this finding is that rapid evolution can affect not only the structure and function of a species , but also influence behavioral ecology and natural history , ” says Irschick .

6 Curious College Donations
by Katie Kelly
Universities are always looking for cash from their alumni ( or anyone else with a big enough checkbook ) .
But sometimes colleges are offered donations of another variety .
Here are stories of six rather unusual gifts given to universities across the world .
University of Colorado at Boulder
Endowing a school , building , or even a classroom with one 's name is a pretty typical fundraising practice among universities today " ¦ demanding a bathroom to commemorate yourself is n't quite as commonplace .
Brad Feld , a local venture capitalist , donated $ 25,000 to the University of Colorado on the condition that a plaque would be placed on the door of a second - floor men's restroom in one of the campus ' technology centers .
He originally made the conditional offer to his alma mater , MIT , but was rejected .
Feld , in an interview with Boulder 's Daily Camera , states : " I just wanted a plaque outside of the men 's room to inspire people as they walk in to do their business . " 
Quite fittingly , the quote reads , " The best ideas often come at inconvenient times " “ do n't ever close your mind to them . " 
Princeton University
With an $ 11.2 billion endowment and a current plan to raise an additional $ 1.75 billion , Princeton knows how to bring in cash .
But Andrew Carnegie 's donation is a large liquid asset of a different type : a lake .
Carnegie was a devoted philanthropist , founding libraries and universities in the United States and Scotland , and Princeton was eager to add their name to his list of lucky donors .
While sitting for a portrait one day Carnegie regaled the artist , Howard Russel Butler , with tales of the lochs he had built in Scotland .
Butler , an alumnus of Princeton University and its varsity crew team , described the crowded narrow canal that the team was practicing on and his plans to build an adjacent lake .
Carnegie immediately took interest and undertook the project himself .
At the dedication of Lake Carnegie , University president Woodrow Wilson ( the future President of the United States ) approached the donor , eager to involve Carnegie in funding new academic programs .
Carnegie responded with disinterest , saying " I have already given you a lake . " 
Wilson 's reported response ?
" We needed bread , and you gave us cake . " 
Tufts University
The donation that P. T. Barnum made in 1889 dwarfs the small peanuts being donated to the University by recent college graduates .
The great circus entertainer P.T. Barnum was one of the earliest supporters of Tufts , and he donated many of his deceased circus specimens to Tufts ' Barnum Museum of Natural History , which he also contributed .
Of all the exotic species he bestowed upon the college , his biggest ( literally ) and most impactful specimen donation was Jumbo the elephant .
Barnum promised the skeleton of the 13 - foot tall African elephant to the Museum of Natural History , and its hide to Tufts .
Upon Jumbo's death , he was mounted and sent to live at Tufts .
The students immediately took to Jumbo , and he became the school 's mascot .
However , tragedy struck in 1975 when Jumbo and the structure surrounding him , then known simply as Barnum Hall , was destroyed in a fire .
Athletic administrators , desperate to keep a remnant of their beloved mascot , scooped up some of the ashes into a peanut butter jar which remains on the desk of the Tufts athletic director to this day .
Churchill College , Cambridge University
Frances Crick ( of DNA fame ) had fundraising of a different type in mind for Cambridge University , intending to transition Churchill from leading the House of Commons to leading a house of ill repute .
To honor former Prime Minister Winston Churchill , Cambridge decided to build a new college in his honor in 1960 .
Crick was offered a fellowship in the college , and the fervent atheist accepted on the condition that a chapel never be constructed in the college , believing that religion had no place in a serious institution focused on science and technology .
However , when funding for the construction of a chapel was offered by a donor , the college agreed to proceed .
Crick protested to Churchill , who responded that " none need enter [ the chapel ] unless they wish . " 
Crick responded by saying that if that is the case , the college ought to build a brothel under the same grounds and even included a check for 10 guineas as his contribution towards such a business .
Unfortunately for Cambridge students , Crick 's facetious proposal was not accepted and he resigned .
Cal - Poly Pomona
W. K. Kellogg , of cereal fame , was an avid fan of Arabian horses since his childhood .
After starting his namesake company with his brother and earning millions of dollars , he purchased land in Pomona , California , to establish a world - class Arabian horse ranch .
In 1932 he donated the ranch to the state of California , stipulating that the horses must be kept , along with the traditional Sunday horse shows to display the grace and versatility of the Arabian horse .
When the property was transferred to the California State Polytechnic University at Pomona in 1949 , the school agreed to uphold these terms .
The Sunday shows continue today , performed by a student drill team on the first Sunday of each month , October through May .
University of Calgary
While light saber wars between students are routine at universities like Cal Tech and MIT , the University of Calgary lays claim to one of the largest collections of sci- fi material in the galaxy .
When devoted sci-fi collector Bob Gibson died in 2001 , his family had no idea what to do with his 30,000 piece collection - the boxes of books and magazines took up most of the house .
His son , an alumnus of the University of Calgary , decided that the collection would be best preserved and shared by donating it to his alma mater .
Thus , with the establishment of the Bob Gibson Collection of Speculative Fiction , the University of Calgary instantly became the home of one of the world 's leading collections of science fiction .

The Japanese Minister of Defense is calling for efforts to work out the military and legal issues that would result if Japanese were attacked by extraterrestrials .
Two members of the Japanese cabinet have expressed personal beliefs in the existence of extraterrestrials out there , somewhere .
Because of Japans 1947 constitution , there are restrictions on what actions the military can take .
Basically , the Japanese military is , technically , a purely defensive force .
But an extraterrestrial invasion might play out in ways that would find the Japanese military prevented , by lawyers , from moving against an extraterrestrial menace .
We 're not making this up .
Earlier today we noted that the Republican Senate candidate from Colorado , Bob Schaffer , told the Denver Post that America should adopt an immigration and guest labor policy modeled on that of the Mariana Islands ( aka the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ) — whose guest worker program is notorious around the world for forced abortion , slavery , child prostitution , sex trafficking , beatings , female workers kept in shacks with no plumbing surrounded by barbed wire and other fun stuff .
When I first heard what a bang up job Schaffer thinks they ’re doing in the Marianas I figured he had only some casual acquaintance with the situation in the Islands .
But it turns out that ’s not so .
TPM Reader AK points out that the folks at ProgressNowAction have done a little digging .
And it seems that that back in 1999 , when Schaffer was serving in Congress , he went on one of those junkets to the Islands put together by none other than disgraced lobbyist and now - federal inmate Jack Abramoff .
Those of you with a clear recollection of the details of the Abramoff scandal will remember that one of Jack ’s biggest clients was the group of sharks who ran the Marianas sweat shops .
They had a great thing going because they were able to slap Made In The USA labels on clothes and other items made in Saipan by female guest workers imported from other parts of East Asia to work in sub-Third World labor conditions .
That is , when the guest workers were n’t busy getting beaten , raped or coerced into having abortions .
Jack ’s job was to find politicians willing to travel with him on junkets to the Marianas , hang out at the casinos and come back to the states and say how well the labor conditions actually there seemed to be .
It was actually amazing what Abramoff could get members of Congress to do for the Marianas sweatshop owners .
After his Marianas junket , Rep. Ralph Hall ( R - TX ) agreed to enter into the congressional record a series of personal attacks against a 15 year old sex slave whose ordeal had become a major source of press attention .
“ [ S ] he wanted to do nude dancing , ” said Rep . Hall .
In any case , it was just one of these junkets with Abramoff that then US Rep .
Bob Schaffer took back in 1999 , which , as it happens , was a year after the release of the Department of Labor report that confirmed the 15 year old sex slave ’s account .
Story Highlights • San Francisco recycles about 30,000 gallons of latex paint every year
• Recycled paint is shipped to locations world - wide for free
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) --
The highest - volume product brought to most municipal waste collection centers during spring cleanup is paint .
" Everybody who owns a house has five cans of paint in their garage , and they 're all half full , " said Robert Reed of Norcal Waste Systems Inc. , which runs the waste collection program for the city of San Francisco , California .
What to do with it all ?
Some collection programs do n't want latex paint because there 's so much of it and it can't be processed into anything else .
( Oil - based paint can be burned as fuel . )
They suggest using it up by laying on a couple of extra coats , or giving it to a neighbor , a school or a theater group .
It can also be mixed with sand , allowed to dry and tossed out with the regular trash .
San Francisco had a different idea .
The city 's Household Hazardous Waste Recycling Facility , operated by Norcal , takes in about 30,000 gallons of latex paint every year .
The paint is segregated into color groups , then blended and tinted into a few basic colors , Reed said .
The paint is then given away in 5 - gallon buckets to anyone who wants it .
( Miami , Florida , does this too . )
Even so , " we end up with more than we can give away , " Reed said .
That 's where Humberto Quinonez comes in .
Once or twice a year , Quinonez arranges to have hundreds of gallons of recycled paint shipped to other countries for use in schools , hospitals and other public buildings .
( See a gallery of Mexican schools that have benefitted from the donated paint . )
" America does n't export a lot of things , " Reed said .
" Why not export a little community service ? "
Most of it goes to Mexico and El Salvador , but shipments also have been sent to Tonga and Fiji in the South Pacific and to Mali in central Africa .
Bureaucracy complicated initial shipments to Mexico , but Quinonez and a relative in Los Cabos devised a way around the red tape by using a local business that has an import license .
" Now we know how it works , and every time we send something it gets a little easier , " he said .
Quinonez and another employee accompany every shipment , paying their own way and using a combination of vacation and company time .
Norcal employs a number of immigrants , who arrange for shipments to be sent to their hometowns .
" There are a few guys lining up now .
They really want to come , " Quinonez said .
Norcal , an employee - owned company , foots the bill for the sturdy 5 - gallon buckets and the shipping costs , which can be substantial .
As much as 3,700 gallons ( 740 buckets ) can be sent by truck .
There 's virtually no limit on loads moved by sea ; the biggest one so far was 4,500 gallons ( 900 buckets ) .
" Now , in liters that 's a lot more , " Quinonez joked .
" It sounds more impressive . "
Touching scene in hometown
In Quinonez 's hometown of Durango , Mexico , a load of paint went to a school for the blind and an agency that operates 10 homes for AIDS patients .
" We wanted to participate in the painting but they would n't let us , " he said . " ... I was willing to roll up my sleeves and do some work , but they would n't let us do it .
They had so many workers , they did n't need the help .
We were probably in their way . "
He said he wept at the reaction of a family living in one of the AIDS houses who had endured harsh discrimination .
" It was really heartbreaking , but they were so happy , " he said .
" They kind of felt like they were somebody because people would actually care about them .
Just because somebody would paint their home , they were somebody . "
A contact in San Salvador , the capital of El Salvador , requested help after militants defaced buildings with graffiti .
" They need some paint to restore the beauty there , " Quinonez said .
In Santiago , Mexico , donated paint was used to beautify a school -- the children painted a mural on the side of the building .
" We went to Durango and Santiago and Los Cabos , and then we looked at the paint on the walls of the schools , and it was really nice .
They did a really nice job of combining the colors .
They were creative . "
And it 's high - quality paint , free of lead and other toxins .
In Los Cabos they tested it with a pressure washer and it stayed put , he said .
They 're not used to that in Mexico , where paint is often thinned down " like Kool - Aid , " he said with a laugh .
Even the buckets are better than what 's generally available there , and people can reuse them when the paint is gone , he said .
" Now they 're asking us for more .
We 're really popular now . "
Reed sees it as a kind of diplomacy .
" America is n't loved in a lot of places , " he said , " so maybe something like this can help with that a little bit . "

LINDA ( # 6 ) -- These iVotronic DRE machines were the ones purchased by KATHERINE HARRIS ( at least for Sarasota County ) in 2002 / tested by CIBER , INC .
Their history of failures , mechanical break - downs , repairs ( especially to the mylar touch screens ) have been carefully documented by citizen observers over the years ... reads like a damn phone book .
While I 'm overjoyed to see them FINALLY headin ' to the junk - yard ( no small victory ; it IS the DREAM that has propelled us forward ) -- there is some concern among us that in doing so , BROWNING has now disposed of the final evidence of the stolen CD - 13 election .
... perhaps the error rate / failures / bugs , whatever happened inside those bastard machines would be IMPOSSIBLE to find , now -- still , I know several very clever and talented computer programmers who are DYING to get their hands on one of these ( now crunched ) voting machines ,
convinced they have several ways to reproduce or find the problem .
I can feel their angst ; all they ever wanted to do was see a truly independent , thorough testing of these machines ... and despite ALL of the tests done here :
1. FSU TEST -- they did n't test the PEB 's / testing was not even given the APPEARANCE of non-partisan , independence .
2 . STATE PARALLEL TEST / AUDIT -- run by insiders Kathy Dent and David Drury / only 10 machines tested , 5 of which were used on election day , unsound testing procedures / STRANGE TEST SCRIPTS THAT HAD ALL VOTES CAST BY TESTERS ENTERING THE VOTE SEQUENCING THROUGH JENNINGS !!
( Yes , they did ...! )/ PRESS and OBSERVERS HASSLED 3 .
GAO TEST -- Again , machines chosen by DENT AND DRURY / loaded up PERSONALLY by DRURY / tested at DENT and DRURY 's warehouse / no investigation of STATE TESTING PROCEDURE examined .
Incomplete , but analysis " exonerates " iVotronics right before they are destroyed .
... as a result , Vern Buchanan was officially certified just last week .
I was , and still am , a NEW YORKER .
As I read Brad 's report , kept thinking about how damn fast that 2 million tons of steel disappeared .
We were so proud of our boys , our efforts ...
only to see the EVIDENCE of the largest crime scene be shipped off to make " collector 's edition WTC coins " and new war ships .
That being said , DRE's are OVER .
Thanks to everyone , here .
MUCH reason to celebrate .
Now we can fight the complete absence of PRECINT BY PRECINCT RESULTS ... and even MORE ominous -- VOTE BY MAIL as the solution to the PRIMARY MESS .
( And FLORIDIOT -- yes ... I 'm blaming FL STATE DEM CHAIR KAREN THURMAN , personally .
Would LOVE to see her name come up more often as the pundits are going limp - fingered with all their nasty , uninformed pointing of their poking finger . )

That old spam piece still is hilarious though , thanks .
Is it the new button ?

Let 's not get too excited .
Optical scanners are also vulnerable to fraud .
The paper trail is crucial but so is a hand count .

Q-CELLS , based in Wolfen , just north of Leipzig , is the world 's biggest maker of the photovoltaic cells used in solar panels .
It overtook Sharp of Japan last year and announced big jumps in sales ( up 59 % ) and profits ( up 69 % ) on March 27th .
Germany , which is not known for being sunny , seems an unusual place to find this industry leader .
But the country leads the world in its installed capacity of renewable energy sources ( see chart ) , and is the third - biggest producer of solar panels , after China and Japan .
The environment ministry 's latest report on the state of the industry , released on March 12th , shows how quickly it is growing .
Renewables now account for 6.7 % of energy consumption , up from 5.5 % in 2006 and 3.5 % in 2003 .
The industry 's turnover was € 24.6 billion ( $ 32.9 billion ) in 2007 , up 10 % on 2006 and nearly four times the figure for 2000 .
The share of electricity generated from renewable sources reached 14.2 % , a big jump from 11.7 % in 2006 , owing in part to stronger - than - usual winds last year .
This means Germany has already met the European Union 's national target that 12.5 % of electricity should come from renewable sources .
Andreas Düser of Enercon , a wind - equipment maker in Lower Saxony , believes that renewable - energy equipment will become a big part of the country 's manufacturing industry , alongside cars and machine tools .
Employment in the renewables industry will increase from 250,000 in 2007 to around 710,000 in 2030 , matching the jobs in carmaking by that time , predicts Torsten Henzelmann of Roland Berger , a consultancy .
Most of Germany 's electricity comes from coal - fired and nuclear plants .
But the former are unpopular because of their relatively high greenhouse - gas emissions , and the latter because of the fear of a catastrophic accident .
So in 1991 Germany adopted a renewable - energy law , now known as the EEG , which encourages investment by cross - subsidising renewable electricity fed into the grid .
The law is popular with those who support the rapid introduction of new clean technology .
Stefan Schurig of the World Future Council , a green think - tank in Hamburg , calls it “ the best law of its kind worldwide ” .
The law says electricity produced from renewable sources must be purchased by utilities according to a generous “ feed - in tariff ” that sets higher - than - market rates and fixes them for 20 years .
Roof - mounted photovoltaic systems installed in 2007 , for example , can sell power at € 0.49 per kilowatt - hour , or about seven times today 's wholesale price , until 2027 .
The fixed rate allows investors to calculate returns and removes uncertainty over financing .
The utilities that buy power at these higher rates pass the extra costs back to their customers in the form of higher electricity bills .
This added an average of 1 euro cent per kilowatt - hour to the price of electricity last year , increasing the typical household electricity bill by 5 % , or € 3 a month .
For the country as a whole , the cost was € 7.7 billion in 2007 , up 38 % on the year before .
Enthusiasts consider that a small price to jump - start a new industry and start decarbonising the power supply .
Clouds on the horizon
But the government is not so sure .
It has proposed a revision to the EEG , which calls for a shift away from solar and towards other forms of renewable energy , and offshore wind in particular .
As things stand , the feed - in tariff for solar goes down by 5 % every year .
But new proposals call for a cut of 9.2 % next year , and 7 - 8 % thereafter .
The problem is not just the expense of the existing law .
Cheerleaders for solar had hoped that the increased demand for panels would help manufacturers reduce unit costs , and thus make solar more competitive in the long run .
Instead , the rush into solar has led to a shortage of the high - grade silicon used to make the cells , which has soared in price from $ 25 per kilogram in 2003 to around $ 400 today .
Indeed , such is the demand for solar panels in Germany that it has kept prices high globally .
This is wonderful for manufacturers , but makes it more expensive to install solar capacity in sunnier parts of the world , where it would generate more electricity .
The EEG 's generous rates for solar amounted to “ picking winners on a grand scale ” , says Dieter Helm , an expert on energy policy at the University of Oxford .
A euro in cross-subsidies spent on wind power , rather than solar , produces more generating capacity and a larger reduction in carbon emissions .
“ Of course we want solar energy to pay for itself , ” says Anton Milner , the chief executive of Q - Cells .
But for some years it will not be competitive with conventional power sources , which are also subsidised , he says , since the cost of carbon emissions is not properly priced .
Fans of solar also note that wind cannot expand for ever .
Kurt Rohrig of ISET , a solar - research institute at the University of Kassel , predicts — somewhat heroically — that wind power in Germany will reach saturation by 2038 .
“ Then solar will take over , ” he says .
As the government tweaks the feed - in tariffs , manufacturers are also thinking ahead .
Many expect silicon - based cells to be overtaken by new “ thin film ” technology .
Inside the 300 - strong R&D department at Q - Cells , they are working on both kinds .
Ersol , a smaller company which is bent on mass - production , prefers to outsource research to institutions in Erfurt , Konstanz and Hameln .
Throughout Germany , around 160 institutions are doing research on solar technology .
In the long run , the hope is that Germany 's clean - tech industry will be able to survive without any subsidies , and will do its bit to preserve the country 's status as an industrial titan .
Yet unless solar power becomes competitive with cheaper forms of generation , it will never make much of a dent in the nuclear and coal - fired power on which Germany relies .
And then there is the problem of storing it for use on cloudy days and at night .
Meanwhile , the unlikely flowering of solar panels beneath Germany 's cloudy skies continues .
Based on the results of the April 22 primary , 158 pledged delegates are awarded to presidential candidates ; of these , 103 are awarded proportionally based on the results in each of the state 's 19 Congressional districts , and 55 are awarded proportionally based on the results statewide .
The remaining delegates attend the national convention unpledged ; of these , three are selected by the state Democratic committee , and the rest are either party leaders or elected officials .
Winter Soldier : Iraq and Afghanistan was a 4 - day event from March 13 - 16 in DC that brought together veterans from across the country to testify about their experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Although the news media has unsurprisingly ignored the event much as they did its predecessor in 1971 , this time we have digital media and the intertubes to document it and bring it to a wider audience .

Iraq Veterans Against the War :
In 1776 , Thomas Paine wrote : “ These are the times that try men ’s souls .
The summer soldier and sunshine patriot will , in this crisis , shrink from the service of his country ; but he that stands it now , deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . ”
In 1971 , a courageous group of veterans exposed the criminal nature of the Vietnam War in an event called Winter Soldier .
Once again , we will demand that the voices of veterans are heard .
Spencer Ackerman has had ongoing coverage of Winter Soldier : Iraq and Afghanistan and much of it is beyond disturbing :
" That was the first time I 've ever seen a six year old girl dead .
And it was not drown[ ing ] in a swimming pool , but because she had been shot by a bunch of teenage American kids .
Not because we want to , but because it happens . " ...( read on )

Mike Prysner 's testimony was particularly revealing ( YouTube here & here ) about military commanders ' deliberate use of racism as a tool to motivate soldiers to fight and " die to control the market of another country . " ( excerpted transcript after the jump )
Prysner :
When I first joined the army we were told that racism no longer existed in the military .
A legacy of inequality and discrimination was suddenly washed away by something called the ' Equal Opportunity Program .
We would sit through mandatory classes and every unit had this EO representative to ensure that no elements of racism could resurface .
The Army seemed firmly dedicated to smashing any hint of racism .
And then September 11th happened and I began to hear new words like ' towel head ' and ' camel jockey ' and the most disturbing : ' sand nigger . '
And these words did not initially come from my fellow soldiers but from my superiors : my platoon sergeant , my company first sergeant , battalion commander .
All the way up the chain of command these terms , these viciously racist terms were suddenly acceptable . [...]
We were told we were fighting terrorists , but the real terrorist was me and the real terrorism is this occupation .
Racism within the military has long been an important tool to justify the destruction and occupation of another country .
It has long been used to justify the killing , subjugation , and torture of another people .
Racism is a vital weapon deployed by this government .
It is a more important weapon than a rifle , a tank , a bomber or a battleship .
It is more destructive than an artillery shell , or a bunker buster , or a tomahawk missile .
While all of those weapons are created and owned by this government , they are harmless without people willing to use them .
Those who send us to war do not have to pull a trigger or lob a mortar round .
They do not have to fight the war .
They merely have to sell the war .
They need a public who is willing to send their soldiers into harm 's way and they need soldiers who are willing to kill or be killed without question .
They can spend millions on a single bomb , but that bomb only becomes a weapon when the ranks in the military are willing to follow orders to use it .
They can send every last soldier anywhere on earth , but there will only be a war if soldiers are willing to fight , and the ruling class : the billionaires who profit from human suffering care only about expanding their wealth , controlling the world economy , understand that their power lies only in their ability to convince us that war , oppression , and exploitation is in our interests .
They understand that their wealth is dependent on their ability to convince the working class to die to control the market of another country .
And convincing us to kill and die is based on their ability to make us think that we are somehow superior .
Soldiers , sailors , marines , airmen , have nothing to gain from this occupation .
The vast majority of people living in the US have nothing to gain from this occupation .
In fact , not only do we have nothing to gain , but we suffer more because of it .
We lose limbs , endure trauma , and give our lives .
Our families have to watch flag draped coffins lowered into the earth .
Millions in this country without healthcare , jobs , or access to education must watch this government squander over $ 450 million a day on this occupation .
Poor and working people in this country are sent to kill poor and working people in another country to make the rich richer , and without racism soldiers would realize that they have more in common with the Iraqi people than they do with the billionaires who send us to war .
Senator Barack Obama has made significant inroads over the last month among the Democratic elected officials and party leaders known as superdelegates who will cast a fifth of the votes at the party ’s convention , cutting into Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s long - held advantage with the group .
What began for Mr. Obama as a trickle of support from the superdelegates has grown into more of a stream as he has won the last 11 nominating contests in a row against Mrs. Clinton , of New York .
Those victories have led to a few prominent defections 
Representative John Lewis of Georgia formally switched sides this week  and prompted other undecided superdelegates to get off the fence and to support Mr. Obama .
At least nine superdelegates have declared their support for Mr. Obama in the last few days .
The effect has been to whittle away at Mrs. Clinton ’s lead with a group that her campaign had been counting on as a bulwark against the nomination ’s going to Mr. Obama , of Illinois .
The Clinton campaign said Thursday that it had the support of 258 of the 795 superdelegates ( not counting those from Florida or Michigan , whose delegations are the focus of a dispute ) , while the Obama campaign said it had the support of more than 200 .
It said it had won the support of 39 since Feb. 5 , including four that formerly supported Mrs. Clinton .
Over the past week , Hillary repeatedly said that she would nuke Iran if Iran nuked Israel .
She also said that she would consider extending the US nuclear umbrella to protect other US allies in the Middle East as well .
This is a rather large change in US nuclear policy .
Apparently aware of this fact , senior members of Hillary ’s staff tried three times yesterday to deny that Hillary said she would nuke Iran ( Hillary literally said that the US would have “ a nuclear response ” to Iran – it does n’t get any clearer than that ) and they denied that she said we should extend our nuclear umbrella to protect other countries in the region ( but she did , twice ) .
In an effort to determine just how a large a gaffe Hillary made , I decided to contact a national security expert .
AJ , our former defense intelligence officer , is taking his law exams , so in the meantime , here ’s the take of Dr. Jeffrey Lewis .
Dr. Lewis is Director of the Nuclear Strategy and Nonproliferation Initiative at the New America Foundation .
He founded and maintains the leading blog on nuclear arms control and nonproliferation , ArmsControlWonk.com .
Here is Dr. Lewis ’ take on Hillary ’s , and her staff ’s , comments on this issue :
When you witness it , you are left in disbelief ; how can it be happening ?
But it is occurring daily ; what seems to be purposeful hindrances to
I had already observed a power point presentation on Fragmentation of the West Bank , one of many presentations that the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) displays for those interested in conditions in the Palestinian West Bank .
An OCHA source told me that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed surprise with the same presentation ; he had n’t been informed of the shown and known restrictive conditions .
Evidently , Tony Blair had been unaware of the separation wall that separates Palestinian communities and families , that chokes the Palestinian economy and obstructs daily exchanges between peoples ,
He was not sufficiently informed of a planned North South super highway for only Israelis that will divide the West bank in half , of the other highways that slice through Palestinian lands and completely bar farm homes from agriculture ; of checkpoints every five miles , flying checkpoints , road barriers , berms , trenches , settler bypass roads , blocked Palestinian village roads , and travel restrictions to Jerusalem .
All of this was emphasized in another presentation by Machsom Watch ’s Hanna Baraj .
Machsom
Watch consists of a group of women who rise at 5 AM daily , go to 40 checkpoints and investigate human rights violations .
Ms. Baraj related horror stories ; of Palestinians who cannot receive visitors , of a child who had cancer but the parents did not have permission to accompany the child to a hospital in Jerusalem , of women who cannot obtain passports or identity cards and are locked in their homes .
Her exposition led to one conclusion :
The entire purpose of the restrictions on freedom of movement is to make life impossible for the Palestinians .
OCHA Field Support Officer , Dr. Tim Williams , transformed the visual and auditory presentations to real life .
He provided a guided tour from Jerusalem to Bethlehem and parts of the West Bank .
Start on Road # 1 , along the Green Line that leads to the Mandelbaum Gate , a former checkpoint between Israeli and Jordanian sectors of Jerusalem .
Pass the Mandelbaum gate and arrive in East Jerusalem .
The Palestinians in East Jerusalem who refused Israeli citizenship after the 1967 war are now stateless .
To make their lives worse , Israel has halted re-unification of families that are separated between the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
Approximately 100,000 persons have applied for reunification .
Most persons who had a spouse and children in both areas are denied access to their families .
Some parents can’t register children or obtain birth certificates .
For these parents it means not being able to move to a job in another country without leaving the child .
Entering Bethlehem means being greeted by the separation wall which runs close to homes .
The former popular Bethlehem has shrunk in size and economy .
Israel decided to incorporate 22 % of Bethlehem land into Jerusalem .
The government also contrived to route the wall so that it cuts across the Jerusalem / Bethlehem highway and closes the previously used road to Bethlehem .
This road brought tourists past the souvenir shops , which are now mostly closed .
Hotels are only 10 % occupied .
The livelihoods of many Bethlehem citizens have disappeared .
To obtain employment , laborers line up at 3 AM at checkpoints they must pass through in order to go to Jerusalem and work .
The checkpoint funnels persons through a small fenced area , similar to a stockyard , bringing them to a turnstile and to security control .
The once busy and proud Bethlehem is now a decaying town ; empty shops , empty homes , empty tourist attractions .
If the Christian Lord could rise again , he would be alone .
The UN claims decaying Bethlehem water pipelines lose 25 % of the water .
The former Palestine Authority intelligence headquarters , bombed by Israeli jets on March 5 , 2002 , remains a bombed out group of senseless buildings .
At a hilltop site in Gush Etzion , ( Bloc of the Tree ) , the famous Zionist constructed villages , which were destroyed and abandoned under Jordanian rule , but have returned to grow to 40,000 settlers since Israel ’s occupation after the 1967 war , Israel ’s modification of the land is apparent .
Israeli setlements dot the landscape .
Several temporary vans with antennae are in view on the top of the hill .
Two Israelis come jogging from the incipient settlement .
An old Palestinan village is obvious in the near distance .
We are told that its cisterns have been dampened and the village is static – building of new homes is not permitted , except for special circumstances .
A new narrow road winds its way in the distance .
The direct road which led to the main road has been blocked , bypassed , reblocked and on and on .
A super highway , for settlers only , cuts through Palestinian lands and separates the homes from the agriculture and gazing .
Children who tend goats after school must walk several hundred yards from their homes in order to cross the road and find the goats .
A Palestinian only road is being constructed under the superhighway .
Fruit trees have been destroyed to provide this road , which at its low level , is subjected to flooding .
The road is not finished .
Hebron is the other principal Palestinian city in the southern part of the West Bank .
Gill Swain , voluntary member of the Ecumenical Accompaniers in Hebron , is the Hebron guide .
The Ecumenical Accompaniers in Hebron do just what their nomenclature indicates ; they accompany Hebron Arabs in everyday functions and prevent harrassment from illegal settlers .
Entrances to the old market , where the supposed Abraham ’s tomb is located , have been blocked by checkpoints .
Arab children , who attend schools in the old section , must pass through metal detectors at these checkpoints .
Most shops and homes along the principal street of the old wholesale market have had their locks broken and remain empty .
The guide stops and talks to a man , an illegal settler , under house arrest .
Nevertheless , the man walks the streets .
The illegal settlers now control the central part of the old city .
They mingle together , obviously not working , in a housing project hidden from the main street .
Their children , many of them , run and play .
The settlers are reticient to talk , saying they will only talk if we promise to tell the truth .
When asked why the Palestinians are no longer here , the settler responds he does n’t know – an example of what he characterizes as the truth .
Outside the settlement is a huge banner that proclaims : Return Stolen Jewish Property – a reference to the 1929 riots when about 65 Jews were killed and all Jews eventually left Hebron .
The sign is raised over Arab stores , all of which have been destroyed and are now locked and unused ; although the proprietors must pay taxes and the leasees must pay rents .
The illegal settlements have destroyed Palestinian life in the central market of Hebron .
When the Israeli military attempted to evict the settlers , the settlers broke windows and ruined the Palestinian shops .
For an incomprehensible reason , the settlers have returned to their positions and the Palestinian shops and houses remain empty
These settlers make claim to properties “ taken ” from Jews during riots against Hebron Jews back in 1929 , but do not display any rights of inheritance or deeds to any of the properties .
Can this claim of a ‘ collective right ’ have a legal basis ?
Contrast the Hebron settlers ’ illegal positions and false claims with Palestinians , who have legal deeds to properties in Israel , and are prevented from recovering their properties .
Close to the security checkpoint and directly opposite to a settlement of 30 families at Beit Hadassah , Palestinian children attend a school .
Each day the entrance to the steps leading to the school is blocked by a car , just a petty expression that characterizes the meaness of the Hebron settlers .
Separate roads , separate schools , separate shops , separate everything – is n’t that apartheid ?
President Jimmy
Carter did n’t err in calling it apartheid .
He could have termed it a super apartheid , nothing comparable to it in the western world of the present century .

Teacher to 4 - Year - Olds : ' You Are All Just Stupid Kids '
A mother concerned about her daughter 's behavior secretly videotaped her class .
Feb. 27 , 2008  -- A Houston mother , who said her daughter was well - behaved at home , was worried about what was going on in her child 's classroom because the girl had been suspended four times for bad behavior .
So , Diana Mijares decided to secretly bug her daughter 's backpack and was shocked to hear what was on the tape .
" It made us concerned , " Mijares said on " Good Morning America " today .
" It was enough and we needed answers . "
Megan Mijares ' digital tape recorded mostly mundane moments at Memorial Elementary School 's prekindergarten class , but then it captured the teacher yelling at the group of 4 - and 5 - year - olds .
All of it happened without Megan 's or her teacher 's knowledge .
" You 're just a bad kid , " the teacher says on the six - hour tape .
" You 're mean to me , so I get to be mean to you . "
The teacher , who was not identified , continues to harshly scold the children .
" You are all just stupid kids .
I swear to God , " the teacher says .
" You are just all stupid kids . "
Mijares said at that point the teacher was responding to a boy who was moving slowly .
" I believe one of the students was taking a little bit longer to come into the classroom , " Mijares said .
In response to the allegations , the Houston Independent School District is investigating the case and the school 's principal has reassigned the teacher .
Mijares worries that action will not be enough .
" My fear is that if she 's reassigned that maybe possibly this could happen to other children , " said Mijares , who added she only was trying to protect the children .
" They are learning bad manners and they do n't need this , " Mijares said .
The teacher has a history of parental complaints .
Another mother told ABC News Houston affiliate KTRK that the teacher yelled at her young son and then slapped his face in December .
Houston school officials confirmed a slapping allegation was reported to the principal .
After an investigation , the principal found evidence the teacher slapped a student and she was disciplined .
" She was suspended for one day without pay back in December , " said district spokesperson Terry Abbott .
Mijares said it 's important for parents to pay attention and be involved with their children 's schools .
" My advice is if you feel something is really going on and you can't get any answers from the school , try to take charge as much as you can , " she said .
Now she and her husband , Oscar , are trying help Megan recover .
She said that the girl still is having some problems in school and that they worry the teacher 's harsh words may have affected the girl .
One parenting expert said such words could be damaging to young children .
" Four - year - old children see themselves as stupid when you call them stupid .
They are going to act up if you call them mean and bad because that is how you see them , " said Nancy Samalin .
" They are not going to disappoint you . "
The teacher 's attorney told ABC News the 30 - year veteran " wishes to apologize to the students and the students ' parents .
Her actions that day were an aberration … the result of medication that she was taking as a result of a recent hospital visit . "

BREAKING , SHOCKING : Our opposition actually apologizes
by Jeremy Hooper
Do n't be alarmed , ladies and gents , but there is a very good chance that hell has just frozen over .
And why do we think this , you ask ?
Well , because a " pro-family " personality has apologized for some horrid comments that he made , and has done so without using any real qualifiers or attempts to say that he was " misrepresented . "
Last week , as you might remember , the Family Research Council 's Peter Sprigg said the following in an interview with the Medill News Service :
powered by ODEO
Well now , in a posting to FRC 's blog , Sprigg has issued the following statement :
In an interview with Medill News Service that was posted on the Internet last week , I discussed FRC ’s opposition to an immigration bill that would allow foreign nationals who are the same - sex partners of American citizens to immigrate to the United States on the same basis as foreign spouses of American citizens .
FRC does not believe that homosexual relationships are the equivalent of marriage , and we therefore oppose any legislation that would treat such relationships as the equivalent of marriage .
In response to a question regarding bi-national same - sex couples who are separated by an international border , I used language that trivialized the seriousness of the issue and did not communicate respect for the essential dignity of every human being as a person created in the image of God .
I apologize for speaking in a way that did not reflect the standards which the Family Research Council and I embrace .
Okay , so sure he still stands in opposition to the fair and equitable treatment of our relationships .
Also , he does n't bring up the exact words that caused such a kerfuffle that it clearly resonated within the ranks of FRC .
So we would guess that what he is sorry for is that he got caught , not that he made his initial comment .
After all , saying you 'd like to " export homosexuals " is not just a slip of the tongue or a brain fart .
It has to be in your gut to make it past your lips .
But on the flip side :
Here we have someone on the side that so frequently disrespects " the essential dignity of every human being " actually owning up to an instance in which he did exactly that .
For these folks , that 's something !
Statement by Peter Sprigg [ FRC Blog ]
Your thoughts
Well it 's official .
There will be a blizzard in Florida this summer .
Posted by : a. mcewen | Mar 27 , 2008 6:08:51 PM
Funny , I thought his comments were a PERFECT reflection of what the FRC is all about .
Posted by : DCN | Mar 28 , 2008 12:08:10 PM
Yea , well , that 's one way of looking at it , DCN .
But it's of course very unlike them to ever apologize for anything .
So one has to wonder what went on behind the scenes to force him to do so !

Oh he 'll run his trap and say it again NEXT week .
You know how republicans / " christians " get when those meds starts wearing off .

" The violation of Iraq 's sovereignty already started with demanding disarmament by inspection and gradually led to war , " said a spokesman at North Korea 's foreign ministry told KCNA , the communist state 's official news agency .
The spokesman said the war in Iraq should " compel ( North Korea ) to do all it can to defend itself " .
Separately , North Korea criticised South Korea 's decision to put its military on heightened alert as " an undisguised challenge and intolerable hostility " .
South Korea said on Friday its military went on heightened alert to guard against possible North Korean moves to use the distraction of war in Iraq to increase tensions on the Korean Peninsula .
But it said the precautionary move did not involve significant troop movements .
North Korea 's Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said : " We cannot but express deep concern about the irrevocable adverse impact such reckless sabre - rattling going on in South Korea will have on peace on the Korean Peninsula and inter-Korean relations . "
But South Korea 's unification ministry said the war in Iraq should not have a negative impact on inter-Korean relations .
" It is regrettable North Korea doubts our determination on reconciliation and co-operation on the Korean Peninsula . "
South Korean Defence Minister Cho Young - kil said North Korea was conducting air raid drills across the country to heighten vigilance .
But he said he saw " little chance of high - intensity military provocations " from the communist state .
Tensions have run high in the region since October , when the US said North Korea admitted having a secret nuclear program .
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun sought to ease foreign investors ' concerns over the tensions .
" There will not be a war , or any chaotic situation that resembles war " on the peninsula , he said .
KCNA said the US was conducting war exercises to test its capabilities of fighting two wars simultaneously .
The US , which has said it has no plans to invade North Korea , says its regular military exercises with South Korea are purely defensive .

Lieberman could snag cabinet post if McCain elected Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday March 11 , 2008

Print This Email This If Sen. John McCain ( D - AZ ) prevails in his bid to keep the White House in Republican hands for the next four years , one of his most hawkish colleagues could find himself overseeing the Department of Defense , State or Homeland Security within a McCain White House .
Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman , the Democrats ' onetime vice presidential nominee who left the party last year , is seen as a likely McCain pick for a cabinet level appointment , according to Roll Call : Atop McCains short list , according to closely aligned Republican Senators and aides , likely would be two of the Arizonans most vocal supporters : Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) for attorney general or Sen. Joe Lieberman ( ID - Conn . ) as secretary of State , Defense or Homeland Security .
Graham and Lieberman have been stumping for McCain for months and are considered two of the most loyal and ardent backers of his Iraq War policy .
 Those are two of the most obvious choices from the Senate ,  observed one Republican Senate aide .
Other long - shot possibilities for McCain could include Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) at Treasury or Justice , Sen. Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) at Veterans Affairs , or even conservative Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan. ) , who is retiring in 2010 , as attorney general or secretary of Health and Human Services .
Several GOP sources advised that a Brownback selection is unlikely , however , since Kansas is home to a Democratic governor and Obama supporter in Kathleen Sebelius .
Lieberman remains one of the most ardently supportive voices for President Bush 's war effort in the Senate , and he has suggested expanding the war from Iraq to Iran .
In the Senate , Lieberman supported the Patriot Act and its renewal , and he 's voted in favor of a measure to expand the government 's domestic surveillance authority .
He also has defended waterboarding as a legitimate interrogation tool in certain instances ; on this issue he is at odds with McCain , who considers the tactic torture .
As Secretary of State or Defense , he would be given authority in shaping US military or diplomatic policy toward the Middle East and the rest of the world .

The Dodd / Feingold Amendment 3907 to strip retroactive immunity from the underlying SSCI bill just failed , 31 - 67 . 51 votes were needed to pass .
Voting with the Republicans were the following eighteen Democrats ( again , rough count ) :
Bayh , Inouye , Johnson , Landrieu , McCaskill , Ben Nelson , Bill Nelson , Stabenow , Feinstein , Kohl , Pryor , Rockefeller , Salazar , Carper , Mikulski , Conrad , Webb , and Lincoln .
Joe Lieberman also voted against stripping retroactive immunity .
Not present and voting was Senator Hillary Clinton , the only presidential candidate serving in the Senate to miss the vote .
Before the vote , Senator Dodd raised a very interesting point that I have n’t previously seen discussed .
Three out of of four congressional committees that looked at FISA reform legislation were opposed to retroactive immunity .
The Senate Judiciary , House Judiciary , and House Intelligence committees all rejected retroactive immunity for the big telecoms .
Only the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence supported retroactive immunity .
Yet because the SSCI version of the FISA reform legislation was the underlying bill , we ’re stuck with RI coming out of the Senate .
Update I :
Feingold ’s amendment 3912 , which would have limited bulk collection , failed 37 - 60 .
Again , by rough count , more than ten Democrats voted with the Republicans to ensure this amendment failed .
I do n’t have the full count yet , Updated with all twelve Dems voting with the GOP .
but here ’s who did vote with the GOP on this one :
Bayh , Carper , Johnson , Mikulski , Ben Nelson , Bill Nelson , Rockefeller , Landrieu , Inouye , Lincoln , Pryor and Webb
Update II :
Bond ’s amendment 3938 , which includes an exception for wiretaps related to WMDs , passed by voice vote .
Update III :
Kagro X at Daily Kos writes of the demise of the Senate .
I quote nearly in full :
In rejecting the Feinstein “ exclusivity ” amendment to the FISA revision considered on the Senate floor today — an amendment that failed by a vote of 57 Ayes to 41 Noes , thanks to another “ painless filibuster ” of precisely the type we were promised would not be tolerated on this bill — the Senate has voted to say that although they were passing a law governing surveillance , it was OK if the President decided that he really did n’t like the law very much and wished to make up his own instead .
Exclusivity — the purpose of the amendment that “ failed ” — meant simply this : that the law they were passing was the law , and it was the governing authority for how surveillance could be conducted in America .
The Senate just rejected it , so that means that they ’re passing a law , but if a president decides later on that he thinks there ’s really some other controlling authority besides the law , that ’s OK .
The original FISA , of course , had exactly such an exclusivity provision in it .
That the new revision of the law will have had that provision explicitly “ rejected ” can mean only one thing : that nobody will know the actual state of “ the law ” on surveillance , because the “ law ” as written might not really be “ the law ” at all .
In fact , it could be something entirely different , and maybe even something you ’ve never heard of — or indeed will never be allowed to hear it , because it ’s top secret .
Or hell , you may not ever hear it because the President will make it up as he goes along .
It wo n’t matter what the reason is , in fact .
All that will matter is that “ the law ” supposedly governing surveillance says that there may or may not be some other authority that really controls .
Maybe .
Maybe not !
Tee hee !
Is n’t “ law ” funny ?
This is a terribly sad day for our country .
Update IV :
The Specter - Whitehouse substitution amendment # 3927 just failed 30 - 68 .
Voting against it were liberal senators like Dodd , Biden , and Murray .
They opposed it because it would have taken the cases pending against the big telecoms and substituted the federal government as the defendant in all of them .
It was a special treatment amendment and had it passed , it would have undermined the rule of law in America .
That said , 31 votes for it were almost all Democrats .
Update V :
Feinstein’s “ good faith ” amendment to move consideration of cases to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts ( #3919 ) failed 41 - 57 . 60 votes were needed for it to pass .
While the Democratic caucus was largely in favor of this , some liberal senators like Dodd and Menendez again voted against it for the special treatment it would have provided the telecoms .
Update VI :
The SSCI bill just passed cloture , 69 - 29 .
In addition to Joe Lieberman , I believe 19 20 Democrats voted in favor of cloture on the SSCI bill .
Here is my currently incomplete the complete list :
Baucus , Conrad , Feinstein , Kohl , Lincoln , Landrieu , Mikulski , Bill Nelson , Pryor , Salazar , Whitehouse , Rockefeller , Inouye , Webb , Casey , Ben Nelson , Carper , Johnson , McCaskill and Bayh .
I ’ll update that list when I have all the names .
I will also be looking closely to see which Democrats vote for cloture but against final passage .
I do n’t see any reason why a Democrat should have voted for cloture and while final passage is a relevant vote , the cloture vote was a lower threshold to stop this bill .
The Senate is taking a break for meetings , but will resume debate post - cloture after 2 PM Eastern .
Senator Dodd is expected to take the floor and talk in opposition to the bill for up to four hours .
The vote on final passage should take place later this afternoon or evening .
Life expectancy declines for women in Southern US counties : a consequence of widening inequality
By Naomi Spencer
24 April 2008
In yet another confirmation of the destructive effects of inequality on working class living standards , a new study documents a significant decline in life expectancy relative to the rising overall average for women in 180 US counties from 1983 to 1999 .
The decline was concentrated overwhelmingly in persistently poor regions of the country .
“ The Reversal of Fortunes : Trends in County Mortality and Cross - County Mortality Disparities in the United States , ” was co-authored by researchers from Harvard , University of California and the University of Washington .
The research , published April 21 , found that life spans have shortened for one in five women in the past three decades , with most deaths attributable to diseases that are preventable through early detection and proper treatment .
By virtually every measure , the health of the poor in the America is worsening .
In spite of being the wealthiest country in the world , the US ranks at or near the bottom among industrialized nations for indices such as infant mortality , cancer rates , and heart disease .
Obesity — a factor strongly associated with heart problems , diabetes , osteoarthritis , respiratory problems and some forms of cancer — now affects a third of the population .
Morbid obesity is most prevalent in the poorest layers of the population , among whom access to lean and fresh foods is limited by income and region and who must instead depend upon cheap , processed and so - called filler foods , heavy in starch and unhealthy fats .
Federal data indicate obesity among both adults and children is worsening .
Rates for fatal staphylococcus infections , autism and Alzheimer ’s disease also continue to increase , in the face of declining medical research funding and soaring health costs .
In recent years , the country has even seen a resurgence of malaria , cholera , tuberculosis , and other ills that plague developing countries .
The number of Americans without health insurance coverage is approaching a fifth of the population , and the frequency of death from entirely preventable and manageable ailments is rising .
At the same time , life expectancy and medical resources available for the most affluent layer of the population continue to improve .
“ The Reversal of Fortunes ” study was published on PLoS Medicine , the peer - reviewed open - access web journal of Public Library of Science .
Drawing upon four decades of National Center for Health Statistics and federal Census Bureau data , researchers found that overall US life expectancy increased from 1961 to 1999 — from 67 to 74 years of age for men , and from 74 to 80 years for women .
The period of 1961 to 1983 saw a decline in the death rate that the study attributes to reduced prevalence of preventable diseases , mostly heart disease and stroke .
The largest gains in life expectancy during this period were seen in the poorest regions of the country , reflecting economic gains and the impact of Civil Rights reforms , the establishment of Medicare and programs associated with the “ war on poverty ” of the 1960s , such as food stamps and the development of regional public health infrastructure in Appalachia .
Beginning in the early 1980s , however , the study noted , “ The worst - off counties no longer experienced a fall in death rates , and in a substantial number of counties , mortality actually increased , especially for women . ”
Between 1983 and 1999 , researchers found life expectancy either stagnated or dropped for 4 percent of men and 19 percent of women .
Both male and female life expectancies had a statistically significant decline ( in 11 and 180 counties , respectively ) , averaging a loss of 1.3 years .
According to the study , “ This stagnation in the worst - off counties was primarily caused by a slowdown or halt in the reduction of deaths from cardiovascular disease coupled with a moderate rise in a number of other diseases , such as lung cancer , chronic lung disease , and diabetes , in both men and women , and a rise in HIV / AIDS and homicide in men . ”
The decline in life expectancy was concentrated overwhelmingly in the Deep South and in counties along the Mississippi River ; in the Appalachian region of Kentucky , West Virginia and Tennessee ; and in the southern portion of the Midwest and into Texas .
From 1983 to 1999 , above - average life expectancy increases also became more concentrated geographically in the Northeast and Pacific Coast regions , following the pattern of wealth concentration .
The lowering life expectancy is greatly related to the decline of decent - paying jobs and social infrastructure , tax cuts for the wealthy and subsequent under- funding of welfare provisions under the Republican Reagan and Bush administrations .
This trend accelerated in the 1990s under the Democratic Clinton administration with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act , which effectively ended welfare as an entitlement program and cut access to public health programs for millions of people .
In nine years following the study ’s focus window , all of the precipitating factors of the lower life expectancy have been intensified .
Social inequality has never been higher , and medical costs consume an increasing proportion of household incomes .
At the same time , employer - paid health insurance programs and millions of decent - paying jobs have been slashed .
Many families are priced out of health care altogether .
In fact , the federal Centers for Disease Control reported in December that over 40 million people — nearly one in every five US adults — needed but did not receive medical care , prescription medicines , mental health care , dental care or eyeglasses in 2007 because they could not afford them .
According to the Census Bureau , 47 million Americans are uninsured , up from 40 million in 2001 ; advocacy group Families USA estimates that nearly 90 million people — nearly a third of the population — were uninsured for at least part of last year .
Well over 50 million other lower - income Americans are dependent upon the government - funded Medicaid program .
Moreover , in the face of declining real wages and rising premiums , co-payments , and deductibles , many others who have insurance are deterred from seeking out early and preventive treatment .
As a result , broad layers of the working class look to medical care as an unaffordable luxury and a last resort .
Diseases such as cancer and heart disease go undetected until they reach more advanced and less curable stages .
According to a 2002 report from the Institute of Medicine , uninsured adults are 25 percent more likely to die prematurely than those with private health insurance , because of the lack of regular preventive care and screenings .
A new , state - by - state analysis of the Institute of Medicine data by Families USA estimated that more than 22,000 adults between the ages of 25 and 64 died because they did not have health insurance .
In Louisiana , for example , Families USA found that two working - age adults died each day — over 4,200 from the years 2000 to 2006 — because they lacked health coverage .
Over that period , 9,900 uninsured New Yorkers died because of lack of health care .
In Texas , an estimated 17,700 died over the period ; on average , more than seven working - age Texans died prematurely each day in 2006 because they had no insurance .
“ Across the United States , in 2006 , twice as many people died from lack of health insurance as died from homicide , ” the study concluded .

This essay originally appeared in the May 1992 issue of The Rothbard - Rockwell Report .
The most fascinating thing about JFK , as exciting and well - done as it is , is not the movie itself but the hysterical attempt to marginalize , if not to suppress it .
How many movies can you remember where the entire Establishment , in serried ranks , from left ( The Nation ) through Center to Right , joined together as one in a frantic orgy of calumny and denunciation .
Time and Newsweek actually doing so before the movie came out ?
Apparently , so fearful was the Establishment that the Oliver Stone movie might prove convincing that the public had to be thoroughly inoculated in advance .
It was a remarkable performance by the media , and it demonstrates , as nothing else , the enormous and growing gap between Respectable Media opinion and what the public Knows in its Heart .
You would think from the shock of the Respectable Media , that Stone ’s JFK was totally outlandish , off - the - wall , monstrous and fanciful in its accusations against the American power structure .
And you would think that historical films never engaged in dramatic license , as if such solemnly hailed garbage as Wilson and Sunrise at Campobello had been models of scholarly precision .
Hey , come off it guys !

Despite the fuss and feathers , to veteran Kennedy Assassination buffs , there was nothing new in JFK .
What Stone does is to summarize admirably the best of a veritable industry of assassination revisionism  of literally scores of books , articles , tapes , annual conventions , and archival research .
Stone himself is quite knowledgeable in the area , as shown by his devastating answer in the Washington Post , to the smears of the last surviving Warren Commission member , Gerald Ford , and the old Commission hack , David W. Belin .
Despite the smears in the press , there was nothing outlandish in the movie .
Interestingly enough , JFK has been lambasted much more furiously than was the first revisionist movie , Don Freed ’s Executive Action ( 1973 ) , an exciting film with Robert Ryan and Will Geer , which actually did go way beyond the evidence , and beyond plausibility , by trying to make an H.L.
Hunt figure the main conspirator .
Deep Politics and the ... Scott , Peter Dale Best Price : $ 4.76 Buy New $ 26.14 ( as of 12:35 EST - Details )
The evidence is now overwhelming that the orthodox Warren legend , that Oswald did it and did it alone , is pure fabrication .
It now seems clear that Kennedy died in a classic military triangulation hit , that , as Parkland Memorial autopsy pathologist Dr. Charles Crenshaw has very recently affirmed , the fatal shots were fired from in front , from the grassy knoll , and that the conspirators were , at the very least , the right - wing of the CIA , joined by its long - time associates and employees , the Mafia .
It is less well established that President Johnson himself was in on the original hit , though he obviously conducted the coordinated cover - up , but certainly his involvement is highly plausible .
The last - ditch defenders of the Warren view cannot refute the details , so they always fall back on generalized vaporings , such as : “ How could all the government be in on it ? ”
But since Watergate , we have all become familiar with the basic fact : only a few key people need be in on the original crime , while lots of high and low government officials can be in on the subsequent cover - up , which can always be justified as “ patriotic , ” on “ national security ” grounds , or simply because the president ordered it .
The fact that the highest levels of the U.S. government are all - too capable of lying to the public , should have been clear since Watergate and Iran - Contra .
The final fallback argument , getting less plausible all the time is : if the Warren case is n’t true , why has n’t the truth come out by this time ?
The fact is , however , that the truth has largely come out , in the assassination industry , from books  some of them best - sellers  by Mark Lane , David Lifton , Peter Dale Scott , Jim Marrs , and many others , but the Respectable Media pay no attention .
With that sort of mindset , that stubborn refusal to face reality , no truth can ever come out .
And yet , despite this blackout , because books , local TV and radio , magazine articles , supermarket tabloids , etc. ca n’t be suppressed  but only ignored  by the Respectable Media , we have the remarkable result that the great majority of the public , in all the polls , strongly disbelieve the Warren legend .
Hence , the frantic attempts of the Establishment to suppress as gripping and convincing a film as Stone ’s JFK .
Conservatives , as well as centrists , are smearing JFK because Stone is a notorious leftist .
Well , so what ?
It is not simply that the ideology of the teller has no logical bearing on the truth of the tale .
The case is stronger than that .
For in a day when the Moderate Left to Moderate Right constitute an increasingly monolithic Establishment , with only nuanced variations among them , we can only get the truth from people outside the Establishment , either on the far right or far left , or even from the highly non-respectable supermarket tabloids .
And it is no accident that it is an open secret that the heroic “ Deep Throat ” figure in JFK is Colonel Fletcher Prouty , who is certainly no leftist .
And one of the outstanding Revisionist writers is the long - time libertarian Carl Oglesby .

One particularly welcome aspect of JFK , by the way , is its making Jim Garrison the central heroic figure .
Garrison , one of the most viciously smeared figures in modern political history , was simply a district attorney trying to do his job in the most important criminal case of our time .
Kevin Costner ’s expressionless style fits in well with the Garrison role , and Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding as the evil CIA - businessman conspirator Clay Shaw .

All in all , a fine movie , for the history as well as the cinematics .
There are some minor problems .
It is unfortunate that the founding Kennedy Revisionist , Mark Lane , felt that he had to leave the movie - making early , with the result that the film does not bring out the crucial testimony of Cuban ex-CIA agent Marita Lorenz , who has identified right - wing CIA operative E. Howard Hunt , Bill Buckley ’s pal and control in the CIA , as paymaster for the assassination .
( See the brilliant new book by Lane , Plausible Denial . )
According to Lane , heat from the CIA during the filming led Stone to underplay the CIA ’s role by spreading the blame a little too thickly to the rest of the Johnson administration .
As the case for revisionism piles up , there is evidence that some of the more sophisticated members of the Establishment are preparing to jettison the Warren legend , and fall back on an explanation less threatening than blaming E. Howard Hunt or the CIA : that is to lay blame solely on the Mafia , specifically on Sam Giancana , Johnny Roselli , and Jimmy Hoffa , none of whom are around to debate the issue .
A convincing attack on the Mafia - only thesis was leveled by Carl Oglesby in his Afterward to Jim Garrison ’s book of a few years back ( which formed one of the bases for JFK )
On the Trail of the Assassins .
The Mafia simply did not have the resources , for example , to change the route or call off military or Secret Service protection .
Many conservatives and libertarians will surely be irritated by one theme of the film : the old - fashioned view of Kennedy as the shining young prince of Camelot , the great hero about to redeem America who was chopped down in his prime by dark reactionary forces .
That sort of attitude has long been discredited by a very different kind of Revisionism  as tales have come out about the sleazy Kennedy brothers , Judith Exner , Sam Giancana , Marilyn Monroe , et al .
Well , OK , but look at it this way : a president was murdered , for heaven ’s sake , and good , bad , or indifferent , it is surely vital to get to the bottom of the conspiracy , and bring the villains to justice , if only at the bar of history .
Let the chips fall where they may .
One happy result of the film was the conclusive Stoneian argument : if everything is on the up and up , why not open up all the secret government files on the assassination ?
It looks as if the pressure for opening will win out , but once again , phony “ national security ” will prevail , so we wo n’t get the really incriminating stuff .
And some of the crucial material is long gone , e.g. , the famed Kennedy brain , which mysteriously never made it into the National Archives .

Family blames military 's punishment of suicidal soldier for death David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008

This CNN reported on the case of a soldier who killed himself while serving in Iraq , in what his parents blame on a failure of military oversight .
When Pfc Jason Scheuerman was first recommended by his company chaplain for psychiatric help in June 2005 , he was punished instead , accused of faking his problems , and cut off from phone and email contact with his family .
" The last thing you do to someone who is suicidal is cut off their support group , " stated his father .
Three weeks after that , Jason was punished again and was told by his first sergeant that he might face a court martial and the risk of being sodomized in prison .
He stepped into the barracks closet and shot himself less than an hour later .
It was just two months after his 20th birthday .
The Army did not immediately tell Scheuerman 's parents that he had died by his own hand , saying that the death was still being investigated .
Even after acknowledging it had been a suicide , the Army denied there was a suicide note .
However , over a year later , the parents were sent a note as part of a packet of hundreds of documents they had requested under the Freedom of Information Act .
" Maybe finally I can get rid of these demons , " Jason wrote .
" Maybe finally I can get some peace . "
" It breaks my heart , because he was reaching out for help , " his mother commented .
Jason 's father , Chris Scheuerman is a retired Special Forces commando who still teaches at Fort Bragg , and Jason spent his early years on military posts .
His mother also served in the Army , and one of his two brothers is currently serving in Afghanistan .
The Army has refused to answer questions about why Jason -- who had indicated that he suffered from depression and feelings of hopelessness , had repeatedly been seen putting a rifle in his mouth , and had been recommended twice for psychological treatment -- was punished instead of being taken out of combat .
Chris Scheuerman said that he initially trusted the Army to do the right thing .
" I did not want to believe that it was as bad as I thought it was , so I chose not to make hasty judgments , " he stated .
" I chose to systematically try to get all the information that I could and once I received all the information I could , my worse fears were realized . "
The Army 's own investigations concluded there were no signs of negligence , merely a lack of communication .
Scheuerman is angry that no one has been held accountable for his son's death .
" It 's hard , " he told CNN , fighting back tears .
Scheuerman told a House Armed Services Committee subcommittee last month that the military would have made Jason pay for a second psychiatric evaluation after the first psychologist concluded he was faking .
He recommended that the military set up a suicide prevention hotline and investigate common factors in military suicides .

To demonstrate why using fingerprints to secure passports is a bad idea , the German hacker group Chaos Computer Club has published what it says is the fingerprint of Wolfgang Schauble , Germany 's interior minister .
According to CCC , the print of Schauble 's index finger was lifted from a water glass that he used during a panel discussion that he participated in last year at a German university .
CCC published the print on a piece of plastic inside 4,000 copies of its magazine Die Datenschleuder that readers can use to impersonate the minister to biometric readers .
Several years ago the CCC published a guide to lifting and reproducing fingerprints .
Schauble is a big proponent of the use of fingerprints in passports but is not the CCC 's only target .
The group has called for help in obtaining the prints of other German officials , including Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The CCC 's publication of the fingerprint coincides this week with the presentation of a security researcher who demonstrated a biometric keylogger that can capture digital fingerprints and other digital biometric data as its transmitted from a scanning device to the server where the information is processed .
The hacker can then analyze and re-use the data to subvert biometric systems and gain entry to secured buildings .
Matt Lewis , a researcher with British - based Information Risk Management , demonstrated his Biologger tool at the Black Hat security conference in Amsterdam but said the easy part is intercepting the data – the hard part is getting the biologger onto a network .

At a hearing yesterday before the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs , anti-child porn activists urged the Senators to increase the FBI 's budget for combating child porn online and to move forward with plans to create a next - generation network monitoring and database system that can ferret out child porn trafficking on P2P networks , web sites , and chat rooms .
The new system would be hosted on the FBI 's Regional Information Sharing Systems ( RISS ) network and would give more law enforcement agents across the country access to an existing system , based in Wyoming , that 's currently being used to find and catch online child porn traffickers .
Congress would also expand and better fund the current Wyoming system , called Operation FairPlay , consolidating it in a newly - created National Internet Crimes Against Children Data Network Center .
In arguing for the funding and the upgrade , Grier Weeks , executive director of the National Association to Protect Children , briefly recapped for the senators the history of the Canadian Child Exploitation Tracking System ( CETS ) , a suite of network monitoring , database , information management , and collaboration tools that Microsoft developed and funded to the tune of $ 7 million .
In 2003 , Microsoft deployed the system in Canada and offered it to the US Department of Justice , which turned it down because it was then locked in a bitter anti-trust dispute with the software maker .
US law enforcement was left to roll its own answer to CETS , and Wyoming 's Internet Crimes Against Children ( ICAC ) task force stepped up with Operation FairPlay , a system developed by task force chief Flint Waters and housed in Wyoming 's ICAC headquarters .
FairPlay can monitor and map illicit file sharing activity on popular P2P networks , web sites , and chat rooms , and has become a key tool for law enforcement in the two years that it has been in use .
The FBI 's six RISS divisions
Special Agent Flint Waters described parts of the system to the subcommittee , and CNet 's Anne Broache was there to capture some of the details .
The system appears to rely heavily on filenames for targeting users for additional levels of scrutiny , but Waters declined to give too many details of how it positively identifies specific users who are engaged in illicit activity .
Waters ' comments , which refer to 624,932 " unique serial numbers " that are tied to specific suspects ' computers for long - term tracking , make it difficult to discern just how accurate and invasive the system is .
The agent would n't disclose much of anything about these " serial numbers , " either how they 're obtained or what they represent .
Recent revelations about the FBI 's honeypot scheme for catching possible child porn traders do give some cause for concern over the lack of detail on how the system works , a concern that 's only likely to grow as the system itself grows .
There 's no doubt that child exploitation ruins lives , but so could the high number of false positives associated with computer - automated surveillance and tracking systems , especially when combined with aggressive prosecution and the overall technical ignorance of CSI - watching juries .
Weeks urged the subcommittee to pass the Combating Child Exploitation Act , which is the Senate version of the bill that would provide the new funding and other resources for combating online child porn .
The bill would also consolidate control of the ICAC at the federal level with the creation of an ICAC task force within the DoJ itself , and it would call on the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction — a sort of national child exploitation czar .
The bill 's main sponsor is Senator Joe Biden ( D ) of Delaware .
Biden praised Operation FairPlay to the subcommittee and urged the bill 's passage .

The flow of blood may be ebbing , but the flood of money into the Iraq war is steadily rising , new analyses show .
In 2008 , its sixth year , the war will cost approximately $ 12 billion a month , triple the " burn " rate of its earliest years , Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz and co-author Linda J. Bilmes report in a new book .
Beyond 2008 , working with " best- case " and " realistic - moderate " scenarios , they project the Iraq and Afghan wars , including long - term U.S. military occupations of those countries , will cost the U.S. budget between $ 1.7 trillion and $ 2.7 trillion — or more — by 2017 .
Interest on money borrowed to pay those costs could alone add $ 816 billion to that bottom line , they say .
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) has done its own projections and comes in lower , forecasting a cumulative cost by 2017 of $ 1.2 trillion to $ 1.7 trillion for the two wars , with Iraq generally accounting for three - quarters of the costs .
Variations in such estimates stem from the sliding scales of assumptions , scenarios and budget items that are counted .
But whatever the estimate , the cost will be huge , the auditors of the Government Accountability Office say .
In a Jan. 30 report to Congress , the GAO observed that the U.S. will be committing " significant " future resources to the wars , " requiring decision makers to consider difficult trade - offs as the nation faces an increasing long - range fiscal challenge . "
These numbers do n't include the war 's cost to the rest of the world .
In Iraq itself , the 2003 U.S. - led invasion — with its devastating air bombardments — and the looting and arson that followed , severely damaged electricity and other utilities , the oil industry , countless factories , hospitals , schools and other underpinnings of an economy .
No one has tried to calculate the economic damage done to Iraq , said spokesman Niels Buenemann of the International Monetary Fund , which closely tracks national economies .
But millions of Iraqis have been left without jobs , and hundreds of thousands of professionals , managers and other middle - class citizens have fled the country .
In their book , The Three Trillion Dollar War , Stiglitz , of Columbia University , and Bilmes , of Harvard , report the two wars will have cost the U.S. budget $ 845 billion in 2007 dollars by next Sept. 30 , end of fiscal year 2008 , assuming Congress fully funds Bush administration requests .
That counts not just military operations , but embassy costs , reconstruction and other war - related expenses .
That total far surpasses the $ 670 billion in 2007 dollars the Congressional Research Service says was the U.S. price tag for the 12 - year Vietnam War .
Although American military and Iraqi civilian casualties have declined in recent months , the rate of spending has shot up .
A fully funded 2008 war budget will be 155 % higher than 2004's , the CBO reports .
The reasons are numerous : the " surge " of additional U.S. units into Iraq ; rising fuel costs ; fattened bonuses to attract re-enlistments ; and particularly the need to " reset , " that is , repair or replace worn - out , destroyed or damaged military equipment .
Almost $ 17 billion is appropriated this year for advanced armored vehicles to protect troops against roadside bombs .
Looking ahead , both the CBO and Stiglitz - Bilmes construct two scenarios , one in which U.S. troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan drop sharply and early — to 30,000 by late 2009 for the CBO , and to 55,000 by 2012 for Stiglitz - Bilmes — and a second in which the drawdown is more gradual .
Significantly , the two studies view different time frames , the CBO calculating possible costs met in the next 10 years , while Stiglitz and Bilmes also include costs incurred during that period but paid for later , such as equipment replaced in post -2017 budgets .
This factor figures most in the category of veterans ' medical care and disability payments , where the CBO foresees $ 9 billion to $ 13 billion in costs by 2017 .
Stiglitz and Bilmes , meanwhile , project $ 422 billion to $ 717 billion in costs over the lifetime of soldiers who by 2017 are wounded or otherwise mentally or physically disabled by the wars .
" The CBO is only looking 10 years out on everything , " Bilmes noted in an interview .
For its part , a CBO critique suggested that Bilmes and Stiglitz might be overstating the expense of treating veterans ' brain injuries , a costly category .
The two economists say their calculations are conservative , because they do n't encompass many " hidden " items in the U.S. budget .
Their basic projections also exclude the potentially huge debt - service cost — on which CBO approximately agrees — and the cost to the U.S. economy of global oil prices that have quadrupled since 2003 , an increase analysts blame partly on the Iraq upheaval .
Estimating all economic and social costs might push the U.S. war bill up toward $ 5 trillion by 2017 , they say .
Their book already figures in the stay - or - leave debate over Iraq .
When Stiglitz testified on Feb. 28 before the congressional Joint Economic Committee , the ranking Republican , New Jersey 's Rep. Jim Saxton , complained that such projections are too imprecise to help determine relative costs and benefits of the Iraq war .
Saxton said a rapid U.S. pullout could lead to full - scale civil war and Iranian domination of Iraq , " enormous costs " that he said should be weighed in any calculation .

Reading some of today ’s news , it suddenly struck me : we ’re living in the age of the anti-Cassandra .
Cassandra had the gift of prophecy — she saw , correctly , what was coming — but was under a curse : nobody would believe her .
Today , our public discourse is dominated by people who have been wrong about everything — but are still , mysteriously , treated as men of wisdom , whose judgments should be believed .
Those who were actually right about the major issues of the day ca n’t get a word in edgewise .
What set me off was the matter of Alan Greenspan ; as Dean Baker like to remind us , news analyses of the housing and financial crisis almost always draw exclusively on “ experts ” who first insisted that there was n’t a housing bubble , then insisted that the financial consequences of the bubble ’s bursting would remain “ contained . ”
It ’s even worse , of course , on the matter of Iraq : just about every one of the panels convened to discuss the lessons of five disastrous years consisted solely of men and women who cheered the idiocy on .
Now , none of this is entirely new .
Consider what Keynes said in 1931 :
A sound banker , alas , is not one who foresees danger and avoids it , but one who , when he is ruined , is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows , so that no one can really blame him .
Still , it seems especially extreme now .
And think of the incentive effects .
What ’s the point of taking the risk of challenging conventional wisdom if , even after you ’re proved right , only the guys who were wrong get invited to opine on Charlie Rose ?

Ask Americans what made our country great and they will say , without hesitation , that liberty is our touchstone .
Yet ask Americans what their government should do for them and the answer can be boiled down simply to this : " Control , tax , and regulate my neighbors . "
Americans want liberty for themselves , but they want something very different for others .
This is why it has been a struggle to keep liberty as the foundation of our society .
Liberty requires respect for the personal choices that others make .
In the long run , our liberties cannot be maintained if we violate the liberties of others .
In trying to control others , we will eventually find ourselves controlled .
Taking our neighbors ' liberties results in the loss of our own .
Let 's take the Drug War , for example .
When we take away our neighbors liberty , because they like to use substances we consider to be harmful , we expose ourselves to harm .
Close to one - half of all murders in this country result from the prohibition of drugs .
Turf wars between gangs result in the death of many innocent victims .
The exorbitant black market prices mean that more people steal to fund their habit .
Thus , we are twice as likely to die from a mugging when drugs are illegal than when we are not .
Our children are also put at risk .
The high black - market profit margin in illegal drugs guarantees that pushers will haunt our schools , addicting our youth .
Even though alcohol and tobacco are illegal for minors , the average student finds it easier to buy an assortment of chemical highs at school than drinks or smokes .
The War on Drugs has painted targets on the backs of our young people .
The economic costs of the Drug War are staggering as well .
Half of our police , court , and prison resources are devoted to tracking , arresting , and jailing people whose only crime is an attempt to be happy .
Our military are deployed overseas to burn hemp fields and to prevent the cultivation of opium .
We have fueled anti-American sentiment and strengthened the hand of Latin American authoritarian regimes by funding their half - hearted cocaine eradication efforts .
We pay these costs with high taxes and more inflation , resulting in recession and job destruction .
As a result , our very livelihood may be lost .
The standard of living that would otherwise have been ours is no longer possible .
I could go on , but I 'm sure you get the picture .
Taking liberty from another has dire consequences for us .
The blowback can cost us our standard of living , our jobs , our children , and our very lives .
Consequently , I cringe when some well - meaning individuals , even those who call themselves libertarian , insist that society is better off when we deprive a select few of liberty .
They just do n't understand .
Our rights are intertwined .
When we deprive someone of their liberty our own is sure to be compromised .
It 's just a matter of time .
To be for liberty , you must be for it consistently , respecting the lives of others in all matters .
You can not make an exception for the War on Terror .
You can not make an exception for the War on Poverty .
You can not make an exception for the War on Drugs .
You can not make an exception for gays or prostitutes .
You can't let bureaucrats deny dying patients life - saving medicine just because the FDA has n't yet approved it .
You can't take another 's money or land and give it to another .
Liberty is indivisible .
It 's the one thing we can't have unless we are willing to give it others .
If someone tells you differently , they just do n't know how the world really works .
Make sure that you do n't vote them into power .
The liberty you save may be your own !

The Best of Mary Ruwart
Suppose that you want to find the value of the first argument to the function that called your caller .
While the inspect module documents the types involved , it does n't really explain what the members are ; here 's what I 've worked out .
Start with a frame , for example from calling inspect.currentframe( ) to get your own frame and then backing up a couple of frames to your caller 's caller via f_back .
The values of all of the function 's local variables are in f_locals , a name to value dictionary , but that does n't tell you which ones are the function arguments and which are ordinary local variables .
For that you need to go to the function 's code object via f_code .
The names of all the function 's local variables are in the co_varnames tuple , in the order that they occur ; this puts the function arguments at the front .
How many function arguments there are is co_argcount ; this includes keyword arguments but not * args or ** kwargs stuff .
( There is a complicated naming scheme to handle nested arguments that I am not going to get into here .
If you need to care , you should use the functions in the inspect module . )
So let 's put all that together and write a function the returns true if its caller 's caller had a given first argument ( ignoring nested arguments and so on ) :
import inspect
def isfirstarg ( obj ) : fr = inspect.currentframe( ) try : fr = fr.f_back .f_back if fr is None : return
False if not fr.f_locals : return False fl = fr.f_locals fc = fr.f_code if fc.co_argcount < 1 : return False fa = fl[fc.co_varnames [0 ] ] return bool ( fa is obj ) finally : del fr
Can you use this to solve the mixin over - tracing problem ?
Probably not ; there are any number of plausible functions that take an object as their first argument , despite not being methods .
If you assume your code follows conventions , you can avoid false positives by making isfirstarg ( ) also check that the name of the first argument is ' self '.
( As before , all of this is probably CPython specific , especially since a bunch of this is intimately tied to the CPython bytecode format . )

One morning last August in San Francisco , six women in pink sweaters marched up a hilly boulevard towing pink roller bags full of shoes .
They unzipped the bags in front of Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi ’s house , dumped the shoes on her lawn , and went on to arrange loafers , pumps , and pink glittery sandals like hawkers at a yard sale .
Anchoring their display was a pair of combat boots , placed on Pelosi ’s doorstep .
The boots , like the other shoes , had been pulled from a dead body in Iraq — the body of Casey Sheehan , in fact , whose mother , Cindy , is running as an Independent against Pelosi for Congress .
These women believe Cindy Sheehan could succeed where their anti-war group , Code Pink , has failed .
Pelosi has refused to meet Code Pink ’s demand that she end the war in Iraq by procedural fiat :
As Speaker , Pelosi has the power to prevent votes on war funding bills , and could demand that any legislation contain a timetable for withdrawing the troops .
“ Pelosi crosses us out ; she wo n’t even meet with us , ” Code Pink cofounder Medea Benjamin said as she hunched on the House Speaker ’s curb .
“ So it takes somebody like Cindy to counteract the pressure from other [ less emphatically antiwar ] Democrats ” by challenging her at the polls .
More mainstream progressives within the Party would prefer to oppose the war on their own terms , which is to say , carefully .
The lefty bloggers who first publicized Sheehan ’s anti-war sit - in outside Bush ’s ranch in 2005 now overwhelmingly oppose her independent race as a distraction from their goal of forging a coalition to retake the White House .
“ I feel that working within the Democratic Party is really the only way progressives can operate without sort of turning into just reverse Joe Liebermans , ” Democratic blogger Chris Bowers told me .
The race has hastened a clash between Netizens like Bowers , who prefer to wait patiently for the other shoe to drop in November , and the traditionally impatient anti-war movement , which has flirted with outsiders such as the People ’s Party and Green Party ever since the war in Vietnam .
The schism over Sheehan has sent cracks high into the ivory towers of liberal consensus .
While some contributors to The Nation have supported her candidacy , for example , the magazine ’s columnist Katha Pollitt wrote a scathing blog post last August in which she predicted it would diminish Sheehan ’s cachet as an activist ( even though by last spring Sheehan already had renounced her role as the face of the American anti-war movement ) .
The New Guard is joined by politicos of the Old Left who ’ve come to believe that the Democratic Party ca n’t be herded by nipping at its shoelaces from the sidelines .
John Burton , U.S. Congressman and president pro-tempore of the California Senate , said he ’s learned a lot about races such as Sheehan ’s since the ’60s .
“ It ’s gonna be horseshit , ” he said , “ and it ’s gonna be negligible . ”
That Sheehan has the support of a cadre of proudly negligible political operatives may only seal her fate in the eyes of detractors .
Ralph Nader — who this week launched an exploratory website for yet another presidential bid — told me that running against Pelosi is “ a very important thing for Cindy Sheehan to do . ”
Moreover , Nader ’s acolytes in the Sheehan campaign have done little to dispel their image as actors who wandered out of the movie Hairspray .
At an anti-war vigil in San Francisco ’s business district last July , Sheehan supporter Renay Davis wore pink costume earrings , donned a pink crown , and waved a pink wand .
Unlike Pelosi , Sheehan is “ not a rich , establishment type of person , ” she was saying , but was cut short when a Code Pink comrade stepped in to offer a customized “ Impeach mint . ”
The unbridled goofiness of Sheehan ’s supporters plays well , however , in a city that is poorly understood by the campaign ’s detractors .
San Francisco Green Party candidate Matt Gonzalez won 47 percent of the vote in a 2003 mayoral runoff against a charismatic Democrat .
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted overwhelmingly in 2006 to impeach the president .
And last year ’s mayoral bid of performance artist Chicken John was front page news .
Here politics is theater , and ballot returns are only slightly more important than the strength of applause .
Just because San Franciscans probably wo n’t boot the Speaker of the House does n’t mean they wo n’t relish Sheehan ’s narrative .
“ Pelosi has to be careful in how she responds to this , ” says veteran San Francisco political consultant Richard DeLeon .
“ She has to address her own constituency and deal with these kinds of issues in a way that at least tells them that she is listening , that she cares , that she can understand how this kind of challenge might come about . ”
Understanding Sheehan ’s run requires understanding Code Pink , which was founded in 2002 in San Francisco and whose members have worked closely with the peace mom since her first days in Crawford , Texas .
In 2000 , Code Pink ’s Benjamin ran for U.S. Senate as a Green against Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein , earning 3 percent of the vote statewide , but 25 percent in San Francisco ’s liberal Mission District .
She leveraged her progressive cred into the anti-war group and in 2003 earned a meeting with Hillary Clinton .
When the senator refused to pledge opposition to the Iraq war , Code Pink activists outraged Clinton by shoving at her a rumpled pink slip .
“ People in Washington called me and said I ’ll never eat lunch in this town again , ” recalls Code Pink co-founder Jodie Evans .
So instead Code Pink has noshed on politicians .
When Benjamin herself considered running against Pelosi two years ago , for example , the congresswoman fired off a strongly worded press release against the war , Benjamin says .
The perceived victory helped inspire Code Pink to pitch “ Camp Pelosi ” outside the Speaker ’s mansion .
If Pelosi caved once , the thinking went , she ’d do it again .
Since then , however , Sheehan has achieved little more than a tense stand - off with the Speaker , who has come under increasing fire from critics on the left .
In December the Washington Post reported that Pelosi and three other members of Congress were briefed in 2002 on the CIA ’s overseas detention sites and interrogation techniques such as waterboarding but did n’t object at the time ( Democrats later would condemn waterboarding as torture ) .
Sheehan responded to the news report by calling for Pelosi to be stripped of her leadership post .
“ I was appalled and really saddened , ” Sheehan told me .
“ We ca n’t be represented by a person like this . ”
Sheehan ’s increasingly harsh tone toward Pelosi might end up doing her campaign and movement more harm than good , some political experts say .
“ To the degree that people like Cindy Sheehan make the argument about the split among people against the war , they are hurting the cause , ” says Georgetown professor Michael Kazin , an expert on the history of the Left .
“ If the media is spending a lot of time reporting on how people against the war disagree with each other about tactics , that ’s a diversion from making arguments about how terrible the war is .
You want to unite as much as possible around common goals and a common offensive position against your opponent . ”
And yet Sheehan sees little option but to attack Pelosi head - on .
“ I ’m not running a negative campaign , ” she says , “ I ’m just pointing out what Nancy Pelosi does .
We have to run on her record , and it ’s not a good record . ”
In a city that has always helped set the Democratic agenda , Sheehan hopes her campaign will create a stronger sense of urgency about ending the war immediately .
San Francisco could become a launching pad for forwarding that position should Democrats take the White House or a larger share of Congress .
In early August , Sheehan held her first campaign meeting in a San Francisco restaurant .
Speaking to a crowd that included Daniel Ellsberg , who helped end the Vietnam War by releasing the Pentagon Papers ; assorted activists pimpled in campaign buttons ; and a man who pioneered using bodies to spell the word “ Impeach ” on California beaches , she marveled at the offers of money and volunteers that she ’d never received in her days as an activist .
“ I think that ’s great , ” she said , as if the crowd needed to be told , “ because this is n’t going to be a normal political campaign . ”
And so far , it has n’t been .
Sheehan has reached out to black leaders in the gentrifying Bayview neighborhood , an area she calls “ traditionally practically ignored in elections ” while also pressing her cause on the global stage , visiting Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria last summer and planning a trip to Egypt this month to attend a terrorism trial with human rights implications .
It ’s all relevant to her race in San Francisco , she insists .
“ I think that ’s what our campaign is trying to do — just connect all these dots . ”
Proprietary innovations by browser vendors are nothing new .
Internet Explorer alone has given us XMLHttpRequest , innerHTML , and colored scrollbars .
In each instance , we were free to use or ignore these non-standard extensions .
Now Internet Explorer is introducing a new proprietary technology in the shape of version targeting .
But this time , the only way to opt out of using the technology is , perversely , to use it .

Ball of confusion #section2
When I first read about version targeting here in the hallowed pages of A List Apart , one point confused me .
At the end of Eric ’s heartfelt article detailing his reaction to the proposal , the final section seemed to suggest that IE 8 would , by default , behave identically to IE7 .
“ That ca n’t be right , ” I thought .
Surely I was misreading Eric ’s words .
To clarify the situation , I asked Chris Wilson what would happen if IE8 were to encounter a valid , well - formed document with a strict DOCTYPE .
My worst fears were realized when he confirmed that the browser would behave exactly as if it were its predecessor .
This is gobsmackingly audacious .
Imagine a new version of Word that behaves exactly like the old version of Word unless the document it is processing contains a hidden instruction to unlock any new features .
That ’s what Microsoft is demanding that web developers implement .
Unless you explicitly say otherwise , IE8 ( and IE9 and IE10 , ad infinitum ) will behave exactly like IE7 .
My incredulity could n’t be assuaged by the obvious explanations for this behavior — that Microsoft was being stupid or “ evil . ”
The Internet Explorer team is made up of good standards - savvy developers .
They must have a good reason for proposing a solution which , on the face of it , appears so crazy .
Destroying the web to save it #section3
Microsoft ’s proposal was triggered by a traumatic event : the upgrade from IE6 to IE7 .
Internet Explorer 6 languished in the doldrums of non-development for many years .
Eventually , spurred on by the encroaching market share of rival browsers , Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7 sporting far better CSS support than the previous version .
Because IE6 stagnated for so many years and because it remained the market leader , a whole generation of websites had emerged that were coded to the quirky but predictable vagaries of that browser .
These websites appeared to “ work . ”
That is , they looked fine in the most popular browser on the market .
But when IE7 was released , these websites were inevitably rendered differently .
IE7 , with its improved support for Web Standards , rendered these sites in much the same way as any other standards - compliant browser .
Despite a concerted campaign to encourage developers to use conditional comments instead of browser - specific hacks , Microsoft received a barrage of complaints from website owners upset at the way that IE7 had changed the game .
This is what the Internet Explorer team are referring to when they talk about “ breaking the web . ”
That ’s a loaded phrase that does n’t stand up to closer scrutiny .
Firstly , what ’s at issue here is not “ the web ” but “ some websites ” .
Secondly , rather than “ breaking ” , it ’s more accurate to say “ displaying differently . ”
Finally , it ’s important to remember that we are talking about how websites are displayed in one browser : when the IE team talk of “ breaking the web , ” what they really mean is that their browser will display documents in much the same way as other modern browsers do .
Would that really be such a bad thing ?
Wo n’t somebody think of the children ?
#section4
On the face of it , being the market leader is something to aspire to .
But think of how much responsibility that entails .
Would you really want to innovate and push the boundaries when even the smallest changes could cause disruption for thousands of your customers ?
This is exactly the kind of paralysis that Microsoft is trying to break out of .
The version targeting proposal is a good solution to this deadlock .
With the addition of one meta element , websites can specify exactly how they should be rendered ( in one browser ) .
Furthermore , had Microsoft implemented the X - UA - compatible instruction in IE7 , they could have saved themselves a whole mess of trouble .
Instead of requiring developers to revisit their style sheets and strip out their browser - specific hacks , they could have instead told website owners to simply add one line to the head of their documents .
While it ’s hard to imagine that the move from IE7 to IE8 will cause the same upheaval , it ’s reassuring to know that Microsoft has thought ahead .
Version targeting allows site owners to freeze rendering ( for one browser ) to a specified browser version .
That ’s a good thing .
While it probably wo n’t affect standards - savvy developers like you or me , it offers a simple solution for site owners who do n’t want to worry about the future .
Better still , the fact that the X - UA - compatible instruction can be sent as a header means that this issue can be taken care of by sysadmins with one small tweak to their server configurations .
But even that is asking too much , according to Microsoft .
Instead of asking that developers who want to opt out of future improvements do so with the addition of a meta element or header , Internet Explorer expects standards - savvy developers to actively opt out of version targeting … by using version targeting .
The reasoning here is that less savvy developers should n’t have to worry their little heads about adding one extra line to their documents .
Instead , they should be encouraged to continue to write to the quirks of one specific browser version from the market leader .
That their documents will “ break ” in other browsers is not Microsoft ’s problem .
The counterpoint to this condescending worldview is that standards - aware developers are the ones best placed to add a single line of markup to their documents — though , for some unexplained reason , the instruction for up - to - date rendering ( IE=edge ) is strongly discouraged .
This strategy is doomed to failure .
Standards - aware developers , by their very nature , will object to adding a line of unnecessary markup to their documents just to get one single browser to behave as it should by default .
Fear of drowning #section5
While most of the web development community saw the release of IE7 as a welcome return to form , within the corridors of Redmond it was viewed as a failure .
Microsoft simply cannot afford a repeat of the IE7 upgrade .
Version targeting is a technology born of fear .
A fear of “ breaking the web ” — which really means “ rendering some websites differently in one browser ” — has prompted the draconian default behavior .
Whether this fear is well - founded or not depends on just how drastically IE8 is going to “ break ” existing websites .
Personally , I ’m rather puzzled : what exactly are they planning to add in the next version of their browser to make the web asplode ?
If IE8 is going to differentiate itself from its predecessor by having better standards support , then surely we can assess how it will render websites by simply viewing those websites in a standards - compliant browser like , say , Firefox , Safari or Opera .
Lonely at the top#section6
There was a time when Friendster was the biggest social networking site on the web — MySpace and Facebook were little more than distance glimmers on the horizon .
There was a time when Netscape Navigator was the undisputed king of browsers and Internet Explorer was laughable challenger playing catch - up .
On the World Wide Web , the status quo is a mutable , shifting thing .
The proposed default behavior for version targeting is predicated on events that took place during a short span of years when Microsoft , having emerged as the top dog , pulled the plug on its own browser .
There is an unspoken assumption that the only meaningful way the web is experienced is through one browser : Internet Explorer .
We are being told that the default version targeting behavior is necessary because without it , the web will turn into a messy crime scene of breakage ( in one browser ) .
If Microsoft are to be believed , the self - crippling default behavior of IE8 + is necessary to save the web ( in one browser ) .
Whether you agree or disagree with the default behavior comes down to faith : faith in Microsoft accurately foretelling the impact that IE8 will have .
I would much rather base my judgement on facts .
There is an easy way for Microsoft to prove the necessity of mandatory version targeting : release a beta version of IE8 with version targeting disabled by default .
Then we can see just how badly the web breaks some websites render differently in one browser .
I ’ve listened to and understood all of the arguments in favor of the proposed default behavior : all of them assume that without self - crippling , IE8 will make a mess of a significant portion of the web .
If that fear is borne out by an uncrippled beta release of the browser , I will back the proposed default behavior .
Until then , I ask that Microsoft honor their promise from many years ago and allow their browser to render a valid , well - formed document with a current DOCTYPE to the best of its abilities .
Future imperfect#section7
Version targeting is not a bad idea .
The choice of delivery mechanisms — meta element or server header — is inspired .
As an optional feature , this could prove to be a real lifesaver in some development environments .
As a mandatory millstone however , it strikes a blow against progressive enhancement . [ 1 ]
The proposed default behavior for version targeting in Internet Explorer solves the problem of “ breaking the web ” in much the same way that decapitation solves the problem of headaches .
In its current state , version targeting is a cure that will kill the patient .
Version targeting could have been an opportunity for Microsoft to demonstrate innovation .
Instead , the proposed default behavior demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the World Wide Web , a place that according to its creator , Sir Tim Berners - Lee , will always be “ a little bit broken . ”
[ 1 ]
On the plus side , as - yet unpopular DOCTYPEs such as HTML5 can be used to trigger up - to - date rendering from future versions of Internet Explorer .
That ’s reassuring for the future but HTML5 is not ready for use today — any DOCTYPE that still includes the FONT element still has some issues that need to be worked out .
Besides , once HTML5 is widely deployed , Internet Explorer will probably freeze its rendering for those documents too .
Agreed — I hope they do a wider screen to compete with the iYouknowwhat .
I 'm curious to see how the software will work , too .
Other modules I 'm curious about would be TV Tuner ( with some sort of video input and recording capability ) , wifi card , business card scanner , and the aforementioned wider screen — I 'm just assuming they 'll support mp3/4 playback .
Over all , that 's a great idea for a system .
Then again , all those modules might be a little easy to lose .
Still , I 'm very curious to see how this one turns out .

Mr. Cheshire added , “ That imprudence or recklessness may be part of why he was not more astute about the risks he was running with this shady operator , ” Charles Keating , whose ties to Mr. McCain and four other lawmakers tainted their reputations in the savings and loan debacle .
During his current campaign for the Republican presidential nomination , Mr. McCain has played down his attacks on the corrupting power of money in politics , aware that the stricter regulations he championed are unpopular in his party .
When the Senate overhauled lobbying and ethics rules last year , Mr. McCain stayed in the background .
With his nomination this year all but certain , though , he is reminding voters again of his record of reform .
His campaign has already begun comparing his credentials with those of Senator Barack Obama , a Democratic contender who has made lobbying and ethics rules a centerpiece of his own pitch to voters .
“ I would very much like to think that I have never been a man whose favor can be bought , ” Mr. McCain wrote about his Keating experience in his 2002 memoir , “ Worth the Fighting For . ”
“ From my earliest youth , I would have considered such a reputation to be the most shameful ignominy imaginable .
Yet that is exactly how millions of Americans viewed me for a time , a time that I will forever consider one of the worst experiences of my life . ”
A drive to expunge the stain on his reputation in time turned into a zeal to cleanse Washington as well .
The episode taught him that “ questions of honor are raised as much by appearances as by reality in politics , ” he wrote , “ and because they incite public distrust they need to be addressed no less directly than we would address evidence of expressly illegal corruption . ”

A Formative Scandal
Mr. McCain started his career like many other aspiring politicians , eagerly courting the wealthy and powerful .
A Vietnam war hero and Senate liaison for the Navy , he arrived in Arizona in 1980 after his second marriage , to Cindy Hensley , the heiress to a beer fortune there .
He quickly started looking for a Congressional district where he could run .
The Best Low - Carb Fruits ( and the Worst )
This one ’s not just for all you low - carbers !
Here ’s a quick guide to the best and worst fruits according to their sugar content and nutritional value .
If you enjoy sweets and find yourself relying ( or perhaps suffering ) on Splenda and mockalate far too often , enjoy a sensible selection of fruit instead .
These are our favorite fruits :
Berries
Blueberries , strawberries , raspberries , blackberries , huckleberries , salmon berries , gooseberries – they ’re all packed with antioxidants and vitamins .
These little fiber bombs are the smartest , most nutritionally - dense fruit you can eat .
Aim for a half - cup to one cup daily .
Keep in mind that these fruits , especially strawberries and raspberries , are excellent on grilled meats and in salads , so go ahead and experiment !
( Glycemic Index : generally low to mid-20’s )
Cherries
Cherries are similar to berries in terms of their antioxidant value .
They have a bit higher natural sugar content , but they ’re still very low - carb and are an excellent source of important fiber .
Cherries are amazing with bacon , feta and greens ; or try them smothered atop pork chops .
Hungry yet ?
( GI : 22 )
Apples and Pears
These northern fruits are related to the rose .
They ’re low in sugar and contain a respectable amount of fiber .
While antioxidants are n’t exactly overflowing from your average Granny Smith , apples ( and pears ) are still a great way to satisfy a craving for sweetness without terrorizing your pancreas .
( GI : 38
Grapefruit
Most citrus fruits are quite high in sugar , but grapefruits are not .
In fact , their effect on blood sugar is less than apples and pears at only 25 .
Just do n’t ruin a smart thing with a sprinkling of sugar on top !
Grapefruit is excellent in salads , especially when paired with avocado slices .
Bonus : biggest grapefruit ever
Apricots and Peaches
With similar nutritional value as apples and pears , these stone fruits are a smart way to get a good dose of vitamin C and fiber .
Avoid nectarines , which are much higher in sugar and are more akin to mangoes and papayas .
( GI : 30s )
Figs
Oh , the forgotten fig .
It seems to get lumped into the dates ‘n raisins category , but figs are just as low in sugar as strawberries , and are packed with fiber ( all those tender , tiny seeds ) .
Enjoy these fresh whenever they ’re in season .
These fruits are high in sugar , so do n’t make them a daily habit :
– Melons
Some low - carb guides will recommend melons , but you do have to be mindful of which ones you ’re going for .
Both cantaloupes and watermelons are very high in sugar ( GI : 65 , 100 respectively ) .
We recommend making melons a rare treat .
– Mangoes and Papayas
Though not as sugary as pineapples , these fruits are best enjoyed infrequently .
A better choice is the banana , which – although starchy and a 55 on the glycemic index – is a smarter energy source .
– Pineapples
Pineapple is the best source of bromelain , an enzyme that can help with joint health and inflammation .
Some folks are intolerant or allergic ( if you get irritated lip or mouth tissues after eating pineapple , this is why ) .
Pineapple is very high in sugar , but it ’s full of valuable nutrients in addition to bromelain , so enjoy it guilt - free from time to time .

THE POWER TO DREAM
You are indispensable .
Yes , I really do mean you , and here ’s what I mean .
Everything is meditation .
You do it .
I do it .
meditation is the global language .
meditation makes the world work .
That means the meditation you do is critical to the success of everyone else , no matter what you create , an idea , a product , a service , your personal brand , a brighter vision for your family or community , change the World .
Whatever it is , we need it , and that ’s why I believe you are indispensable .
You see , Paul J. Meyer reminds of the power of a positive perspective .
It goes like this : “ Whatever you vividly imagine , ardently desire , sincerely believe , and enthusiastically act upon must inevitably come to pass . ”
But anyhow , you train fleas by putting them in a jar .
You put the top on the jar , and you watch those fleas .
They ’ll jump up and they hit top over , and over , and over , and over , and over , and over .
You watch them jump .
Finally , after they ’ve been jumping a long time , you will notice that even though they continue to jump , all of a sudden they are no longer jumping high enough to hit the top .
Then , it ’s an absolute fact you can just take the top off of the jar and they ’ll keep on jumping , and jumping , and jumping , but they cannot , I repeat , can not jump out .
You see , they have conditioned themselves to jump just so high .
They created an energy blockage for themselves .
Once they ’ve conditioned themselves to jump just so high , that ’s all there is .
There is no more .
Man is the same way .
He starts out in life to climb the mountain , to write the book , to break the record , to do something with his life .
But along the way , he bumps his head , he stubs his toes , and he becomes what I call a SNIOP .
Now , that ’s spelled S - N - I - O - P .
That ’s a person who is susceptible to the negative influence of other people .
And the solution to those painful - it 's real painful to keep on banging your head against a brick wall - experiences is to meditate them away .
To get in contact with our Earth .
To feel the flow of Kundalini Energy flowing out of the Earth , the source , the fountain of all energy and enthusiasm and as you do that feel the pain , the negativity , the stress , the emotions all flow down from the infinite chakras above the head into the Center of the Earth to burn up , gone , never to be seen again .
Can you imagine how you would feel to have that happen to you ?
Do you know people who are like those fleas ?
Well , they ’ve been painfully conditioned to expect that they ’ll never get what they want in life .
They bought into the lie that life just does n’t work out for them .
Maybe you ’re one of those people .
I hope not , but if so , you ’ll need to shed those energy blockage created limiting beliefs , ground those energy blockage created limiting beliefs to embrace the power of this meditation secret .
So , if you can have everything in life you want , what do you really want ?
We ’re going to unpack how this secret changes your interaction with other people .
But right now , I want to focus on you .
Do you have the courage to get clear on your dream and pursue it ?
I want to give you something that ’s hard to come by these days , permission to dream .
I would n’t be where I am today if I did n’t dare to dream of having everything I wanted in life to make this World a better place .
Now , you may not become the Meditation Master like I did .
Your dreams will be unique to you .
Until you get clear on what they are , you ’ll never attempt to vividly bring them to life .
You ’ll keep striking out in life without knowing why .
So , here ’s my challenge to you .
Invest the time right now to engage the Initiations of the Four Levels of Energy Enhancement Meditation to help you shed those limiting beliefs and get clear on your dreams .
It ’s time to ask yourself what do you really want .
Give some intentional thought to where you want to go and why , because , you can have everything in life you want , everything , if you will just help enough other people get what they want .
Life is service , service to your family and friends , service to your city and country , service to the World .
And everything starts with Energy Enhancement Meditation , THE POWER TO DREAM .

" I Felt a lot in my throat and abdomen discharging .
Overall , I was just feeling good vibrationnally , being aware of my feelings and thoughts , and enjoying the energy during both sessions I was receiving from Swami Devi Dhyani .
I felt the ego coming out , feeling like im perfect the way I am and do n't need to change , although I knew it was n't true or right , and felt that it was absolutely necessary to change ( and I had a lot of ego left inside of me that do not want to be integrated with the Soul ) or is afraid to ( which I started to ground yesterday using the 7step process ) .

" After that session with Ganesha B ( which I recommend to anyone taking the course ) not only was I able to focus better on the material , the power of the initiations became more powerful and intense and I found myself sleeping more as my mind and body began to adapt to the changes .
I have found myself since doing the first two levels of the course , with more energy , improved finances and while my relationships are not 100 % , they are much improved ( ca n't wait to see how things go once I learn Level 4 techniques ) .
I attribute all of these things to Swami and his explanation of EE techniques , many of which I had never heard of to remove energy blockages and to cut the cords that had been attached to me from BM 's that I never knew were there .
One thing that I found revealing while working through the material , is that I have spiritual teachers and masters .
I had always heard about it , yet , I never felt their presence .
With the EE course , between building up my energy and also increasing the power of my psychic vision , I have made the connection with my spiritual teachers and masters and have been enjoying the gifts that they have shared with me since . "

When Life Gives You Idiots ...
You could 've filled Tiger Stadium ( aka Comerica Park ) with the tidal wave of idiot - ade in this little drama .
Start with one University of Michigan archeology professor , a little more versed in ancient culture than consumer culture , who takes his 7 - year - old kid to the ball game .
He spots a sign : Mike 's Lemonade , $ 7 .
Being a nice dad , he buys his kid a lemonade .
Yeah , the price is kind of inflated , but it 's the ball park , and he 's probably focused on having a nice time with his kid .
Whoops , seems that 's not just Mike 's Lemonade , but Mike 's Hard Lemonade , with a whopping 5 % alcohol in it .
Brian Dickerson tells the tale for the Freep :
If you watch much television , you 've probably heard of a product called Mike 's Hard Lemonade .
And if you ask Christopher Ratte and his wife how they lost custody of their 7 - year - old son , the short version is that nobody in the Ratte family watches much television .
The way police and child protection workers figure it , Ratte should have known that what a Comerica Park vendor handed over when Ratte ordered a lemonade for his boy three Saturdays ago contained alcohol , and Ratte 's ignorance justified placing young Leo in foster care until his dad got up to speed on the commercial beverage industry .
... It was n't until the top of the ninth inning that a Comerica Park security guard noticed the bottle in young Leo 's hand .
" You know this is an alcoholic beverage ? " the guard asked the professor .
" You 've got to be kidding , " Ratte replied .
He asked for the bottle , but the security guard snatched it before Ratte could examine the label .
... An hour later , Ratte was being interviewed by a Detroit police officer at Children 's Hospital , where a physician at the Comerica Park clinic had dispatched Leo -- by ambulance ! -- after a cursory exam .
Leo betrayed no symptoms of inebriation .
But the physician and a police officer from the Comerica substation suggested the ER visit after the boy admitted he was feeling a little nauseated .
The Comerica cop estimated that Leo had drunk about 12 ounces of the hard lemonade , which is 5 % alcohol .
But an ER resident who drew Leo 's blood less than 90 minutes after he and his father were escorted from their seats detected no trace of alcohol .
" Completely normal appearing , " the resident wrote in his report , " ... he is cleared to go home . "
But it would be two days before the state of Michigan allowed Ratte 's wife , U - M architecture professor Claire Zimmerman , to take their son home , and nearly a week before Ratte was permitted to move back into his own house .
... And so what had begun as an outing to the ballpark ended with Leo crying himself to sleep in front of a television inside the Child Protective Services building , and Ratte and his wife standing on the sidewalk outside , wondering when they 'd see their little boy again .
And yes , the CPS nitwits actually put the kid in foster care .
Meanwhile , there are probably hundreds of kids in Detroit , in foster care and out , direly in need of assistance .
My big wish ?
That there were a TV show to replicate the role of the town stocks in the Middle Ages , where " public servants " shown to have their heads planted halfway up their small intestine will not simply be rewarded with pay raises , pensions , and vacation time , but with the kind of reception they actually deserve .
P.S. I vote for Professor Ratte to pitch the first rotten tomato of the season .
Oh yeah , and about childhood alcohol consumption , I agree with addiction treatment specialist Stanton Peele who contends that the healthy approach is giving kids alcohol in moderation , and teaching them healthy habits .
When alcohol 's not forbidden , it 's really not such a big deal .
And I say that also from personal experience , as somebody who , as a kid , was offered " tastes " of whatever liqueur my dad was drinking , and wine on Jewish holidays .
Yep , Manishevitz , the Amarone of the suburban Detroit Jews .
On that note , I do have to admit :
It is possible that if my parents served better wine I 'd now be a crack whore / blogger posting this piece via borrowed Wifi from my favorite gutter .
Meanwhile , let 's just hope the statute of limitations has expired , as my dad 's a little old to manage in DeHoCo ( Detroit House of Corrections ) .

What you want to know Hello About Contact Publications Working Together
By Hugh Sykes
BBC News , Baghdad
The Iranian president 's visit to Iraq poses severe security problems
Although he was invited by Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , it is a controversial and potentially divisive state visit , as well as a security challenge .
Many Sunni Arabs find it deeply objectionable that Iraqi hospitality is being offered to a man they suspect of covertly helping to finance and arm Shia militia groups .
Those groups have killed hundreds of Iraqis in gruesome attacks that often involve torture with electric drills .
One Sunni tribal leader believes the Iranian president is coming here " to organise more terrorist operations in Iraq " .
Iranian instructor
The United States also believes Iran has helped Shia groups in Iraq - especially helping develop " shaped " or " explosively penetrating " rounds .
Iran regards the US as an occupation force in Iraq , and considers resistance to be legitimate
These are chillingly effective roadside bombs that launch molten metal when they are detonated ; the force of the explosion propels the molten rounds at such high speed that they can penetrate military armour .
And just a day before the Iranian presidential visit , the US military said they had captured a man they described as a sniper instructor " trained in Iran " .
They said he was also an expert in the design and use of those penetrating rounds .
But Iran regards the US as an occupation force in Iraq , and considers resistance to be legitimate .
Before leaving for Iraq , Mr Ahmadinejad laughed off American accusations of Iranian interference .
" Is it not funny that those with 160,000 forces in Iraq accuse us of interference ? " he asked .
Careful arrangements
The president 's visit is a complex security challenge .
Baghdad International Airport , where he arrived , is directly alongside the mostly American military airbase - and the Americans control the airspace .
However , it was thought an Iraqi air traffic controller would be on duty for the Iranian presidential plane .
The US military believes Iran has backed Shia militants
Visiting dignitaries usually head straight from Baghdad airport to the fortified Green Zone - in an American helicopter .
The BBC understands that the Iranian president was not offered this facility and a car journey along the seven - kilometre airport road into the city was the likeliest option .
Traffic on this road has often been ambushed and attacked - and along much of its length there is only a light fence .
Ironic ' allies '
The president will also avoid the Green Zone , as to gain access to this area - home to the huge American Embassy and numerous Iraqi government offices - vehicles are required to stop at US checkpoints .
And few American troops would want to wave through a man many in the US believe was one of the students who kidnapped American diplomats in Teheran for 444 days soon after the fall of the Shah in 1979 .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies he was involved .
There are also paradoxes associated with this visit .
Despite decades of bad blood , Iran is a potential US ally - against al - Qaeda and the Taleban in Afghanistan .
Shia Iran has little in common with the fundamentalist Wahhabists of the Taleban and al - Qaeda .
Enlightened self - interest
After the attacks on New York and Washington in September 2001 , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he was " repulsed " by the loss of civilian lives .
During the following fortnight there were several meetings in Geneva between Iranian and US officials .
According to diplomats , the Iranians urged the US to invade Afghanistan as soon as possible and to install a government to oppose the Taleban .
Tehran also promised $ 500 m for the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
It was enlightened self - interest .
Iran did not want to be sandwiched between two enemies - Saddam Hussein to the west and the Taleban to the east .
It is ironic that both threats to Iranian stability were removed ... by the US .

We do n't need to be told that exercise is good for us .
We know that it combats cholesterol , we know boosts our hearts and we know it stops the pounds from piling on .
But , beyond the obvious physical benefits of a good cycle , run or swim , a growing body of evidence suggests that getting breathless can also build the brain .
Spark : The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain , which is published later this year , shows how even regular brisk walks can boost memory , alleviate stress , enhance intelligence and allay aggression .
John Ratey , an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston and the book 's author , says that exercise stimulates our grey matter to produce what he calls " Miracle - Gro " for the brain .
" I can't understate how important regular exercise is in improving the function and performance of the brain , " he says .
" It 's such a wonderful medicine . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Happiness
If the mere thought of trudging round ice - bound playing fields at school was enough to bring you out in a cold sweat , the idea that exercise makes us happy might sound perverse .
But , beyond the ( potential ) mood - lifting effects of fresh air and scenery , evidence suggests that pounding the pavement can also change the way our brains work to make us happier , or even stave off depression .
" Exercise is as good as any anti-depressant I know , " Ratey claims .
Last December , scientists from Yale University wrote in the journal Nature Medicine that regular exertion affects the hippocampus , the area of the brain responsible for mood .
Tests on mice showed that exercise activated a gene there called VGF , which is linked to a " growth factor " chemical involved in the development of new nerve cells .
Tests show that this brain activation lifts a person 's mood .
Participants in one recent German survey were asked to walk quickly on a treadmill for 30 minutes a day over a 10 - day period .
At the end of the experiment , researchers recorded a significant drop in depression scores .
Scientists are now working on a drug that mimics the effects of the VGF gene to market it as an alternative to conventional antidepressants .
Stress
If , by around 4 pm , it feels as if a stressful day at work has turned your brain to blancmange , it might not only be down to overwork or a shortage of double espressos .
We respond to stress in the same way our ancestors did – by adopting a " fight or flight " response .
Adrenalin and other hormones are released into our bloodstreams and our muscles are primed for response .
The problem is that , these days , stress is more likely to be brought on by a tricky PowerPoint presentation or a job interview than an attack by marauding lions , so the toxins that build up for a physical response have no outlet .
The results can be good ; the cardiovascular system is accelerated and we can work harder ( for a while , at least ) , but others are not so good ; stress slows down the gastrointestinal system and reduces appetite , and can overexcite the brain , fuzzing our thought .
By responding to or anticipating stress with fight ( kickboxing or judo , say ) or flight ( 30 minutes on the treadmill , say , or 50 lengths of the pool ) , blood flow to the brain is increased , allowing the body to purge the potentially toxic by - products of stress .
According to Ratey , exercise also helps in the long term .
" It builds up armies of antioxidants such as Vitamins E and C , " he says .
" These help brain cells protect us from future stress . "
Intelligence
Observers of the game of football might refute the claim that exercise leads to greater intelligence – and they would be partly right , says Ratey .
" Exercise does n't make you smarter , but what it does do is optimise the brain for learning . "
Physical activity boosts the flow of blood to the part of the brain that is responsible for memory and learning , promoting the production of new brain cells .
Several schools in the US and the Netherlands have taken note .
Pupils at Naperville Central High School near Chicago , for example , start the day with a fitness class they call " Zero Hour PE " .
Equipped with heart monitors , they run laps of the playground , and teachers say exam results have soared since the keep - fit initiative kicked off .
Meanwhile , in Amsterdam , a test involving 241 people , aged 15 - 71 , compared physical activity with the results of cognitive tasks .
The researchers documented improved results among people who were more active , especially those in younger age groups .
Yet more research suggests that exercise boosts intelligence in the very , very young .
Experiments on rats at the Delbrück Centre for Molecular Medicine in Berlin showed that baby rats born to mothers who were more active during pregnancy had 40 per cent more cells in the hippocampus , the area of the brain responsible for intelligence .
If the same is true in humans , we can expect Paula Radcliffe 's baby , Isla , to be a genius ; Radcliffe was training for the New York marathon until the day before she went in to hospital to be induced – and won the race just nine months after giving birth .
Aggression
A few rounds with a punch bag or a game of squash are great ways to release pent - up aggression , but exercise does more than " get it out your system " , says John Ratey .
" People assume exercise reduces aggression by burning energy .
In fact , exercise changes your brain so you do n't feel aggressive in the first place . "
The frontal cortex is the part of the brain that decides whether you throw a punch or take something on the chin .
Reduced activity in the region , a trauma or abnormal development can result in an inability to control violent urges .
" This area makes us evaluate the consequences of our actions , " Ratey says .
" It 's the part of the brain that puts the brakes on when the ref makes a terrible decision and you want to beat him up . "
Exercise increases activity in that area , boosting rational thought , which makesus less likely to lash out .
Memory
Most of the competitors at the annual World Memory Championships could hardly be described as the epitome of physical fitness but , according to Ratey and other scientists in the field , a good workout does much to boost recall , especially as we clock up the years .
" When we 're exercising , we 're using nerve cells in the brain which help build up what I call brain fertiliser , " he says .
Ratey is talking about new research that suggests exercise increases blood flow to the part of the brain responsible for memory , and improves its function .
In MRI scans on mice , conducted last year by neurologists at Columbia University Medical Centre in New York , the animals were shown to grow new brain cells in the dentate gyrus , which is affected in age - related memory decline .
Research on humans is ongoing but Ratey is convinced that physical activity has a similar effect .
He says : " Exercise does more than anything we know of to boost memory . "
Addiction
Smokers keen to quit cigarettes probably wo n't celebrate the news that exercise could be the key to a fag - free life .
But research by British scientists suggests that as little as five minutes of brisk walking can reduce the intensity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms .
In the tests , researchers asked participants to rate their need for a cigarette after various types of physical exertion .
Those who had exercised reported a reduced desire to smoke .
" If we found the same effects in a drug , it would immediately be sold as an aid to help people quit smoking , " Adrian Taylor , the study 's lead author at the University of Exeter , said last year .
The principle is that exercise can stimulate production of the mood - enhancing hormone dopamine , which can , in turn , reduce smokers ' dependence on nicotine .
" Dopamine works by replacing or satisfying the need for nicotine , " Ratey explains .
Whether the findings will lead office - based smokers to dash out for a jog remains to be seen .
After all , you would n't want to get addicted to exercise .
How much do you need ?
You do n't have to become a marathon runner to benefit your brain .
The mainstay of exercise is simple , brisk walking , Professor Ratey says .
You 'll feel the benefit even from a 30 - minute walk .
" That 's what people need to be doing as a minimum , ideally four or five times a week .
If you want to do more , then great . "
Professor Ratey also recommends interval training – really pushing yourself hard for between 20 and 30 seconds while running , cycling or swimming , so that you are momentarily exhausted .
Do , say , two minutes of walking , 30 seconds ' sprinting , then two minutes of walking again .
It does n't have to be a lot for a long time , but you will really notice the difference .
" The side effects on the body are n't bad either - I lost 10 pounds in no time , " Professor Ratey says .
