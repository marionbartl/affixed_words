NEW ORLEANS ( Reuters ) - Chocoholics were given further reason to rejoice on Saturday when a small clinical study showed that dark chocolate improves the function of blood vessels .
While the researchers cautioned against bingeing on bon bons , they said the findings of the trial were clear and called for larger such studies to confirm the results .
“ In this sample of healthy adults , dark chocolate ingestion over a short period of time was shown to significantly improve ( blood vessel ) function , ” said Dr. Valentine Yanchou Njike of Yale Prevention Research Center , a co-investigator of the study .
The results , presented at the annual American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in New Orleans , add to mounting evidence of the health benefits of dark chocolate .
During the six - week trial , 45 people were given 8 ounces ( 227 grams ) of cocoa without sugar , cocoa with sugar or a placebo each day .
An upper arm artery ’s ability to relax and expand to accommodate increased blood flow -- known as flow mediated dilation ( FMD ) -- was measured using high - frequency ultrasound before and after daily cocoa or placebo consumption .
Of the 39 subjects who completed the trial , FMD improved significantly in both cocoa groups -- by 2.4 percent among those who had it without sugar and 1.5 percent among those who had it with sugar .
It dropped 0.8 percent in the placebo group .
“ While the findings from this study do not suggest that people should start eating more chocolate as part of their daily routine , it does suggest that we pay more attention to how dark chocolate and other flavonoid - rich foods might offer cardiovascular benefits , ” Njike said .
White House officials said they were aware that some Democrats and Muslims were urging President Bush to admonish Representative Virgil H. Goode Jr. , Republican of Virginia , and Dennis Prager , the conservative commentator , for suggesting that the first Muslim elected to the House had no place in Congress .
“ We ’re aware of the situation , ” said Dana Perino , a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush , “ but no judgments have been made . ”
Mr. Goode said the election of Keith Ellison , a Minnesota lawyer who converted to Islam as a college student , posed a threat to American values .
Mr. Prager , a presidential appointee to the board that oversees the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum , said Mr. Ellison should not serve if he could not swear on a Bible , though he has apologized for those remarks .
Mr. Ellison plans to use the Koran during a private swearing - in ceremony next month .

Fox mocks ' S.O.B. '
Cheney 's eviction from ' prime ' office
RAW STORY
Published : Thursday January 4 , 2007 Print This Email This Print page sponsored by Velvet Revolution .
Rep. Charlie Rangel ( D - NY ) , who will be elevated today as Chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives , has " evicted " Vice President Dick Cheney from the Capitol Building , and Fox News Channel correspondents had a few laughs about it .
Cheney has long occupied an office suite on the second floor of the Capitol Building in his constitutional post as President of the Senate .
The office is prime Capitol real estate , and traditionally reserved for the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee .
Rangel reportedly lobbied quickly with incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi to occupy the office after the Democrats achieved a majority in the House of Representatives , according to a New York Post article in November .
The article further suggested that Rangel was seeking to one - up the vice president , with whom he has had a conflictual relationship in the past .
In a testy exchange over Cheney 's perception of Rangel 's understanding of economics , Rangel said to the Post , " He 's such a real son of a bitch , he just enjoys a confrontation . "
With the 110th Congress sworn in , Cheney has now left the office to Rangel .
Cheney 's staff apparently stated that the vice president always understood that the office was " on loan . "
On this morning 's Fox and Friends , Judge Andrew Napolitano mimicked how the distinctively , raspy - voiced Democrat may have sounded when he asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" Can I have that office , Nancy ? " Napolitano said in his best imitation of Rangel .
Another Fox commentator asked Napolitano if he did any " other voices " such as the cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn .
The Fox News clip , based on a story in this morning 's New York Post can be viewed below .

According to a new paper released at the IEEE Semi-Therm conference , IBM has discovered a way to dramatically improve processor cooling .
Unlike some other recent cooling breakthroughs , IBM 's discovery appears to be one that should be relatively inexpensive to implement , and could have a significant impact on consumer microprocessors in the near future .
Without fundamentally changing the approach to CPU cooling today and without the use of more advanced setups like water coolers , IBM says that they can double CPU cooling capacity while making it easier and safer to do so .
IBM 's find addresses how thermal paste is typically spread between the face of a chip and the heat spreader that sits directly over the core .
Overclockers already know how crucial it is to apply thermal paste the right way : too much , and it causes heat buildup .
Too little , and it causes heat buildup .
It has to be " just right , " which is why IBM looked to find the best way to get the gooey stuff where it needs to be and in the right amount , and to make it significantly more efficient in the process .
A CPU 's heatspreader is normally attached directly to the core by use of a paste or glue that has been enriched with micrometer - sized ceramic or metal particles .
These particles then form heat - evacuation bridges between the core and the cooler , and it's these bridges that carry heat into the heatspreader .
Diagram : Layers of cooling .
( Source : IBM )
In its current form , the process is quite inefficient : IBM 's says that up to 40 % of a CPU 's total thermal budget ( i.e. , the cooling capacity available to draw heat away from the core ) is consumed by these particles .
This inefficiency is made worse because the particles are n't truly spread evenly throughout the paste .
Instead , particles clump together , forming what IBM refers to as the " Magic Cross " , as shown below at Figure 1 .
This thickened area is a non-homogeneous mixture of paste and particles that dramatically worsens total cooling efficiency across the core .
Figure 1 : the Magic Cross . ( Source : IBM )
IBM 's solution was to design a series of micrometer - length trenches into the copper cap that sits above the CPU core , as shown in the top diagram ( " hierarchical branched channels " ) .
These larger and smaller trenches allow for paste to be evenly distributed at precisely the points where it would normally pile up and form a Magic Cross - like structure .
Utilizing IBM 's new technology allowed researchers to spread thermal paste into a far more homogeneous and efficient pattern , as shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 : Gettin ' groovy .
( Source : IBM )
The results are quite impressive .
Paste thickness could be reduced by a third , and the pressure required to properly fit a CPU cooler on top of a core was cut in half .
All of this , and IBM says that cooling capabilities are effectively doubled .
Manufacturing tools to define the micrometer channels are already in development .
IBM offers no specific details on when we might see chips using this new procedure in the wild , but they say that the new technology can be quickly integrated into current manufacturing plants at a low cost and using existing process technologies .
Whether or not the AMDs or Intels of the world will buy in remains to be seen , but the potential is undeniable .

Cheese is to be treated as junk food under new advertising rules for children 's television .
Commercials promoting it will be banned during children 's TV programmes and those with a large proportion of young viewers .
The Argentine avocado with 75 per cent less fat
More health stories here ...
The rules , which come into force this month , are part of a Government drive to reduce children 's exposure to foods high in fat , salt and sugar .
Much to the disgust of its makers , cheese is to be regarded in the same light as crisps , sugary cereals and cheeseburgers .
In fact , under the criteria used by the Food Standards Agency to determine junk foods , such products are actually regarded as healthier than cheese .
The ban follows evidence that TV commercials have an indirect influence on what children eat and are contributing to obesity in the young .
The Food Standards Agency model assesses the fat , sugar and salt content in a 100g or 100 ml serving of food or drink .
But the British Cheese Board points out that a typical portion of cheese was 30 to 40g - not the 100g used in the agency 's model .
Most cheese would be exempt from the ban if a typical portion had been used in the calculations , according to the board .
It pointed out that cheese was one of the most ' nutritionally complete ' foods .
The National Farmers ' Union described the decision as ' nannying gone mad ' .
' To suggest there is anything inherently harmful about cheese is absurd , ' spokesman Anthony Gibson said .
' There is no such thing as a bad food .
It is just how much of it you eat , in what balance and how much exercise you take . '
He said the new rules were ' of no use to consumers ' , adding : ' It may very well put them off eating healthy things . '
Mary Quicke , who runs Quickes Cheese in Devon , producing handmade cheddar , said the rules had left her ' speechless ' .
'
Frankly , i t's bonkers , ' she told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
She said the FSA 's decision to assess cheese using a 100g portion was ridiculous .
' Imagine eating 100 grams of cheese - that 's four ounces .
You would have to be a pretty dedicated eater of cheese to get around that .'
Other foods banned from advertising during children 's TV include : Marmite , Flora Lite , half - fat cheddar , Dairylea triangles , bran flakes , camembert , sugar - coated puffed wheat , instant hot oat cereal , Jaffa cakes , reduced calorie mayonnaise , multi-grain hoop cereal , half - fat creme fraiche , takeaway chicken nuggets , potato waffles , Greek yoghurt ( from sheep 's milk ) , ham , sausages , bacon rashers , low - fat spreads , peanuts , cashew nuts , pistachio-nuts , peanut butter , raisins , sultanas , currants , low - fat potato crisps , olive oil , butter , pizza , hamburgers , tomato ketchup , chocolate , brown sauce , cola and lemonade .
Foods which escape the ban include : Plain fromage frais , fish fingers , lasagne ready meals , currant buns , malt loaf , frozen roast potatoes , chicken curry with rice ready meal , frozen oven chips , sliced white bread , cottage cheese , supermarket frozen chicken nuggets , milk , brazil nuts , canned strawberries in syrup , diet cola and chocolate - flavoured milk .

As we all know Haskell is a lazy language which means it has an unusual order of evaluation equivalent to the so called normal order evaluation .
Normal order evaluation has the property that if any evaluation order reduces to a result , then normal order will also .
This means one can forget what the actual order of evaluation is .
So long as one can ﬁnd some order of evaluation that delivers a result , then one knows the Haskell code give the same result .
In this case , imagine [ this code ] ﬁrst going through and computing all the instruction names , without filling in the the instruction parameter values .
At the same time it creates the association list of labels and locations .
Imagine that only after this association list is created does the evaluator go through and fill in the parameters for the instructions .
Because only the parameters for the instructions require the association list this evaluation order works .
This means that whatever order Haskell uses , it will compute the same result .
That is the official explanation , but I prefer the sci - fi explanation .
When we pass the output of [ this function ] into the input for the oracle we are actually sending the data backwards in time .
So when [ the code ] queries the oracle we get a result from the future .
Time travel is a very dangerous business .
One false move and you can create a temporal paradox that will destroy the universe ( which in this case means that the computation will diverge ) .
When programming with values from the future , it is important never , never , to do anything with the values that might change the future .
This is the temporal prime directive .
The latest Monad Reader ( a Haskell magazine , sorta ) has a neat article that cleverly applies lazy evaluation to get an effect that really does seem like time travel .
The problem is this : imagine you 're writing a DSL atop Haskell that produces assembly language .
You want to be able to write jump instructions that can jump to a label that occurs later in the code , but when you 're generating the underlying machine code for the jump instruction you do n't know what offset to jump to until you 've generated code up to the label point .
One obvious solution is to do two passes -- one to lay everything out , then another to generate now that offsets are known .
Here 's where it gets clever .
Rather than two passes , they instead write the code in such a way that the code - generator function 's output is also passed as a parameter to the same function .
( This is often referred to as data recursion , is the same technique used in Packrat parsing , and is something I do n't yet fully grok . )
So why does it work ?
The article continues to present a different way of thinking about it :
They then go on to show another , even cleverer , way to express this using a GHC6 extension ( see 7.3.3 ) that allows monads to refer to bindings " from the future " .

Last Week's Terrorism Arrests
Hours - long waits in the security line .
Ridiculous prohibitions on what you can carry onboard .
Last week ’s foiling of a major terrorist plot and the subsequent airport security graphically illustrates the difference between effective security and security theater .
None of the airplane security measures implemented because of 9/11 — no-fly lists , secondary screening , prohibitions against pocket knives and corkscrews — had anything to do with last week ’s arrests .
And they would n’t have prevented the planned attacks , had the terrorists not been arrested .
A national ID card would n’t have made a difference , either .
Instead , the arrests are a victory for old - fashioned intelligence and investigation .
Details are still secret , but police in at least two countries were watching the terrorists for a long time .
They followed leads , figured out who was talking to whom , and slowly pieced together both the network and the plot .
The new airplane security measures focus on that plot , because authorities believe they have not captured everyone involved .
It ’s reasonable to assume that a few lone plotters , knowing their compatriots are in jail and fearing their own arrest , would try to finish the job on their own .
The authorities are not being public with the details — much of the “ explosive liquid ” story does n’t hang together — but the excessive security measures seem prudent .
But only temporarily .
Banning box cutters since 9/11 , or taking off our shoes since Richard Reid , has not made us any safer .
And a long - term prohibition against liquid carry - ons wo n’t make us safer , either .
It ’s not just that there are ways around the rules , it ’s that focusing on tactics is a losing proposition .
It ’s easy to defend against what the terrorists planned last time , but it ’s shortsighted .
If we spend billions fielding liquid - analysis machines in airports and the terrorists use solid explosives , we ’ve wasted our money .
If they target shopping malls , we ’ve wasted our money .
Focusing on tactics simply forces the terrorists to make a minor modification in their plans .
There are too many targets — stadiums , schools , theaters , churches , the long line of densely packed people before airport security — and too many ways to kill people .
Security measures that require us to guess correctly do n’t work , because invariably we will guess wrong .
It ’s not security , it ’s security theater : measures designed to make us feel safer but not actually safer .
Airport security is the last line of defense , and not a very good one at that .
Sure , it ’ll catch the sloppy and the stupid — and that ’s a good enough reason not to do away with it entirely — but it wo n’t catch a well - planned plot .
We ca n’t keep weapons out of prisons ; we ca n’t possibly keep them off airplanes .
The goal of a terrorist is to cause terror .
Last week ’s arrests demonstrate how real security does n’t focus on possible terrorist tactics , but on the terrorists themselves .
It ’s a victory for intelligence and investigation , and a dramatic demonstration of how investments in these areas pay off .
And if you want to know what you can do to help ?
Do n’t be terrorized .
They terrorize more of us if they kill some of us , but the dead are beside the point .
If we give in to fear , the terrorists achieve their goal even if they were arrested .
If we refuse to be terrorized , then they lose — even if their attacks succeed .

ユーザとその権限を管理するには
ユーザとその権限を管理するシステム管理者
システム管理者はMySQLのユーザ「root」で、MySQLをインストールしたときに登録されてます。
ユーザとその権限に関するデータは、データベース「mysql」内の5つのテーブルに格納されており、GRANT構文やREVOKE構文により管理します。
mysqlコマンドでデータベース「mysql」に、MySQLのユーザ「root」で接続します。
$ mysql - uroot -p mysql
ユーザを登録して権限を与えるGRANT構文について
GRANT構文によりユーザを登録します。同時に、その権限やパスワードの設定管理が行えます。（同じユーザに対して何度でも実行できるので、権限の設定を編集できます。）
GRANT priv_type [ ( column_list ) ] [ , priv_type [ ( column_list ) ] ...]
ON {テーブル名 | * | *.* | データベース名 .*} TO ユーザ名 [ IDENTIFIED BY 'パスワード ' ] [ , ユーザ名 [ IDENTIFIED BY 'パスワード ' ] ... ]
[ REQUIRE [ { SSL| X509} ] [ CIPHER cipher [ AND ] ] [ ISSUER issuer [ AND ] ] [ SUBJECT subject ] ]
[ WITH GRANT OPTION ]
GRANT構文のpriv_typeには、次のようなものがあります。
ALL PRIVILEGES (*) ：すべての権限。 （ALLと同義語） ALTER (*) ：ALTER TABLE構文が実行できる権限。 CREATE (*) ：データベースとテーブルの作成が行える権限。
DROP (*) ：データベースとテーブルの削除が行える権限。
FILE (*) ：LOAD DATA構文とSELECT 〜 INTO OUTFILE 構文を実行できる権限 。 PROCESS (*) ：mysqladminコマンドのprocesslistとkill命令を実行できる権限。
RELOAD (*) ：mysqladminコマンドのreload、refresh、flush-privileges、
flush-hosts、flush-logs、flush-tables命令を実行できる権限。
SHUTDOWN (*) ：mysqladminコマンドのshutdown命令を実行できる権限。
DELETE：DELETE構文を実行できる権限。
INSERT：INSERT構文を実行できる権限。 SELECT：SELECT構文を実行できる権限。
UPDATE：UPDATE構文を実行できる権限。 INDEX：インデックスの作成と削除が行える権限。
REFERENCES：テーブルのリファレンスが参照できる権限。
USAGE ：すべての権限がない。 （" no privileges " と同義） (*)：通常のデータ操作以上の権限を与えるので、十分な検討が必要です。
ユーザ名には、ユーザとホストを指定します。 ■書式： ユーザ@ホスト名 ユーザ：登録するユーザ ホスト：登録するユーザは、どのホストからMySQLサーバにアクセスするのか （localhost | ホスト名 （IPアドレス） | " % " （ワイルドカード）） ■例： ユーザ名 or ユーザ名@localhost or ユーザ名@IPアドレス or ユーザ名@ " % "
* GRANT構文を実行した後に 、FLUSH PRIVILEGES 構文を必ず実行します。
*「*」 、「 %」はワイルドカードです。
* MySQL 3.22.11.以上で実行できます。
ユーザの権限を取り去るREVOKE構文について
REVOKE構文により、登録しているユーザの権限を取り去ります。（ユーザの削除は行いません）
REVOKE priv_type [ ( column_list ) ] [ , priv_type [ ( column_list ) ] ...]
ON {テーブル名 | * | *.* | データベース名 .*} FROM ユーザ名 [ , ユーザ名 ...]
* REVOKE構文を実行した後に、FLUSH
PRIVILEGES 構文を必ず実行します。
* priv_typeについては、ユーザを登録して権限を与えるGRANT構文についてを参照してください。
管理者権限を持つユーザを登録する
MySQLのユーザ「 root」と同じ、管理者権限を持つユーザ「user1」を登録するには、次のような2つのGRANT構文を実行します。MySQLのユーザ「user1」にはパスワードを設定しています。
mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO user1@ " % " -> IDENTIFIED BY 'パスワード '
WITH GRANT OPTION ; mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO user1@localhost -> IDENTIFIED BY 'パスワード '
WITH GRANT OPTION ; mysql > FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;
どのホストからでもサーバに接続できるようにするために、「user1@ " % " 」と「user1@localhost」を指定した、2つのGRANT構文を実行しています。（localhostから接続できるようにするためには、「user1@localhost」を指定する必要があります）
また 、 「 WITH GRANT OPTION 」によりGRANT 構文の実行権限を与えています。
権限：ALL PRIVILEGES （すべての権限） データベース名.テーブル名：*.*（すべてのデータベースのすべてのテーブル） ユ ーザ名：user1@ " % " （すべてのホスト 「 " % " 」の、ユーザ「 user1 」 ） user1@localhost（ローカルホストの、ユーザ「user1 」） GRANT実行権限：（GRANT構文を実行する権限）
通常のデータ操作が行えるユーザを登録する
SELECT、INSERT、UPDATE、DELETE構文により、通常のデータ操作が行えるユーザを登録します。
mysql > GRANT SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE , DELETE -> ON データベース名 .* ->
TO ユーザ名@localhost -> IDENTIFIED BY 'パスワード ' ; mysql > FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;
*1つのテーブルに対して権限を持つユーザを登録するときには、「データベース名.*」を「データベース名.テーブル名」とします。
*他のホストから接続するユーザを登録するときには、「localhost」を「ホスト名（IPアドレス）」とします。
ユーザや権限を管理するテーブルについて
データベース「mysql」には、ユーザや権限を管理するための5つのテーブルがあります。5つのテーブルには、4つの権限レベルに対応した権限が格納されます。
user ：Globalレベル ユーザの基本的な定義を管理するテーブルです。 サーバ上のすべてのデータベースに適用される権限について格納します。 host ：Databaseレベル 接続してきたクライアントのホストに対する権限の定義を管理するテーブルです。 データベース内のすべてのテーブルに適用される権限について格納します。 db ：Databaseレベル データベースに対するアクセスの権限の定義を管理するテーブルです。 データベース内のすべてのテーブルに適用される権限について格納します。 tables_priv：Tableレベル テーブルに対する権限の定義を管理するテーブル テーブル内のすべてのフィールドに適用される権限について格納します。 columns_priv：Columnレベル フィールドに対する権限の定義を管理するテーブルです。 テーブル内の一つのフィールドに適用される権限について格納します。
これらのテーブルでは、ホスト、ユーザ、パスワード、データベース、カラム、権限などについて記録しています。権限を記録するカラム名は権限と対応しています。（Y：権限がある、N：権限がない）
ユーザを削除す る
ユーザを削除するには 、DELETE構文によりmysqlデータベースのユーザや権限を管理する5つのテーブルから、該当するユーザのレコードを削除する必要があります。
また、5つのテーブルから直接データを削除する方法とは別に、次の手順に従ってユーザを削除する方法があります。通常はこちらの方法でユーザを削除してください。
mysql > DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE user= 'ユーザ名 ' and host= 'ホスト名 ' ; mysql > FLUSH PRIVILEGES ;
また 、MySQL 4.1.1.で追加されたコマンドでも権限を持たないユーザを削除することができます。このコマンドを利用するには次の手順に従ってください。
mysql > DROP USER ユーザ名 ;
（注意!：誤って他のユーザを消さないように注意してください。）
SET PASSWORD で パスワードを設定するには
パスワードの設定は、ユーザを登録するGRANT構文以外に、SET
PASSWORD があります。パスワードを変更したい場合は、SET
PASSWORDを実行します。
mysql > SET PASSWORD FOR ユーザ名@ " % " = PASSWORD ( ' パスワード ' ) ;
*ユーザ名については、ユーザを登録して権限を与えるGRANT構文についてを参照してください。
パスワードの暗号 化
ユーザのパスワードは暗号化する必要があります。
GRANT構文のIDENTIFIED BYで指定したパスワードは暗号化されます。
また、SET PASSWORD構文や、UPDATE構文でmysql.userテーブルを更新するときは、PASSWORD関数を使用してパスワードを設定します。これにより、暗号化されたパスワードが設定されます。
ユーザの権限を確認するには
MySQLには、ユーザの権限を確認することができるPerlスクリプトが附属しています。
ヘルプはオプション「-- help」で表示されます。また、簡単な使い方の例はオプション「--howto」で表示されます。
user、db、hostテーブルにより、権限があるときは'Y'を、ないときは'N'を表示します。
# mysqlaccess localhost ユーザ名 データベース 名
また、直接mysql.userテーブルをSELECTすることで確認することもできます。このとき、ユーザをWHERE句で指定しなければすべてのユーザの権限が確認できます。
mysql > select * from mysql.user ; or mysql > select * from mysql.user \G
* \ Gを付けると結果が1レコードごとに垂直に表示されます。
mysql > SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE User='ユーザ名 ';
mysql > SELECT * FROM mysql.user WHERE
User like ' % a % ' ;
登録されているユーザを確認するには
mysql.userテーブルをSELECTすることで登録されているユーザを確認することができます。節4.10[ユーザの権限を確認するには]でしめしたSQL文とほとんど同じですが、ホスト、ユーザ、パスワードの情報のみ取得するため、SELECTするカラムを指定します。
mysql > SELECT
Host , User , Password FROM mysql.user ; or mysql > SELECT
Host , User , Password FROM mysql.user \G
* \ Gを付けると結果が1レコードごとに垂直に表示されます。
mysql > SELECT
Host , User , Password FROM mysql.user WHERE User='ユーザ名 ' ;
mysql > SELECT
Host , User , Password FROM mysql.user WHERE
User like ' % a % ' ;

データのバックアッ プ
MySQLでは、データをダンプしてバックアップします。また、データベースのファイルをコピーしてバックアップをすることもできます。
MySQLでは、1つのデータベースを1つのディレクトリとしています。データベースのディレクトリ内に、テーブルと対応したファイルが格納されます。1つのテーブルは、3つのファイルで構成されています。それぞれのファイル名はテーブル名.拡張子で、ファイルの内容により拡張子が異なります。
データベース関連のファイル 拡張子 説明 MYD データ MYI インデックスのデータ frm テーブルの構 造
矛盾のないバックアップをとるには
FLUSH TABLES 構文で開いているテーブルをすべて閉じます。次に、関連するテーブルをLOCK
TABLES構文でロックします。
バックアップが終了したら 、UNLOCK
TABLES構文でテーブルのロックを解除します。（mysqlコマンドで、MySQLクライアントを起動して実行します。）
データベースのディレクトリをコピーするmysqlhotcopyコマンド
指定された出力先ディレクトリに、データベースをコピーします。

THE BIONIC ARM THE BIONIC ARM
Meet the $ 4 million woman
When her doctors first called her " The Bionic Woman , " 26 - year - old Claudia Mitchell did n't understand the reference to the 1970s TV show about the secret agent who was part woman , part machine .
Besides , the first woman to be outfitted with a bionic arm says that when the motors are running in the 10 - pound device , it reminds her of another famous cyborg — Arnold Schwarzenegger 's The Terminator .
" It 's really cool , " she says .
" This is not just something in the movies .
This is really happening . "
Mitchell , a former U.S. Marine , lost her left arm in 2004 on an Arkansas highway when the friend she was riding with lost control of his motorcycle .
As she struggled to cope with the loss of the limb , she read a Popular Science story about Jesse Sullivan , a Tennessee man who received the first bionic arms at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago after losing his in an electrical accident in 2001 .
" I said , ' I 've got to have one of those , ' " Mitchell says .
Last year she had surgery and received an arm that 's even more advanced than Sullivan's .
Today , in a Washington , D.C. , news conference with National Institutes of Health officials , Mitchell will show off her skills with the arm developed in a $ 4 million project funded largely by the NIH .
Though recent prosthetic research has focused on implanting sensors that link devices to movement commands from the brain , Mitchell was drawn to the less - invasive work in Chicago .
" Most people have been looking at trying to tap into the brain , but that has a number of challenges , " says Todd Kuiken , who heads neural engineering at the Chicago institute .
Implants are " becoming more doable , but if something breaks you have to have surgery to fix it .
The exciting thing about this technique is we are not implanting anything into her body . "
Kuiken found a way to use chest muscles to connect the prosthetic to nerves that once sent signals to the hand , wrist , elbow and shoulder .
After an amputation , the brain still thinks the arm is there .
It feels sensations and sends signals to move .
But those signals are too weak for modern mechanics to detect from the surface of the skin , so Kuiken 's team amplified them .
First , plastic surgeon Greg Dumanian of Northwestern Memorial Hospital moved the targeted nerves into muscles in Mitchell 's chest .
Then , the nerves that cause the motion of those muscles were disconnected .
Mitchell can no longer send a signal to flex her pectoral muscle , but when she wants to close her hand or bend her elbow , the nerve impulse moves her " pec . "
When that muscle moves , it sends a signal strong enough for a sensor on the skin to detect .
After some rewiring by Dumanian , six muscles in Mitchell 's chest now move six motors in the bionic arm .
And nerve data flow up , too .
When Kuiken touches a certain spot on Mitchell 's chest , she feels him touch her hand , even though it 's no longer there .
There is much still to sort out .
Though Mitchell can perform a simple task such as folding a pair of pants without first stretching them out on a flat surface , Kuiken calls the arm clumsy .
Both he and Mitchell say they are optimistic about making the prosthetic — hers and future versions — more sensitive and precise .
" We hope to be able to close the loop with Claudia and have the sensation be there so that when she touches something , she feels a touch of her hand , " Kuiken says .
Mitchell , who hopes to go to college next year to study communications , says she is proud to be part of the team .
" I am really excited about the prospects of being able to , hopefully , pave the way to make this something that is more common , " says Mitchell , a volunteer at Washington , D.C. - area military hospitals .
Until today , her role in the bionic research project has been shrouded in secrecy .
But now , the former Marine who served in Kuwait can tell the amputees she counsels about her arm and the research .
And some soldiers and Marines can now apply to follow Mitchell 's lead .
Kuiken is looking for amputees who have lost arms above the elbow in the past year .
Mitchell says some of the returnees she meets may be candidates .
" I have met these young women and men who are now changed forever , " she says .
" I see how they are coping with life and how they are learning to deal with their prosthesis .
I know how they 're feeling . "
Some day , she says , the bionic arm may make it easier for amputees to strap on a prosthesis and get on with their daily routines .
" I can open a spaghetti jar and hold it up at an angle and use a spoon to empty it out , " she says .
" Small things like that may seem trivial to a two - armed person , but it is very exciting to me . "

Conventional matter exists in three familiar forms - solid , liquid and gas .
But under special circumstances , quantum theory predicts exotic states of matter , such as superconductors in which electrons flow with no resistance and Bose - Einstein condensates in which atoms move as a collective whole .
Now , in the Dec. 15 issue of the journal Science , three Stanford physicists theorize a new state of matter that may pave the way for electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat .
'' Searching for new states of matter has become the holy grail of condensed matter physics , just as the quest for new elements dominated chemistry and the pursuit of new subatomic particles dominates particle physics , '' says physics Professor Shoucheng Zhang , who also holds courtesy appointments in the Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering departments .
With graduate student Taylor Hughes and former graduate student and current Princeton University postdoctoral fellow Andrei Bernevig , Zhang proposed the existence of the so - called '' quantum spin Hall state , '' which has extraordinary properties .
The U.S. Department of Energy and National Science Foundation funded their work .
Say ' cheese '
To understand the quantum spin Hall state , it 's key to first understand the related quantum Hall state .
Imagining a cheese sandwich will help .
Swap semiconductor sheets for the bread , and turn the cheese into an electron gas .
Instead of sticking your cheese sandwich in the fridge , place your semiconductor - electron gas concoction in an environment where it's way colder ( below 1 degree Kelvin ) .
Apply an intense magnetic field of several Teslas - more than 10,000 times greater than Earth 's magnetic field .
'' In such a state , the electrical current does not flow through the two - dimensional sheet , but is confined at the edges , '' Zhang explains .
'' The current at a given edge flows without dissipation , and only in one direction ; it cannot be scattered backward by impurities . ''
In essence , current flows only around the bread crusts .
'' This property gives rise to the remarkable observation of quantized Hall voltage measured in the direction perpendicular to the current flow . ''
In contrast , in conventional electronics , currents flow in the same direction as applied voltage , and the resistance can take arbitrary or nonquantized values .
That means greater energy dissipation .
So that 's the recipe for creating the quantum Hall effect , which Zhang calls '' one of the most profound phenomena in physics . ''
The stuff of dreams , the quantum Hall effect was the basis of Nobel Prizes in 1985 and 1998 .
A new state
Physicists often use math to convert complex physics concepts into terms of shape , or topology .
It makes it easier to describe the extraordinary properties of different states of matter .
'' If one performs smooth distortions of the donut , one can never get rid of the hole in its center and transform it into a sphere , '' Zhang says .
'' Similarly , the electronic state of the quantum Hall effect is topologically distinct from that of any conventional semiconductor states . ''
As cool and exotic as the quantum Hall state is , it has a serious drawback , Zhang notes .
'' Unfortunately , the quantum
Hall effect can only be realized under high magnetic field and low temperature , and cannot , therefore , be used for semiconductor devices operating under ambient conditions . ''
In their report in Science , the three Stanford researchers proposed that a new state , called the quantum spin Hall effect , could be realized without applying an external magnetic field .
They stacked and skewed alternating layers of mercury telluride and cadmium telluride .
Just as in a slightly skewed stack of checkerboards , where red squares are bordered by black squares and vice versa , the material made a crystal lattice structure similar to that of the silicon or gallium arsenide of semiconductors .
The researchers say that by controlling the thickness of wells in the mercury telluride , the result will be a quantum phase transition into a new state that is distinct from that of conventional semiconductor states .
Conventional semiconductors are insulators at low temperatures .
That means the resistance of the material is so high that no current can flow .
But insulators can be turned into conductors - materials with some resistance , but not enough to stop current from flowing - using n- type doping , which adds electrons to the material , or p- type doping , which removes electrons to leave behind holes .
But matter in the quantum spin Hall state can carry electric currents without any doping , Zhang says .
Just like with the quantum
Hall effect , electrical current flows only at the edges of the sample .
What 's more , the quantum spin Hall state would display an ' ' extraordinary ' ' property , Zhang says .
On any given edge , electrons oriented with their spins aligned pointing up would flow in one direction , while the electrons oriented with their spins aligned pointing down would flow in the opposite direction .
Because impurities usually do not flip the spin orientation , they cannot easily scatter the electrons into the backward direction , thus leading to far less energy dissipation or heat generation compared to conventional semiconductors .
Basically , the quantum spin
Hall effect has most of the desirable features of the quantum Hall effect , but without the cost of applying a huge magnetic field to a device , Zhang says .
'' Similar to the quantum Hall effect , the quantum spin Hall effect is also topologically distinct from any conventional semiconductors , '' says Zhang .
'' In this precise mathematical sense , the quantum spin Hall effect is a topologically distinct new state of matter . ''
Putting theory to the test
Since quantum wells in mercury telluride / cadmium telluride sheets can be readily fabricated , it is possible to experimentally test the theoretical predictions of Zhang , Bernevig and Hughes .
A research group at the University of Würzburg in Germany , under the direction of Professor Laurens Molenkamp , is currently doing this .
If the theory pans out , the quantum spin Hall effect may eventually inspire room - temperature devices with new capabilities .
Zhang notes the potential for getting around a well - known roadblock of the electronics industry , the dictum saying the number of transistors fitting on a computer chip will double every 18 months : '' Transistors built based on the quantum spin Hall effect are expected to dissipate far less heat compared to conventional transistors , thus paving the way for extending Moore 's law . ''
In fact , hoping to turn Zhang 's vision into a commercial reality , the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation , a consortium of leading U.S. semiconductor companies , has started to fund his research on the quantum spin Hall effect .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass .
-- Cambridge has found a partner in its effort to provide residents with free wireless Internet access : the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
With MIT 's help , the city hopes to provide free access to its 100,000 residents by this summer .
The original goal was to get access to those who can least afford it , but it 's expected to have broader benefits .
" It 's making it a part of the infrastructure of the city , " said Mary Hart , director of the city 's information technology .
" At a basic level it should be available free . "
MIT researchers will help test the " mesh " technology , which allows individual users to both receive and send a Wi -Fi signal , so that a user does n't need to be within range of the original signal from MIT .
The network would communicate through the wireless networking cards that come standard with many computers .
A priority area will be public housing , Hart said .
The city is working with businesses to obtain discounts or donations of computers , she said .
" We want to make technology available to everybody , regardless of their economic standing , " Hart said .
" Thirty to $ 50 dollars ( per month ) is prohibitive for some people . "
Many other cities , including Philadelphia , San Francisco and New Orleans , are hoping to become wireless .
Harvard eventually may join the project , Hart said .
Officials at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst say they 've had similar discussions about providing wireless access throughout the town of Amherst .
Phone and cable TV companies have fiercely opposed attempts at providing free access .
The companies contend competition from government - run Internet service stymies their incentive to invest in upgrading their networks and services .
Cambridge 's network would be faster than dial - up service , but slower than high - speed services provided by telephone and cable TV companies , Hart said .
" We are not competing with them , " she said .
" This is an entry level option . "

Authors are treated to a fairly straight conversation with Mr. Stewart , but Stephen Colbert , who remains in character as a Bill O’Reilly - type commentator , can be a more challenging interviewer who forces the author to play along with his schtick .
“ It ’s a different experience , ” Ms. Weinberg said wryly .
Television programs that devote significant attention to serious authors have practically gone the way of the illuminated manuscript , publishers lament .
Brian Lamb ’s long - running “ Booknotes ” program on C - Span was permanently shuttered in 2004 .
“ The Charlie Rose Show ” does n’t generate as much buzz as it used to or translate into higher sales after an author appearance , some publishers say .
And the morning shows seem to prefer a bad Britney to a good book .
Many publishers shrug off “ The Tonight Show With Jay Leno ” on NBC and “ Late Show With David Letterman ” on CBS , saying they are too celebrity - driven to be interested in serious authors , and usually fail to generate a bump in sales anyway .
All that ’s left are programs like “ 60 Minutes ” on CBS , “ Imus in the Morning ” on MSNBC , “ Larry King Live ” on CNN , and , of course , “ Oprah ” — all extremely competitive venues for placing an author .
“ The people who have abandoned us have abandoned us , ” said Martha K. Levin , the publisher of Free Press , which last fall released “ In the Line of Fire , ” a memoir by Gen. Pervez Musharraf , the president of Pakistan .
“ Particularly for nonfiction , we are so dependent on media .
And television has an impact that is unparalleled . ”
But the Comedy Central shows are also becoming extremely competitive for publicists placing their authors .
After a “ Daily Show ” appearance , several publishers said , the author ’s Amazon ranking rises and the daily sales figures “ pop , ” in industry parlance .
It is not at all unusual , one book publicist said , for a title to go from a 300,000 rank to a spot in the Top 300 — not often the case after shows like “ Charlie Rose . ”
Congressional Election Nullified – Nobody Noticed
Speaker of the House Nullified
San Diego Congressional Race

Election Nullification 2 : Speaker 's Special Source
It appears the US media overlooked one of the great political stories of the year .
In what is becoming something of a pattern , here ’s a brief chronology :
On June 6 , 2006 Republican Brian Bilbray allegedly slightly outpolled Democrat Francine Busby in the special election for California ’s 50th Congressional District , despite Busby ’s lead in the polls going into the election .
There were immediate cries of foul following the election due to major irregularities , including electronic voting machines sent out to the homes and cars of volunteers for up to 12 days prior to the election , and irregular election results like huge mega- precincts of absentee ballots where turnout was thousands of percent more than registered voters .
On June 13 , 2006 , Bilbray flew to Washington , DC and was sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives by House Speaker Dennis Hastert .
On or about June 30 , 2006 , 17 days after Bilbray was sworn in as a member of the House , Mikel Haas , Registrar of San Diego County , officially completed the audit of election results required for certification , and officially certified the election of Bilbray over Busby based on 163,931 votes cast , of which 2,053 votes were said to be cast on Diebold TSX touchscreens , and the remainder scanned via Diebold Accuvote OS computers .
On July 31 , 2006 , the Contestants filed an election contest , seeking a hand recount and to invalidate the election on several grounds , not only including the affirmative evidence of irregular results , but also including the stonewalling of citizen information requests and the pricing of recounts at an estimated $ 150,000 that made it difficult or impossible for any citizen to tell who won the election .
On August 22 , 2006 the defendants moved to dismiss , arguing that the swearing in of Bilbray deprives everyone else of jurisdiction including specifically the San Diego Superior Court because Art. I , sec. 5 of the US Constitution has been held to mean that the House and Senate are the judges of the Qualifications of their Members , one of those qualifications is supposed to be “ election . ”
There is some thing very wrong with this sequence .
Elections are not complete , anywhere , until they are officially certified by local authorities .
How can a citizen get sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives before his or her election is certified ?
Only Speaker Dennis Hastert , his team , and Bilbray have the answer .
In a filling in San Diego Municipal Court yesterday , attorney Paul Lehto outlined the core in stark terms :
Defendants are in effect arguing for the remarkable proposition that unilateral self - serving actions by a majority party in the House of Representatives to shuttle in a member of the same party can be effective , even if those actions do violence to and amount to circumvention of other sections of the US Constitution as well as the California constitution .
Document available here .
Lehto is one of the two attorneys representing citizens who are challenging the election .
Shortly after the last vote was cast , citizens discovered disturbing facts .
Prior to Election Day , several poll workers had taken home voting machines for periods of a day to a week at a time without supervision or even consistent tracking procedures .
Other irregularities like vote switching on touch screen machines emerged .
Brad Friedman of www.BradBlog.com conducted an extensive investigation that uncovered a series of sloppy procedures by County Registrar Haas .
The election became an immediate cause for citizens , supporters of the losing candidate , and national voting rights activists .
The results were also challenged by Howard Dean , Chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
A suit was filed by two local citizens challenging the election .
The initial filing relied on the right of citizens to know that their votes are and counted correctly in order to assure that the candidate designated as the winner is in fact the winner .
Part of the suit is a request , denied to date , for a recount of the ballots cast on Election Day .
In response to the suit , the County of San Diego filed a response questioning the authority of the local court to decide the case since ( a ) membership in the house was the province of the House of Representatives and ( b ) the speaker had already sworn in Bilbray .
Lehto and Simpkins filed a withering response to this argument .
They point out that elections are the province of local and state authorities for all elections including federal contests , unless otherwise specified in the constitution .
The following is form the filing yesterday :
Clearly , the swift swearing in did not end the election in the 50th Congressional District , and it did not render everything , including the certification of results weeks later , nugatory and without “ jurisdiction . ”
If this swearing in had this effect , then in the course of dismissing this case the Court would be bound to conclude that the certification of the results after the swearing in of Bilbray was without force and effect , without jurisdiction , and in contravention of principles of federalism , as Defendants argue .
That conclusion , however , requires either an absurdity , or the conclusion that our Congressional election was canceled by decision of the Speaker of the House , before all the votes were fully counted , and well before certification .
Document available here .
So there you have it .
Dennis Hastert , Speaker of the United House of Representatives , called “ the peoples ’ House , ” now has the authority to nullify elections simply by swearing in candidates and claiming federal privilege based on one narrow section of the constitution , while completing ignoring the others , including the one stating that members of the House shall be elected every two years “ by the People , ” and not selected in Washington DC .
Once again , the country is faced with a Bush v. Gore style selection manufactured in Washington DC , and if only the people did not know which party benefited and which party was hurt by the selection , the country would be unanimous in denouncing this power grab .
Ongoing support and interference by the House of Representatives or persons associated therewith continues in San Diego .
Paul Vinovich , Counsel to the House Administration Committee , Chaired by Bob Ney , R , of Ohio , had a letter delivered to San Diego Superior Court presiding Judge Yuri Hoffman , with a number of arguments in favor of the Judge dismissing the case .
This type of communication with members of the judiciary , particularly when another government authority is involved , is covered by strict rules .
One such rule is that the ex parte communication be provided simultaneously to counsel for all involved .
In his own hand , Vinovich says to plaintiff ’s attorney Lehto , “ Letter delivered to court last evening . ”
Lehto received the fax at 8:56 a.m.
Thursday morning , many hours after the letter was admittedly provided to the judge by Vinovich .
In the letter , Vinovich admits the time sequence of a July 13 swearing in followed by a July 29th certification of the election and then , through circular reasoning , tries to use the certification as justification for the swearing in ceremony .
He fails to note that Speaker Hastert would have needed psychic powers on June 13th to know that the swearing in of Bilbray would be justified by a June 29th certification .
We ’re clearly at the point where members of the ruling party are making up rules post hoc to justify whatever actions they wish to take .
We are also at a point where there is little if any opposition to this .
The House is silent .
With the exception of local and national voting rights activists and Chairman Dean , the opposing party is silent .
The Defendants literally argue that the Courts are powerless to stop them ( without jurisdiction ) .
Friday will reveal whether the courts are powerless to stop this abuse of power and premature termination of elections .
Will Judge Yuri Hoffman carry on the emerging tradition of silence , or will he take us back to the courage and integrity shown by Judge John Sirica , a Republican appointee , who made history by demanding the truth from the Watergate burglars ?

Programmer hacks
Digg , gets bury list for a few hours :
Bury list is full of shills burying highly significant content
A programmer found a bug at Digg which allowed him to view the Bury feed at Digg .
He posted the list on his website and it is eye opening , to say the least .
CLICK HERE TO READ THE LIST
Notice how there are tons of obvious shills burying our recent explosive WTC 7 articles as well as many other articles of extreme significance .
It 's shocking to read the list and see how much significant , documented , and extremely popular content is being buried for obvious ideological reasons .
This is completely undemocratic abuse of the Digg system and is proof positive the Bury feature is being abused to suppress content by vindictive Anti-Diggers .
From Pronet Advertising :
We 've heard about a purported ' Bury Brigade ' on Digg time and again , with sketchy pieces of evidence here and there but no concrete proof .
Until now .
...
While that system is supposed to be used to remove superfluous or irrelevant content from Digg , the mechanism is often abused to remove useful and insightful content by malicious users for self - serving and vindictive reasons .
My observations are based on data collected by David using a mechanism that he tried to explain to me via email .
You can get this data by using the Digg Spy JSON Array :
...
You can see which user did the burying , on what story , and on what basis .
By looking at just some of the data , you can get quite conclusive hard evidence that not only does the bury brigade exist , but it is hard at work burying any content that does n't suit its ideology .

A guy has sold a free yahoo email ID for a whopping $ 355 at EBay .
The email ID is iPhone_Wholesalers@yahoo.com .
The guy stated starting bid at $ 20 .
Amazingly the auction proceeded pretty fast and landed at $ 355 .
Goodness gracious me !!
It is very clear that selling yahoo IDs is a violation of Terms Of Service .
We have to wait and see how yahoo reacts to this issue .
This incident may lead to many more email id auctions in future .
Interestingly , the EBay site says that the seller is no longer a registered user of EBay .
There are few more Yahoo IDs similar to this like ' iphone_wholesaler ' , ' iphonewholesaler ' , ' iphonewholesalers ' are not available too .
We may see those being put in auction soon if ebay or yahoo ( or any other web based email providers like gmail and hotmail ) takes no action to prevent these kind of unethical trades .
I am just thinking about the man who won the auction .
Is it really worth to get a free email ID for a huge price ?
Is it really going to help to promote his business ?
An iPhone itself costs lesser than this email ID !
A web based free mail ID for a company does n't attract many customers .
It would be interesting to get an answer from the man himself for the reason he bought (!! ) this free IDThanks JohnChow for reporting about the auction via Bob
ANYBODY who doubts the size of the transatlantic divide over Israel should try discussing the Middle East conflagration in Britain and then doing the same in America .
Everybody watches much the same grisly footage .
But , by and large , people draw very different conclusions .
The emphasis in Britain is overwhelmingly on the disproportionate scale of the response .
Americans are much more inclined to give Israel the benefit of the doubt — and to blame Hizbullah .
Some Jewish organisations are so confident of support for Israel that they even take out slots during news programmes , pleading for donations .
Opinion polls confirm that Americans are solidly on Israel 's side .
A USA Today / Gallup poll conducted on July 28th - 30th showed that eight in ten Americans believed that Israel 's action was justified — though a majority were worried about the scale of the action .
A plurality ( 44 % ) thought that America was doing “ about the right amount ” to deal with the conflict .
An earlier USA Today poll found that 53 % put “ a great deal ” of the blame for the current crisis on Hizbullah , 39 % put the blame on Iran and only 15 % blamed Israel .
Similarly , Americans are far more likely than Europeans to side with Israel in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
A Pew Global Attitudes survey taken between March and May found that 48 % of Americans said that their sympathies lay with the Israelis ; only 13 % were sympathetic towards the Palestinians .
By contrast , in Spain for example , 9 % sympathised with the Israelis and 32 % with the Palestinians .
The political establishment is even more firmly behind Israel than the public is .
Support for Israel stretches from San Francisco liberals like Nancy Pelosi to southern - fried conservatives like Bill Frist .
The House and Senate have both passed bipartisan resolutions condemning Hizbullah and affirming Congress 's support for Israel .
The House version passed by 410 to 8 ( of which three were from districts in Michigan with concentrations of Arab - Americans ) .
The Senate resolution , sponsored by 62 senators — including the leaders of both parties — passed unopposed .
Indeed , the parties are engaged in a competition to see who can be the most pro-Israeli .
Twenty or so Democrats , including Ms Pelosi , the House leader , and Harry Reid , the Senate leader , demanded that Iraq 's prime minister , Nuri al - Maliki , retract his criticisms of Israel or have his invitation to address Congress cancelled .
( Mr Maliki , strongly backed by the administration , was eventually allowed to go ahead . )
Several leading Democrats , including Hillary Clinton , have addressed pro-Israeli rallies .
The contrast with the simmering rage within the Labour Party over Tony Blair 's support for George Bush could hardly be more marked .
Pro-Israeli forces command the intellectual high ground as well as the corridors of power .
Commentators such as Charles Krauthammer issue column after column ridiculing the notion of proportionality and stressing Hizbullah 's responsibility for civilian casualties .
Most middle - of - the - road commentators question the effectiveness , rather than the morality , of Israel 's actions .
Out - and - out critics of Israel are relegated to the sidelines .
Why is America so much more pro-Israeli than Europe ?
The most obvious answer lies in the power of two very visible political forces : the Israeli lobby ( AIPAC ) and the religious right .
AIPAC , which has an annual budget of almost $ 50 m , a staff of 200 , 100,000 grassroots members and a decades - long history of wielding influence , is arguably the most powerful lobby in Washington , mightier even than the National Rifle Association .
“ Thank God we have AIPAC , the greatest supporter and friend we have in the whole world , ” says Ehud Olmert , Israel 's prime minister .
The lobby , which is the centrepiece of a co-ordinated body that includes pressure groups , think - tanks and fund - raising operations , produces voting statistics on congressmen that are carefully scrutinised by political donors .
It also organises regular trips to Israel for congressmen and their staffs .
( The Washington Post reports that Roy Blunt , the House majority whip , has been on four . )
The Christian right is also solidly behind Israel .
White evangelicals are significantly more pro-Israeli than Americans in general ; more than half of them say they strongly sympathise with Israel .
( A third of the Americans who claim sympathy with Israel say that this stems from their religious beliefs . )
Two in five Americans believe that Israel was given to the Jewish people by God , and one in three say that the creation of the state of Israel was a step towards the Second Coming .
Religious - right activists are trying to convert this latent sympathy into political support .
John Hagee , a Texas televangelist who believes that supporting Israel is a “ biblical imperative ” , recently founded Christians United for Israel .
Last month he brought 3,500 people from across the country to Washington to cheer Israel 's war against Hizbullah .
Mr Hagee 's brigades held numerous meetings on Capitol Hill ; both Mr Bush and Mr Olmert sent messages to his rally .
These pressure groups are clearly influential .
Evangelical Christians make up about a quarter of the American electorate and are the bedrock of Mr Bush 's support .
Congressmen take on AIPAC at their peril .
But they deal with well - heeled lobbies every day .
And the power of the religious right can hardly explain why Democrats are so keen on Israel .
Two other factors need to be considered : the war on Islamic radicalism , and deep cultural affinities between America and Israel .
Seeing themselves in Israel
Americans instinctively see events in the Middle East through the prism of September 11th 2001 .
They look at Hizbullah and Hamas with their Islamist slogans and masked faces and see the people who attacked America — and they look at Israeli citizens and see themselves .
In America the “ war on terror ” is a fact of life , constantly reiterated .
The sense that America is linked with Israel in a war against Islamist extremism is reinforced by Iranian statements about wiping Israel off the surface of the earth , and by the political advance of the Islamists of Hamas in Palestine .
But the biggest reason why Americans are so pro-Israel may be cultural .
Americans see Israel as a plucky democracy in a sea of autocracies — a democracy that has every right to use force to defend itself .
Europeans , on the other hand , see Israel as a reminder of the atavistic forces — from nationalism to militarism — that it has spent the post - war years trying to grow beyond .
Americans are staunch nationalists , much readier to contemplate the use of force than Europeans .
A German Marshall Fund survey in 2005 found 42 % of Americans strongly agreeing that “ under some conditions , war is necessary to obtain justice ” compared with just 11 % of Europeans .
A Pew survey found that the same proportion of Americans and Israelis believe in the use of pre-emptive force : 66 % .
Continental European figures were far lower .
Yet all this unquestioning support does not mean that America will give Israel absolute carte blanche to do whatever it wills .
Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , was visibly shaken after the tragedy in Qana where at least 28 civilians , half of them children , were killed by Israeli bombs .
There are growing worries both about Israel 's conduct of the war and its wider impact on the Middle East .
Many of these anxieties are expressed by the “ realist faction ” .
Chuck Hagel , a Republican maverick , has given warning that America 's relationship with Israel “ cannot be at the expense of our Arab and Muslim relationships ” .
Richard Haass , a State Department official under George Bush senior who now heads the Council on Foreign Relations , has laughed publicly at the president 's “ birth of a new Middle East ” optimism about the crisis .
Some of the worries extend to conservatives .
Tony Blankley , a former press secretary for Newt Gingrich and a fire - breathing columnist for the Washington Times , says that “ We ignore world opinion at our peril . ”
A few cracks are starting to appear .
But they are still insignificant in the mighty edifice of support .
Getting in too - much touch ( interruption is not collaboration ) Jason 51 comments Latest by Martin
I just got back from the Collaborative Technologies Conference in Boston .
I was there to talk about some of the ideas behind how we collaborate at 37 signals .
You can download a PDF of my slides .
They ’re spartan so they may not make a whole lot of sense unless you were there , but I said I ’d post them for everyone at the conference so here they are .
[ UPDATE ] :
Here ’s a video of my talk .
I had a chance to listen to a few other speakers , and talk to some folks in the hallway before and after my talk , and there was one thing I kept hearing that troubled me :
Technology is making it easier and easier to interrupt people — both virtually and physically .
Well , they used “ collaborate , ” I ’m using “ interrupt . ”
Certain software vendors are hailing the promise of “ always - on location based awareness . ”
They suggest that knowing where everyone is all the time ( at the office , in the car , on the floor above you , in the building next door , on the road , etc. ) and being able to get in touch with anyone anywhere whenever is good for productivity .
I ’m not so sure .
The way I see it , interruption is being mistaken for collaboration .
The are drastically different things .
Interruption is productivity ’s biggest enemy .
It sounds counterintuitive to many , but we should be working harder on staying apart and less on getting in touch too much .
A healthy dose of physical and virtual distance is a good thing .
If we want to be highly productive we need more alone time .
Being productive is n’t something that just happens .
You do n’t just sit down and be productive .
Real productivity takes time .
It ’s a process .
You make your way into it .
Sometimes it takes 15 minutes or a half hour or an hour or more to really get in that zone .
And when you ’re in that zone you are actually getting real work done .
But once you get knocked out of that zone it takes a real toll on you .
You go from highly productive to annoyed .
And all these new methods of interruption , and the ability of anyone to find you any time , well , I think they ’re just making it easier to indirectly annoy people .
I do n’t have research to back this up , it ’s just a gut feeling .
There are different degrees of interruption too .
Passive interruption such as an IM or an email can be ignored until you ’re ready to deal with it .
But active interruption such as when someone physically comes over and taps you on the shoulder , or calls you into a physical meeting , well , that kind of interruption kills the “ productivity buzz . ”
And once that buzz is killed , it takes a while to get that buzz back .
So before you keep trying to keep in touch too much , think about stepping back and being quiet for a while .
You ’ll be surprised at how much more work you , and the person you were about to interrupt , will get done .

YouTube で 「 Monzy performs at Stanford Univ.」というタイトルのマニアックなラップが話題になっていました。
スタンフォード大学でバンドが演奏をしてる映像ですが、曲名が「 kill dash nine ( kill - 9 ) 」でした 。
その時点で半笑い状態だったんですが、内容も笑えました。
UNIXネタで音楽を作るという発想と根性が凄いと思いました。
カラオケでこの曲があったら歌いたいですね。
演奏の前フ リ
ボーカル : いやね、プロセスが走っていて、そのプロセスは自分がいつ終了すればいいかわからなくなっている時にはどうする？

Get rid of that abdominal fat with 3 yoga techniques
Today I am going to tell you three simple yoga asanas ( pose ) - Bhujang - asana , PavanMukt - asana and Urdhva Dhanur - asana , that will help you reduce your body fat specially targeting the your abdominal area .
And yes , just like all the workouts given here you can perform these three in your office itself WITHOUT any equipments except a
Bhujang - asana
This is the simplest of the three yoga asanas ( pose ) that we are going to learn today .
In Sanskrit Bhujang means king cobra , a huge and poisonous snake found in India , and so as the name suggest Bhujang - asana is the position that depicts the king cobra .
Technique :
Lie down on your stomach .
Keep your hands next to your chest folded on the elbows .
Take a deep breathe .
Now raise your upper body , apply force from the back and not from the hands .
Keep head straight .
Exhale while you raise your body .
Maintain the position for 15 seconds .
As you develop the stamina , increase this period to two minutes .
Now slowly lower your body to the ground and relax .
Other Benefits : Reduces neck pain and makes back muscles strong .
PavanMukt - asana
Pavan comes from the Sanskrit word " air " , Mukt from " free " .
PavanMukt means freeing or releasing the trapped gas from the stomach .
There are two variants of this asana - Ardha PavanMukt and PavanMukt .
Both are effective in improving the digestion .
Ardh PavanMukt - Technique :
Lie on your back .
Legs straight .
Arms on the side .
Take a deep breathe in .
Now while exhaling , fold the left knee , touching your chest .
Hold the knee with both your hands .
Now hold this position for 15 seconds .
Breathe normally .
After 15 seconds release the knee and bring it down .
Repeat with the right knee .
PavanMukt - Technique :
lie on you back as you do for Ardh PavanMukt .
Take a deep breathe in .
Now fold both the knees and hold them with your hands .
Hold the position for 15 seconds .
Release the knees and relax .
Repeat 10 times .
Other Benefits : Keeps the digestive system healthy , relieves constipation and indigestion , keeps and lungs healthy .
Urdhva Dhanur - asana or Chakar - asana
In sanskrit Urdhva means " upward " and Dhanur means " to bow " .
This pose looks like the performer is bending upwards towards the sky .
By far this is one of the most difficult asana .
So do n't loose heart if you are not able to perform this in first try .
Technique :
Stand straight , now sit on the floor by bending your knees .
Your buttocks should be touching your heels .
Lie down on you back without moving your legs .
Keep your arms on the side , folded on the elbows .
Inhale .
Now slowly raise your pelvis and shoulders by pushing your arms against the ground , exhale while doing this .
Try getting your forearms perpendicular to the ground .
Maintain the position for 15 seconds or as long as you can .
Lower the body slowly by bringing down your pelvis .
Other benefits : Makes lungs , joints and abdominal muscles strong and reduces back pain .
All these Asanas are difficult in the beginning , so try to maintain each pose for 10 - 15 seconds only .
With practice you should be able to increase this duration to 2 minutes .

I 've been looking for the Higgs boson for almost 20 years .
So there I was , on a Saturday morning in December , at CERN as it so happened , when I saw the graph we'd been working towards all year .
At first I thought it was some mistake - the hair literally rose up on the back of my neck , and I said : " Holy crap !
What 's that ? "
Where do I start ?
For a long time now our field of particle physics has been totally obsessed with finding this beast we call the Higgs .
We have a very successful mathematical model we call the Standard Model which has accounted all too well for hundreds of different experiments and observations of the fundamental particles in nature and how they interact .
My favorite analogy is that a hundred years ago we had the periodic table of the elements , which organized them all into neat rows and columns according to their chemical properties , from the halogens to the noble gases .
But a hundred years ago , no one had a clue as to why this was so .
It took another thirty years of experimenting and theorizing to figure it out .
That led to quantum mechanics , the solution to the hydrogen atom , and then the understanding of more complex atoms and molecules .
Then it all broke open : nuclear energy , silicon electronics , computers , cell phones ... not to mention NSA wire tapping and YouTube .
But I digress .
Now we have a neat little periodic table of the smallest of the small , the fundamental particles we call quarks and leptons :
It took the last 40 years since quarks were first imagined to get to the point where we are now .
This neat three - generation structure , though , is absolutely begging for answers to these questions :
Why do they have such different masses ?
Why just three generations ?
Why the weird fractional charges ?
( Or is the charge of the electron three more fundamental units of charge ? )
The Higgs boson is a particle which is essentially a by - product of the Standard Model , a sort of physical manifestation of a hypothetical " Higgs field " which permeates all space - time and with which all particles have some level of interaction .
The more interaction with the Higgs field , the more massive a particle is .
We call it a " boson " as opposed to a " fermion " ( all the quarks and leptons are fermions ) because it is thought to have no spin , no intrinsic angular momentum .
The Standard Model gave us no guidance , though , 30 years ago as to what the mass of the Higgs boson might be , except that it 's probably a good deal less than 1000 times more massive than the proton .
So , 20 years ago , we had an accelerator at CERN in Switzerland called LEP that was the first one that we thought might be able to produce the Higgs .
I was on one of the four big experiments there , called ALEPH ( a mythical monster with eyes in all directions ) and we started from the smallest masses we could , and worked our way up from there .
We kind of thought we had found it once , but it was a sort of experimental mirage .
I moved back to the US in 1993 and took up the hunt at the then - new Tevatron at Fermilab on the CDF experiment .
The LEP accelerator collided electrons with their antimatter opposites , positrons , at energies about 100 times that of the proton rest mass .
The Tevatron collides protons and antiprotons at energies 20 times greater than that !
Unfortunately , though , as we know nowprotons and antiprotons are bags of smaller particles called quarks , along with the " gluons " that hold them together .
( Good name , huh ? )
So it 's actually the quarks and gluons that collide , and so you do n't get all the energy into the interesting part of the collision .
In the end , the energy is closer to that of LEP , but occasionally greater .
Sometimes a lot greater .
To make Higgs bosons , in the case we are interested in , it 's actually the gluons that collide .
In fact the case we are interested in is not the Standard Model but an extension called supersymmetry .
If we discover supersymmetry , we 'll have job security for a lifetime because for every particle we know about , if supersymmetry is true there is a supersymmetric partner for it .
In the case of the Higgs boson , there is not one but four to discover !
Even better , if supersymmetry ( SUSY for short ) is there , then it 's possible that Higgs bosons will be produced at a greatly enhanced rate at the Tevatron .
That 's what I have been working on for a lot of years now in the CDF experiment .
If you produce a Higgs boson , then what ?
It decays , nearly instantly , into the heaviest quark - antiquark or lepton - antilepton pair it can .
For the Higgs masses we seek , this would be either a b and an anti-b quark , or a tau and an antitau lepton .
The tau lepton is without question my favorite .
It 's really just a heavy version of an electron , but its mass , about twice that of a proton , means that it decays in many interesting ways .
" Interesting " in the sense of the curse " may you live in interesting times " or " the IRS found your tax return interesting " .
Finding tau decays amidst the debris of your typical Tevatron proton - antiproton collision is one of the toughest experimental challenges there is .
It 's sort of like " Where 's Waldo ? " because quite often the ubiquitous quarks and gluons that come screaming out of the collision look just like tau decays .
I wo n't go into how we separate out the taus here - after 15 years of work we 're starting to get good at it at the Tevatron .
Good enough that only a small fraction of the time do we mistake quarks or gluons for taus , and we have ways to measure that .
The sort of work we do at Fermilab and CERN takes large teams - there are hundreds of physicists on the Tevatron experiments and thousands on the new CERN experiments .
Clearly you can't work with hundreds of people at once , so we organize ourselves into much smaller working groups which meet often to discuss the progress .
There is a whole pyramid structure of bigger and bigger meetings at which results are presented , criticized , and refined until , according to the rules of the collaboration , a result is " blessed " for release to the public .
I had been invited in October to present results of our search and other peoples ' searches for the SUSY Higgs at the annual Aspen Particle Physics meeting in January .
This is the kick - off international conference of each new year , and I was quite lucky to have been invited .
Our little team of CDF physicists saw this as a chance to show our fresh stuff , and so we worked like crazy all fall to get the result completed .
There were calibrations to make , cross checks to perform , and internal notes to write .
My part was the final extraction of the result , which we full well expected to be null - no sign of the Higgs .
These sorts of searches are like that : it 's like playing the long odds at roulette , with a small chance of winning but a big payoff if you do .
I 've been working with these guys , Amit Lath and Anton Anastassov , since 2001 on this project .
They were my colleagues when I was at Rutgers : Amit is a professor there and we hired Anton as a postdoc in 2000 .
They are two of the sharpest guys I know , and like me are infatuated with the tau and its possibilities .
The team also included two more junior talented guys : Dongwook Jang , formerly a grad student at Rutgers and now at Notre Dame as a postdoc , and Cristobal Cuenca , my student from Valencia .
Anton has done by far the most work on the project and he is the one that keeps the engine tuned up and humming .
Continuing the analogy , if the project were a car , I am the one to take it down a straight road very very fast , and Amit figures out where we are and how far we 've gone .
( Okay , enough of that . )
As honest scientists , we wait until we have performed all the checks and controls and have convinced our colleagues that we are ready before " opening the box " and seeing what is there or not .
In an earlier version of the result back in 2005 , we had seen nothing unusual .
The collisions we select are usually mostly from the production of Z bosons , the particle which , together with the W bosons , is responsible for the weak nuclear force .
It 's sort of a standard candle for us , and seeing the right number of them tells us we 've done our job correctly .
In fact , the mass of the Z is about 100 times that of the proton , and what we were looking for is probably about 20 - 50 % heavier than that .
So in addition to the big " bump " in our graph from Z events , we 'd also see a second , much smaller bump at higher masses , an excess over all the ordinary background signalling production of something new : SUSY Higgs bosons .
So , that Saturday , I was ready to go - we 'd gotten the green light to open the box , and I was ready to extract the final result .
I opened the box , made the plot , and there it was .
Holy crap !

Recovering New Orleans ’ dead subordinated to profit and politics
By John Levine
16 September 2005
One of the essential tasks in a disaster recovery operation — after evacuation and care for the living — is the removal of the dead .
This is essential both to prevent the spread of disease and to identify the remains of those who were lost .
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , however , federal and state authorities did not even begin the process for more than a week .
The delay in retrieving the bodies of Katrina ’s victims is one of the most telling examples of the indifference of the authorities to the massive human suffering caused by the disaster .
Incompetence and negligence — combined with contracting out the task to a private company — have resulted in a situation where bodies have been allowed to literally rot beyond recognition in the fetid flood waters that still cover large parts of New Orleans .
A major factor contributing to the delay in carrying out this grim task has been the Bush administration ’s concern about the impact that a rising body count will have on public opinion .
Having already come under sharp criticism for the devastating consequences of its botched response to the hurricane , the administration sought to delay for as long as possible news and images of the bodies adding to the mounting death toll .
The ham - fisted attempt of the top military officer in New Orleans , Lt. Gen.
Russel Honore , to block any news coverage of the recovery operation collapsed in the face of a legal challenge from the CNN cable television news network .
Honore ’s claim that the principal concern was “ dignity ” was belied by the blatant failure to do anything to collect bodies that littered the city ’s streets in the previous days .
The operation was rendered even more sordid by bitter disputes between the local authorities , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) and the private contractor — Kenyon International Emergency Services — over the terms of the commercial agreement struck for collecting corpses .
Louisiana ’s Democratic Governor Kathleen Blanco and FEMA officials haggled for days with Kenyon over a business deal giving them exclusive rights to profits from body recovery .
The New Orleans Times - Picayune quoted David Passey , a spokesman for FEMA , telling the newspaper he “ could not say why active - duty and National Guard soldiers have not been participating in the body collection process even though they constitute the largest relief personnel presence in the New Orleans area . ”
The paper also cites Ricardo Zuniga , another FEMA spokesman , who “ said Monday that the agency ’s policy barred military and municipal police officers from touching the bodies , except to tag them and report their location to higher authorities . ”
Spokesmen for Kenyon have said the company arrived in Louisiana in early September , but did not begin working until September 7 , and then only on the basis of an oral contract .
The company then threatened to leave , according to Blanco , when FEMA would not provide it with an acceptable written contract .
Governor Blanco stepped in , signing a deal with the company , even though she insisted that it was FEMA ’s responsibility .
The fact that the sensitive and urgent task of retrieving victims ’ bodies is contracted out to a private corporation is itself testimony to the contempt for Katrina ’s victims .
It is a prime example of how big business and its political representatives subordinate all aspects of social life to profit .
The operation was gripped by chaos as federal and local authorities conflicted over who was really in charge of signing the deal .
In 1997 , FEMA formed a working agreement with Kenyon to provide disaster relief services , including mobile morgues and body recovery services , according to a company spokesman .
Governor Blanco , too , said , “ recovery of bodies is a FEMA responsibility . ”
Yet , according to FEMA spokesman David Passey , “ From the beginning , the state had indicated that it will collect the bodies . ”
He directly contradicted Blanco , saying , “ The collection of bodies is not normally a FEMA responsibility . ”
He claimed that Blanco ’s administration had indicated it would take responsibility for the corpses , but then changed its mind , asking for federal assistance .
FEMA , according to Passey , then brought in Kenyon on an oral contract on September 7 , nine days after the hurricane , while it continued negotiations with company officials .
FEMA offered Kenyon a written contract , but the company rejected the deal .
“ It was a business decision , ” said Bill Berry , a spokesman for Kenyon .
The company began work with roughly 115 workers based on the oral contract , which had been set to expire Tuesday .
Berry complained that FEMA made no arrangements with the company to help it retrieve bodies .
After Kenyon threatened to withdraw its workers from the disaster region on Monday , the state of Louisiana signed its own contract with the company on Tuesday .
According to Reuters , “ The contract between the company and the state ’s Department of Health and Hospitals runs from September 12 to November 15 at a daily personnel rate of $ 118,980 , after a 10 percent discount .
Kenyon also estimated expenses of around $ 639,000 for the first 31 days of its mission , covering everything from body bags to trailers to laundry services for its staffers . ”
It will also provide for housing closer to New Orleans .
The company says it will increase its staff by the “ tens and twenties , if not more , ” from its current 115 .
If it had 150 workers in the area , that would amount to an average of nearly $ 800 per employee per day , surely with the bulk of the funds going to company profits and salaries of top executives based in Houston , Texas .
And this does not include expenses which will be charged to the state as the company deems fit .
Kenyon , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Service Corporation International ( SCI ) — which runs one of the largest chains of funeral homes in the country — worked at the World Trade Center site in 2001 as well as in Thailand to retrieve Australian citizens after last year ’s tsunami .
It also had a contract with the United Nations in Baghdad in the initial stages of the war to provide “ mortuary operations , family assistance and disposition of personal effects , ” according its web site .
Based in Houston and publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange , SCI owns 1,500 funeral homes throughout North America , and has been a close political supporter of George W. Bush since his days as governor of Texas .
SCI has been implicated in multiple scandals — involving unlicensed embalmers , the digging up and dumping of bodies to clear space for new graves and more profits and the stuffing of bodies sent for cremation into sheds .
When the company came under investigation in Texas during Bush ’s term as governor , an SCI employee threatened the lives of state regulators .
Nonetheless , Bush defended its CEO , Robert Waltrip , helping to scuttle the probe .
The Texas legislature , whose members also received political contributions from SCI employees , passed a law overhauling the Texas Funeral Service Commission , the agency in charge of regulating the funeral industry , and the investigators lost their posts .
The controversy led to a lawsuit by the commission ’s director against Bush , charging the then - Texas governor with obstructing a legal investigation and having her fired for refusing to go along .
Playing a prominent role in the scandal was Joe Allbaugh , then governor Bush ’s chief of staff and later his first appointment as FEMA ’s director .
Currently , Allbaugh ’s private firm is “ helping coordinate the private - sector response to the storm , ” according to the Washington Post .
One of Allbaugh ’s top clients is Kellogg Brown & Root , a subsidiary of Halliburton ( the company formerly run by Dick Cheney , the vice president ) , which is already profiting from reconstruction contracts in the Katrina disaster .

Checking our list of self - harmers was one of my first duties , and I noticed that there was a " code blue " on a female prisoner yesterday evening .
She had tied a ligature round her neck , and an officer went into her room and cut it off .
Self - harming is an issue in our unit - in February we had 140 incidents .
The women break the plastic cutlery to cut themselves , or rip up the sheets to tie ligatures .
What we try to do here is to keep them busy .
When I arrived at 7.30 , the prisoners were having their breakfast .
They are given any medication afterwards , and at nine we start moving them to their education classes or work .
The ones who stay in the unit clean their cells or have a bath before going outside to the exercise yard .
They have their lunch at about 11.45 , and then go back into their rooms .
At 1.30 we move them to education or work again , and some go to the calm room , a therapeutic place where they can have their hair or nails done , or just relax .
Female prisoners are much more dependent on the staff than male prisoners .
The women have specific worries about their children and families and can get quite distressed .
They are in their rooms again at four , where they have a radio ( and will soon have television ) .
Dinner is at five , and between six and seven they have association time .
At eight they are back in their rooms .
The job is stressful , but I love it .
Sometimes I wonder , looking at the prisoners , why they are here in the first place .
Many of them are eventually moved to secure hospitals .
They are vulnerable women with a lot of problems .
If I am lucky I leave around 5.30 , but I can be in the unit until 9.30 .

Serving four years at HMP Cardiff
I got up at half past seven and the doors were unlocked at quarter to eight .
I put down my food choices for later in the day , had a shower , had breakfast , exercised and then at 8.30 , I went to work .
I have three jobs : as a cleaner on my landing , as a server of food and as a " listener " .
A listener is someone who is trained to listen to other prisoners ' problems .
We can't help with anything practical , but we can give them advice on how to deal with things .
Loneliness comes up the most .
People when they 're first here do n't know what to do .
We break the ice .
After lunch you get two sessions for visitors - my mum came to see me today .
And there are gym sessions four times a week .
You come back from work at 4.30 ; people who serve the food are let out at 5.30 , dinner is at 6 , then prisoners are banged up 8 .
The food is OK ; there 's halal if you want it .
I 'm a Muslim , and on Wednesdays and Fridays there are facilities for worship .
Boredom is the big problem .
There 's a library open three times a week .
I read faith books ; Islamic books .
I 'm all right .

First ever day in prison .
Serving 12 months for deception at HMP Wandsworth , London
It 's better than what I was expecting .
I was scared .
I expected it to be more austere , and that people would give me unpleasant looks .
I woke up at 7.40 today , but waited until my cellmate was up before putting the telly on .
He is also a first - timer , and had been advised not to speak about his crime .
Some people do , some do n't .
We had a cup of tea and waited for somebody to open the door to let us out .
I was surprised by how decent the facilities were - three individual showers , for example .
I expected to be freaked out here , but feel quite matter - of - fact about it all .
My cellmate is having a more difficult time , and I 've been trying to calm him .
He 's a smoker , and I 'm not .
But he 's sensitive to that and smokes by the window , which I appreciate .
We got lunch at 12 .
Tuna bake , rice and broccoli .
Again , it was pretty good .
After lunch we were locked up .
In the afternoon I was moved to another cell .
The new guy I 'm sharing with also smokes , but he 's not so considerate .
That could be an issue .
I 'm pretty intolerant about smoking .
I 've been surprised by the amount of people who have offered help - mostly prisoners .
I hope to be out of here within six months .
There is zero chance of me reoffending - no way am I coming back here .
Paul Saunders , 43
Search officer at HMP Whitemoor maximum - security prison , near Peterborough
I arrived as normal at eight .
There was a meeting in the security department where the intelligence gathered over the past day is discussed .
We know who the players are .
There 's a hierarchy on every wing .
We do late searches and early searches , depending on the intelligence .
When we search , we 'll arrive at a prisoner 's door or collect them from work .
First , we give them the opportunity to tell us what they have .
Everyone is strip - searched but we do n't touch them - they remove their clothes and we search hems and seams .
If the intelligence is good we ask to " squat " the prisoner .
It is up to him if he squats .
He will go down on his haunches so if he is what we call " cheeking " something it will fall out .
It 's not something we relish .
It 's degrading for both parties and embarrassing , but unfortunately it is warranted , given the way these individuals secrete stuff .
Sometimes prisoners have items hidden higher up but we do n't do intrusive searches .
We can only wait and monitor them until something comes out .
We always check their cell in pairs .
We 're not thugs ; we do n't go around smashing stuff .
We leave the cell as we would like to find it ourselves .
We usually have a little laugh with the prisoner and tell him the only thing we have n't done is make his bed .
Phil Wheatley , 58
Director general of the prison service , based in London
I arrive in the office at 7.40 to face an overflowing in - tray , which I have to go through very carefully .
Within it there are difficult decisions to make and problems to examine , so I can't afford not to read through everything .
Managing a service with 80,000 inmates means I can't leave things hanging around .
I abandoned breakfast years ago and make do with fruit before I leave home .
Once the in - tray is complete , I go into a series of back - to - back meetings .
Much of my work at the moment is dealing with the overcrowding .
There have been substantial increases in population , which means many of the prisoners have to move around a lot .
Lunch is a sandwich at the desk , which I bring from home and eat while I work .
The big things that worry me are tight resourcing and full prisons .
However , much of my time is spent pointing out that there is n't a crisis in the prison service .
The rate of absconds and assaults has come down and we are coming in on budget .
By six , I am getting ready to leave the office .
But I always carry my bleeper with me .

Serving eight months for money laundering and having fake documents , HMP Holloway , London
I was pregnant when I came here in September and was put in C4 , a unit for pregnant women .
After my daughter Simi was born , I went to D4 , the mother - and - baby unit .
There are 10 of us on here , with babies ranging from newborn to eight months .
Then you have to move to another prison , which takes mothers and babies up to 18 months .
My day started at 6 - that 's the time my baby wakes up .
The officers come around at seven and say good morning ; you have to be ready by 7.30 and then you have breakfast .
After that , my baby goes to a creche and I have classes from nine .
We can study for qualifications .
My favourite class is art : I 'm learning how to make a baby blanket by sewing together different patches .
I 'm also learning how to cook for my baby .
She 's my first , I want to get it right .
We break off for lunch at 12 , then from two you can go back to education or stay on the unit with your baby or go to the gym .
The creche is nice , with toys .
We have dinner about five and there are five or six choices , including vegetarian .
It 's not bad .
At eight we go to our rooms .
I have a toilet , a single bed and my baby 's crib in my room , as well as a telly and a cupboard .
People can send you bed covers , so you 're not using prison stuff .
I 've got another 11 weeks to go .
Liam Bailes , 19
Serving four years for causing death by dangerous driving , at Swinfen Hall young offenders institution , Staffordshire
I 've got a working - out placement , so I get a wake up call at seven and get picked up about 8.30 in the prison minibus and taken to the Acorn charity shop in Lichfield , where I work until 4.30 .
It 's a massive relief to be out there , it speeds time up , and it's a relief to talk about different things .
We get back at five , and are strip - searched on the way in .
The first time it 's very daunting , but by now I 'm used to it .
You take your top off first , put it back on , and then your bottoms , and you can get it over quickly .
I 'm back on the wing by 5.15 for tea , and from 6.15 onwards it 's associative time : you 're expected to socialise , to play pool and have a chat with your mates .
After a few months I started to think there were only so many games of pool I could play so I started doing library orderly duties and mentoring other young offenders .
It gave me a bit of an insight into teaching , and I think when I get out that 's what I want to do .
At eight we get locked into our cells .
It 's up to us when we turn our lights off - I usually read or watch TV until about 11 .
It does get lonely sometimes .
If you 've had bad news , or a bad day , once that door closes you think , " I wish I had someone to talk to . "
When I started my sentence , back in May 2005 , I thought a lot about how much time I had to go , and about the accident - about being responsible for it , about what people must be thinking of me .
There was no malign intent with the accident .
I just did n't think about what I was doing .
Since I 've been inside I 've always conducted myself properly , and never caused trouble for anyone else .
It 's the demons inside that you can't get away from .
David Bulman , 49
Father of Ronnie , a 19 - year - old who died in custody while awaiting trial .
Tattooed his face after the inquest
I got up at six , made a cup of tea and went immediately to the computer to see if any government bodies have responded to my emails detailing the concerns I have about Ronnie 's death , in July 2005 , at Castington young offenders institution .
No responses today , so I started scouring the internet looking for email addresses of high - profile people who take an interest in the prison system .
When our son was remanded in custody , we thought that at least he would be safe .
How wrong can you be ?
I have another cup of tea at 11 and start writing to people who do n't have email addresses .
At midday I start looking up different cases of deaths in custody to see what similarities there are to Ronnie 's death .
Then on to the prison service 's website to see the rules for checking prisoners during the night .
Staff should get a " verbal or facial response " , but when Ronnie was checked at 4 am we know he had vomited down his shirt and would have been gasping for breath .
The alarm was not raised for more than four hours .
Have something to eat and start writing more letters , looking for solicitors who will apply for a judicial review and / or try and take our case to Europe .
Go to bed , knowing that today 's routine will continue until we get the truth about how our son died .
Kenneth Hanson , 54
Literacy mentor and laundry orderly .
Serving 11 years for drug importation , HMP Garth , Lancashire
Unlocked at 8 am as normal and shot down to the laundry to get the first wash on .
I had breakfast at the same time ; multitasking .
I have one mentee on our reading programme ( organised by the Shannon Trust ) and he is profoundly dyslexic .
He is the most challenging I have ever had .
He arrives at nine and we read for about an hour .
I saw him just after he arrived from HMP Leeds and I realised he could n't read the menus .
Now he can read his daughter 's letters .
I am doing an Open University degree in social science and I work while doing the washing .
I made a decision when I received my sentence that I was not going to waste the time .
I had lunch at 11.30 - jacket potato and chicken supreme - and we were back in cells at 12 .
Unlock was at 1.45 , and I went back to the laundry .
Tea at 4.30 to five and we were banged up again at five until 5.45 and free association .
People played table tennis and snooker .
At 7.45 we were banged up again until the following morning .
I studied a bit , watched TV , did a bit of modelling , my hobby .
I am Category B. Maybe at the end of March I will be downgraded to Category C. I get on with other inmates ; if I have learned one thing , it is that they would really take it badly if their washing was to be mixed up .
I make sure it never happens .
Duncan Hallam , 45
Doctor , HMP Lancaster Castle , Lancaster
I arrived at Lancaster Castle - which is in an actual Norman castle - at eight .
I 've been treating prisoners here for nearly 12 years now .
I collected my keys and went through to the healthcare department , where I asked the nursing team if they 'd had any problems over the weekend .
There had been an assault , and the alleged perpetrator had been put in segregation .
There were four other men in there : one who'd had a falling out with someone on his wing and did n't feel safe there , and three who were being punished .
It was an unusual day in that only four patients had booked in , two of whom did n't turn up , and two of whom were late .
Usually I get about 10 .
Generally , two of those will try to persuade me to prescribe opiate - based medication , and at least two will have a mental - health problem .
Seventy per cent of prisoners have some mental - health issue , usually depression .
You also get untreatable personality disorders ; sometimes it 's difficult to tell these apart from treatable psychiatric illnesses .
We treat a lot of hepatitis C and smoking - related ailments .
Fights do happen , so we get black eyes , bruises , bite - marks .
There 's the occasional allegation of rape .
For me , the hardest to deal with are the patients who persistently self - harm , the ones who cut themselves , attempt to hang themselves , or swallow razors .
Some have been on drugs since they were 12 , and have terrible backgrounds , and you think , " This chap had no chance . "
I 'm regularly faced with manipulative behaviour , and sometimes you have to be quite firm .
Once I had a desk turned over on me , but that 's the worst that has happened .
Bekir ' Dukie ' Arif , 53
In the 10th year of a 24 - year sentence for drug distribution , Whitemoor maximum security prison , near Peterborough
Another interrupted night 's sleep ; the night screw , who must wear size - 18 boots , given the noise he makes , shone his torch in my face every hour .
Unlocked at five to eight and I made an application for money to go on my Pin numbers , so I can make phone calls .
Called to labour at 8.55 , checked off the wing with a rubdown and metal detector .
The work - breaking up used CDs - is about as mind - numbing as it gets .
Finished work at 11.10 am , checked back on wing , then exercised in a small yard - totally inadequate .
Gave my lunch away , as usual , then back to work in the afternoon .
Locked up until just gone five , then association till 7.10 before lock - up for the night .
My big concern right now is that my daughter visited me regularly until she was 16 .
Then she was deemed an adult and had to be security cleared .
Up to now , this has taken 19 months , which was when I last saw her .
This is my own daughter , remember .
Graham Kerridge , 41
Cat C officer , D wing , HMP Wayland , Norfolk
At 8.20 am we unlocked the prisoners .
Once everyone was out of their cells they went off to work .
Wayland has immense training facilities .
You have prisoners coming in with no qualifications and leaving with Open University degrees .
There are bricklaying courses , plumbing courses , everything .
We then collated the prison roll to make sure no one was missing .
I did my core duties on the wing , which involved making sure the cleaners were working , undertaking security searches and checking that the prisoners ' parole papers were up to date .
I 'm the personal officer to about 12 prisoners - I got to know them personally when they first came onto the wing .
Every day I sit down with one of them and help him go through his paperwork , try and facilitate visits etc .
You build up a rapport .
You get to know about their family life .
I f you spend time with the prisoners it makes your day that much easier .
Most of the prisoners just call me Mr K and there 's very rarely any trouble .
By about 11.30 am the prisoners fi nished working and went to the exercise yard for half an hour .
I patrolled the wings until they returned to their cells for lunch .
I then went to the staff room to eat before heading to the gym .
We use the same facilities as the inmates - it 's a top - class gym - and it's not unheard of for offi cers to work out with the prisoners .
The prisoners came back from work at 4.30 and got locked up straight away .
At 5.30 they had a recreation period where they were allowed to play snooker and watch TV , then at eight everyone went back in the cells .
We collated the roll again and I went home just after eight .
I enjoy my job from the time I get into work until the time I go home .
Anne Owers , 59
Chief inspector of prisons , London
I arrived to the usual flurry of emails .
One was about an event I went to concerning people in prison who have learning disabilities .
Another related to a trip to Poland to talk to their ombudsman and look at their prisons .
We have many things in common , such as overcrowding and the challenges of monitoring the prisons .
Our system is generally regarded as a model for how to do it .
I looked at a letter from the west Yorkshire coroner .
I gave evidence there last week at the inquest of a mentally ill young woman who killed herself .
The fi gures are startling .
Women are 5 % of the population but account for over 50 % of the self - harm cases .
Later in the day I signed off a press release for a report on Edmonds Hill Prison , Suff olk .
I produce 74 inspection reports a year but only about half a dozen get any publicity .
When I give a prison a good report , which happens quite a lot , I tell them that the bad news is that hardly anyone will get to hear about it .
There have been huge improvements in prison healthcare , education and training , but with the population at this level I worry if it can besustained .
Maybe we will look back and say this is as good as it got .
Eduard Ngienga Lukombo , 33
Asylum - seeker awaiting deportation with wife Angelina , 29 , Ashley , 4 , and Joshua , 11 months , Yarls Wood removal centre , Bedfordshire
We wake at seven to feed the children .
I try to go back to sleep but thoughts of how we were snatched from our home in Glasgow invade my mind .
A friend telephones ; he is worried about the children .
I try to get them to change my wife 's medication - they took hers away when we came here and the replacement is n't working .
Likewise my daughter 's medication for eczema .
At noon I try to pray but cannot concentrate - images of us being forced into a van and taken to airport come back .
We were taken off the fl ight at the last minute , but I can hear the screams of the other Congolese being forced onto the plane .
My son has had constipation ever since we came here .
Both children , who were born in the UK , are confused and cry all the time .
This behaviour is not their habit and my wife is not able to handle the new personalities they have acquired in detention .
In the afternoon I sit gazing out of the window .
I get a call from my pastor who encourages me to hope in God .
At 10 pm we go to bed , but my eyes stay open .
The family were released at the end of last week .
Sandra M , 30
Criminal justice link worker for the Prison Advice and Care Trust ( Pact ) , HMP Holloway , London
It 's my job to offer practical and emotional support to women on their first day in prison , both women who have never been in custody before and those who are in on new charges .
On a busy day we might see as many as 23 prisoners , but today was quiet - only 10 .
One woman I saw was a tearful single mum who had just been sentenced to three months for not sending her kids to school , and had never been prosecuted for anything before .
When she went to court she had told her four children that she was just going to the shops , so none of them knew she was in prison .
When I called her oldest daughter , who was 21 , they were both very upset .
Like a lot of people , her idea of prison comes from Bad Girls , and she was worried that her mum would get beaten up .
Then I called the woman 's sister to see if she could look after the younger children .
Two of the prisoners were foreign nationals , one a Chinese woman on remand for having forged documents and one a Pole in for burglary .
Neither could speak English and were very puzzled as to why they were there .
So with the help of some prisoners who could speak their languages , I was able to explain the situation and make international phone calls to inform their relatives .
Alison Adams , 56
Chaplain , Glen Parva young offenders institution , Leicester
The day begins with the first person coming in , lighting a candle in the chapel , saying a prayer and checking the answerphone .
You might have had a call from an anxious parent or a prisoner wanting to come and talk .
A big part of the job is to do receptions - there are two of us , and one sees every prisoner as they come in .
I ask them simple questions like , " Did you sleep last night ? " or " Do your parents know you are here ? "
This afternoon I did some music teaching .
We have a band and I was struck by the development in self - esteem of one individual .
He said he had not played for ages and wanted to keep it up when he got out .
One played a tune he had written called Glen Parva Blues .
It had us all tapping our feet .
I also spent some time in the segregation unit .
Sometimes they are just glad to see a face - it 's not easy being isolated .
I took a rosary for someone who wanted that .
We have a capacity of 808 in Glen Parva .
Around 46 attended chapel on Sunday and 40 - odd Friday prayers .
Tonight I took Bible study .
Imagine exploring the issue of forgiveness with a sex offender or someone who has committed GBH .
We have some very interesting discussions .
I tend to go home at about 8 pm , having started at 8 am .
It 's hard work but I love it .
This map shows the thickness of the south polar layered deposits of Mars , an ice - rich geologic unit that was probed by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) on board ESA ’s Mars Express .
The thickness of the layered deposits was determined by measuring the time delay between radar echoes from the surface and those from the lower boundary , or ‘ bed ’ , of the deposits .
The radar data indicate that the deposit , larger than than a big portion of Europe in area , is more than 3.7 kilometres thick in places , and that the material consists of nearly pure water ice with only a small component of dust .
The map was generated by comparing the elevation of the bed as determined by MARSIS with the high - resolution map of surface topography obtained by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter ( MOLA ) aboard NASA ’s Mars Global Surveyor .
The thickness of the layered deposits is shown by colors , with purple representing the thinnest areas , and red the thickest .
The total volume of ice in the layered deposits is equivalent to a water layer 11 metres deep , if spread evenly across the planet .
The boundary of the layered deposits was mapped by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey .
The dark circle in the upper center is the area pole - ward of 87 ° south latitude , where MARSIS data can not be collected .
The map covers an area 1670 by 1800 kilometres .

The amount of water trapped in frozen layers over Mars ' south polar region is equivalent to a liquid layer about 11 metres deep covering the planet .
This new estimate comes from mapping the thickness of the dusty ice by the Mars Express radar instrument that has made more than 300 virtual slices through layered deposits covering the pole .
The radar sees through icy layers to the lower boundary , which in places is as deep as 3.7 kilometres below the surface .
" The south polar layered deposits of Mars cover an area as wide as a big portion of Europe .
The amount of water they contain has been estimated before , but never with the level of confidence this radar makes possible , " said Dr. Jeffrey Plaut of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena ( California ) , co-Principal Investigator for the radar and lead author of the study .
The instrument , named the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) , is also mapping the thickness of similar layered deposits at the north pole of Mars .
“ Our radar is doing its job extremely well , ” said Prof. Giovanni Picardi of the University of Rome ‘ La Sapienza , ’ Principal Investigator for the instrument .
“ MARSIS is showing to be a very powerful tool to probe underneath the Martian surface , and it ’s showing how our team ’s goals – such as probing the polar layered deposits - are being successfully achieved , ” he continued .
“ Not only MARSIS is providing us with the first ever views of Mars ’ subsurface at those depths , but the details we are seeing are truly amazing .
We are expecting even greater results when we will have concluded an on - going , sophisticated fine - tuning of our data processing methods .
These should enable us to understand even better the surface and subsurface composition . ”
Polar layered deposits hold most of the known water on modern Mars , though other areas of the planet appear to have been very wet at times in the past .
Understanding the history and fate of water on Mars is a key to studying whether Mars has ever supported life , because all known life depends on liquid water .
Plaut , Picardi and 22 other researchers report analysis of the Mars Express radar instrument 's south polar observations in the online edition of the journal Science this week .
The polar layered deposits extend beyond and beneath a polar cap of bright - white frozen carbon dioxide and water at Mars ' south pole .
Dust darkens many of the layers .
However , the strength of the echo that the radar receives from the rocky surface underneath the layered deposits suggests the composition of the layered deposits is at least 90 percent frozen water .
One area with an especially bright reflection from the base of the deposits puzzles researchers .
It resembles what a thin layer of liquid water might look like to the radar instrument , but the conditions are so cold that the presence of melted water is deemed highly unlikely .
Detecting the shape of the ground surface beneath the ice deposits provides information about even deeper structure of Mars .
" We did n't really know where the bottom of the deposit was , " Plaut said .
" We can see now that the crust has not been depressed by the weight of the ice as it would be on the Earth .
The crust and upper mantle of Mars are stiffer than the Earth 's , probably because the interior of Mars is so much colder . "
The results appear in the 15 March 2007 issue of the Science magazine , in an article by J. Plaut , G. Picardi et al. , titled : " Subsurface Radar Sounding of the South Polar Layered Deposits of Mars . "

Why in 2006 are we engaged in a public discussion of torture ?
Why do prominent lawyers and columnists promote torture ?
Why at this time are we reading memos written by top U.S. officials that justify their power to torture ?
Why do we hear our Vice - President affirm that torturing by means of water is justifiable ?
Why does our Congress pass laws to legalize heinous acts of torture ?
Why do we learn that our military has been torturing captives ?
Why do we learn that the CIA , continuing a long history of black deeds , has operated secret and not - so - secret torture hideaways in foreign lands ?
Our officials simultaneously deny that torture is occurring under their command , while they ( A ) seek and pass legislation that absolves them of culpability of past crimes of torture , ( B ) seek and pass legislation that allows them to torture captives , and ( C ) tell us that torture is necessary for the safety of the American public .
Why are all these events happening now ?
Did n’t nations agree to outlaw torture ?
Why is the U.S. now ( again ) flouting the Geneva Convention ?
Is torture necessary to save American lives and prevent another 9/11 catastrophe ?
Why now ?
When individual murderers or serial killers torture their victims before killing them , sensational stories are published .
These dreadful cases are so uncommon that we learn the names of the killers .
Isolated individuals rarely engage in torture .
We do not hear about torture murder being a systematic feature of day - to - day life .
We only begin to hear about systematic torture when conditions are ripe for it .
Torture becomes widespread when conditions exist that bring out bestial and cruel behavior in human beings and break down the usual moral inhibitions .
What are these conditions ?
( 1 ) Torture typically arises when there are powerful figures of authority like high priests , kings , emperors , generals , bureaucrats , dictators , and presidents who possess the power to torture , often without detection ; ( 2 ) Torture will rise if there is greater public indifference , sympathy , acquiescence , or even approval .
Polls suggest that about 58 percent of Americans are against torture and 36 percent would allow some degree of torture .
The world averages are 59 and 29 percent , respectively .
( 3 ) Torture arises when there exists an enemy — real , imagined , or exaggerated — such as religious heretics , Algerian resistance fighters , terrorists , insurgents , or unlawful enemy combatants .
Even at lower levels of authority , such as with police forces and prison authorities , one - sided brutality , mistreatment , and sometimes torture arise .
The enemies in these cases are common criminals , hippies , rioters , draft - dodgers , or simply unruly people who seem to threaten the police , the prison , society and the social order .
Again , cruelty and injustice are more likely when the public goes along with it .
Usually it is war or violent struggle against an enemy that give rise to state - run and state - approved torture on a noticeable scale .
Often the enemy is viewed as a shadowy conspiracy against society and its authorities .
The torturers may want confessions to scare off other heretics or insurgents or to show they are doing their job .
They may want information concerning the conspiracy whose dim outlines they fear .
They may be part of the state ’s control apparatus over their own population .
The conspiracy or enemy is seen as a danger that must be stamped out by any means , even immoral and evil means like torture .
The moral element has to be negated or overcome .
It takes training or indoctrination to produce torturers who overcome their compunctions and consciences .
It takes a system .
The U.S. military has provided such training to the U.S. Army Special Forces in the past with the involvement of the CIA .
Between 1946 and 1984 , the U.S. military taught torture at the School for the Americas in Panama , later moved to Fort Benning , Georgia .
The CIA has been the main locus of U.S. torture capabilities .
The list of authorities , usually state and government authorities , that have tortured is very long , covering many places , times , and forms of government .
There were four separate Inquisitions in the Middle Ages : French , Spanish , Portuguese , and Roman .
English kings have tortured .
American soldiers employed water torture in the Philippine - American War ( 1899 — 1902 ) against natives .
The CIA has used torture for decades .
The British government operated a secret torture center in London during World War II .
America ’s South Vietnamese ally tortured .
To this can be added Nazis , Communists , Fascists , South American dictators , Middle Eastern countries including Israel and Iraq , etc .
States use torture to maintain control over their own populations , that is , to suppress dissidents , rebels , or enemies within .
And they use it to maintain control over insurgents in distant territories or colonies .
Today we face all the conditions that tend to generate torture .
We have powerful officials of state who want torture , long - established intelligence and military bureaucracies that train for torture , a divided public whose feelings do not run high against torture , and shadowy enemies .
The torture bureaucracies
A good many articles tell us that torture is ineffective and explain why it is not effective .
Interrogation along humane lines is said to produce better results .
These articles counter the impression left by U.S. officials that torture has saved American lives .
There is some truth to the theory that torture is ineffective , or at least that it ’s not as effective as one might believe .
There ’s enough plausibility to this theory that it pays us to think through what such an idea really means .
But at the same time , torture surely accomplishes some of what it sets out to do , even if it does so inefficiently .
Did n’t Saddam Hussein hold his rule partly through torture ?
Did n’t Stalin and Papa Doc Duvalier use such methods ?
Did n’t Mao Zedong employ extensive torture in his 1968 Cleansing Class Ranks campaign ?
Suppose that torture is actually a poor way to achieve the results it ’s aimed at .
Then why do we observe it cropping up again and again under the same conditions ?
Is it an error ?
Quite possibly it is .
I ’ve argued in the past that reliance on the state is a longstanding error , in part because the connection between the state ’s actions and the effects of its actions are hard for people to discern and disentangle from other causes .
Furthermore , the state propagandizes on its own behalf and its accountability is diffuse .
These factors make it hard for people at large to develop an appropriate , reliable , and strongly - held folk wisdom that the state actually harms rather than helps them .
Torture presents a similar situation .
In the U.S. , the episodes of torture occur once a generation or so , and society has no solid institutional memory of how well or badly it works .
It has been 35 years since the Vietnam episode .
The authorities can spin the torture theme to their own ends and manipulate public opinion .
What works against their success in selling torture is the strong moral inhibition against its use , so the authorities hammer away at this by emphasizing the expediency of the torture .
Since the public has no strong experience or knowledge base about torture , a large fraction becomes persuaded that the moral rules can be broken for the sake of saving lives .
If torture is largely ineffective , why is it perpetuated ?
It ’s like many government programs that go on and on and on .
First and foremost , torture is not done by runaway individuals within the state .
Torture is done via bureaucratic or hierarchical methods within a state ’s power structure .
One set of people orders it done .
Another set of people sets it up .
Another set of people actually does it .
The torture is veiled in secrecy .
The torturers are removed from the powers above them that endorse the torture .
All the parties involved feel a need to justify that what they are doing works .
But there is usually no systematic checking up that the torture is effective .
Afterwards , members of the bureaus and the public may possibly become aware of anecdotal reports from disenchanted torturers , rival interrogators , and those tortured that suggest that the torture did n’t achieve its aim .
But such spasmodic reports have little impact on the broad public or even on the torture bureaucracies that always shy away from taking responsibility for anything anyway .
In government , few really know what is going on .
Few know whether it ’s doing any good or not .
Few care .
Many are protecting themselves .
Whistleblowers are ignored or dealt with .
Public outrage is deflected .
The FBI , which may believe in benign interrogation , will have no strong interest in promoting its views against the CIA , which may believe in brutality .
The higher - ups are disinterested , or interested only in knowing that there have been some good results that they can trumpet in order to make themselves look good .
Even if there are no good results , there are always those officials who want to show that they are doing something to protect the public .
The whole situation is typical of the state and the state ’s bureaucracies .
A second set of factors has to do with the top officials .
Like the public , most of the higher - ups are also ignorant of whether torture is effective or not .
This means that most officials do not have strong feelings one way or another .
Furthermore , being men and women of power , these officials are less likely to be as morally inhibited as the typical citizen is .
In such a situation , if there are a few officials who have strong pro-torture beliefs , they can persuade the fence - sitters to activate or expand the torture capabilities that already exist within some of the state ’s bureaus .
The bottom line is that while many citizens condemn torture and get sick to their stomachs over it , and while many innocents and captives are being destroyed by the torture apparatus of the state , the state ’s cruelties grind on .
The utilitarian fallacy
The main argument in favor of the current round of torture is the utilitarian one that it has saved or is saving American lives .
We do not have enough information to verify whether this statement is true or false , but neither do those who make it and they ca n’t get such information .
If the knowledge that Americans torture captives hardens resistance against the U.S. and creates more insurgents , then torture has cost American lives .
Torture may cost the lives or sanity of some torturers .
It may teach Americans to ignore other moral rules and generate further evils .
Because the utilitarian cannot measure or know the multiple negative effects of torture like these , he is incapable of ever proving the statement that torture saves American lives .
There are deeper objections to the utilitarian defense of torture .
In the utilitarian ethic , a bad act is allowable if its good consequences more than outweigh the bad .
This is supposed to provide a guiding rule by which people live .
But we must ask " Who is going to do the bad act , such as the torturing ? "
Will it be each of us in our daily lives ?
Will we each make judgments that we can do evil acts because we think the good coming from them outweighs their evil ?
Without moral guidelines , how can we possibly make such judgments , and wo n’t they lead to chaos ?
How can we judge amounts of good and bad and the ramifications of our evil acts ?
Suppose anyone can commit an evil act if he believes that the good it generates outweighs it .
Wo n’t the moral distinction between good and evil simply break down as everyone does what he pleases according to his own judgment ?
Wo n’t the distinction between evil - doers and good - doers break down ?
How can we distinguish a victim from an aggressor if the aggressor argues or believes that he is doing good by some malicious act ?
It is clear that utilitarian rules ca n’t be used at an individual level as a general way of life without creating chaos .
Can they possibly be used at a group or social level ?
This raises more questions .
Who can oversee this process ?
Who judges the amounts of good and evil ?
Who says it is all right to euthanize old people so that the living will live better ?
Who draws the lines ?
The state ?
Its employees ?
Will some authorities be allowed to commit these crimes on behalf of everyone else ?
But then who monitors them and decides whether what they are doing has a net benefit to everyone else ?
Who controls them ?
Even if a group process is followed , the distinction between good and evil , between evil - doer and good - doer breaks down .
Suppose , however , that somehow standards of good and evil are maintained .
The utilitarian ethic leads to a few people , or some of the people , or even a majority of the people making life and death decisions for the rest .
But in this process , whether it be done by individuals or by social groups , parties , or the state , there are no fixed standards of good and evil .
The utilitarian standards , if they exist at all , are man-made .
This means that they are subjective , changeable , and biased .
This means they are open to abuse .
Changing rules of good and evil must ultimately lead to confusion , clashes , and social disorder .
Instead , suppose that we have a fixed rule .
Murder is forbidden , period , because it is inherently evil .
It ’s evil because it violates God ’s commandment .
We have a once - and - for - all judgment from above , from beyond mankind .
We have a clear line that avoids confusion .
We have a moral law that everyone can understand and implement .
We have a stable and constant rule , an absolute rule that prevents abuse .
Such a law makes the human being inviolate .
We either have such a law or we do not .
Without such a moral law , we have an unsettled utilitarian ethic .
We have chaos , bias , and injustice .
With such a law , we have order , freedom , and justice .

A few religious words
In Genesis 49 , Jacob said of two of his sons : 5 " Simeon and Levi [ are ] brothers ; Instruments of cruelty [ are in ] their dwelling place .
6
Let not my soul enter their council ;
Let not my honor be united to their assembly ;
For in their anger they slew a man , And in their self - will they hamstrung an ox .
7 Cursed [ be ] their anger , for [ it is ] fierce ;
And their wrath , for it is cruel !
I will divide them in Jacob And scatter them in Israel . "
Simeon and Levi are condemned for harboring instruments of cruelty and using them in their wrath against men and oxen .
Psalm 74 says : 20 " Have respect to the covenant ;
For the dark places of the earth are full of the haunts of cruelty . "
The CIA ’s covert prison facilities are termed " black sites " in official documents .
God ’s covenant and laws are opposed to these places of cruelty .
Ezekiel 34 speaks against the cruelties of the misbehaving shepherds of Israel : 4 " The weak you have not strengthened , nor have you healed those who were sick , nor bound up the broken , nor brought back what was driven away , nor sought what was lost ; but with force and cruelty you have ruled them . "
Leviticus 19 speaks of mistreating the deaf and blind : 14 " You shall not curse the deaf , nor put a stumbling block before the blind , but shall fear your God : I [ am ] the LORD . "
Is it coincidence that the U.S. military blindfolds and hoods its captives , or that it deafens them and others with obnoxious sounds ?
Pope Paul VI promulgated Gaudium et Spes ( December 7 , 1965 ) , in which was written : " Furthermore , whatever is opposed to life itself , such as any type of murder , genocide , abortion , euthanasia or wilful self - destruction , whatever violates the integrity of the human person , such as mutilation , torments inflicted on body or mind , attempts to coerce the will itself ; whatever insults human dignity , such as subhuman living conditions , arbitrary imprisonment , deportation , slavery , prostitution , the selling of women and children ; as well as disgraceful working conditions , where men are treated as mere tools for profit , rather than as free and responsible persons ; all these things and others of their like are infamies indeed .
They poison human society , but they do more harm to those who practice them than those who suffer from the injury .
Moreover , they are supreme dishonor to the Creator . "
Later , in Veritatis splendor , August 6 , 1993 , Pope Paul classified all of these acts as " intrinsically evil . "
Conclusion
Speaking of torture is difficult when American soldiers are taught to behave barbarously in wars such as Vietnam and Iraq .
It is hard to speak of torture when hundreds of thousands of innocent people are slain in and because of American - style warfare , or when America sets off bloody civil wars such as in Iraq .
Torture is the next step beyond the harsh , hostile , brutal , trigger - happy , callous , and demeaning behavior of American soldiers that is so often reported in the press .
If torture is counter - productive , so is this behavior .
Both are products of state bureaucracies .
The American public is altogether too lenient with its purse and its sympathy for any American military enterprise .
It is altogether too tolerant of war - making and war - supporting Congressmen .
Americans , how great our wickedness on the earth has become !

The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
The Beefeaters date back to 1485
The Yeoman Warder , who has not been named , will join the 35 - strong guard in September after undergoing training .
She fought off competition from five other candidates , all male , and will replace a retiring Beefeater .
A successful candidate must have served a minimum of 22 years in the forces as well as boast a long service and good conduct medal .
Tour guide
Spokeswoman Natasha Wollard said : " There were six candidates for the vacancy , and she was the only female .
She was awarded the job on merit .
" Because woman have been carving out careers in the forces ... they are starting to come up .
More women have got the criteria that they need . "
The new Beefeater 's scarlet livery uniform will be the same as her male colleagues ' although it will be altered to fit her figure .
Her role will involve acting as a guide for tourists visiting the Tower , which is more than 900 years old .
Beefeaters have been guarding the Tower since 1485 - for 522 years .
Ceremonial dress
The Beefeater nickname of the Tower of London 's Yeoman Warders is thought to derive from the daily ration of meat they received .
Their full title is Yeoman Warder of Her Majesty 's Royal Palace and Fortress the Tower of London , and Members of the Sovereign 's Body Guard of the Yeoman Guard Extraordinary .
For state occasions they wear the well - known ceremonial dress of red and gold with red stockings , a white ruff and black patent shoes .
For everyday duties they wear dark blue trimmed with red .

Libertarian writers fight uphill battling regulation after regulation .
Any small tariff , restriction , and tax create adverse effects .
Often , laws are so mangled together that one cannot make a difference with the removal of only one element .
Sometimes , however , the change of one regulation can make a world of difference .
I offer a change with a remote law in New Orleans that can prevent the city 's continued decline and fall .
The edict that must be removed is the monopoly on gambling held by Harrah 's casino .
The current law allows only one land - based casino in New Orleans .
This casino , Harrah's of New Orleans , is primly located on Canal Street , conveniently across the street from the French Quarter .
A gaming industry entrepreneur could not ask for a better location .
For a very long time , New Orleans has existed as a gambling city at least through back - door card games .
Its gambling history vibrates through song specifically in the " House of the Rising Sun " covered by the Animals .
How will New Orleans benefit from the repeal of the casino restriction ?
There would be perhaps a dozen or more casinos offering low - skilled , high - paying jobs to the residents of New Orleans .
New Orleans , despite statistics of unemployment , has never had a deficit in the job market .
Jobs are particularly easy to locate as many restaurants with traditional high turnover rates constantly seek new employees .
The real problem of the New Orleans job market is finding a job that pays well and requires low skill at the same time .
The casino industry provides this alternative .
Yes , being a casino card dealer requires intense knowledge of proper gaming etiquette .
However , anyone can learn this on the job or through proper job training .
Casinos pay high wages that make working preferable to leisure time on welfare .
Currently , the Iberville Projects are immaculately located near the French Quarter , the most likely place for an unskilled laborer to find employment .
Yet the incentive is still not strong enough for subsidized unemployed laborers to walk two blocks .
Mississippi Gulf Coast , an area also ravaged by Hurricane Katrina , had about a dozen casinos .
Why does Mississippi near a polluted beach have a dozen casinos while New Orleans , a capital of world tourism , has only one ?
The obvious answer is the difference in law .
In Mississippi , casinos are allowed as long as they are built on the water .
In New Orleans , only one casino is allowed .
If I was a gaming industry entrepreneur and someone asked , " Where would you rather build a casino ?
New Orleans or the Mississippi Gulf Coast ? "
Without a moment of hesitation , I would answer New Orleans !
Further evidence points to the fact that New Orleans can support multiple casinos .
In the suburb of Kenner , the Treasure Chest casino does well for itself .
Being out of the way , the Treasure Chest is not even utilizing the demand of tourists .
It mostly runs on the risk - taking desires of locals .
Casinos in Pearl River , Mississippi near the Louisiana border also serve New Orleans consumers .
Even the regulations on the Mississippi Gulf Coast pose a major threat to business .
The casinos are forced to locate on the water .
Can anyone think of a dumber regulation in a hurricane - molested area ?
The regulation was a direct catalyst for disaster and destruction .
Without the one land - based casino regulation , the dozen casinos on the Gulf Coast would likely be located in New Orleans instead .
The jobs brought by the casino industry could create the high - paying jobs that would have solved a large part of New Orleans poverty .
The issue is not as simple as it may appear .
Surely , any New Orleans mayor would realize the advantages to gainful employment from casinos .
The argument of immorality and crime brought by gaming industries cannot be justified .
If anyone knows a city more morally bankrupt than New Orleans … please inform me .
Obviously , the city has granted a fascist - like monopoly within the city limits over the lucrative tourist industry .
This appears to be the apparent cause , and it is partially true .
Many feel that the casinos will ruin the feel and " style " of New Orleans .
As mentioned earlier , this has always been a gambling town , and its reputation will surely not be smeared by the construction of more places to gamble .
This " style " argument was made against Wal - Mart entering the city one year ago .
People worried that the first Wal - Mart in New Orleans would destroy the " style " of the city .
The Wal - Mart prevailed and is currently located in the Warehouse District .
I do not feel it necessary to describe to the reader the " style " of the Warehouse District .
But surely it was not ruined by Wal - Mart .
What " style " are proponents of these restrictions trying to protect ?
Perhaps the projects and slums ?
I know nothing feels more historic than seeing houses equivalent to 19th - century slave cabins in most parts of the city .
With economic restrictions , this " style " is the end result .
The casino would not destroy the city because of New Orleans 's historic advantages .
The casino gathers tourists through the significance of historic areas .
If the casinos destroyed historic places , they would be also destroying their own profits .
If this is the reasoning for protecting Harrah's , why not have only one grocery store for New Orleans ?
Or one gas station ?
Or one fast food restaurant ?
If this policy was applied on a grand scale , the city would be in utter chaos !
The style of the city is only represented by the dollars consumers are willing to spend .
Wal - Mart has been booming .
Harrah 's casino appears to get more customers than Bourbon Street these days .
The truth is revealed in dollars and profits .
The day to allow completely free gambling in New Orleans is far overdue .

Les associations saluent la fin des animaux sauvages dans les cirques et delphinariums
La ministre de la transition écologique , Barbara Pompili , a annoncé mardi la fin progressive des spectacles itinérants mettant en scène fauves , primates ou cétacés , ainsi que l’interdiction , sous cinq ans , des élevages de visons .
By Matt Frei
BBC News , Washington
Almost exactly five years ago I was lucky enough to be granted a journalist visa to Iran .
I am not being facetious .
Iranian women must be careful when it comes to clothing
There 's the majesty of Isfahan with its blue mosques , giant squares and scented bazaars ; the ancient courtyard mansions of Kashan ; the sophistication of Tehran , where beautiful women are forced to wear headscarves and anoraks in public and look like supermodels masquerading as spies .
Like all other journalists I made my weekly pilgrimage to the Friday prayer meeting at Tehran University .
Tens of thousands of students and other devotees converged in what could best be described as a giant car - park covered with the kind of roof you expect to find in an aircraft hangar .
We were allowed onto a viewing gallery .
Below us , the veterans of the Islamic revolution , the heavies from the Revolutionary Guard and thousands of students wearing the white clothes of would - be martyrs listened to Iran 's spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamenei berate the Great Satan - America - and its understudy the Little Satan - Britain - for their aggression .
' Axis of evil '
Afghanistan had already been invaded .
Iraq was next on the list .
Iran had just been named by President Bush as a founding member of the axis of evil .
So , even a cursory glance at the map and American troop movements would have created a lump in the average Iranian throat .
If only the B - 52 [ bombers ] could stop off in Tehran before going on to Kabul
Iranian man
" What about your President Bush ? " he soldiered on .
" He 's a top - class aggressor ! "
Then he looked around and motioned me to come and stand behind a pillar .
He leant so close to me I could smell the tobacco and garlic on his breath .
My personal space was definitely being invaded and I was pondering options .
" There is a joke doing the rounds , " he suddenly said in a whisper and in perfect English .
" If only the B - 52s [ bombers ] could stop off in Tehran before going on to Kabul .
" After all , it is on the way ! "
He motioned to the ayatollahs on the podium next to us .
" We ca n't get rid of them without your help ! "
Chewing the fat
Later in the day I came across a similar if less brazen view .
The editor of a ' liberal ' newspaper which had been shut down no fewer than seven times and reopened under a different name told me he approved of sanctions because they would put pressure on the regime .
Military action , he said , would be counter - productive .
We were invited to attend an editorial board meeting .
The discussion ranged from domestic issues , like the latest arrests of human rights activists , to the turmoil on Tehran 's nascent stock market and the war in Afghanistan and how the regime was not sure whether to thank the US for getting rid of its old enemy the Taleban or be afraid of Uncle Sam 's designs on the region .
As far as I could tell through the translation , the conversation was sophisticated , funny and relaxed - scribblers chewing the fat .
It could have been London or Washington .
Pelted with eggs
Here 's the point : Iran is complicated , mercurial and rife with internal divisions .
Iran has allowed some protest against President Ahmadinejad
Saddam Hussein personally shot people he did n't like .
The president of Iran has been pelted by unruly students with eggs and insults and no - one was shot .
I 'm not saying he 's been grossly misunderstood .
I am saying that Iran is far less monolithic than many in Washington like to think .
The trick is to sweat out the differences .
Saddam Hussein cursed Iran as he neared death , some say
Consider that among the last words uttered by Saddam Hussein , of all people , before the noose tightened around his neck : " Damn the Americans and damn the Persians ! "
The Russians are annoyed because the Iranians wo n't pay their dues on the nuclear reactor at Busher .
This is hardly ideological opposition , but it 's better than nothing .
The Chinese are voting with the other members of the UN Security Council against Iran even though they can't get enough Iranian light crude .
The pressure may be working but it is n't enough .
Lure with iPods
If I were the US government I would issue Iran with 10,000 student visas and 1,000 technology grants to Silicon Valley .
Iran boasts five million college students with higher degrees , the largest proportion in the Middle East .
Instead of encouraging them to turn into head - bashing extremists I would seduce them into becoming head - banging , iPod - wearing computer geeks .
Was it wise to detain UK sailor Faye Turney and 14 others ?
Even if the administration thought of it , the Democrats , flexing their muscles on Capitol Hill or positioning themselves to race for the White House , would oppose it .
They were , after all , the ones who kicked up a stink about the Dubai ports deal even though the Gulf States actually quite like America and Dubai is already the biggest US naval base overseas .
But subtlety does n't play well in election campaigns .
What 's more , the rhetoric coming from the US is music to Tehran 's ears .
Every time there 's a tiff the price of oil inches above $ 65 a barrel , making the Iranian government a little bit richer still .
So - with US Iran policy struck in a groove , Tehran thriving on adversity , an extra US carrier group in the Gulf , the Revolutionary Guards building IEDs [ bombs ] for Shia death squads in Iraq and the Israelis feeling distinctly twitchy about the prospect of a nuclear Iran - the stars are dangerously aligned for a show - down , even if the White House and Tehran do n't actually want one .
Now imagine " an event " , an unforeseen crisis that pushes everyone to the brink - like 15 British sailors being held hostage by the Revolutionary Guard Navy in the Shatt al - Arab waterway .
Send us your comments in reaction to Matt Frei's Washington diary using the link below :
It looks like a heap of rubbish , feels like flaky pastry and has been linked to aliens .
For decades , scientists have puzzled over the complex collection of cogs , wheels and dials seen as the most sophisticated object from antiquity , writes Helena Smith .
But 102 years after the discovery of the calcium - encrusted bronze mechanism on the ocean floor , hidden inscriptions show that it is the world 's oldest computer , used to map the motions of the sun , moon and planets .
' We 're very close to unlocking the secrets , ' says Xenophon Moussas , an astrophysicist with a Anglo - Greek team researching the device .
' It 's like a puzzle concerning astronomical and mathematical knowledge . '
Known as the Antikythera mechanism and made before the birth of Christ , the instrument was found by sponge divers amid the wreckage of a cargo ship that sunk off the tiny island of Antikythera in 80 BC .
To date , no other appears to have survived .
' Bronze objects like these would have been recycled , but being in deep water it was out of reach of the scrap - man and we had the luck to discover it , ' said Michael Wright , a former curator at London 's Science Museum .
He said the apparatus was the best proof yet of how technologically advanced the ancients were .
' The skill with which it was made shows a level of instrument - making not surpassed until the Renaissance .
It really is the first hard evidence of their interest in mechanical gadgets , ability to make them and the preparedness of somebody to pay for them . '
For years scholars had surmised that the object was an astronomical showpiece , navigational instrument or rich man 's toy .
The Roman Cicero described the device as being for ' after - dinner entertainment ' .
But many experts say it could change how the history of science is written .
' In many ways , it was the first analogue computer , ' said Professor Theodosios Tassios of the National Technical University of Athens .
' It will change the way we look at the ancients ' technological achievements . '
Announcing Slackware Linux 11 !
The first Slackware release more than a year in the making , this edition of Slackware combines Slackware 's legendary simplicity , stability , and security with some of the latest advances in Linux technology .
Expect no less than the best Slackware yet .
Among the many program updates and distribution enhancements , you 'll find two of the most advanced desktop environments available today : Xfce 4.2.3.2 , a fast and lightweight but visually appealing and easy to use desktop environment , and KDE 3.5.4 , the latest version of the award - winning K Desktop Environment .
Slackware uses the 2.4.33.3 kernel bringing you advanced performance features such as the ReiserFS journaling filesystem , SCSI and ATA RAID volume support , SATA support , and kernel support for X DRI ( the Direct Rendering Interface ) that brings high - speed hardware accelerated 3D graphics to Linux .
Additional kernels allow installing Slackware using any of the journaling filesystems available for Linux , including ext3 , ReiserFS , IBM 's JFS , and SGI 's XFS .
Slackware 11.0 also fully supports the 2.6 kernel series , with your choice of the well - tested 2.6.17.13 kernel in / extra ( including a version of this kernel that supports multiple processors , multi-core CPUs , HyperThreading , and about every other optimization available ) , or the recently released 2.6.18 kernel in / testing .
This kernel also spent a long time in development and in our own testing has proven to be fast , stable , and reliable .
All of these kernels may be used with Slackware 's CD / DVD based installation system , and NFS network installs may be done using the 2.6.17.13 ( huge26.s ) kernel .
From the beginning , Slackware has offered a stable and secure Linux distribution for UNIX veterans as well as an easy - to - use system for beginners .
Slackware includes everything you 'll need to run a powerful server or workstation .
Each Slackware package follows the setup and installation instructions from its author(s ) as closely as possible , offering you the most stable and easily expandable setup .
Here are some of the advanced features of Slackware 11.0 : - Runs the 2.4.33.3 version of the Linux kernel from ftp.kernel.org .
Special kernels were prepared to support hardware such as SCSI controllers , SATA controllers , USB keyboards and mice , parallel - port IDE devices , IBM PS / 2 machines with the Microchannel bus , and even speech synthesizers providing access to Linux for the visually impaired community .
The performance of the 2.4.x kernel series along with Slackware 's track record of careful attention to system security make it the perfect choice for running your production servers .
-
As an alternate choice , Slackware 11.0 includes Linux 2.6.17.13 and 2.6.18 kernel source , kernel modules , and binary packages , along with the mkinitrd tool and instructions on using it to install the new kernel ( see / boot / README.initrd ) .
When running a 2.6 kernel , Slackware supports udev .
This is a system for creating devices in / dev dynamically , greatly reducing device clutter and making it easy to see what devices are actually present in the system .
Udev probes for and enables hardware on the system , much like the hotplug system does for a 2.4 kernel .
- System binaries are linked with the GNU C Library , version 2.3.6 .
This version of glibc also has excellent compatibility with existing binaries .
- X11R6.9.0 ( same codebase as Modular X. Org 7.0.0 )
This is the X. Org Foundation 's X Window System .
The 6.9.0 version includes additional hardware support , functional enhancements , and bug fixes compared with the 6.8.2 release that shipped in Slackware 10.2 , and we 're added additional support for some recent popular Intel graphics chipsets .
- Installs gcc -3.4.6 as the default C , C++ , Objective - C , Fortran - 77 , and Ada 95 compiler .
- Support for fully encrypted network connections with OpenSSL , OpenSSH , and GnuPG . - Apache 1.3.37 web server with Dynamic Shared Object ( DSO ) support , SSL , and PHP .
- PCMCIA , CardBus , and APM support for laptops .
( pcmcia - cs - 3.2.8 and pcmciautils - 014 ) .
Slackware also now includes hotplug and udev support .
This locates and configures most hardware automatically as it is added ( or removed ) from the system .
It also loads the kernel modules required by sound cards and other hardware at boot time .
- New development tools , including Perl 5.8.8 , Python 2.4.3 , Ruby 1.8.4 , Subversion 1.4.0 , and graphical tools like Qt designer and KDevelop .
- Updated versions of the Slackware package management tools make it easy to add , remove , upgrade , and make your own Slackware packages .
Package tracking makes it easy to upgrade from Slackware 10.2 to Slackware 11.0 ( see UPGRADE.TXT ) .
The slackpkg tool in / extra can also help update from an older version of Slackware to a newer one , and keep your Slackware system up to date .
In addition , the slacktrack utility ( in extra / ) will help you build and maintain your own packages .
- Web browsers galore !
Includes KDE's Konqueror 3.5.4 , SeaMonkey 1.0.5 ( this is the new replacement for the Mozilla Suite ) , and the immensely popular Firefox 1.5.0.7 , as well as the Thunderbird 1.5.0.7 email and news client with advanced junk mail filtering .
-
The complete K Desktop Environment ( KDE ) version 3.5.4 , including the KOffice productivity suite , networking tools , GUI development with KDevelop , multimedia tools ( including the amazing Amarok music player ) , the Konqueror web browser and file manager , dozens of games and utilities , international language support , and more . - A collection of GTK + based applications including gaim - 1.5.0 , gimp - 2.2.13 , gkrellm - 2.2.9 , gxine - 0.5.7 , xchat - 2.6.6 , xsane -0.991 , and pan-0.14.2.91 . -
Large repository of extra software packages compiled and ready to run .
This includes various window managers , the K3b CD burning application for KDE , the Java ( TM ) 2 Software Development Kit Standard Edition , libsafe ( advanced buffer overflow protection for additional security ) , ISDN support , additional 802.11 drivers , and much more ( see the / extra directory ) .
-
Many more improved and upgraded packages than we can list here .
For a complete list of core packages in Slackware 11.0 , see this file : ftp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-11.0/PACKAGES.TXT
- Another Slackware exclusive : Slackware 's ZipSlack installation option is the fastest , _easiest_ Linux installation ever .
ZipSlack provides a basic text - based Linux system as a 70 megabyte ZIP archive .
Simply unzip on any FAT or FAT32 partition , edit your boot partition in the LINUX .
BAT batch file , and you can be running Linux in less than five minutes .
The ZipSlack installation includes everything you need to network with Linux ( including Ethernet , token ring , and PPP ) , and extend the system with additional software packages such as X .
A ZipSlack system will even fit on a 250 MB Zip ( TM ) disk , so you can carry a personal Linux system with you to run on any PC with a 250 MB Zip ( TM ) drive .

All these buildings might remind some objects from Sci-Fi movies of the past .
In the former USSR you can meet such buildings .
They are not very often but there are some like in this photo series .
Some of the buildings have weird history .
For example the building number 3 , the “ Friendship ” hotel attracted a great part of attention from USA intelligence agency .
They thought it was some sort of missile launching site .
This one can remind some castle from “ Star Wars ” but in fact it ’s a place in which Soviet marriage events were held in Tbilisi , Gergia .
In Russia and in USSR marriage does n’t occur in the church , it happens in a special house called “ Palace of The Marage ” .
It is so still nowadays , though after getting married in such place couple can visit a church .
This one is a “ State Department for Traffic ” .
It was built in 1975 and also is located in Tbilis .
This one is the hotel “ Friendship ” , build during Soviet era , and it was considered by CIA as some strange military object .
Nowadays this place is in Ukraine .
This is another strange one .
It is a “ Palace of Soviets ” built in Kaliningrad city , Russia in 1975 .
Locals call it “ A Big Monster ” .
Here is a building for a Technological Institute in Minsk , Belarus .
Was built in 1981 and looks like some white big boat .
If you would ever travel to Russia you would be probably interested in visiting those places to get a photo like this .
Scratching the Surface 23 January , 2007
It ’s out !
The MIT Media Lab ’s Lifelong Kindergarten group with John Maloney , who most of you know as one of the major contributors to Squeak , have released Scratch .
Scratch is a new programming language that lets you create your own interactive stories , games , music , and art .
I spoke with John about Scratch .
Ron : John many people are familiar with your past , could you give us an update as to what you have been doing and what you are currently working on ?
John : Since January of 2003
I have been working in the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab on a media - rich programming environment called “ Scratch ” ( http://scratch.mit.edu).
Scratch combines ideas from Squeak EToys , CricketBlocks ( the precursor to PicoBlocks , see http://www.picocricket.com), and Logo to create a playful and engaging introduction to programming .
Like EToys , Scratch programs are written by assembling colorful command blocks on the screen to control one or more sprites .
However , Scratch has fewer commands and objects and more “ training wheels ” to get you started .
Scratch was developed under an NSF grant and is aimed at youth at after school centers .
As we ’ve developed Scratch , we ’ve worked closely with the Computer Clubhouse , a network of 100 + after - school centers located in low - income areas in cities around the world .
This is a very tough audience , since kids are free to choose what they want to work on and there is no “ curriculum , ” no classes , and no teachers .
( The Computer Clubhouse relies on volunteer mentors . )
Thus , we ’ve worked hard to make Scratch be fun and easy to learn so youth will want to use Scratch and can figure out many things for themselves even if there is n’t a mentor around .
But in addition to after - school computer centers , Scratch is also attracting attention from forward - looking teachers and educators , science museums , school computer clubs , and it has even been used as a first introduction to programming in several Harvard computer science classes .
Ron : I spent some time working with Scratch , it really is nicely done .
I can see that it would be very useful to teach program flow , and I think that the set of sample applications is great for opening up the creative possibilities in the minds of children .
I ’m interested in what you believe we can learn from how children use the program and what you believe are the benefits to tile programming .
I personally like the way that programming becomes more tactile .
It ’s very interesting to see the concepts that we take for granted represented in puzzle pieces that can be picked up organized .
John :
It ’s not just children who find Scratch an easy entry intro programming .
David Malan and others at Harvard have been using Scratch in the Intro programming class as a warm - up for Java .
It ’s been a big success and David had a paper about it at this year ’s SIGSE .
It seems clear that both kids and adults are able to transfer concepts such as control flow , iteration , conditionals , and variables from Scratch into other languages .
David ’s paper is the most well documented study , but I ’ve seen kids go from Scratch to Flash ActionScript programming with relative ease .
Ron : I have seen some people complain ( mostly adults not children ) that tiles do not allow for a deeper understanding of programming concepts .
I can see that the programming concepts once understood can be represented in the mind of the programmer as a “ thing ” that needs to be recreated syntactically in other languages .
How do you feel about the argument that tiles make programming too simple and limit deeper understanding ?
John :
We ’ve heard this argument before .
I think that the people who make this argument are confusing the surface structure of programming languages with their deeper meaning .
Because many programming languages involve strict syntax rules and complex data typing systems , people sometimes lose track of the goal , which is to get the computer to do what you want with as few errors and ambiguity as possible .
Syntax and type declarations are simply means to that end .
Some aspects of traditional computer languages are more for the convenience of the language implementation ( e.g. syntax rules ) , not the human being .
Other aspects , while meant to reduce human errors , are sometimes more of a hindrance than a help ( e.g. complicated type systems ) .
Programming language design is an exercise in balancing many factors : ease of implementation , efficiency of the final code , ease of writing , ease of maintenance , and human understandability .
As a programming language , Scratch is optimized for ease of writing and , to a lesser extent , ease of understanding for relatively small programs within a specialized domain .
The same exact statement could be made about Perl , Tk , Awk , APL .
None of these languages is particularly efficient or suitable for building large applications , yet all of them are useful .
Scratch is a programming language in exactly the same spirit , but focused on a different audience .
I actually believe that a blocks language similar to Scratch , PicoBlocks , or EToys could be scaled up to support larger programming projects .
Current Integrated Development Environments for languages such as C++ and Java make heavy use of color and highlighting to help the user with syntax ( e.g. finding missing quote marks or curly brackets ) .
Scratch blocks can be seen as just a fancier version of such editors that uses shape as well as color to help with syntax .
But to answer your question — I am convinced that you are right .
People who grow to understand programming in Scratch will be able to map the key concepts onto analogous constructs and syntax in other programming languages .
I do n’t believe for a moment that “ tiles make programming too simple and limit deeper understanding ” .
You can make a few things happen in Scratch by trial - and - error .
But as your aspirations grow , you quickly run into the need for deeper concepts .
And when you learn a new concept to accomplish something in Scratch , you really appreciate and remember it .
Mitchel once had a boy thank him profusely and shake his hand many times for showing him how to use a variable to keep score in a game .
Ron :
What does the “ Share ” button on the Scratch users interface do ?
John : Nothing yet .
However , the Lifelong Kindergarten Group is currently working on a new Scratch website that will allow you to share your Scratch project online .
Once you ’ve created a Scratch home page on the site , clicking that button will upload your project .
Assuming you have a Java - enabled browser , Scratch projects on the web site will run right in your browser , like playing a YouTube video except that Scratch projects can be interactive .
If you find a project that you like , you can download it to see how it works or to create your own variation of it .
Our goal is to build a Scratch community in which users are inspired by , learn from , and build upon each other ’s work .
We hope to have this new website online by the end of February .
Stay tuned !
Ron :
What is the Scratch license ?
John : Scratch is under the MIT license .
That means that people are free to use Scratch for any purpose whatsoever , as long as the copyright notice and license remains intact .
The license is in the file “ license.txt ” in the Scratch folder .
Ron :
Is the source code of Scratch available ?
John : Scratch is a “ closed development , open source ” project .
We plan to make source code available by mid-2007 under the MIT License so that others can experiment with extensions and variations .
However , unlike a conventional open source project , we do not seek code contributions from the community .
The open - source version of Scratch will be visually different and incompatible with the standard MIT version , to avoid confusion between experimental versions and the standard version .
Ron :
When will there be a Linux version of Scratch ?
John :
We hope to have a Linux version available by the end of 2007 .
Ron : Scratch is wonderful fun .
It is nice to play with programming constructs by picking up pieces with a mouse .
I ’m sure that Scratch ’s ability to remove syntax and to provide instance feedback will help a number of people learn the concepts of digital media , programming , user interaction and logic flow .
Great work !!

Ron Teitelbaum is long time Smalltalk programmer .
He is President and Principal Software Engineer at US Medical Record Specialists .
The Edmonton Symposium on Aging was an interesting mix : scientists from all over the interdisciplinary field of aging research , and educated laymen who have a keen interest in our work .
As the research was all over the map it is a bit hard to categorize , but I ’ll try to do so roughly here :
Stem cell therapy
Irina Conboy ( my boss ) presented our lab ’s currently in - press data on how an aged tissue environment negatively affects the ability of muscle stem cells to differentiate .
The proximity of ESCs , however , can locally rescue the affects of a “ polluted ” niche .
We are currently investigating the soluble factors that regulate the ability of cells and tissues to renew and regenerate .
Amit Patel presented some good data from his work on injecting bone marrow - derived MSCs ( mesenchymal stem cells ) into the heart ( of both rodents and patients ) to treat heart failure .
The mechanism is hazy at best , but it seems to work !
The cells ( self - derived ) do not graft , but probably help through paracrine effects .
Tissue Regeneration
Ellen Heber - Katz gave an update on the MRL ( Murphy Roths Large ) mouse story .
She has discovered that this regenerating mouse breaks down the basement membrane in the vicinity of an injury ( apparently similarly to other , more “ traditionally ” regenerating creatures such as salamanders ) .
Matrix metalloproteinases secreted by inflammatory cells recruited to the wound site are apparently essential to this aspect of the healing process .
Geoff Goldspink gave a really interesting talk about MGF , a unique alternative splice form of IGF - 1 that is activated extremely soon after muscle injury .
The isoform stimulates muscle stem cell self - renewal , and then shuts off , so that stem cells can differentiate and repair muscle .
He showed some very convincing data on enhancing rodent muscle - building with MGF supplementation .
Novus Biologicals holds the patent and is developing both protein- and drug - based therapies for muscular dystrophy .
Re-engineering the Body
Aubrey de Grey rallied the troops with his rousing speech encouraging us to take an engineering approach to tackling the problem of the maladies of aging .
His point boils down to the idea that if someone finds something valuable enough , they will find a way to take care of it and keep it working .
Examples of this are old cars .
Most of them were n’t meant to live forever , but we find a way to make them immortal .
Some of them ( e.g. the VW ) were n’t even very well built to begin with , but they are popular , so people find ways to keep them working .
Bruce Rittmann is a bioremediation guy who has been running with an idea that Aubrey de Grey has been pushing for the past few years : using a bioremediation strategy to target bodily waste products that cannot be broken down , e.g. , lipofuscin .
7 - ketocholesterol is apparently the most abundant such indigestible component of foam cell lysosomes .
Rittman and co-workers screened for bacteria that could survive on a diet of 7 - ketocholesterol and found one strain .
Now they are doing a genetic screen to identify the gene of interest .
Diseases of Aging
Supercentenarians – people aged 110 and higher , are a rare breed ( 1 in 5 million make it that far ) .
The Supercentenarian Research Foundation ( SRF ) is dedicated to honoring and studying these “ super - humans . ” Doros Platika spoke on behalf of the SRF .
Two interesting facts about supercentenarians :
They do n’t get brain plaques or any autopsy - visible brain degradation .
Most seem to die from transthyretin ( TTR ) amyloidosis .
While the group has very little data and very few subjects to study , a clue about what we might be up against if most major diseases were cured and people started living past 100 could be extremely valuable .
There was a really exciting talk by Ashley Bush about a novel class of compounds being developed to treat Alzheimer ’s .
The idea is dealing with the problem of metals in Aß plaques .
He rejects the idea of chelators to deplete metals ( he thinks zinc is the most important ) from the brain , since total brain Zn2 + is actually reduced in Alzheimer ’s brains , and depleting it further would presumably be bad .
Therefore , he has focused on compounds that bind zinc with fairly low affinity and instead specifically disrupt the Aß – zinc interaction .
Dramatic results were achieved in mouse models of Alzheimer ’s ; clinical trials are encouraging and well underway .
The most current incarnation of the drug is called PBT2 and is being developed by Prana Biotechnology .
Patrick
Lee reported work on treating cancer with live viruses – not for gene therapy , but to sic the virus on the cancer and let them battle it out — seriously !
Dr. Lee is using reovirus , the advantage being that the virus is ordinarily quite harmless , and is quickly completely cleared by the immune system .
The reason that it works is that the virus is supported by Ras , one of the most common oncogenes , which Lee believes greatly enhances viral replication .
The virus is extremely lytic , so it quickly kills Ras-positive cells .
Drawbacks to this approach are that the virus is easily cleared by the immune system and therefore may need to be used in combination with immunosuppression .
( And , of course , your tumor needs to be Ras- positive . )
Mitochondrial Aging
I recently reported that at the AACR aging meeting , the mitochondrial theory of aging took a blow from some negative data .
At Edmonton the ship started taking on water , as Konstantin Khrapko showed a lot of negative data from some very careful mitochondrial aging experiments .
He holds out hope that even though mitochondrial aging and its effects cannot be detected at the system - wide level , damage to mitochondria in specialized tissues may be important .
He showed some data suggesting that this may be the case in the substantia nigra of the brain .
A Party for Young Old People
The Classics are one of the oldest rock bands in Canada , and they played at the after party .
They ’re actually really good .
This conference did n’t just talk about how to make you young again , it actually did !
You ’ve never seen distinguished scientists like Irina Conboy , Aubrey de Grey , and Ellen Heber - Katz throwing it down on the dance floor like I did at the party .
Talk and poster abstracts are available online , and rumor has it that video of the presentations will be available soon .

KNOTTY OLD ISSUE KNOTTY OLD ISSUE " Mathematics are well and good but nature keeps dragging us around by the nose , " Albert Einstein groused , a lament that echoes in the debate over string theory .
Physicist Lee Smolin has criticized this theory as a mathematical effort to solve a problem that belongs in the realm of theorists .
He sees a historical warning in the mathematics of " knot theory . "
Knot theory was the offspring of eminent physicist Lord Kelvin 's 1860 's idea that atoms are essentially knots in the aether .
Aether was a mysterious fixed medium through which light traveled , in the minds of Victorian scientists .
Kelvin 's concept was popular for decades , sparking the Scottish physicist Peter Tait to devise a table of the elements based on knots , with heavier , more complex ones representing heavier atoms .
( Hydrogen was a simple loop and lead a complex one , for example . )
Knot theory ’' relevance to atomic physics was untied by later experiments before Einstein 's landmark 1905 " e=mc2 " papers proved its final undoing .
" But they guessed wrong about nature , not about mathematics , " says Peter Ewing of the American Mathematical Society .
Knot theory has many non-physics applications and is a thriving subject , he says .
Ewing says Kelvin and Tait 's error says little about string theory because the two ideas do n't share the same underlying math .
Besides , history is filled with math ideas that were busts , he notes , from the ancient Pythagoreans ' notion that numbers have gender to the " epicycles " that medieval astronomers used to explain planetary motion .
They " only say something about our limitations in making good guesses about nature , " he says .

String theory : Hanging on by a thread ?
String theory is on the ropes .
After decades of prominence as the key to physics ' elusive " theory of everything , " challengers say the hypothesis is unraveling .
Why ?
Because there have n't been experiments to prove it — and there do n't seem to be any on the horizon .
" The interplay with experiments is essential , and string theory just does n't have that , " says physicist Lee Smolin , author of The Trouble With Physics : The Rise of String Theory , the Fall of Science , and What Comes Next , out today Physics breakthroughs power advances in areas as diverse as computing , material science ( nanotechnology ) and electronics , and Smolin says it 's bad news for progress if physics goes off track .
For decades , some scientists , most notably Albert Einstein , have sought a " theory of everything " to unite the fundamental theories of physics : general relativity ( which geometrically models gravity as massive objects bending the fabric of space , leading them to follow curved orbits ) , electromagnetism and quantum mechanics ( which explains atomic forces as the result of point - like atomic particles working together in wave - like fashion ) .
The last great triumph of 20th - century physics was the so - called standard model of particle physics , which linked electromagnetic and atomic forces by showing they all result from the interactions of fundamental sub-atomic particles .
These point - like objects with whimsical names like " quarks , " " leptons " and " bosons " are the building blocks of atoms , according to the standard model .
But general relativity 's gravity remains distinctly divorced from the standard model , a quandary that has long troubled physicists because the two theories differ greatly in their visions of how the universe functions and fits together .
This suggests that both fundamental theories are fundamentally flawed , say Smolin and others .
Enter string theory , which surfaced in 1970 with the research of the University of Chicago 's Yoichiro Nambu .
Broadly speaking , string theory envisions subatomic particles as strings and loops of vibrating energy rather than the point - like particles of the standard model .
Each string may be about a billion billion times smaller than the protons inside atoms .
The appeal of string theory , says physicist Sean Carroll of the California Institute of Technology , is that these little energy loops appear to mathematically explain not only the interactions of atomic particles but also where gravity comes from .
String theory describes a vibrating string that acts like a " graviton , " which produces the force of gravity , much in the same way that the standard model 's particles produce forces .
But it was n't until 1984 that theorists John Schwartz of the California Institute of Technology and Michael Green of England 's Cambridge University showed that string theory 's mathematics could encompass all the particles in the standard model , not just parts of it .
The finding captivated physicists .
But Smolin says its adherents are prizing mathematical agility , the theoretical ability to whip up ever more stringy particles , over deep insight into the mismatch between gravity and other forces .
" Aspects of string theory may turn out to be true , " Smolin says , but physicists have flirted with failed mathematical bridges to nowhere , built of string - theory buttresses such as extra dimensions and elegant math , throughout the last two centuries .
In particular , Smolin charges that string theorists just fudged their models to explain away dark energy — a mysterious force that supernova measurements indicate is pulling galaxies away from one another at an accelerating rate — rather than admitting they have real problems .
Other detractors , including physicists Lawrence Krauss , author of last year 's Hiding in the Mirror : The Mysterious Allure of Extra Dimensions From Plato to String Theory and Beyond , and mathematician Peter Woit , author of this summer 's Not Even Wrong : The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law , argue that string theory is dragging physics down a rabbit hole , producing endless theorizing and no payoff .
Physicists always argue , says historian Spencer Weart of the American Physical Society 's Center for the History of Physics in Greenbelt , Md. Respectable physicists disagreed about the existence of atoms until the 1950s , he notes , until experiments settled the issue .
String theory differs from those cases historically , Weart says , in an inability to come up with experiments .
" In the end , physicists like a theory only if it will help them to do some research , " Weart says .
Schwartz , one of the fathers of modern string theory , replies by e-mail that experiments will verify string theory in the future .
The big question is how much energy an experiment would have to pound into a collision between particles to reveal strings , he adds .
Many physicists hope that Europe 's Large Hadron Collider facility will offer some answers , starting in 2007 .
Ultimately , Carroll says , " the only way for someone to kill string theory will be to come up with a better one . "
String theory is physics ' great hope for uniting the physics of galaxies ( shown left ) with the phyiscs of sub-atomic particles .

Oooh fascinating .
Looks simple too ; nice find , Wendy !
Now , if only I could change highlight color or style ( as I 'm used to in Firefox 's Scrapbook extension " somehow .
I 'm gonna see if this has any practical usages for me as I 'm blogging and quoting others .
Could be nicely meta ! :)
The Washington Post reports today that Republicans in Congress are turning against the crown jewel of President Bush ’s education policy , the No Child Left Behind Act :
More than 50 GOP members of the House and Senate — including the House ’s second - ranking Republican — will introduce legislation today that could severely undercut President Bush ’s signature domestic achievement , the No Child Left Behind Act , by allowing states to opt out of its testing mandates .
For a White House fighting off attacks on its war policy and dealing with a burgeoning scandal at the Justice Department , the GOP dissidents ’ move is a fresh blow on a new front .
Among the co-sponsors of the legislation are House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) , a key supporter of the measure in 2001 , and John Cornyn ( R - Tex . ) , Bush ’s most reliable defender in the Senate .
Rep. Eric Cantor ( Va. ) , the House GOP ’s chief deputy whip and a supporter in 2001 , has also signed on .
Burson Snyder , a spokesman for Blunt , said that after several meetings with school administrators and teachers in southwest Missouri , the House Republican leader turned against the measure he helped pass .
Blunt was convinced that the burdens and red tape of the No Child Left Behind Act are unacceptably onerous , Snyder said .
Some Republicans said yesterday that a backlash against the law was inevitable .
Many voters in affluent suburban and exurban districts — GOP strongholds — think their schools have been adversely affected by the law .
Once - innovative public schools have increasingly become captive to federal testing mandates , jettisoning education programs not covered by those tests , siphoning funds from programs for the talented and gifted , and discouraging creativity , critics say .
One Republican , Peter Hokstra of Michigan has authored a bill that would allow any state to opt out of NCLB by referendum or executive action :
“ President Bush and I just see education fundamentally differently , ” said Hoekstra , a longtime opponent of the law .
“ The president believes in empowering bureaucrats in Washington , and I believe in local and parental control . ”
Unfortunately , neither of the bills being proposed to modify NCLB contain any of the ideas that Republicans used to put forward on education .
There are no vouchers .
School choice is n’t being mentioned .
And let ’s not even talk about testing teachers to ensure that they actually understand the subject they ’re teaching .
Unfortunately , we ’ve come a long way from the days when Ronald Reagan talked about abolishing the Department of Education . –
Dead Buddhist Monk Is Alive Bumninorn.ru , Feb 25 , 2007 Moscow , Russia --
“ Exhumation of the body of Hambo Lama Itigelov took place September 10 th , 2002 on the territory of cemetery near the city of Ulan Ude ( Russian Federation ) .
He died and was buried in 1927 and the exhumation was performed in presence of relatives , officials , and specialists ” .
This was the information that appeared in Russian mass media regarding Buryat Lama who was exhumed from the grave in the beginning of the 21 st century .
The grave contained a wooden box and there was a sitting Buddhist lama in ‘ lotus ’ pose .
His body was preserved as if it was mummified , however it was not .
Soft muscles and skin , folding joints .
The body was covered with silk clothes and fabric .
Hambo Lama Itigelov is a real person quite well known in Russian history .
He studied in Anninsky Datsan ( Buddhist university in Buryatia , nowadays there are ruins only ) and obtained degrees in medicine and philosophy ( on the nature of emptiness ) , he created an encyclopedia of pharmacology .
In 1911 Itigelov became a Hambo Lama ( the head of Buddhist church in Russia ) .
During the period from 1913 till 1917 he participated in social actions of the Tsar , being invited to 300 - year anniversary of Romanov ’s house , opened the first Buddhist temple in St. Petersburg , and Nikolai II gave him St. Stanislav award on 19 th of March , 1917 .
During the First World War Itigelov created and inspired the organization called “ Buryat brothers ” .
He was helping the army with money , meals , clothes , medicaments , he also built a set of hospitals with lama doctors helping wounded soldiers .
For that he got St. Anna award and others .
In 1926 Itigelov advised the Buddhist monks to leave Russia , since ‘ the red teaching was coming ’ ( Itigelov himself never left Russia ) .
In 1927 , being 75 , he told lamas to begin meditation , since he said he was preparing to die .
Lamas did not want to perform this meditation because Itigelov was still alive .
Thus , Itigelov began to meditate by himself , lamas joined him and soon he died .
Ititgelov left a testament where he asked to bury him as he was , sitting in lotus pose in the cedar box on traditional cemetery .
It was done .
There was also a statement , where he asked other monks to exhume him after several years .
( This is the exciting point – this means he knew that his body would be preserved ) .
This was done in 1955 and in 1973 by Buddhist monks but they were scared to tell everybody about this , since communist regime did not leave any space for religion in society .
Only in 2002 the body was finally exhumed and transferred to Ivolginsky Datsan ( a residence of today ’s Hambo Lama ) where it was closely examined by monks and , which is now more important , by scientists and pathologists .
The official statement was issued about the body – very well preserved , without any signs of decay , whole muscles and inner tissue , soft joints and skin .
The interesting thing is that the body was never embalmed or mummified .
Two years passed .
Itigelov ’s body is now kept open air , in contact with other people , without any temperature or humidity regimes .
How Itigelov keeps this condition , nobody knows .
This is the ONLY KNOWN AND CONFIRMED CASE OF IMPERISHABLE BODY throughout the whole world .
Embalming and mummifying is well known among different nations and peoples – Chili ( Chinchora ) , Egypt mummies , Christian Saints , communist leaders and others .
Some bodies were found in permafrost , however when they contacted with oxygen atmosphere they perished within several hours .
However , there are descriptions of such things in Buddhist texts , but there are no confirmed examples .
Well , now there is .
For two years after the exhumation of Itigilov ’s body it does not perish nor decay , no fungus , no negative things happen to it .
Itigelov said before he died that he left a message to all peoples on Earth .
This message contains no words .
Now it is our turn to understand it .
Hezbollah Riots in Lebanon ( Continuously Updated )
While I was in Lebanon gathering the material I 've been publishing , Hezbollah kept threatening to strangle the country by seizing major roads , including the one that leads to the airport .
I was worried I might get stuck there , but I did n't .
Today , though , they finally make good on their threat .
Palestinian guerillas are reportedly helping .
Future TV and LBC say there are clashes between rioters and commuters .
Cars , as well as tires , are burning .
Photos via Blacksmiths of Lebanon .
Click for more .
UPDATE : Lebanon 's Prime Minister Fouad Seniora accuses Hezbollah of intimidation and terrorism .
He may be over - reacting a bit with the t- word in this context , but it 's telling because he used to call them a " resistance " movement instead of terrorists .
Those days are gone .
UPDATE : More pictures at The Ouwet Front .
One commenter says " It looks like Gaza . "
Yes , it does .
UPDATE : Here is a BBC photo gallery .
Below is a sample .
Lovely .
UPDATE : Violence is spreading .
Three people have been shot .
Sunni and Shia Muslims fought each other with sticks , rocks , and automatic weapons in Southern Beirut .
Violent clashes , often involving gunfire , are erupting elsewhere in the country as well .
Michel Aoun threatens to escalate .
UPDATE : Beirut is covered in smoke .
UPDATE : Just a side note here ... Up until today Hezbollah has modeled its " resistance " to the elected government after the March 14 demonstations to oust the occupying Syrian army .
The March 14 movement , though , never did anything remotely like this .
That 's because they are , for the most part , liberal and democratic while Hezbollah is a Syrian - Iranian terrorist army .
Today should be a moment of clarity for the willfully obtuse .
Notice , also , that the violent clashes in the streets are mostly between Sunnis and Shia , not between Christians and Shia .
This is , and was , entirely predictable .
Those who think Hezbollah is a popular movement with the support of Lebanon 's Muslims as a whole should think again .
UPDATE : This post is getting a lot of attention from other blogs .
This is mostly a link round - up , though .
In case you missed some of my recent original reporting from Lebanon , here is an interview with a liberal Shia cleric , a descendent of the Prophet Mohammad , no less , who is an outspoken enemy of Hezbollah .
And here is a photo gallery of Hezbollah's " capital " south of Beirut that was devastated by the Israeli Air Force during the summer .
It looks like World War II blew through there .
UPDATE : Hezbollah called off the so - called " strike . "
Nasrallah seems to be aware that his latest stunt was seen by Lebanese an act of war in direct violation of Lebanon 's power - sharing arrangment .
Members of Parliament today described Hezbollah as " terrorists " and Beirut as " occupied . "
Nasrallah is learning the limits of what he can do .
He can squat downtown , but he can't seize it or burn it without starting a war .

Gordon
Bell will never forget what I look like .
He ’ll never forget what I sound like , either .
Actually , he ’ll never forget a single detail about me .
advertisement
advertisement
That ’s because when I first met the affable 72 - year - old computer scientist at the offices of Microsoft Research Labs , in Redmond , Washington , he was carefully recording my every move .
He had a tiny bug - eyed camera around his neck , and a small audio recorder at his elbow .
As we chatted about various topics –Australian jazz musicians , his futuristic cell phone , the Seattle area ’s gorgeous weather –Bell ’s gear quietly logged my every gesture and all my blathering small talk , snapping a picture every 60 seconds .
Back at his office , his computer had carefully archived every document related to me : all the email I ’d sent him , copies of my articles he ’d read , pages he ’d surfed on my blog .
“ Oh , I ’ve got everything , ” Bell said cheerily .
And when I saw him the next day , down in his cramped personal office in San Francisco , he offered to give me a glimpse of the memories he ’d collected .
He plunked down in front of his computer , pulled up a browser , typed in “ Clive Fast Company , ” and there they were : Hundreds of pictures of the meeting scrolled by on his screen , and the sound of our day - old conversation filled the room .
It was a deeply strange feeling .
My random chitchat is being preserved ?
For all eternity ?
He nodded , pointing to a mundane Dell computer parked beneath his desk .
His massive store of data .
His “ surrogate brain . ”
Because I ’m not the only thing Gordon Bell will never forget .
His goal is never to forget anything .
For the past seven years , Bell has been conducting an audacious experiment in “ lifelogging ” –creating a near - total digital record of his experience .
His custom - designed software , “ MyLifeBits , ” saves everything it can get its hands on .
For every piece of email he sends and receives , every document he types , every chat session he engages in , every Web page he surfs , a copy is scooped up and stashed away .
MyLifeBits records his telephone calls and archives every picture–up to 1,000 a day –snapped by his automatic “ SenseCam , ” that device slung around his neck .
He has even stowed his entire past :
The massive stacks of documents from his 47 - year computer career , first as a millionaire executive then as a government Internet bureaucrat , have been hoovered up and scanned in .
The last time he counted , MyLifeBits had more than 101,000 emails , almost 15,000 Word and PDF documents , 99,000 Web pages , and 44,000 pictures .
“ And that , ” he cackles , “ is a s–tload of stuff . ”
That load has endowed Bell with the ability to perform supernatural feats of memory .
He can dredge up the precise contents of an inspirational note above his desk 30 years ago ( a set of aphorisms , including “ Start many fires ” ) .
He knows who passed him on the street on the way to work four weeks ago .
And when someone disputes his recollection of a conference call the previous day , he can end the argument by pulling up the audio stream and listening to it again .
Instantly .

“ It gives you kind of a feeling of cleanliness , ” Bell tells me .
“ I can offload my memory .
I feel much freer about remembering something now .
I ’ve got this machine , this slave , that does it . ”
It gives his mind the chance , he says , to be more playful , to have more energy for creative thinking .
But it is also a double - edged sword .
Bell suspects MyLifeBits might be slowly degrading his real , carbon - based brain ’s ability to remember clearly .
When you have an outboard mind doing the scut work , you tend to get out of practice .
“ It ’s like doing arithmetic , ” he says .
“ Who does it anymore ?
You ’ve got pocket calculators for that .
I know I can do long division .
But I have n’t done it for a long time . ”
It ’s a crazy experiment .
But perhaps its craziest aspect is that soon you ’ll be part of it too–whether you want to be or not .
The way Bell sees it , computers and the Internet are now rapidly becoming capable of storing everything you do and see .
Hard - drive space has exploded in size , and every day people are recording more and more of their lives :
We blog about our thoughts , upload personal pictures to Flickr , save every email on our infinitely expanding Gmail accounts , shoot video on our cell phones , record phone calls straight to our hard drives when we use Skype .
“ People say , ‘ Oh , what you ’re doing is revolutionary ! ' ”
Bell says .
“ I say , ‘ No , no , it ’s evolutionary .
Because it ’s happening to you .
It ’s happening as you speak . ' ”
So what will life be like when nothing is forgotten ?
Provocative as that question may be , it ’s hardly theoretical .
The thinking behind MyLifeBits and other lifelogging research is already seeping into our lives .
It ’s changing the way our search engines work .
It ’s affecting corporate strategy .
And the power of machines to create boundless memory–and to augment and even transform human thinking –is only going to become more pronounced .
We ’ve arrived at a time when the memory of machines creates ideas we ’ve never considered .
Paperless Trail
You could trace the notion of perfect recall back to 1945 , when presidential science adviser Vannevar Bush published a provocative essay in The Atlantic Monthly entitled “ As We May Think . ”
Bush argued that man ’s mind could be perfected by technology .
He envisioned a device called a Memex , “ in which an individual stores all his books , records , and communications , and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility . ”
A user would wear a “ walnut - sized ” camera on his forehead , capturing everything he saw , then sit down at his Memex to browse thousands of personal letters , newspapers , and encyclopedias instantly .
It would be , Bush argued , “ an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory . ”
advertisement
“ We ’ve come to a time when machine memory creates ideas we ’ve never considered . ”
MyLifeBits was born from a much humbler idea : Bell was sick of carting around stacks of paper .
He was a veteran of the computer revolution–indeed , he helped kick - start it in the 1960s and 1970s by building the first refrigerator - sized “ minicomputers ” for DEC , a pioneering computer firm .
In the 1980s , he helped the government bootstrap the Internet into existence , then worked as an angel in Silicon Valley , growing wealthier and wealthier as his investments took flight .
Hired in 1995 by Microsoft Research Labs , a wing of the company devoted to designing the future of computers , Bell was given carte blanche .
He decided to become the first person in history “ to truly go paperless . ”
So he bought a scanner , and his poor assistant Vicki , a witty , motherly 56 - year - old , began the arduous slog of making PDFs of four enormous filing cabinets ’ worth of stuff .
The archive begins with photos of Bell ’s mother ’s birth in 1900 and basically never stops , sucking in everything from the sublime to the ridiculous :
Bell ’s medical records , his Japanese - made notebooks filled with his elegant sketches of computer circuitry , phone bills , stickie notes , a copy of a “ robot driver ’s license ” he got a couple of years ago .
His appetite whetted , Bell decided to store even more data .
So he turned to two Microsoft researchers , Jim Gemmell and Roger Lueder , who built software to automatically save digital copies of everything Bell generated : chat transcripts , every Web page he looked at , even records of his keystrokes .
Then Lyndsay Williams , a Microsoft inventor in Cambridge , England , came up with an even more radical idea : the SenseCam , which creates a visual record of his life , like a personal security camera .
It would snap pictures either at regular intervals or when triggered by a meaningful event , such as when its infrared detectors sensed someone standing in front of Bell , or when its light sensors saw that he ’d entered a new room .
A tagalong GPS device stamps each picture with its geographic location .
At first , Bell was worried about filling up his hard - drive space too quickly .
He accumulates 1 gig of information a month , and at that clip , the average MyLifeBits for an 72 - year - old person would require 1 to 3 terabytes–a hefty amount of storage .
But by 2000 , driven by teenagers ’ insatiable desire to store MP3s and video clips , hard drives had dropped radically in price and grown enormously in capacity .
Bell figures that in a few years , even a cheap cell phone will have enough space to store your entire existence .
“ We ’ve gone from this period of scarcity , when you had to always go , ‘ Jeez , I ca n’t keep this video file because my hard drive is full , ’ to the opposite , ” Bell says .
“ I tell people , ‘ Never throw anything out .
You ’ll never have to worry about space for the rest of your life . ' ”
Slowly , in often subtle ways , MyLifeBits began to affect Bell ’s life .
During a phone call to discuss a heart problem last year , Bell could n’t follow his doctor ’s flood of jargon– but he could listen to the call again and decode it at his leisure .
A friend passed away ; Bell was able to pluck a piece of 20 - year - old correspondence from the mists for his eulogy .
Meanwhile , the presence of the SenseCam and audio recorder began creeping out his “ significant other , ” who was n’t sure she liked having everything set in stone .
“ We ’d be talking , and she ’d suddenly go , ‘ You did n’t record that , did you ? ' ”
Bell chuckles .
“ And I ’d admit , Yeah , I did .
‘ Delete it !
Delete it !' ”
Bell also discovered he was getting annoyed by experiences that could n’t be stuffed into a hard drive .
During a ride in a cab in Australia , a tiny security - cam surveyed him , and he wondered why he could n’t automatically get a copy of the feed .
And books , in particular , drive him crazy .
“ I virtually refuse to own any books at this point , ” he complained at one point .
“ I mean , I get them , I look at them , I occasionally read them .
But then I give them away , because they ’re not in my memory .
To me they ’re almost gone . ”

Total Recall
If it ’s not in your database , it does n’t exist .
That ’s the sort of eerie philosophical proposition Bell ’s project raises .
He has a superhuman brain :
Does that change the nature of being human ?
For Bell , MyLifeBits has reduced the nagging anxiety we face every day at work .
We meet an important stranger and panic about whether we ’ll remember her name and position .
We browse through Web pages , wondering absently if we should take the extra few seconds to bookmark something for future reference .
These tiny but draining bits of mental toil have fallen from Bell ’s cognitive load–a luxury even for me as I reported this piece : Copies of his old memos from DEC ?
The list of people he considered hiring a few years ago to head up Microsoft Research , with handwritten notes on their strengths and weaknesses ?
He had pristine copies at hand .
Martin Conway , a psychologist and memory expert at the University of Leeds , argues that projects like MyLifeBits can actually improve mental health by freeing our brains to be more productive and more creative .
“ We ’re moving into an age when technology is going to massively enhance our cognitive abilities , our problem - solving abilities , ” he says .
It ’s rather like the way Google has already become an indispensable part of how people think about things–sitting at their desks , constantly tapping into the world ’s massive trove of information .
“ Your real memory becomes a sort of executive manager for all these other technological abilities . ”
“ Forgetting is how we make sense of life , ” says one skeptic .
“ We need to forget . ” Personal - productivity guru David Allen also has long argued that the frailty of everyday memory is the primary source of stress for overburdened corporate types .
We sit around anxious about our to - do lists because we can never entirely remember them ( while we ’re at work ) or entirely forget them ( when we ’re not ) .
Yet Bell ’s project has also made some observers nervous .
It may not be a good idea , they argue , to tamper with human memory –because it ’s such a powerful part of what makes us who we are .
“ I ’m a big fan of forgetting , ” says Frank Nack , a German computer scientist who published a critique of lifelogging experiments last winter .
“ It ’s how we make sense of life , how we interpret things .
Everybody is building a life story ; we all need to forget certain stages .
I do n’t want to be reminded of everything I said . ”
Forgetting , he points out , is key to cultural concepts like forgiveness and nostalgia .
Sure , we lose track of most of what happens to us–but that natural filtering process results in what we call knowledge and wisdom .
When memories are only a click away , Nack says , they ’re cheapened .
Without the difficult act of pulling something from the crannies of the mind , we become like the hapless high - school student who gets 2 million hits for a search on “ World War II ” and has no way of prioritizing them .
advertisement
James L. McGaugh , a memory expert at the University of California , Irvine , points to the sad spectacle of Funes , a character in a Jorge Luis Borges story who suffers a head injury that renders him incapable of forgetting .
“ He says , ‘ My mind is like a garbage heap . ’
That ’s what it ’d be like , ” McGaugh adds .
“ You have to watch what you wish for with memory . ”
As Bell ’s significant other realized , if everyone had a record of every conversation , it could turn everyday life and work into a maddening series of gotchas .
Imagine that prig in your weekly meeting confronting you with an ill - advised comment you made three months ago .
( On the other hand , imagine having a handy record of your boss ’s promises about when , precisely , he ’d get that report back to you . )
College graduates are already getting a taste of life in a world of persistent memory .
Last spring , many found themselves getting turned down for entry - level jobs after prospective employers Googled them and unearthed tales of debauchery –with photos ! –on their MySpace pages .
Some corporations already erase all email older than a few months for fear of suffering the fate of Enron or Microsoft , companies that had humiliating years - old correspondence subpoenaed .
What ’s more , knowing that everything is being logged might actually turn us into different people .
We might be less flamboyant , less funny , less willing to say risky but potentially useful things , much as politicians on - camera tamp down their public statements into stifled happytalk .
“ There ’d be a chilling effect , ” particularly early on , says Mark Federman , former strategist for the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology , a high - tech think tank .
“ We ’d all be on our best behavior .
Reality would become reality TV . ”
As for Bell , he acknowledges that all this remembering could have a downside .
“ Fifty years from now , do you want to know that , gee , I visited a porn site today ? ” he asks with a smile .
And when it comes to corporate information , he admits that “ ownership , deniability , privacy , expungability –they ’re important . ”
Microsoft has n’t yet objected to all of its sensitive corporate memos going into Bell ’s off - site brain , but he suspects that day will come .
When he eventually retires , he says , he ’ll be in the weird position of having to shave those memories off and give them back .
“ I ’ll need a lobotomy , ” he says , only half joking .
Still , Bell insists the trend toward total memory is n’t going away .
More and more , it is happening automatically .
Those tens of millions of bloggers and Flickr users–all out there recording their thoughts and pictures –have clearly decided that there ’s enormous value not just in capturing those thoughts but in sharing them with the public .
The choice is n’t whether you ’ll join the revolution but whether you ’ll embrace it .
Shaping Chaos
For all of its machine muscle , Bell ’s virtual memory was n’t quite what I imagined .
When I first heard about his work , I expected someone who would dazzle me mentally , pulling off feats of recollection like some cyborgian savant : Quick–give me the name of a random seatmate on a flight last July !
List all the ingredients from that stroganoff you made back in college !
And indeed , hanging out with a mnemonist could be quite unsettling .
One day , Bell was trying to describe to me a superb jazz - trumpet performance he ’d attended in Australia the week before , then realized he did n’t have to–he just found the audio file of the event and played it , the sinuous solo blasting out his computer speakers .
( He concedes , sheepishly , that it probably was n’t quite legal to record the event . )

MyLifeBits is now so big that it faces a classic problem of information management :
It ’s hellishly difficult to search , and Bell often finds himself lost in the forest .
He hunts for an email but ca n’t lay his hands on it .
He gropes for a document , but it eludes him .
While eating lunch in San Francisco , he tells me about a Paul Krugman column he liked , so I ask him to show it to me .
But it ’s like pulling teeth : A MyLifeBits search for “ Paul Krugman ” produces scores of columns , and Bell ca n’t quite filter out the right one .
When I ask him to locate a phone call from one of his colleagues , he hits a bug :
He can locate the name of the file , but when he clicks on it the data are AWOL .
“ Where the hell is this friggin ’ phone call ? ” he mutters to himself , pecking at the keyboard .
“ I either get nothing or I get too much ! ” Granted , MyLifeBits is an experimental demo , and thus naturally unstable .
And even when his system is failing , Bell remains pretty bemused about everything , displaying the perpetual geniality of all brilliant , accomplished , wealthy older men who ’ve long ceased to care what anyone thinks of them .
Still , as I watch the hunt for the missing call , it feels like some creepy sci-fi version of Alzheimer ’s , or a scene plucked out of a bleak Philip K . Dick novel :
Our antihero has an external brain with perfect recall , but it ’s locked up tight and he ca n’t get in–a cyborg estranged from his own limbs .
This turns out to be the central question behind MyLifeBits :
Yes , it ’s possible to store a lifetime of memories , but what do you do with them ?
To figure that out , I made a visit to Mary Czerwinski , a principal research scientist at Microsoft Research Labs whose team has developed “ Facetmap , ” an audacious piece of software designed to visualize the contents of Bell ’s cybermemory .
When I meet the energetic , hyperverbal Czerwinski , she pulls me over to a massive 3 - foot - by - 3 - foot LCD monitor on her office wall .
On - screen there ’s a collection of colorful blobs representing different parts of Bell ’s life .
There ’s a blob for people , another for calendar dates , and a bunch for different types of documents like email or Word files .
She shows me how it works :
If you click on any blob , it instantly expands to show you everything it contains .
Click on the blob for “ Jim Gemmell , ” Bell ’s main collaborator , and you ’ll see a blob containing all their email traffic , another with documents that mention Gemmell ’s name , and a third with events where he appears .
The more data in each category , the bigger the blob , “ so you can quickly see which area has had the most action , ” she notes .
But the truly intriguing part about Facetmap is that it shows how Bell ’s information is connected .
I start poking around , clicking on Gemmell ’s blob , then drilling down to a particular email Bell sent him on February 25 , 2005 .
As I zoom in , the software automatically creates new blobs showing everything else Bell did on that day–emails to other colleagues , photos Bell took , Web sites he viewed .
It feels like flying freely through Bell ’s memories , flitting anywhere I want .
And it re-creates those same loosey - goosey linkages that tie memories together in our real - life minds .
Were this my own computer , I could zip back to read a Wall Street Journal article from three months ago , then teleport over to all my email from that day , then notice I ’d forwarded the article to someone along with a couple of cool ideas , ideas I ’d forgotten I ’d ever written .
It ’s like software for productive daydreaming .

Facetmap is based on a truth psychologists have long understood :
We organize our memories by time and people .
Those categories , Czerwinski says , are the pathways into the forest and the portholes from one memory to another .
“ The way you remember things is associative , ” she says .
“ You think , ‘ There ’s all this stuff in my life that ’s related to Clive , or to Gordon . ’
Or you think , ‘ There ’s all this stuff that happened last fall . ' ”
If you vaguely remember a book but ca n’t recall the title or author , the first thing you ’re likely to begin with is the friend who told you about it ; so you hunt through all the emails you got from him .
One of Czerwinski ’s colleagues at Microsoft , Susan Dumais , analyzed how people search for things on their computers and found that about one - quarter of the queries were for someone ’s name .
She also explored ways to use “ landmark ” events to index our memories .
“ You ’ll think , ‘ Oh , I ’m sure it happened right before the wedding , or just after Hurricane Katrina , ' ” Dumais says .
She developed an experimental piece of software that embedded those landmarks into search tools so that you could , say , start with a major event and then see all the email or Web pages you looked at that day .
It drastically improved the ability to find things in the distant past , she says .
These sorts of tricks are already helping Bell find his memories .
Gemmell has written a piece of software that works much like Facetmap .
It ’s less graphical ( it looks more like a regular Windows search ) but just as powerful , as Gemmell illustrated with an example during my visit to his office :
At one point last year , Bell had considered selling some property , so he surfed a bunch of real - estate Web pages and chatted with Connie , his broker .
A few months later , he wanted to revisit those pages but could n’t figure out the right key words to bring them up .
He had Connie ’s number , though , so he located the copy of his call to her .
Then he checked the rest of his activity for that call , and presto :
There were the Web sites , too .
“ It works via how your memory works , ” Gemmell says .
“ It ’s like , ‘ I do n’t remember the specific words on that real - estate page . ’
My memory is just , ‘ It ’s the page I saw when I was talking to Connie . ’
We have to make ‘ search ’ more like the way we actually think . ”
Instant Replay I came away from these demos eager for this stuff to come out of the lab and into the world .
But the fact is that our everyday search tools are already moving slowly in this direction .
In the past year , free “ desktop search ” programs by Google and Microsoft–which scour your hard drive–have begun incorporating sophisticated filters that let you work in similar ways :
You can start by looking for a person , then find all the memos you ’ve written to them , then quickly zoom in on a day .

One day when I met Bell in San Francisco , I got a chance to see his life through his eyes .
He ’d worn his SenseCam to work that day , and when he plays the images back rapidly , it ’s like watching a crude , stop- motion movie : buying coffee at Starbucks , grabbing a paper , entering his building , and finally dropping down at his desk .
“ If you lose your keys , you can scroll back and figure out where you put ’em , ” he jokes .
In fact , Bell seems like the sort of guy who might lose his keys a lot .
He ’d regularly get halfway through a sentence , then cut himself off and race along another tangent , only to have his hamster brain veer away halfway through that thought , too .
The guy ’s obviously crazy - smart , I thought .
But no wonder he loves having a camera record the messy details of life .
Yet here ’s the problem with the pictures :
They pose an even bigger search dilemma , because computers ca n’t “ see ” the contents of a photo .
It ’s impossible for Bell to hunt for “ pictures of my desk at work , ” or “ that tall blond guy I met at the party ” ; at best , he can sort them by date or GPS coordinates .
And while he has added keyword “ tags ” to many shots , it ’s time - consuming and still not terribly accurate .
Even he admits he rarely peruses any of his thousands of SenseCam pictures .
So are all those photos a waste of memory ?
Or can that kind of exhaustive visual record actually be worth something ?
Alan Smeaton , a professor of computing at Dublin University , thinks it can .
After hearing about Bell ’s project , Smeaton got Microsoft to lend him a few SenseCams and gave them to his students , who began wearing them all day long .
They discovered an intriguing psychological effect :
If , at the end of each workday , they spent a minute scrolling through the thousands of pictures the SenseCam had taken–a high - speed replay of their day–it had the effect of stimulating their short - term memory .
“ You actually remember things you ’d already forgotten , ” Smeaton says .
“ You ’d see somebody you met in a corridor and had a two - minute conversation with that you ’d completely forgotten about .
And you ’d go , ‘ Oh , I forgot to send an email to that guy ! ’
It ’s bizarre .
It improves your recall by 100 % . ”
advertisement
In fact , “ refresher ” imagery is so powerful that it seems to help restore recall in people who have very little memory , or none at all .
Ken Wood , a computer scientist in Microsoft ’s research lab in Cambridge , gave a SenseCam to a UK woman who had lost her short - term memory due to encephalitis .
She began wearing it to events she wanted to retain .
After each of them , she reviewed the pictures several times over the course of the following two weeks .
When the researchers quizzed her a month later , she still had “ significant recall . ”
“ She was over the moon , ” Wood marvels .
“ Totally thrilled . ” Silicon Cortex Consider for a second how , precisely , we think .
We use our memories all the time , of course , often by “ active ” remembering –scrolling through our minds to locate a tidbit .
But much mental labor is passive .
We think about something in the background , subconsciously letting a problem brew .
Then we suddenly hit upon an interesting combination of things , a new way of thinking about a problem : the elusive , all - important epiphany .
What if our computers had their own intelligence , and could do that background work for us ?
What if they could mine our memories for new ways of thinking ?
And what if they could prioritize the vast heaps of material in the backs of our minds , shaping the informational chaos that often leaves Bell so baffled ?
A memory system that could think on its own would unlock the lifelog ’s full potential .
Already Bell and Gemmell have played around with this effect using the SenseCam data by developing a screen saver that displays random snapshots from their personal archives .
Bell finds it oddly mesmerizing : Pictures of long - ago birthdays or family trips will trigger waves of nostalgia , he says .
But Czerwinski predicts that a similar screen saver could become a killer app in the office .
When you ’re working on a project , the screen saver would cycle randomly through any documents , pictures , emails , or Web pages pertaining to your work–and you would see if the unpredictable combinations inspired fresh ways of understanding it .
“ You ’d see some memo you wrote two years ago and think , ‘ Oh , right , that was a good idea .
Why did n’t I follow up on that ? ' ” she says .
But the real goal is “ to discover things that even you did n’t know that you knew , ” says Bradley Rhodes , a computer scientist with Ricoh Innovations .
In the lifelogging community , Rhodes is famous for creating the “ Remembrance Agent , ” an experimental piece of software , as a PhD student at MIT .
The Agent sits in the corner of your screen and pays attention to everything you type ; every few seconds it checks inside your hard drive to see if it can find anything relevant .
If it does , it alerts you in the corner of your screen by showing a line or two of the related document .
advertisement
The connections the Agent discovers are surprising , often valuable .
When Rhodes first started using it , he ’d begin writing an email to ask a colleague a question , but before he could even push “ send , ” the Agent would reveal that a long - forgotten document on his hard drive already contained the answer .
Other times , a colleague would email him a question and the Agent would remind Rhodes that he ’d been asked that once before and had forgotten to reply .
“ So , in mid-email , I realize I have to switch gears and apologize and go , ‘ Sorry for not getting back to you . ’
It actually would change my behavior , ” he says .
By actively reminding you of things from the past , “ it keeps you from looking stupid . ”
Now there ’s a killer app .
After using the Remembrance Agent for a while , Rhodes got a reputation for uncanny recall .
“ I ’d have people emailing me saying , ‘ Hey , Brad , I know you ’ve got this augmented brain .
Can you answer this ?’
And sometimes I could . ”
He imagines the Agent as particularly useful for lawyers and other paranoid execs drowning in paperwork .
They could cram every sensitive email and memo related to a corporate crisis into their computers and let the Agent monitor them on the periphery .
One of Bell ’s Microsoft allies is also investigating whether artificial intelligence could be used to find hidden patterns in memory .
One day last summer , I visited Eric Horvitz , an expert in machine intelligence at the Research Labs , to see his “ Lifebrowser . ”
The Lifebrowser ’s goal is to automatically identify the most significant events in your life , so that when you scroll back through your history , it shows you only the most important highlights .
The software starts by having you “ train ” it by rating different things on your computer as significant or negligible .
But then you turn Lifebrowser loose , and things get really interesting .
It begins to observe your daily behavior and rank your documents and calendar events .
Horvitz has given the software to members of his team at Microsoft , and Lifebrowser has already discovered several intriguing things about how we work .
Unusual events –“ atypia ” –tend to be the ones that people most want to remember .
Intuitively , this makes sense : Sudden , unexpected news , good or bad , is highly meaningful ; a large cluster of pictures from the same day usually means you saw something odd or important–pluck one of them out , and it ’s likely to be a rich memory .
( In contrast , regular meetings are virtually never remarkable .
“ No one ever needs to remember what happened at the regular Monday staff meeting , ” Horvitz notes dryly . )
He pulls me over to his computer screen to see his own personal Lifebrowser .
At first , it just looks like a regular calendar , with months stretching back years .
But when he zooms in on October 2004 , I can see that Lifebrowser has carefully picked only a few items to display on each day : A meeting at DARPA , the military - research agency .
Pictures of Horvitz ’s family visit to Whidbey Island .
An email announcing a surprise visit from his old college friend .
“ I would never have thought about this stuff myself , ” Horvitz says , scanning the calendar .
“ But as soon as I see it , I ’m like , ‘ Oh , right –that was important ! ' ”
Lifebrowser , in essence , shapes the seemingly random flow of our lives and reminds us of what we ought to be focusing on .

For me , though , the real holy grail would be a system that does n’t merely remind me of what I already know–or once knew , even .
It would be one that actually conceives of new ideas .
Few computer scientists are claiming to have figured that one out .
But a hint of what may be coming has already arrived from Devon Technologies , a company that has created a tool called DEVONthink .
It works like this :
As you work on a project , you feed DEVONthink copies of any emails , memos , documents , PDF files , or Web pages you find interesting .
The software performs a complex analysis of all that information , trying to find documents that are statistically similar to one another in meaning .
This is much more sophisticated than a simple word search , though : DEVONthink can learn that the words “ automobile repair ” and “ car fixing ” are synonymous , for example , even though they use completely different terms .
This allows the software to spot some astonishingly subtle connections .
Steven Johnson , a writer in New York , discovered that DEVONthink ’s smarts could literally inspire him to come up with profitable new ideas .
He had been using the software for several years , putting all his research into it .
While writing his latest book last year on the London cholera outbreak of 1854 , he ’d plug paragraphs of his draft into DEVONthink to see if anything else on his hard drive was related .
One day , he inserted a passage on the London sewer system that used the word “ sewage ” a lot .
DEVONthink unexpectedly unearthed a quote that discussed how vertebrates originally evolved their bones–by reusing the calcium waste generated by their metabolism .
It was a weird connection : comparing the waste systems of a city to those of an animal .
But a lightbulb went off in Johnson ’s head , and he began dreaming up a new chapter for his book , contrasting the ways that cities and the human body find productive uses for their by - products .
“ Now , strictly speaking , who is responsible for that initial idea ? ” he wondered , when he described the experience in an article .
“ Was it me or the software ? ”
The idea , he argues , was a synthesis of two minds –his real brain and his virtual one .
“ Two very different kinds of intelligence playing off each other , ” he says , “ one carbon - based , the other silicon . ”
In spring 2004 , Gemmell lost a chunk of his memory .
The Microsoft senior researcher had built his own personal MyLifeBits database , filling it , like Bell , with oodles of his email , Web surfing , and pictures .
But one day , Gemmell ’s hard drive crashed , and he had n’t backed up in four months .
When he got his MyLifeBits back up and running , the hole that had been punched in his memories was palpable , even painful .
He ’d be working at a project and vaguely remember some Web site or document that was important , then begin drilling down to find it–only to discover that it was part of the missing period .
advertisement
“ It was like having my memories stolen , ” he says .
He was amazed to realize his backup brain was no longer some novelty but a regular part of his psychological landscape .
“ I realized I count on this now .
It ’s like I expect to drive cars and have flush toilets . ”
Machine memory is obviously giving us astonishing abilities , but can we deal with the change it ’ll wreak in our lives and work ?
We might become so reliant on artificial memory that we lose the habit of noticing things .
“ What is going to happen to us if we bypass something and we ought to have noticed it ? ” wonders Frank Nack , the lifelogging skeptic .
Is it possible to forget how to remember ?
Perhaps so :
Most of us have lost a cell phone only to realize that we can no longer recall the phone numbers of even our closest friends because the machine remembered them for us .
Whatever it all means ,
Bell will likely be the first person on the planet to find out .
As I leave him at his San Francisco office , he offers me a parting gift , and fittingly enough , it ’s a memory device : one of the notebooks he buys at a nearby stationery store .
It ’s beautiful , oddly old - fashioned .
Yes , the man who swore off paper knows it would be much easier for MyLifeBits if he did all his writing electronically , on a digital tablet or whatnot .
“ But I ca n’t help it , ” he says , “ I just love these gorgeous Japanese - made notebooks . ”
He did , after all , spend decades as a young engineer recording every idea on pads of his own .
Some habits die hard .

Monday November 6 , 2006
Here 's how the 2006 mid-term election was stolen .
Note the past tense .
And I 'm not kidding .
And shoot me for saying this , but it wo n't be stolen by jerking with the touch - screen machines ( though they 'll do their nasty part ) .
While progressives panic over the viral spread of suspect computer black boxes , the Karl Rove - bots have been tunneling into the vote vaults through entirely different means .
For six years now , our investigations team , at first on assignment for BBC TV and the Guardian , has been digging into the nitty - gritty of the gaming of US elections .
We 've found that November 7 , 2006 is a day that will live in infamy .
Four and a half million votes have been shoplifted .
Here 's how they 'll do it , in three easy steps :
Theft # 1 : Registrations gone with the wind
On January 1 , 2006 , while America slept off New Year 's Eve hangovers , a new federal law crept out of the swamps that has devoured 1.9 million votes , overwhelmingly those of African - Americans and Hispanics .
The vote - snatching statute is a cankerous codicil slipped into the 2002 Help America Vote Act — strategically timed to go into effect in this mid-term year .
It requires every state to reject new would - be voters whose identity can't be verified against a state verification database .
Sounds arcane and not too threatening .
But look at the numbers and you wo n't feel so fine .
About 24.3 million Americans attempt to register or re-register each year .
The New York University Law School 's Brennan Center told me that , under the new law , Republican Secretaries of State began the year by blocking about one in three new voters .
How ?
To begin with , Mr. Bush 's Social Security Administration has failed to verify 47 % of registrants .
After appeals and new attempts to register , US Elections Assistance Agency statistics indicate 1.9 million would - be voters will still find themselves barred from the ballot on Tuesday .
But do n't worry : those holding passports from their ski vacations to Switzerland are doing just fine .
And that 's the point .
It 's not the number of voters rejected , it ’s their color .
For example , California 's Republican Secretary of State Bruce McPherson figured out how to block 40 % of registrants , mostly Hispanics .
In a rare counter - move , Los Angeles , with a Hispanic mayor , contacted these citizens , “ verified ” them and got almost every single one back on the rolls .
But throughout the rest of the West , new Hispanics remain victims of the “ Jose Crow ” treatment .
In hotly contested Ohio , Kenneth Blackwell , Secretary of State and the Republican 's candidate for Governor , remains voter - rejection champ — partly by keeping the rejection criteria a complete secret .
Theft # 2 : Turned Away – the ID game
A legion of pimple - faced Republicans with Blackberries loaded with lists of new voters is assigned to challenge citizens in heavily Black and Hispanic ( i.e. Democratic ) precincts to demand photo ID that perfectly matches registration data .
Sounds benign , but it 's not .
The federal HAVA law and complex new ID requirements in states like New Mexico will easily allow the GOP squads to triple the number of voters turned away .
Rather than deny using these voter suppression tactics , Republican spokesmen are claiming they are “ protecting the integrity of the vote . ”
I 've heard that before .
In 2004 , we got our hands on fifty confidential internal memos from the files of the Republican National Committee .
Attached to these were some pretty strange spreadsheets .
They called them “ caging lists ” — and it was n't about zoo feeding times .
They were lists ( 70,000 for Florida alone ) of new Black and Jewish voters — a very Democratic demographic — to challenge on Election Day .
The GOP did so with a vengeance :
In 2004 , for the first time in half a century , more than 3.5 million voters were challenged on Election Day .
Worse , nearly half lost their vote : 300,000 were turned away for wrong ID ; 1.1 million were allowed a “ provisional ” ballot — which was then simply tossed out .
Tomorrow , new federal ID requirements and a dozen new state show - me - your - ID laws will permit the GOP challenge campaign to triple their 300,000 record to nearly one million voters blocked .
Theft # 3 : Votes Spoiled Rotten
The nasty little secret of US elections is that three million ballots are cast in national elections but not counted — 3,600,380 not counted in 2004 according to US Election Commission stats .
These are votes lost because a punch card did n't punch ( its chad got “ hung ” ) , a stray mark voided a paper ballot and other machinery glitches .
Officials call it “ spoilage . ”
I call it , “ inaugurating Republicans . ”
Why ?
According to statisticians working with the US Civil Rights Commission , the chance your vote will “ spoil ” this way is 900 % higher for Black folk and 500 % higher for Hispanics than for white voters .
When we do the arithmetic , we find that well over half of all votes spoiled or “ blank ” are cast by voters of color .
On balance , this spoilage game produces a million - vote edge for the GOP .
That 's where the Black Boxes come into play .
Forget about Karl Rove messing with the software to change your vote .
Rather , the big losses occur when computers crash , fail to start or simply do n't respond to your touch .
They are the new spoilage machines of choice with , statistically , the same racial bias as the old vote - snatching lever machines .
( Funny , but paper ballots with in - precinct scanners do n't go rotten on Black voters .
Maybe that 's why Republican Secretaries of State have installed so few of them . )
So Let 's Add it Up
Two million legitimate voters will be turned away because of wrongly rejected or purged registrations .
Add another one million voters challenged and turned away for “ improper ID . ”
Then add yet another million for Democratic votes “ spoiled ” by busted black boxes and by bad ballots .
And let 's not forget to include the one million “ provisional ” ballots which will never get counted .
Based on the experience of 2004 , we know that , overwhelmingly , minority voters are the ones shunted to these baloney ballots .
And there 's one more group of votes that wo n't be counted : absentee ballots challenged and discarded .
Elections Assistance Agency data tell us a half million of these absentee votes will go down the drain .
Driving this massive suppression of the vote are sophisticated challenge operations .
And here I must note that the Democrats have no national challenge campaign .
That 's morally laudable ; electorally suicidal .
Add it all up — all those Democratic - leaning votes rejected , barred and spoiled — and the Republican Party begins Election Day with a 4.5 million - vote thumb on the vote - tally scale .
So , what are you going to do about it ?
May I suggest you … steal back your vote .
It 's true you can't win with 51 % of the vote anymore .
So just get over it .
The regime 's sneak attack via vote suppression will only net them 4.5 million votes , about 5 % of the total .
You should be able to beat that blindfolded .
If you can't get 55 % , then you 're just a bunch of crybaby pussycats who do n't deserve to win back America .

It ’s the late 1700s and you ’re on a ship that ’s lost in the middle of the ocean — nothing but water from horizon to horizon , day after day .
What ’s your most valuable asset ?
Yes , of course , water and food , but I mean besides that .
Would you believe …a pocket watch ?
Neither would some of Britain ’s most eminent scientists at the time , but it was indeed a watch of sorts that held the key to a maritime problem that had frustrated sailors for centuries — sometimes with deadly results — and which many people believed was simply impossible to solve .
That problem was how to determine one ’s longitude on a ship .
Turn Left at the Third Wave
Nothing could be more important to a captain than knowing the ship ’s location , but without landmarks , this was an amazingly difficult puzzle a couple of centuries ago .
There were compasses , of course , which could tell you which direction you ’re heading .
One could judge latitude with reasonable accuracy by measuring the angle between the sun and the horizon — at least if the sun was out and the ship was n’t rocking too severely .
And , by tossing a weighted rope off the ship and counting how many knots passed through one ’s hands in a given period of time , a rough estimate of speed could be obtained .
But it ’s of limited value to know that you ’re traveling southeast at 7 knots , 50° north of the equator , if you have no idea whether you ’re closer to Newfoundland or Ireland .
And even with rigorous recordkeeping , excellent charts , and detailed knowledge of ocean currents , the equipment available at that time made it impossible to judge east - west position with anything approaching accuracy ; the sun simply can’t tell you that , because the planet is rotating .
There being no apparent solution to the problem , mariners simply lived with this frustration .
But on a foggy day in 1707 , four large British warships returning from France misjudged their longitude and ran aground on the Scilly Islands off the southwest tip of England .
The ships all sank , and more than 2,000 men died .
As a result , in 1714 , the British government offered a huge cash prize ( £ 20,000 — equivalent to millions of pounds or dollars in today ’s money ) to the first person who could devise a way of accurately measuring longitude at sea .
It was the 18th century equivalent of the X Prize , and the nation ’s brightest and best set to work inventing solutions of all kinds .
Ticked Off
The key , as everyone realized , was being able to tell what time it is — both at one ’s current location and at some other point on the planet ( say , Greenwich ) .
Because the speed of the planet ’s rotation is known ( about 15° per hour ) , if you know what time it is at a given longitude , you can take the time at your location , do some simple math , and end up with your position .
That sounds straightforward enough , but it meant that you ’d have to have with you , on a journey that may last weeks or months , a clock that accurately told you the time back home .
The problem was that most clocks were extremely inaccurate — gaining or losing a minute or more each day — and even then , they were based on delicate mechanisms ( such as pendulums ) that would be thrown completely out of kilter on a rocking ship .
A few days out of port , even if you could ascertain the time at your current location accurately ( based on the sun ’s position ) , your reference clock would be worthless .
In the quest to solve the timekeeping problem , the most popular approach , by far , involved star charts .
The idea was that the relationship between the moon and various stars was unique for each time of each day , so if you could make careful observations at night and correlate those observations with a set of tables , you could tell with precision what time it is — or was , a few hours ago , when you began making your calculations .
Apart from the difficulty of cataloging all that data usefully , though , this approach assumed that the observer would have clear skies and a steady observation point — both difficult to guarantee on the high seas .
Time for a Solution
Meanwhile , an unknown clock maker named John Harrison was busy on a completely different approach : constructing a clock that was far more accurate than any available at the time and capable of maintaining that accuracy even after weeks of being tossed around on a ship .
In the course of his experiments , Harrison came up with many innovative technologies that have since found their way into not only clocks but also a variety of other machines , such as the caged roller bearing and a bimetallic pendulum to compensate for temperature changes .
But putting them all together into the perfect clock was a very long process .
His first prototype , which he called H1 , took five years to build .
It was , at the time , possibly the most accurate timekeeping device in existence , but still not good enough to win Harrison the prize .
Over the next 20 years or so , Harrison worked on improved designs — H2 and H3 — but abandoned each when he realized it would not ultimately work .
However , while working on H3 , Harrison had asked another watchmaker to build him a pocket watch to his specifications .
Although pocket watches were not taken seriously at the time , Harrison ’s design turned out to be fantastically accurate .
This convinced him that his next step , H4 , should be based on the design of a pocket watch rather than on a larger clock mechanism .
Harrison finally completed H4 in 1759 at age 66 .
It looked like an oversized pocket watch , with a diameter of 13 cm ( about 5 inches ) .
Two years later , in 1761 , Harrison ’s son , William , took H4 on its official transatlantic trial .
The clock performed flawlessly ( and well within the range stipulated for the prize ) .
But the judges on the Board of Longitude — which included Isaac Newton — were convinced that no mechanical device could ever solve the longitude problem .
So this success , they concluded , must have been a fluke .
They demanded ( and got ) a second trial , which showed similar accuracy but still did n’t convince the Board .
Eventually Parliament took up the matter , and agreed to give Harrison and his son half the prize money , with the other half to be delivered if other watchmakers could duplicate his design and produce the same results .
Three years later , William , frustrated by the Board ’s continued heel dragging , appealed to King George III , who tested H4 himself .
He found it as accurate as had been claimed and , outraged that the Board had kept Harrison ’s rightful winnings from him , threatened to appear personally before Parliament if they did n’t hand over the rest of the prize money .
In 1773 , at age 80 and after more than 40 years of work , Harrison finally received both the prize money and the recognition of having solved the longitude problem .
He died three years later , on his 83rd birthday .
Today , sailors no longer need to carry an oversized pocket watch or check the angle of the sun to determine their position .
But even our highest - tech navigation devices , such as GPS receivers , ultimately rely on extraordinarily accurate timekeeping .
So Harrison ’s solution has truly stood the test of time .
Note :
This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared on Interesting Thing of the Day on April 27 , 2005 .
Professor Sam Braunstein , of the University of York 's Department of Computer Science , and Dr Arun Pati , of the Institute of Physics , Sainik School , Bhubaneswar , India , have established that quantum information cannot be ' hidden ' in conventional ways , or in Braunstein 's words , " quantum information can run but it can't hide . "
This result gives a surprising new twist to one of the great mysteries about black holes .
Conventional ( classical ) information can vanish in two ways , either by moving to another place ( e.g. across the internet ) , or by " hiding " , such as in a coded message .
The famous Vernam cipher devised in 1917 or its relative the one - time pad cryptographic code are examples of such classical information hiding : the information resides neither in the encoded message nor in the secret key pad used to decipher it – but in correlations between the two .
For decades , physicists believed that both these mechanisms were applicable to quantum information as well , but Professor Braunstein and Dr Pati have demonstrated that if quantum information disappears from one place , it must have moved somewhere else .
In a paper published in the latest edition of Physical Review Letters , Braunstein and Pati derive their ' no - hiding theorem ' and use it to study black holes which , in Einstein 's Theory of Relativity , are characterized as swallowing up anything that comes too close .
In the mid 1970s , Stephen Hawking 's showed that black holes eventually evaporate away in a steady stream of featureless radiation containing no information .
But if a black hole has completely evaporated , where has the information about it gone ?
This long standing question is known as the black hole information paradox .
Now , Professor Braunstein and Dr Pati have ruled out the possibility that information might escape from the black hole but be somehow hidden in correlations between the Hawking radiation and the black hole 's internal state .
Braunstein and Pati's result demonstrates that the black hole information paradox is even more severe than previously believed .
Dr Pati said : " Our result shows that either quantum mechanics or Hawking 's analysis must break down , but it does not choose between these two possibilities . "
Professor Braunstein said : " The no-hiding theorem provides new insight into the different laws governing classical and quantum information .
It shows that there 's got to be new physics out there . "
" Quantum information cannot be completely hidden in correlations : Implications for the black - hole information paradox " appears in the latest Physical Review Letters .

Home The Haskell Programmer 's Guide to the IO Monad --- Do n't Panic
The Haskell Programmer 's Guide to the IO Monad - Do n't Panic .
Stefan Klinger .
Why do I need a monad for IO in Haskell ?
The standard explanation is , that the IO monad hides the non-functional IO actions --- which do have side effects --- from the functional world of Haskell .
But how does this " hiding " work , apart from having IO actions disappearing beyond the borders of my knowledge ?
This report scratches the surface of category theory , an abstract branch of algebra , just deep enough to find the monad structure .
On the way we discuss the relations to the purely functional programming language Haskell .
Finally it should become clear how the IO monad keeps Haskell pure .
It 's hard for me to judge how successful this tutorial is going to be with beginners , but it seems well written .
The target audience is n't porgrammers trying to learn about monads as a programming construct , but rather programmers that want to get a taste of theory .

Thirty years ago , one was supposed to work one 's way up the corporate ladder .
That 's less the rule now .
Our generation wants to get paid up front .
Instead of developing a product for some big company in the expectation of getting job security in return , we develop the product ourselves , in a startup , and sell it to the big company .
At the very least we want options .
Among other things , this shift has created the appearance of a rapid increase in economic inequality .
But really the two cases are not as different as they look in economic statistics .
Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs .
An easy job from which one can't be fired is worth money ; exchanging the two is one of the commonest forms of corruption .
A sinecure is , in effect , an annuity .
Except sinecures do n't appear in economic statistics .
If they did , it would be clear that in practice socialist countries have nontrivial disparities of wealth , because they usually have a class of powerful bureaucrats who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired .
While not a sinecure , a position on the corporate ladder was genuinely valuable , because big companies tried not to fire people , and promoted from within based largely on seniority .
A position on the corporate ladder had a value analogous to the " goodwill " that is a very real element in the valuation of companies .
It meant one could expect future high paying jobs .
One of main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend for takeovers that began in the 1980s .
Why waste your time climbing a ladder that might disappear before you reach the top ?
And , by no coincidence , the corporate ladder was one of the reasons the early corporate raiders were so successful .
It 's not only economic statistics that ignore the value of safe jobs .
Corporate balance sheets do too .
One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies and sell them for parts was that they had n't formally acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high - paying executive jobs when their time came .
In the movie Wall Street , Gordon Gekko ridicules a company overloaded with vice presidents .
But the company may not be as corrupt as it seems ; those VPs ' cushy jobs were probably payment for work done earlier .
I like the new model better .
For one thing , it seems a bad plan to treat jobs as rewards .
Plenty of good engineers got made into bad managers that way .
And the old system meant people had to deal with a lot more corporate politics , in order to protect the work they 'd invested in a position on the ladder .
The big disadvantage of the new system is that it involves more risk .
If you develop ideas in a startup instead of within a big company , any number of random factors could sink you before you can finish .
But maybe the older generation would laugh at me for saying that the way we do things is riskier .
After all , projects within big companies were always getting cancelled as a result of arbitrary decisions from higher up .
My father 's entire industry ( breeder reactors ) disappeared that way .
For better or worse , the idea of the corporate ladder is probably gone for good .
The new model seems more liquid , and more efficient .
But it is less of a change , financially , than one might think .
Our fathers were n't that stupid .

A stand - off between around 20,000 protesters and more than 1,500 police and paramilitary forces in China 's Hunan province has ended in bloodshed , with scores of people injured and a middle - school student beaten to death by the police , according to eye - witness reports .
The incident not only highlights China 's persistent problems with rural unrest , but also underscores the rationale for the central government 's preoccupation with social stability and improving rural livelihoods .
China 's government continues to make some effort to address the root causes of rural discontent .
Most recently , it has announced increases in spending on rural healthcare and education , as well as plans to expand the rural social insurance and welfare systems .
However , significant challenges remain .
Central government spending on rural development continues to fall short , with local governments expected to provide most of the funds for public services in the countryside .
Also , the actual implementation of policies promulgated in Beijing depends crucially on the co-operation of local governments , which are often complicit in the land seizures and corruption that fuel rural protests .
Abuse of power
The protest in Hunan was apparently sparked by a sudden doubling of public - bus fares during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday , when many people travel to visit their families .
In the resulting clashes , several police vehicles and public buses were torched , at least one person was reportedly killed and many protesters were arrested .
The protest is the most recent manifestation of widespread discontent in the Chinese countryside , which is being fuelled by poverty , inequality , corruption , rising healthcare costs and illegal land requisition .
According to one official source , there were around 23,000 " mass incidents " in 2006 , down from 26,000 in 2005 .
This implies that some progress is being made , although the reliability of these figures and the definition of what constitutes such an incident remains open to doubt ( other official sources put the number of mass incidents in 2005 at 87,000 ) .
As in previous cases , the ostensible reason for the Hunan protest seems disproportionate to the scale and violence of the incident , pointing to deeper discontent that was only waiting for a trigger to manifest in major unrest .
( Local officials have reportedly acknowledged that the protest was an expression of underlying resentment against corruption . )
Good intentions
China 's top leaders , some of whom have served in China 's less - developed western provinces , continue to push reforms aimed at addressing the root causes of rural social unrest .
In early March the ministry of finance announced that central government spending on healthcare would rise by 90 % , while education spending would rise by 40 % .
At the current session of the National People 's Congress ( NPC ) , China 's top legislative body , in Beijing , the central government announced it would spend Rmb392bn ( US $ 50.6bn ) on rural development , an increase of Rmb52bn over 2006 and of Rmb94bn over 2005 .
The central government funds will be used to expand China 's social - welfare system , which aims to establish a minimum living allowance for the rural poor , and the rural co-operative medical system .
To reduce discontent produced by lay - offs from state - owned enterprises , the government also plans reforms to its unemployment insurance and work - related injury compensation schemes .
Land -use conversion regulations have also been tightened in an effort to reduce unrest provoked by unfair seizures of land .
For example , local governments must now record land sales as " on-budget " income , and certain types of projects -- such as golf courses and theme parks -- have been banned on undeveloped land .
Enforcement efforts have been strengthened by sending out teams of auditors to review land rezoning arrangements by local governments .
The NPC will also pass a new private property law which , while stopping short of reforming the rural land - tenure system , reiterates the legal requirement to compensate farmers adequately for the expropriation of their land .
Implementation challenges
Although the government appears to be serious about tackling rural problems , its efforts face many obstacles .
First , despite being increased to Rmb392bn in 2007 , central government spending on rural development remains woefully insufficient .
Given that local governments continue to be expected to shoulder most of the burden of rural healthcare and education , the impact of the recently announced increases is likely to be disappointing .
The central government 's spending on rural welfare continues to pale in comparison to allocations for urban workers .
( In 2006 allocations for rural living allowances for China 's rural population of 600 m totalled Rmb4.2bn ; the budget for the minimum living support insurance , which is issued to the estimated 22.3 m urban poor , was a much more substantial Rmb13.6bn . )
Another significant obstacle is that the central government in Beijing relies to a large extent on local governments to implement its policies .
In many instances , however , local governments are the perpetrators of -- or at least complicit in -- the abuses suffered by the rural population .
This is particularly true with respect to the unfair expropriation of farmers ' land for urban and industrial development .
Cash - starved local governments have a strong incentive to seize farmers ' land , reclassify it as urban , and lease it to developers at a massive profit .
Profits from land - conveyance fees paid by developers and investors for long - term rights to use the land have become an increasingly crucial source of local government revenue , without which , ironically , they could provide even fewer public services .
Even where funding is adequate and the local government is co-operative , many national - level programmes are in an early stage of development and require a challenging degree of co-ordination between various levels of government .
China 's unemployment insurance system , which has no system for individual accounts , is a good example .
Participation has been patchy and protection for migrant workers continues to be particularly poor .
Out of an estimated 120 m such workers , fewer than 450,000 have received unemployment allowances , with many employers avoiding contribution payments .
Despite these obstacles , government efforts to improve rural livelihoods may be aided by ongoing structural changes in the economy , such as rising food prices and labour costs in urban areas .
Falling food prices over the past 15 years have been a crucial reason for rising rural - urban inequality , as Chinese farmers ' incomes have stagnated relative to those in the country 's booming urban areas .
However , food prices -- and hence rural incomes -- appear to be on the rise as a result of the falling supply of arable land , increased demand for agricultural products and a shift away from grain production to higher - value - added crops .
Rising wages in China 's coastal factories will also boost remittances by migrant workers to rural areas .
Harmonious countryside ?
Ultimately , inadequate support for basic public services in rural areas may constrain economic growth in rural areas , limiting the government 's efforts to reduce poverty and create a " harmonious countryside " .
Access to basic healthcare and other public services in many areas now requires the ability to make an up - front payment , providing a powerful incentive for China 's 600 m rural dwellers to save any surplus income rather than to spend it or to make productivity - enhancing investments in their farms or enterprises .
As a result , the failure of the government to channel sufficient resources to the countryside could slow rural development , making it more difficult to deal with the social and economic problems associated with rural - urban inequality and rapid urbanisation .
In political terms , however , expressions of rural discontent such as the riots in Hunan appear to pose little direct threat to the central government .
Many such protests appear to be spontaneous , and the government typically moves quickly to arrest the organisers and to placate everyone else .
In addition , few aggrieved rural citizens seem to hold the government in Beijing primarily responsible for the incompetence or abuses of local officials .
One sign of this is the constant stream of rural petitioners arriving in Beijing with the hope that the central government , much like the emperor in feudal times , will assist them if informed of their plight .
John Carreras was once a contented Google advertiser .
He used text adverts that appeared alongside searches to bring people to his trade exhibition website .
He happily paid Google a few cents for every referral , believing that anyone who clicked through to his site from Google was a likely customer .
But then he attended a conference in Las Vegas , and he noticed something strange : the number of Google referrals he was getting dropped dramatically , only to rise again once the conference was over .
Carreras became convinced the " missing clicks " were n't from customers , but from his competitors , who had all been in Vegas along with him .
He believed his unscrupulous rivals whiled away their office hours clicking on his Google ads , knowing that every tap cost him money .
If you add in a second kind of scam , where people earn themselves a little money from Google by clicking on ads they 're hosting on their own sites , you can see the potential for malice .
Click fraud , as it's called , is acknowledged by Google as a problem : last year , Google chief financial officer George Reyes described it as " the biggest threat to the internet economy " .
While Google Labs , as the company calls its development division , turns out new products at a cracking pace , Google remains largely dependent on just one source of income : advertising .
Google would never admit to being uneasy about that reliance .
Why should it ?
Advertising is doubling the company 's revenue every year , and is expected to generate almost $ 10 bn this year .
But for all the undoubted strengths of its pay - per - click system , some worrying vulnerabilities have emerged .
Clicking off
At the same time as it tries to combat click fraud , Google is preparing to add a second string to its money - making bow , by charging users for video downloads .
It may not sound earth - shattering , but if it works , it could represent the start of chapter two in the Google story .
The problem of click fraud remains - although today Marissa Mayer , the company 's vice - president of search products , is more reassuring .
She calls it " a serious problem for us , but also a very solvable problem " .
In principle , the company will not charge its advertisers for clicks that are n't from genuine potential customers .
Typically , Google is hoping to use technology to detect suspicious click patterns .
Which brings us back to John Carreras .
As a result of his experience , he got out of the trade exhibition business , believing that click - fraud detection would be a more lucrative field .
He now sells software under the name Who 's Clicking Who ?
which promises to solve click fraud for Google advertisers , firstly by sending " we know who you are " messages back to fraudulent clickers , and then by compiling click dossiers to help fraud victims reclaim their money from Google .
For the Mountain View company , click fraud has the potential to become the kind of technological arms race that has been a drag on Microsoft in its battle against ever - changing security threats .
Nobody knows the exact extent of it .
But , says Google - watcher John Battelle , " right now , advertisers are getting such a good return on their investment that it does n't matter to them whether [ click fraud ] is 5 % or 30 % " .
But he believes that as Google advertising becomes more competitive and the level of fraud grows , " eventually the rubber will meet the road and we 'll see how much fraud there is in the system " .
New streams
There 's no question that Google 's ad system is still a runaway success , but with click fraud on the radar , it 's a good time to be exploring new revenue streams .
Previously , Google Video ( video.google.com ) , unveiled in January last year , only offered a chance to upload and view uncopyrighted videos free - creating a jungle of thousands of weird , searchable amateur videos ( try " party " , " family " or " vacation " to get the flavour ) .
But Google is now signing up professional broadcasters , and soon users will be asked to pay for downloads .
But how will users take to paying a company that has so far offered them so much for nothing ?
" It will be a new experience for them , " admits Jennifer Feikin , director of Google Video .
" If you look at our product today , we refer people off to somewhere where they purchase things ; this is something brand new , where it will be happening on Google . "
Google 's new interest in selling is a worrying trend for the likes of Amazon , but Battelle believes online retail is only the start of Google 's commercial ambitions :
" They are changing the economic presumptions of a number of industries .
You can start to tick the boxes of all the information - driven , intellectual property - driven businesses in the world .
And it 's a very , very big bundle of businesses - the biggest bundle one can imagine . "
So far , Google has remained tight - lipped about whether its video payment system will be the basis for other services .
When I suggested to Feikin that it would allow the company to sell almost anything to its customers , she hesitated for a moment , then replied with cheerful mock - surprise , " that 's a good idea ! "

I feel very sorry for this poor man , but equally we must all take responsibility for our actions .
Plastic carrier bags are a vital feature of the tramp - chic look I 've been going with this season , and to be fair , the one I 'm currently carrying my laptop around in reads " plastic bags can be dangerous : to avoid suffocation keep this bag away from babies and children . "
Is there anything else to worry about with hippie crack ?
All drugs carry risks , and it is only by clarifying those risks that we can decide how to manage them .
Luckily the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority has put out a press release , which has manifested itself mostly under headlines suggesting nitrous is " no laughing matter " .
The MHRA says : " Whilst the inhalation of nitrous oxide may be perceived by some as harmless activity , there are a number of health risks associated with its inhalation .
The ' rush ' users experience is caused by starving the brain of oxygen .
This can cause the user to collapse and injure themselves when falling . "
To be effective in public health policy it is generally considered that your message must be credible .
I suspect most hippie crack users will already have experimented with holding their breath , and will rightly conclude that their transcendent experience on nitrous is a drug effect ; and that it's an anaesthetic used in hospitals , and in childbirth , so the effect is probably not caused by starving the brain of oxygen ; and that the MHRA , of all reputable bodies , is talking nonsense .
In fact , the pharmacology of nitrous oxide is fascinating , and a window on to how we deduce what drugs do in the brain .
It seems to work on the NMDA neurotransmitter system , and on the opioid system .
Animal models suggested that it might increase the release of opiate molecules made by your own body .
To test whether opiates were responsible for the effects on humans , researchers gave nitrous to people in pain , and then gave an opiate receptor blocker , to see if the analgesic effect was reversed , or changed : the analgesic effect was , but the subjective sensations of being " high " were not , even at high doses , suggesting that this aspect of its effect must be mediated by a different neurotransmitter system .
It seems likely that these effects are mediated by the NMDA system , perhaps similarly to ketamine .
Are there any real dangers with nitrous oxide ?
Well it 's fairly safe overall , and I suppose you could risk manage the " falling over " thing by " sitting down " , but it has been studied closely for a long time - on account of its widespread medical use , and the worry about chronic low dose exposure for dentists and people who work in operating theatres - and it turns out that it does have a major side effect : it selectively oxidises the folate , or vitamin B12 , in your body .
Vitamin B12 is needed for a process called methylation , involved in making DNA among other things , and without it you have a tough time making new cells .
There are cases in the literature of people overexposed to nitrous becoming dangerously B12 deficient , but it seems clear that the effects are reversed simply by giving high dose vitamin B12 .
This may be rather trendy and " harm reduction " of me , but if I was going to put out a press release on hippie crack , I would advise against using it , but I would n't shoot down my credibility with primary school assertions about its mode of action on the brain .
I would state the risks clearly , and if I thought the risks from , perhaps , folate deficiency were significant and worrying , I might also mention the harm reduction strategies available , and start monitoring outcomes .

BitTorrent is slow ...
This is probably one of the most frequently asked questions I get about BitTorrent .
Unfortunately there 's not some kind of magic trick that makes your torrents go through the roof .
But you could take some simple steps to optimize your speeds .
1. Cap your upload ( most important )
Limit your upload speed to approximately 80 percent of your maximum upload rate .
You can check your upload speed over here ( never trust your isp ) .
Once you know your maximum upload speed , change the max upload ( to 80 % ) speed in your torrent client ’s preferences .
Do n’t get me wrong , everyone should share as much as possible , but if your upload rate reached it ’s max , your download rate suffers significantly .
2 . Hack the max TCP connections
If you ’re on XP sp2 , your TCP connections are limited to a maximum of 10 .
This seriously hurts your downloading speed because it wont let you connect to a high amount of ip numbers .
It is supposed to slow down viruses because their spreading strategy is to connect to a high amount of ip numbers , but it also cripples your torrent downloads .
A nice way to fix this is to download this patch , it allows you to set the maximum allowed connections to any number you want .
Any number between 50 and 100 is ok ( more on this ) .
3. Check seeds and peers
A simple tip , but o so important .
Always look for torrents with the best seed / peer ratio .
The more seeds ( compared to peers ) the better ( in general ) .
So 50 seeds and 50 peers is better than 500 seeds and 1000 peers .
So , be selective .
4 . Change the default port .
By default , BitTorrent uses a port 6881 - 6999 .
BitTorrent accounts for a lot of the total internet traffic ( 1/3 ) , so isp ’s like to limit the connection offered on the these ports .
So , you should change these to another range .
Good clients allow you to do this , just choose anything you like .
If you ’re behind a router , make sure you have the ports forwarded or UPnP enabled .
5. Disable Windows Firewall
It sucks .
Windows Firewall hates P2P and often leads a life of it ’s own .
So disable it and get yourself a decent firewall , Kerio or Zone Alarm for example .
Last but not least …
Buy a faster connection …
Read more on optimizing your BitTorrent Speed .

A genius is a genius , regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race -- and a moron is a moron , regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin . " excerpts from
" Racism "
by Ayn Rand ( An article published in the September , 1963 issue of The Objectivist Newsletter
and included as a chapter in the book , The Virtue of Selfishness ) _____ Racism is the lowest , most crudely primitive form of collectivism .
It is the notion of ascribing moral , social or political significance to a man 's genetic lineage -- the notion that a man 's intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry .
Which means , in practice , that a man is to be judged , not by his own character and actions , but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors .
Racism claims that the content of a man 's mind ( not his cognitive apparatus , but its content ) is inherited ; that a man 's convictions , values and character are determined before he is born , by physical forces beyond his control .
This is the caveman 's version of the doctrine of innate ideas -- or of inherited knowledge -- which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and science .
Racism is a doctrine of , by and for brutes .
It is a barnyard or stock - farm version of collectivism , appropriate to a mentality that differentiates between various breeds of anmials , but not between animals and men .
Like every form of determinism , racism invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species : his rational faculty .
Racism negates two aspects of man 's life : reason and choice , or mind and morality , replacing them with chemical predestination .
The respectable family that supports worthless relatives or covers up their crimes in order to " protect the family name " ( as if the moral stature of one man could be damaged by the actions of another ) -- the bum who boasts that his great - grandfather was an empire - builder , or the small - town spinster who boasts that her maternal great - uncle was a state senator and her third - cousin gave a concert at Carnegie Hall ( as if the achievements of one man could rub off on the mediocrity of another ) -- the parents who search genealogical trees in order to evaluate their prospective sons - in - law -- the celebrity who starts his autobiography with a detailed account of his family history -- all these are samples of racism , the atavistic manifestations of a doctrine whose full expression is the tribal warfare of prehistorical savages , the wholesale slaughter of Nazi Germany , the atrocities of today 's so - called " newly - emerging nations . "
The theory that holds " good blood " and " bad blood " as a moral - intellectual criterion , can lead to nothing but torrents of blood in practice .
Brute force is the only avenue of action open to men who regard themselves as mindless aggregates of chemicals .
Modern racists attempt to prove the superiority or inferiority of a given race by the historical achievements of some of its members .
The frequent historical spectacle of a great innovator who , in his lifetime , is jeered , denounced , obstructed , persecuted by his countrymen , and then , a few years after his death , is enshrined in a national monument and hailed as a proof of greatness of the German ( or French or Italian or Cambodian ) race -- is as revolting a spectacle of collectivist expropriation , perpetrated by racists , as any expropriation of material wealth perpetrated by communists .
Just as there is no such thing as a collective or racial mind , so there is no such thing as a collective or racial achievement .
There are only individual minds and individual achievements -- and a culture is not the anonymous product of undifferentiated masses , but the sum of the intellectual achievements of individual men .
Even if it were proved -- which it is not -- that the incidence of men of potentially superior brain power is greater among the members of certain races than among the members of others , it would still tell us nothing about any given individual and it would be irrelevant to one 's judgment of him .
A genius is a genius , regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race -- and a moron is a moron , regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin .
It is hard to say which is the more outrageous injustice : the claim of Southern racists that a Negro genius should be treated as inferior because his race has " produced " some brutes -- or the claim of a German brute to the status of a superior because his race has " produced " Goethe , Schiller and Brahms .
These are not two different claims , of course , but two applications of the same basic premise .
The question of whether one alleges the superiority or the inferiority of any given race is irrelevant ; racism has only one psychological root : the racist 's sense of his own inferiority .
Like every other form of collectivism , racism is a quest for the unearned .
It is a quest for automatic knowledge -- for an automatic evaluation of men's characters that bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral judgment -- and , above all , a quest for an automatic self - esteem ( or pseudo - self - esteem ) .
To ascribe one 's virtues to one 's racial origin , is to confess that one has no knowledge of the process by which virtues are acquired and , most often , that one has failed to acquire them .
The overwhelming majority of racists are men who have earned no sense of personal identity , who can claim no individual achievement or distinction , and who seek the illusion of a " tribal self - esteem " by alleging the inferiority of some other tribe .
Observe the hysterical intensity of the Southern racists ; observe also that racism is much more prevalent among the poor white trash than among their intellectual betters .
Historically , racism has always risen or fallen with the rise or fall of collectivism .
Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights , that his life and work belong to the group ( to " society , " to the tribe , the state , the nation ) and that the group may sacrifice him at its own whim to its own interests .
The only way to implement a doctrine of that kind is by means of brute force -- and statism has always been the poltical corollary of collectivism .
The absolute state is merely an institutionalized form of gang rule , regardless of which particular gang seizes power .
And -- since there is no rational justification for such rule , since none has ever been or can ever be offered -- the mystique of racism is a crucial element in every variant of the absolute state .
The relationship is reciprocal : statism rises out of prehistorical tribal warfare , out of the notion that the men of one tribe are the natural prey for the men of another -- and establishes its own internal sub-categories of racism , a system of castes determined by a man 's birth , such as inherited titles of nobility or inherited serfdom .
The racism of Nazi Germany -- where men had to fill questionnaires about their ancestry for generations back , in order to prove their " Aryan " descent -- has its counterpart in Soviet Russia , where men had to fill similar questionnaires to show that their ancestors had owned no property and thus to prove their " proletarian " descent .
The Soviet ideology rest on the notion that men can be conditioned to communism genetically -- that is , that a few generations conditioned by dictatorship will transmit communist ideology to their descendants , who will be communists at birth .
The persecution of racial minorities in Soviet Russia , according to the racial descent and whim of any given commissar , is a matter of record ; anti-semitism is particularly prevalent -- only the official pogroms are now called " political purges . "
There is only one antidote to racism : the philosophy of individualism and its politico - economic corollary , laissez - faire capitalism .
Individualism regards man -- every man -- as an independent , sovereign entity who possesses an inalienable right to his own life , a right derived from his nature as a rational being .
Individualism holds that a civilized society , or any form of association , cooperation or peaceful co-existence among men , can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights -- and that a group , as such , has no rights other than the individual rights of its members .
( See my articles " Man 's Rights " and " Collectivized ' Rights ' " in the April and June , 1963 , issues of this NEWSLETTER [ or Chapters 12 and 13 of the book ] . )
It is not a man 's ancestors or relatives or genes or body chemistry that count in a free market , but only one human attribute : productive ability .
It is by his own individual ability and ambition that capitalism judges a man and rewards him accordingly .
No political system can establish universal rationality by law ( or by force ) .
But capitalism is the only system that functions in a way which rewards rationality and penalizes all forms of irrationality , including racism .
A fully free , capitalist system has not yet existed anywhere .
But what is enormously significant is the correlation of racism and political controls in the semi - free economies of the 19th century .
Racial and / or religious persecutions of minorities stood in inverse ratio to the degree of a country 's freedom .
Racism was strongest in the more controlled economies , such as Russia and Germany -- and weakest in England , the then freest country of Europe .
It is capitalism that gave mankind its first steps toward freedom and a rational way of life .
It is capitalism that broke through national and racial barriers , by means of free trade .
It is capitalism that abolished serfdom and slavery in all the civilized countries of the world .
It is the capitalist North that destroyed the slavery of the agrarian - feudal South in the United States .
Such was the trend of mankind for the brief span of some hundred and fifty years .
The spectacular results and achievements of that trend need no restatement here .
The rise of collectivism reversed that trend .
When men began to be indoctrinated once more with the notion that the individual possesses no rights , that supremacy , moral authority and unlimited power belong to the group , and that a man has no significance outside his group -- the inevitable consequence was that men began to gravitate toward some group or another , in self - protection , in bewilderment and in subconscious terror .
The simplest collective to join , the easiest one to identify -- particularly for people of limited intelligence -- the least demanding form of " belonging " and of " togetherness " is : race .
It is thus that the theoreticians of collectivism , the " humanitarian " advocates of a " benevolent " absolute state , have led to the rebirth and the new , virulent growth of racism in the 20th century .
In its great era of capitalism , the United States was the freest country on earth -- and the best refutation of racist theories .
Men of all races came here , some from obscure , culturally undistinguished countries , and accomplished feats of productive ability which would have remained stillborn in their control - ridden native lands .
Men of racial groups that had been slaughtering one another for centuries , learned to live together in harmony and peaceful cooperation .
America had been called " the melting pot , " with good reason .
But few people realized that America did not melt men into the gray conformity of a collective : she united them by means of protecting their right to individuality .
The major victims of such race prejudice as did exist in America were the Negroes .
It was a problem originated and perpetuated by the non-capitalist South , though not confined to its boundaries .
The persecution of Negroes in the South was and is truly disgraceful .
But in the rest of the country , so long as men were free , even that problem was slowly giving way under the pressure of enlightenment and of the white men's own economic interests .
Today , that problem is growing worse -- and so is every form of racism .
America has become race - conscious in a manner reminiscent of the worst days in the most backward countries of 19th century Europe .
The cause is the same : the growth of collectivism and statism . [ ... ]
The existence of such pressure groups and of their political lobbies is openly and cynically acknowledged today .
The pretense at any political philosophy , any principles , ideals or long - range goals is fast disappearing from our scene -- and it is all but admitted that this country is now floating without direction , at the mercy of a blind , short - range power - game played by various statist gangs , each intent on getting hold of a legislative gun for any special advantage of the immediate moment .
In the absence of any coherent political philosophy , every economic group has been acting as its own destroyer , selling out its future for some momentary privilege .
The policy of the businessmen has , for some time , been the most suicidal one in this respect .
But it has been surpassed by the current policy of the Negro leaders .
So long as the Negro leaders were fighting against government - enforced discrimination -- right , justice and morality were on their side .
But that is not what they are fighting any longer .
The confusions and contradictions surrounding the issue of racism have now reached an incredible climax .
It is time to clarify the principles involved .
The policy of the Southern states toward Negroes was and is a shameful contradiction of this country 's basic principles .
Racial discrimination , imposed and enforced by law , is so blatantly inexcusable an infringement of individual rights that the racist statutes of the South should have been declared unconstitutional long ago .
The Southern racists ' claim of " states ' rights " is a contradiction in terms : there can be no such thing as the " right " of some men to violate the rights of others .
The constitutional concept of " states ' rights " pertains to the division of power between local and national authorities , and serves to protect the states from the Federal government ; it does not grant to a state government an unlimited , arbitrary power over its citizens or the privilege of abrogating the citizens ' individual rights .
It is true that the Federal government has used the racial issue to enlarge its own power and to set a precedent of encroachment upon the legitimate rights of the states , in an unnecessary and unconstitutional manner .
But this merely means that both governments are wrong ; it does not excuse the policy of the Southern racists .
One of the worst contradictions , in this context , is the stand of many so - called " conservatives " ( not confined exclusively to the South ) who claim to be defenders of freedom , of capitalism , of property rights , of the Constitution , yet who advocate racism at the same time .
They do not seem to possess enough concern with principles to realize tht they are cutting the ground from under their own feet .
Men who deny individual rights cannot claim , defend or uphold any rights whatsoever .
It is such alleged champions of capitalism who are helping to discredit and destroy it .
The " liberals " are guilty of the same contradiction , but in a different form .
They advocate the sacrifice of all individual rights to unlimited majority rule -- yet posture as defenders of the rights of minorities .
But the smallest minority on earth is the individual .
Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities .
This accumulation of contradictions , of short - sighted pragmatism , of cynical contempt for principles , of outrageous irrationality , has now reached its climax in the new demands of the Negro leaders .
Instead of fighting against racial discrimination , they are demanding that racial discrimination be legalized and enforced .
Instead of fighting against racism , they are demanding the establishment of racial quotas .
Instead of fighting for " color - blindness " in social and economic issues , they are proclaiming that " color - blindness " is evil and that " color " should be made a primary consideration .
Instead of fighting for equal rights , they are demanding special race privileges . [ ... ]
Racial quotas have been one of the worst evils of racist regimes .
There were racial quotas in the universities of Czarist Russia , in the population of Russia 's major cities , etc .
One of the accusations against the racists in this country is that some schools practice a secret system of racial quotas .
It was regarded as a victory for justice when employment questionnaires ceased to inquire about an applicant 's race or religion .
Today , it is not an oppressor , but an oppressed minority that is demanding the establishment of racial quotas . (! ) [ ... ]
It does not merely demand special privileges on racial grounds -- it demands that white men be penalized for the sins of their ancestors .
It demands that a white laborer be refused a job because his grandfather may have practiced racial discrimination .
But perhaps his grandfather had not practiced it .
Or perhaps his grandfather had not even lived in this country .
Since these questions are not to be considered , it means that that white laborer is to be charged with collective racial guilt , the guilt consisting merely of the color of his skin .
But that is the principle of the worst Southern racist who charges all Negroes with collective racial guilt for any crime committed by an individual Negro , and who treats them all as inferiors on the ground that their ancestors were savages .
The only comment one can make about demands of that kind is , " By what right ? --
By what code ? --
By what standard ? "
That absurdly evil policy is destroying the moral base of the Negroes ' fight .
Their case rested on the principle of individual rights .
If they demand the violation of the rights of others , they negate and forfeit their own .
Then the same answer applies to them as to the Southern racists : there can be no such thing as a " right " of some men to violate the rights of others . [ ... ]
No man , neither Negro nor white , has any claim to the property of another man .
A man 's rights are not violated by a private individual 's refusal to deal with him .
Racism is an evil , irrational and morally contemptible doctrine -- but doctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law .
Just as we have to protect a communist 's freedom of speech , even though his doctrines are evil , so we have to protect a racist 's right to the use and disposal of his own property .
Private racism is not a legal , but a moral issue -- and can be fought only by private means , such as economic boycott or social ostracism . [ ... ]
It is an ironic demonstration of the philosophical insanity and the consequently suicidal trend of our age , that the men who need the protection of individual rights most urgently -- the Negroes -- are now in the vanguard of the destruction of these rights . [ ... ]
In conclusion , I shall quote from an astonishing editorial in The N. Y. Times of August 4 [ 1963 ] -- astonishing because ideas of this nature are not typical of our age :
" But the question must be not whether a group recognizable in color , features or culture has its rights as a group .
No , the question is whether any American individual , regardless of color , features or culture , is deprived of his rights as an American .
If the individual has all the rights and privileges due him under the laws and the Constitution , we need not worry about groups and masses -- those do not , in fact , exist , except as figures of speech . "

Countries GDP as US States
Fascinating stuff : Carl Størmer points us to this amazing map of the United States .
Each state 's economic output is analogized to another country 's GDP .
click for larger chart :
Notable omissions : U.K. , Japan , Germany , China , Russia , Italy .
I cannot vouch for the precision of this , but by eyeball , it looks about right .
Carl adds :
" When seeing Norway 's GDP in the context of this map , one realizes why Norway is one of the last countries U.S. companies consider when expanding to Europe .
My two cents ( not in the blog ) :
In addition to small GDP , little competition has enabled local players to build monopolies or duopolies in many industries .
Add high state ownership to this mix , and you understand why Norwegian consumers are unused to good service and competitive prices .
Other than that , Norway is a great country . "
Thanks for the great find , Carl !

Kriegspläne gegen Iran Georg Schöfbänker
Nach einem Bericht von Seymour Hersh gehört die auch militärische Beendigung des iranischen Nuklearprogramms zu einer der dringendsten außenpolitischen Prioritäten der Bush - Regierung
Der US - Enthüllungsjournalist Seymour Hersh hat in einem vielbeachteten Artikel im New Yorker seine Serie über Angriffspläne der US Regierung gegenüber dem Iran fortgesetzt .
Auch bei Hershs neuestem Artikel ist - wie auch schon aus anderen Quellen bekannt wurde - dabei vom möglichen Einsatz substrategischer Kernwaffen die Rede .
Dies wurde auch von der Washington Post bestätigt .
Nachdem der vielleicht bekannteste Enthüllungsjournalist der USA , Seymour Hersh , schon im Januar 2005 im " New Yorker " auf neuerliche Kriegsplanungen der USA gegenüber Iran hingewiesen hatte ( Das letzte Hurra ... ) , lässt sich seinem neuesten Beitrag vor allem eine aktuelle Dringlichkeit entnehmen .
Aus der anschwellenden Rhetorik , aus der zunehmenden medialen Aufgeregtheit , manche US - Medien sprechen bereits von einem " countdown " gegenüber Iran , lässt sich mit Sicherheit Folgendes ableiten : Die Frage des iranischen Nuklearprogramms zählt nun zu den bedeutendsten außenpolitischen Prioritäten der Bush - Regierung .
Trotz des gesamten Debakels im Irak .
Diese Dringlichkeit erklärt sich nicht aus der tatsächlichen zeitlichen Ferne zur Herstellung einer möglichen ersten Kernwaffe .
Hier geht selbst John Negroponte , der oberste Geheimdienstchef der USA , von einem Zeitraum zwischen fünf und zehn Jahren aus .
Nach Hershs Quellen - er nennt einen " Regierungsberater mit engen Verbindungen zum Pentagon " - ist Bush erstens davon überzeugt , dass Iran " die Bombe " auf jeden Fall bauen werde , wenn er nicht gestoppt wird , und zweitens , dass er tun müsse , was kein Präsident nach ihm jemals tun würde , nämlich " Iran zu retten " .
Im Unterschied zu den weniger alarmistischen Analysen der IAEA oder unabhängiger Think - Tanks , wonach es noch Zeit für eine Verhandlungslösung gäbe , scheinen die Scharfmacher in der Umgebung von Bush nun die israelische Position übernommen zu haben , wonach bereits die technische Option der Urananreicherung verhindert werden müsse .
Aus dem Umfeld von Bush wurde dies in den letzten beiden Monaten ähnlich formuliert .
Iran dürfe nicht die Möglichkeit haben , die Technologie der Urananreicherung zu beherrschen .
Bei Hersh liest sich das so : Iran müsse die Möglichkeit verwehrt werden , auch nur eine Pilotanreicherung zu betreiben .
Oder : Staatssekretär Robert Joseph wird mit der Aussage zitiert : " Wir können es nicht zulassen , dass sich nur eine einzelne Zentrifuge im Iran dreht .
Iran ist eine direkte Bedrohung der nationalen Sicherheit der USA und wir werden dies nicht tolerieren . "
Dies ist nun Doktrin und mehr als nur ein Versuch , Iran mit drastischer Rhetorik zum Einlenken zwingen zu wollen .
Es verstellt den Blick jedoch darauf , dass es jenen Hardlinern , die eine militärische Konfrontation suchen , schon längst nicht mehr nur um das Nuklearprogramm , sondern eben auch um einen generellen Regimewechsel in Teheran geht .
Parallelen zum Irak - Krieg
Wie glaubwürdig kann man Hersh und seine Quellen einstufen , insbensondere wenn es um die militärischen Planungen geht ?
Seymour Hersh ist nicht der Typ , der sich irgendwie als Sprachrohr einer Regierung , schon gar nicht der Bush - Regierung , hergeben würde .
Er hat für diesen Bericht länger recherchiert und nennt , was die US - Situation angelangt , folgende Quellen : einen früheren Geheimdienstmitarbeiter , einen früheren Verteidigungsexperten , einen früheren hochrangigen Mitarbeiter des Pentagon , einen kürzlich zurückgetretenen hochrangigen Mitarbeiter der Bush - Regierung , sowie " im Amt befindliche " Regierungsberater , einen militärischen Planer , einen hochrangigen Diplomaten , einen Pentagon - Berater , ein Mitglied des US - Repräsentantenhauses sowie einen israelischen Geheimdienstmitarbeiter .
Nachdem vieles , was Hersh schreibt , ohnehin schon aus anderen Quellen bekannt ist , etwa die Planungen für einen Kernwaffeneinsatz , sollte man seinen
Text eher als Bestätigung der schlimmsten Befürchtungen der Planung mancher Hardliner in der US - Regierung betrachten denn als haltlose Übertreibung .
Es sind eher die Details , der Subtext , der zu denken gibt , wo sich Parallelen zum Irakkrieg geradezu aufdrängen .
Geheime Briefings für ausgewählte Senatoren und Abgeordnete .
Ein Detail , das , wenn es stimmt , militärisch sinnlos wäre , aber als psychologische Einschüchterung verstanden werden könnte .
Hersh berichtet von Flugmanövern von trägergestützten taktischen Kampfflugzeugen , bei denen in Reichweite iranischen Radars Kernwaffenabwürfe simuliert worden sein sollen .
Das Pikante dabei ist , dass es nach allem bekanntem Wissen seit 1994 keine luftgestützten Kernwaffen für taktische Kampfflugzeuge mehr auf amerikanischen Trägerverbänden gibt .
Ein weiteres bemerkenswertes Detail ist die Rolle , die A.Q. Khan , der Vater der pakistanischen Kernwaffe , beim iranischen Nuklearprogramm spielt oder spielen soll .
Er wird ja verdächtigt , Zentrifugen und Zentrifugenteile , sowie einen chinesischen Bauplan an das iranische Regime auf eigenen Gewinn und ohne Mitwisserschaft der pakistanischen Behörden verkauft zu haben .
Dies ist zumindest die gängige Theorie .
A.Q. Khan gilt in Pakistan noch immer als Nationalheld , steht unter Hausarrest und US - Behörden geben sich bei ihm die Türklinke in die Hand .
Eine der Quellen von Hersh spricht davon , dass A.Q. Khan " singe wie ein Kanarienvogel " , eine andere meint gar , aus seinen Aussagen ließe sich eine neue und völlig dramatische Gefahrenlage rekonstruieren .
Das ist insofern merkwürdig , als es der IAEA , der eigentlich zuständigen Behörde für die Aufklärung des iranischen Nuklearprogramms , bisher kein einziges Mal gestattet wurde , A.Q. Khan zu vernehmen .
Machtkampf innerhalb des Militärs ?
Die Tatsache , dass gerade jetzt , etwa zwanzig Tage vor Ablauf der Frist des UN - Sicherheitsrates gegenüber Iran alle Anreicherungsexperimente einzustellen , weitere Details über nukleare Einsatzplanungen an die Öffentlichkeit durchsickern , könnte auch bedeuten , dass sich , wie Hersh behauptet , zahlreiche Spitzenmilitärs deutlich gegen eine " nukleare Option " bei einem Angriff aussprechen .
Hersh nennt hier vor allem die Generalstabchefs und meint , es wären auch einige bereit , deswegen zurück zu treten .
Die Generalstabchefs haben hier jedoch bestenfalls beratende Funktion , da sie nicht in der Befehlskette bei einem allfälligen Angriff vorkommen werden .
Diese verläuft vom Weißen
Haus oder vom Pentagon direkt zum CENTCOM , dem regionalen Einsatzkommando .
Die Nicht - Widerlegbarkeit und das " parallele Nuklearprogramm "
Eine Argumentation ist in den letzten Monaten verstärkt aufgebaut worden : das " parallele Nuklearprogramm " .
Dieser Gedankenstrang findet sich auch bei Hershs Quellen und funktioniert so : Selbst wenn Iran alle IAEA - Auflagen erfüllen sollte , aber trotzdem mit seinem Anreicherungsprojekt weiter machen würde , werde das Land die technische Fähigkeit erlangen , dies in einem geheimen parallelen Nuklearprogramm fortzusetzen .
Nur gibt es bis heute keinerlei ernst zu nehmenden Hinweise darüber .
Auch von der IAEA , die hier durchaus ihren Ruf zu verlieren hat , wurde nichts gefunden .
Sollte es also zu Luftangriffen kommen , so würde damit auch fast jede Form der Überprüfbarkeit beseitigt sein .
Fast alle Experten sind sich darüber einig , dass eine solche Form der militärischen Intervention ein militärisches Nuklearprogramm des Iran zwar verzögern , aber nicht stoppen könnte .

A lost landscape where early humans roamed more than 12,000 years ago has been uncovered beneath the North Sea .
A map of the underwater world reveals criss - crossing rivers , giant lakes and gentle hills around which hunter - gatherers made their homes and found their meals toward the end of the last ice age .
The region was inundated between 18000 and 6000BC , when the warming climate melted the thick glaciers that pressed down from the north .
As the waters rose the great plain vanished , and slowly the contours of the British Isles and the north - west European coastline were established .
Now the primitive landscape is submerged and preserved , tens of metres beneath one of the busiest seas in the world .
Scientists compiled 3D seismic records from oil - prospecting vessels working in the North Sea over 18 months to piece together a landscape covering 23,000 sq km , stretching from the coast of East Anglia to the edge of northern Europe .
They identified the scars left by ancient river beds and lakes , some 25 km ( 15 mls ) across , and salt marshes and valleys .
" Some of this land would have made the perfect environment for hunter gatherers .
There is higher land where they could have built their homes and hills they could see their prey from , " said Vince Gaffney , director of Birmingham University 's Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity , who lead the project with Ken Thomson , a geologist .
The recreation of the ancient landscape shows that the land beneath the North Sea was probably more than merely a land bridge .
People moving north into Europe as the worst extremes of the ice age receded could have lived comfortably on the land , with what is now Britain marginalised and distant .
" People think this was a land bridge across which people roamed to get to Britain , but the truth is very different .
The places you wanted to live were the big plains next to the water and the coastline was way beyond where it is now .
This was probably a heartland of population at the time , " Prof Gaffney said .
" This completely transforms how we understand the early history of north - western Europe . "
The northernmost point of the map falls just short of the south coast of Norway , where rising water levels swamped the land around 18,000BC .
" This is the best preserved prehistoric landscape , certainly in the whole of Europe and possibly the world , " said Prof Gaffney .
Kurt Wenner began street painting in Rome in 1982 , and by 1984 was one of a few recognized Master Street Painters .
Inspired by anamorphism , a technique used in frescoed ceilings to create the illusion of height , he devised a unique geometry that enabled him to bring his illusions to the horizontal surface of the street .
This new art form , known as anamorphic , illusionistic , or simply 3 - D street painting has become a worldwide phenomenon .
Artists using this technique today can trace it back to Wenner 's invention in the early 1980's .
Wenner 's work not only provides a unique opportunity for groups and individuals to witness fine art in the making , it also presents a chance to interact with an artist while he creates .
His original masterpieces are made with richly colored handmade pastels .
As he works , the classical figures and stories rise from the pavement to delight and astonish onlookers .
Whether creating a work of fine art or the centerpiece of an advertising campaign , Wenner is a performing visual artist who turns the celebratory folk art of street painting into a spectacle .

Where Facebook has made a virtue of these limits , MySpace has made a virtue of its lack of them .
It now is so large — 100 million - plus registered accounts — that it has almost come to be a proxy for the Internet itself .
This is the problem with the social - media phenomenon .
MySpace once enabled a remarkable social renaissance : Because of the site ’s indefinable halo effect , you would answer e-mails you would normally never open , meet people you ’d never suffer otherwise ( “ Bill O’Reilly ” is one of my MySpace friends ) .
It was , in fact , not unlike freshman year at college .
But what ’s remarkable soon becomes ordinary .
MySpace remains cool — thanks to surprisingly deft stewardship by its new owner , News Corp . — but nothing is cool forever .
And once the tantalizing pull of millions of people you could possibly be best friends with wears off , you ’re left with some by now pretty ordinary functionality : blogging ; instant messaging ; photo , video , and audio uploads ; networking tools .
Thanks to the inexorable process of Web innovation , such stuff goes from “ OMG ” to “ Whatever ” in no time flat .
AOL followed a roughly analogous “ walled garden ” strategy until recently .
The strategy died , in part because the limited offerings within the garden could not compete with the near - infinite wilderness beyond the picket fence .
The social - media sites are touting their expertly tended , notably fecund , but still fenced - in offerings .
And to be fair , they are free , unlike the old subscription - based AOL .
But , as with the dial - ups , the distinctions in and among these offerings will become less interesting .
Instant messaging , in yet another example of the Web ’s buzz - to - blah dynamic , was once a unique and compelling reason to subscribe to AOL , not to mention hyped as a revolutionary application that would render e-mail fogeyish and vestigial .
It is now a commodity function .
Few of the social networks have yet proved adept at truly linking people of like - minded interests , and many of the networks being started now , especially by entrepreneurs and corporations looking to grab their slice of 2.0 glory , tend to miss the reason the best sites work :
They facilitate behavior that people already engage in .
Networks that make intuitive linkages or networks that are built around more - organic associations ( like the excellent new Saatchi Gallery social network for artists ) may soon draw away users with more - sophisticated social - media palates .
But that ’s just the start .
The features associated with social networks are increasingly being tacked on to existing sites , and new ones are announced almost daily .
Procter & Gamble has a social network now .
So does Barack Obama .
And someone will figure out how to network the networks , linking social - media sites and thus allowing iron - man social networkers to commingle their friends , blogs , images , and video feeds all in one place .
( MiNGGL , Socialgrapes , and Wink are three new sites already trying to do this . )
Individual sites could theoretically block out these epi-networks , but at their peril .
Or a new craze could emerge that cannot ( for technological reasons ) or does not ( for corporate reasons ) sync with sites like MySpace , forcing users to divide their online selves in ways that become unsatisfying .
The bug - which has the scientific name cymothoa exigua - was discovered inside the mouth of a red snapper bought from a London fishmonger .
The 3.5 cm creature had grabbed onto the fish 's tongue and slowly ate away at it until only a stub was left .
It then latched onto the stub and became the fish 's " replacement tongue " .
Excited
Scientists are very excited by the find .
Dr Jim Brock of the Horniman Museum in south London told Metro newspaper : " I have not seen this species in all my 13 years at the museum so it 's a remarkable find . "
What the bug looks like
The bugs are usually found off the coast of California , so it 's possible the fish was imported to the UK .
Freaked out
But do n't be too freaked out - scientists say the creature does not pose any threat to humans and only attaches itself to fish tongues .
Charles Bernstein was in Chicago recently for a poetry reading .
In between poems he let slip the opinion that National Poetry Month is bad for poetry .
Naturally we were intrigued and asked him for a short essay on the idea in celebration of if not the month of Aprilthen our publication of his new book My Way : Speeches and Poems .
" Bernstein is a poetic gadfly , uncompromising in his questioning of what language is , why we use it as we do , and what values are conveyed with our linguistic choices .
Bernstein will make few readers comfortable ; there is something here to irritate almost everyone , beginning with Bernstein 's radical vision of language and his egocentric voice .
. . .
American poetry needs Bernstein to keep it radically honest , and he is , playfully and annoyingly , delighted to meet that need . "
Booklist " This book , for all of its centrifugal activity , is a singular yet globally relevant perspective on the literary arts and their institutions , offered in good faith , yet cranky and poignant enough to not be easily ignored . "

Against National
Poetry Month
As Such by Charles Bernstein
Author of My Way : Speeches and Poems
And they say
If I would just sing lighter songs
Better for me would it be ,
But not is this truthful ;
For sense remote
Adduces worth and gives it
Even if ignorant reading impairs it ;
But it 's my creed
That these songs yield
No value at the commencing
Only later , when one earns it .
translated from Giraut de Bornelh ( 12th century )
April is the cruelest month for poetry .
As part of the spring ritual of National Poetry Month , poets are symbolically dragged into the public square in order to be humiliated with the claim that their product has not achieved sufficient market penetration and must be revived by the Artificial Resuscitation Foundation ( ARF ) lest the art form collapse from its own incompetence , irrelevance , and as a result of the general disinterest among the broad masses of the American People .
The motto of ARF 's National Poetry Month is : " Poetry 's not so bad , really . "
National Poetry Month is sponsored by the Academy of American Poets , an organization that uses its mainstream status to exclude from its promotional activities much of the formally innovative and " otherstream " poetries that form the inchoate heart of the art of poetry .
The Academy 's activities on behalf of National Poetry Month tend to focus on the most conventional of contemporary poetry ; perhaps a more accurate name for the project might be National Mainstream Poetry Month .
Then perhaps we could designate August as National Unpopular Poetry Month .
Through its " safe poetry " free verse distribution program , the American Academy of Poetry 's major initiative for National Poetry Month is to give away millions of generic " poetry books " to random folks throughout the country .
This program is intended to promote safe reading experiences and is based on ARF 's founding principle that safe poetry is the best prophylactic against aesthetic experience .
Free poetry is never free , nor is free verse without patterns .
Oscar Wilde once wrote , " Only an auctioneer admires all schools of art . "
National Poetry month professes to an undifferentiated promotion for " all " poetry , as if supporting all poetry , any more than supporting all politics , you could support any .
National Poetry Month is about making poetry safe for readers by promoting examples of the art form at its most bland and its most morally " positive . "
The message is : Poetry is good for you .
But , unfortunately , promoting poetry as if it were an " easy listening " station just reinforces the idea that poetry is culturally irrelevant and has done a disservice not only to poetry deemed too controversial or difficult to promote but also to the poetry it puts forward in this way .
" Accessibility " has become a kind of Moral Imperative based on the condescending notion that readers are intellectually challenged , and must n't be presented with anything but Safe Poetry .
As if poetry will turn people off to poetry .
Poetry : Readers Wanted .
The kind of poetry I want is not a happy art with uplifting messages and easy to understand emotions .
I want a poetry that 's bad for you .
Certainly not the kind of poetry that Volkswagen would be comfortable about putting in every new car it sells , which , believe it or not , is a 1999 feature of the Academy 's National Poetry Month program .
The most desirable aim of the Academy 's National Poetry Month is to increase the sales of poetry books .
But when I scan some of the principal corporate sponsors of the program of the past several years , I can't help noting ( actually I can but I prefer not to ) that some are among the major institutions that work actively against the wider distribution of poetry .
The large chain bookstores are no friends to the small presses and independent bookstores that are the principal supporters of all types of American poetry : they have driven many independents out of business and made it more difficult for most small presses ( the site of the vast majority of poetry publishing ) to get their books into retail outlets , since by and large these presses are excluded from the large chains .
I also note this year that The New York Times is a major sponsor of National Poetry Month ; but if the Times would take seriously the task of reviewing poetry books and readings , it would be doing a far greater service to poetry than advertising its support for National Poetry Month .
The whole thing strikes me as analogous to cigarette makers sponsoring a free emphysema clinic .
Indeed , part of the purpose of the Academy 's National Poetry Month appears to be to advertise National Poetry Month and its sponsors thus , the Academy has taken out a series of newspapers ads that mention no poets and no poems but rather announce the existence of National Poetry Month with a prominent listing of its backers , who appear , in the end , to be sponsoring themselves .
The path taken by the Academy 's National Poetry Month , and by such foundations as Lannan and the Lila Wallace - Readers Digest Fund , have been misguided because these organizations have decided to promote not poetry but the idea of poetry , and the idea of poetry too often has meant almost no poetry at all .
Time and time again we hear the official spokespersons tell us they want to support projects that give speedy and efficient access to poetry and that the biggest obstacle to this access is , indeed , poetry , which may not provide the kind of easy reading required by such mandates .
The solution : find poetry that most closely resembles the fast and easy reading experiences of most Americans under the slogans Away with Difficulty !
Make Poetry Palatable for the People !
I think particularly of the five - year plan launched under the waving banners of Disguise the Acid Taste of the Aesthetic with NutriSweet Coating , which emphasized producing poetry in short sound bites , with MTV - type images to accompany them , so the People will not even know they are getting poetry .
This is the genius of the new Literary Access programs : the more you dilute art , the more you appear to increase the access .
But access to what ?
Not to anything that would give a reader or listener any strong sense that poetry matters , but rather access to a watered down version that lacks the cultural edge and the aesthetic sharpness of the best popular and mass culture .
The only reason that poetry matters is that is has something different to offer , something slower on the uptake , maybe , but more intense for all that , and also something necessarily smaller in scale in terms of audience .
Not better than mass culture but a crucial alternative to it .
The reinvention , the making of a poetry for our time , is the only thing that makes poetry matter .
And that means , literally , making poetry matter , that is making poetry that intensifies the matter or materiality of poetry acoustic , visual , syntactic , semantic .
Poetry is very much alive when it finds ways of doing things in a media - saturated environment that only poetry can do , but very much dead when it just retreads the same old same old .
As an alternative to National Poetry Month , I propose that we have an International Anti-Poetry month .
As part of the activities , all verse in public places will be covered over from the Statue of Liberty to the friezes on many of our government buildings .
Poetry will be removed from radio and TV ( just as it is during the other eleven months of the year ) .
Parents will be asked not to read Mother Goose and other rimes to their children but only ... fiction .
Religious institutions will have to forego reading verse passages from the liturgy and only prose translations of the Bible will recited , with hymns strictly banned .
Ministers in the Black churches will be kindly requested to stop preaching .
Cats will be closed for the month by order of the Anti-Poetry Commission .
Poetry readings will be replaced by self - help lectures .
Love letters will have to be written only in expository paragraphs .
Baseball will have to start its spring training in May .
No vocal music will be played on the radio or sung in the concert halls .
Children will have to stop playing all slapping and counting and singing games and stick to board games and football .
As part of the campaign , the major daily newspapers will run full page ads with this text :
Go ahead , do n't read any poetry .
You wo n't be able to understand it anyway :
the best stuff is all over your head .
And there are n't even any commercials to liven up the action .
Anyway , you 'll end up with a headache trying to figure out
what the poems are saying because they are saying
NOTHING .
Who needs that .
Better go to the movies .
January is a hangover month , in every sense .
In January , the holiday bills start coming due .
Recessions are the hangovers of economic booms fueled by central banks ’ fiat money .
After a long boom , almost no one remembers the degree of fear that strikes non-government employees during a major recession , when they see their investments shrink in value , their career opportunities shrink , and their commissions — for those people on commission — cut by half .
They pay their monthly bills by withdrawing savings or by borrowing .
Today , at the tail end of a five - year recovery , Americans are already paying their monthly bills by drawing down their savings or by borrowing .
BAD MEMORIES
Bad memories fade .
We remember the good times .
This is one of humanity ’s greatest blessings .
When it comes to recessions , this is a liability .
Senior - level decision - makers today in every field have no memory of how terrifying a recession is for senior business managers : falling sales , enormous payrolls to meet , and enormous corporate debts that must be funded .
Red ink is everywhere .
Stock options become worthless .
Senior managers are paid mostly by stock options .
Senior managers did remember back in 1981 .
There had been three recessions : in 1970 — 71 , 1975 , and 1980 .
Recessions were a common occurrence in that ten - year period .
Managers had experience with them .
So had investors .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had peaked in early February , 1966 , at just under 1,000 .
It had briefly gone above 1,000 inter-day .
The Dow had yet to reach that 1966 level again in 1981 .
It fell to 777 the next year .
Then , for almost a decade , it was boom time .
The Reagan boom began in 1982 .
Not until 1991 did the nation suffer a recession .
That was 16 years ago .
An even longer boom began in 1991 , but not strong enough to save Bush ’s Presidency .
You do n’t remember the details , do you ?
Neither does your boss if you work for a Fortune 500 company .
Your boss was just a hot prospect in 1991 — a comer .
He may have been in a different company , even a different industry , in 1991 .
The 2001 recession is also barely remembered .
It inflicted too little pain .
This is because Greenspan ’s Federal Reserve had been pumping in money and cutting interest rates for at least seven months when the recession began in March .
It was over by November .
The Nasdaq had been in freefall for over a year by March , 2001 , the month the recession began , as we were told officially in 2002 .
The S&P 500 was at 1100 , down from 1550 in early 2000 .
It recovered that summer ; then it fell to 950 later in the year .
It recovered again ; then it fell below 800 in the second half of 2002 .
That was bad news for owners of individual stocks , but their numbers were small : about 20 % of American families .
It was bad news for pension fund managers , but most pension fund investors keep contributing .
It was bad news for senior managers in American companies .
Their companies ’ pension fund obligations continued to rise .
The 15 % to 17 % per year gains in their funds ’ stock holdings had reversed , but the day of reckoning for most corporate pensions was at least a decade away .
Senior managers would be in retirement by then .
In February , 1991 , the United States won a war in Iraq in one month .
The army did not stick around .
The voters trusted President Bush in March , 1991 .
His popularity ratings were sky high , scaring off Mario Cuomo and other big - name Democrat contenders , leaving only some guy from Arkansas at the head of the pack .
Yet Bush lost his bid for re-election in 1992 .
That ’s how fast things changed .
“ It ’s the economy , stupid , ” was the Clinton camp ’s slogan .
It surely was .
Today , we are losing a war in Iraq .
It is clear that there is no way out with honor .
It is a quagmire .
Iraq is moving into a civil war .
The Republicans do n’t know what to do .
The Democrats do n’t know what to do .
The public has lost confidence in Bush , yet the economy seems to be booming .
What will happen to public confidence in his leadership during a recession ?
We have a new Federal Reserve Chairman , who has yet to be tested under fire .
Congress has just changed hands .
There is no recession - tested leadership .
Yet a recession looms .
The U.S. trade deficit ( current account ) is approaching $ 850 billion a year .
Nothing in man ’s history rivals this level of deficit .
The largest economy on earth can no longer compete with the rest of the world except in one area : the issuing of IOUs .
Here , we are the grand masters .
This has been the pattern since the 1991 recession .
The savings rate of private households in some recent fiscal quarters has gone negative .
We have the lowest personal savings rate of any large economy .
We are dependent on Chinese imports for our goods on shelves in Wal - Mart , Target , and the other large retailers of consumer goods .
These imports have kept down the rate of price inflation .
We are being subsidized by the mercantilistic export policies of Asian nations , whose central banks fund the operation by expanding their currencies .
When they stop inflating , they will have a recession like nothing seen in Asia in history .
The last time it happened — the 1930s — Asia was agricultural .
In a recession , Asians will cut prices even lower to keep workers at work .
The Zorro - masked yellow smiley face in the Wal - Mart ads will still be slashing prices and smiling .
Meanwhile , American manufacturing will be slashing payrolls and screaming .
The Institute for Supply Management on December 1 issued its monthly report on American manufacturing .
The index fell in November to 49.5 .
Anything below 50 is a mark of contraction .
This was the first time in 41 months that this index had turned negative .
For American manufacturing , the recession is here .
It is time to start hunkering down .
As the radio ads on the kids ’ shows said in my youth , “ Be the first on your block ! ”
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR .
. . .
If you are male , married , white , and on salary , you probably wo n’t get fired .
The unemployment rate will rise .
It could conceivably double .
But for white , married , salaried men , the unemployment figure will not go double - digit .
You wo n’t get a raise .
You wo n’t get a promotion .
But you probably wo n’t get fired .
That ’s the good news .
The bad news is that you ca n’t be sure .
People do get fired .
If your position in your department is marginal , you ’re not immune to the axe .
There is always some hot shot looking for your job .
If he is single and can work for less , you ’re in trouble .
He may live in India .
If you provide a service that involves the production of digits , you ’re at risk .
If your company sells into an international market , you ’re at risk .
If your division is marginal , you ’re at risk .
What gets hammered in a recession is commodities .
They are at the bottom of the supply chain .
They are price competitive .
There is usually a cheaper commodity that can be substituted .
In November , 2001 , the month in which the most recent recession ended , the Commodity Research Bureau ’s index bottomed at 180 .
Today , it ’s over 340 .
If you are a commodity , expect trouble .
If what you do for a living , others can do almost as well , and if they are in a position to cut their price , you ’re in trouble .
One thing is certain :
If you are on salary , you will become a net liability for your company .
You are a fixed expense .
Meanwhile , corporate revenues will fall .
If you are on commission , the 16 fat years are about to end .
For you , the news is bad . . . unless you work for an auction firm specializing in liquidating bankrupt companies .
The worst thing about a recession for most Americans is the ticking of the debt meter .
It does n’t stop ticking just because the economy is in recession .
It ticks louder .
People freeze up when they get scared .
They put off making purchases .
They cut expenses .
But there are limits to what they can do .
They live so close to the edge of their budgets that there is not much fat to cut in relation to disposable , after - tax income .
The debt meter ticks .
This is why the auto industry is always hit hard in recessions .
People can forego buying a new car .
Consider the American - owned car industry today .
Ford and GM are experiencing huge losses .
Chrysler joined with Daimler .
We are in a boom .
The housing market has turned people ’s homes into ATMs .
People borrow their homes ’ equity .
But this process has begun to slow down .
When equity begins to shrink in the next recession because of falling home prices , it will dawn on a growing number of Americans that they have been eating their seed corn .
What is really scary in the housing market in a recession is the increase in illiquidity .
People refuse to face reality :
Their real estate is worth less than before .
When they decide to sell , they hold out for last year ’s price .
They sit .
They grow fearful .
They still sit .
Then they grow panicky .
Eventually , they are forced to move : a lost job , a transfer , a foreclosure , or something that leaves them without recourse .
They may walk away from the house .
They lose their credit rating when they do .
I bought my home in a foreclosure in 2005 .
I got a very good price .
The number of foreclosures is already over a million a year , up from 650,000 a year ago .
The “ wealth effect ” — spending more when you feel richer — has been fueled by rising prices on housing .
This is about to end , all over the country , but especially in coastal cities .
I feel sorry for people in the early years of their careers .
They have just bought their first homes .
They have not faced a recession .
They think that household budgets , while tight , will get looser as they get older .
Ah , youth !
They will soon have a rendezvous with reality .
WHEN NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK
In recessions , fear grips consumers .
They start looking for ways to cut back on spending .
If your services are marginal in their budgets , you ’re in trouble .
If consumers say , “ I can do without this , ” you ’re in big trouble .
Not everything marginal gets cut .
Some things are seen as cheap luxuries .
People may buy a candy bar instead of going out to lunch .
Warren Buffett bought See ’s Candies .
He knew what he was doing .
People may rent a video instead of going to a movie .
Nobody moves from three - martini lunches to brown bag lunches in one fell swoop .
People should , but they do n’t .
They resist being perceived as failures , as being desperate .
They have their status to maintain .
Anything addictive or near - addictive tends to hold its market in a recession .
Alcohol , cigarettes , and sugar products do n’t face collapsing markets .
Bad habits are hard to break .
Companies cut back on advertising because revenues fail to pay for the ads .
This leaves undefended territory in the market which can be exploited by companies that have deep pockets .
For those few firms that remain aggressive , a recession allows them an opportunity to increase market share .
If you think Wal - Mart is a tough competitor today , wait until the recession is six months old .
It is the feeling of having hit a brick wall that is so discouraging in a recession .
People refuse to buy from you , no matter what you do .
If you are marginal in their present situation , you ca n’t lower your price low enough to get them to buy .
You and your product are no longer in their budget .
If you are a brain surgeon , you will do fine .
People do n’t schedule brain surgery based on the business cycle .
If you are a dentist , you are in trouble .
People can put off getting their teeth cleaned .
Because recessions have been infrequent for so long , and because business owners who are not facing Asian competition are not familiar with the effects of consumer resistance , the next recession will come as a shock to business decision - makers .
They will see red ink flow because of fixed expenses and falling revenues .
Businesses that do not have a line of credit , guaranteed in writing , from a local bank may not survive .
That is what happened two decades ago in Texas during the savings & loan crisis , which piggy - backed on the oil patch crisis that began in 1980 .
Small businesses that had enjoyed informal lines of credit saw these lines severed when their local banks were bought out by national banks , and new managers took over locally .
“ Never heard of you , ” was the refrain .
“ Your rolling credit is not being renewed .
Pay up . ”
They could n’t .
You may think your employer is solid .
Yet we have just been through a period of rising corporate debt like no other in history .
The borrowed money was used to fund mergers and acquisitions , as is common at the tail end of every boom .
The money was also used to buy back corporate shares , thereby raising share prices , thereby making senior executives rich through their stock options .
The debt meter will keep ticking .
WHAT IS YOUR FALL - BACK POSITION ?
You probably will not be fired .
You received a Christmas bonus — maybe .
Do n’t expect a big one next Christmas .
What major moves are you planning over the next two years ?
Re -think them .
If you have your capital invested in equities , re-think your position .
If you plan to retire , re -think this decision .
If you plan to expand your business , wait .
Put the expansion money in reserve in a near - cash asset .
You will get more bang for your buck a year into the recession .
The old rule of having enough money in the bank to cover payments for six months ’ bills is a very good rule .
Extend this to 12 months .
The problem is , almost no business can afford to do this .
The bills are many , profit margins are low , and reserves are minimal .
If your business requires a rolling line of credit , lock it in now .
Get this in writing .
Pay an interest premium if you must .
My next - door neighbor is an independent contractor .
He does cement work .
He does very nice work .
He has no marketing plan that I can see .
I offered to help him develop an advertising program a year ago , for free .
He never contacted me about this .
He is a typical small businessman .
He is uninterested in advertising .
That is why most small businesses remain small .
His services are marginal .
Nobody really needs them .
He is not a plumber .
When people are feeling no pain , they upgrade their yards .
A few of them call him .
But when people are feeling pain , they wo n’t call him .
Nobody needs a new patio .
My guess is that a year from now , he will be forced to put his home up for sale .
I could be wrong .
Maybe he has marketing skills I do n’t recognize .
Or maybe he can liquidate his business and get a job as a laborer .
Or maybe the town I live in will continue to boom .
A lot of people are moving in .
But for people like him in most regions , a recession is a disaster , not an annoyance .
Have you made an honest assessment of your position in a falling economy ?
Have you got some sense of how marginal you are in today ’s economy ?
If this economy heads as far south as it did in 1991 , what will your income / outgo position be ?
If you work for the government , you ’re safe .
If you are in a business that helps people deal with emergencies that cannot be postponed , you ’re safe .
But most people are not in this position .
CONCLUSION
Recessions are hard times for businesses .
People in good times think they have done all they can when they hedge their investment portfolio against falling demand .
But the fact is , what threatens most people is not a fall in their investments , since they have so few investments .
What threatens them most is the loss of a job or the sidetracking of a career .
You may need reserves to draw down in a recession .
This means that you will need ready cash .
If you have to sell something in order to get access to cash , you ’re in big trouble if that is your only reserve .
Others will be selling , too .
High liquidity requires three things : ( 1 ) a rapid sale without offering a discount ; ( 2 ) a rapid sale without advertising expenses ; ( 3 ) rapid sale without offering a commission to a middleman .
Could you live for six months on your liquid reserves ?
If not , it ’s time to sell some less liquid assets in order to increase your liquidity .

What you see is what you get , i.e. there was no cutting of the vehicle prior to the pictures being taken .
It is my brother - in - law that you see holding the mobile phone , he honestly does n't know the speed that he was going at but was n't near as fast as he has done in the past on that particular part of the road .
Although the road was completely dry he said that it felt he was on ice and the car just careened into the tree .
He actually called the emergency services and climbed out of the car by himself , he spent only a couple of hours in hospital , apart from a few minor scratches he got a bandage around his little finger , I told him if he 's not already religious he should take it up ASAP !
The car WAS a pristine RS6 ABT , I was supposed to pick it up that very day to borrow it from him for a week as I 've always wanted to try out the ABT version .
He really should have simply told me that he did n't want me to drive his car I 'm so happy he is alive and all in one piece .
failed
arrests
The frequency of video statements by members of the original al - Qaeda leadership and other Islamist terrorists shows a marked increase .
The propaganda is of greater sophistication , of high quality and more professional .
English is used more often , either in direct speech or in subtitles , allowing potential access to a wider audience .
Video
As threats to life and limb go , terrorists have always been pathetically low on the list compared to , say , motorists or police stations .
A recent Europol report on terrorism on the continent , despite having been released a few weeks ago , has been curiously neglected by the media .
One outstanding fact obtains : in 2006 , of almost five hundred terrorist attacks in Europe , only one was by Islamists - and it .
While the report mentions a cluster of other attacks in previous years and spend a lot of time discussing terrorist activity originating from Islamist groups , the cold facts indicate that there is little of it about .
Much is made of the fact that half of thefor terrorist offenses were related to Islamist activity , but we already know that the arrests far outweigh the actual scale of activity .
As the report notes , " the arrests and convictions were not necessarily related to terrorist offences that took place during the reporting period . "
Arrests are a reflection of policy focus , and dont ' necessarily correlate to an actual threat .
Thus , the report notes that only 32 % of those arrested were suspected of involvement in or the preparation of a terrorist attack .
Further , " the number of arrests made in relation to Islamist terrorism in the UK is among the highest in the EU " .
Elsewhere , the largest number of arrests is for separatist activity in France .
However , there is no accounting for the perfidy of those who march under the black flag : attacks , the cunning bastards .
At least the Home Secretary can no longer claim that Islamist activity is related to a refusal to speak English .
The report is so far the most systematic attempt by European police to gather together data on this matter , and can be seen as definitive .
Indeed , if anything , Europol was pitching for a greater batch of funding with this report , seeking to upgrade itself from a continental crime - fighting force to a mainstay of the ' war on terror ' .
Every national police or intelligence force contributing data could be said to have a similar reason for wishing to amplify the threat .
Yet , the most they could come up with was a single failed attack .
I can find only two references to this report in mainstream media outlets , one in the Boston Herald , the other in Deutsche Welle , neither of which refers to these figures , but both of which discuss a ' growing terror threat ' .
So much for ' Eurabia ' and ' Londonistan ' .
So much for the Clash of Civilisations .
The counter - climactic truth is that the incidence of Islamist activity , including that using terrorist tactics , is concentrated in parts of the world where US imperialism operates .
Labels : ' war on terror ' , clash of civilisations , europe , europol , islamism , terrorism
All right , we 're busy coming up with the design requirements for what DK4 will have to do .
But one of the biggest early decisions will be this : how should the brand - spanking - new backend be built ?
What language ?
What frameworks ?
What tools ?
We 've talked over various options , but we 're going to throw it open to the community for discussion too .
Nothing can get as heated or as obscure as quickly as a bunch of techies talking tech .
You think your Thanksgivings with GOP relatives get bad , try wandering into a room full of programmers and saying " Java sucks ! " or " I just got a 2.18 % speed increase in my data archiving cronjobs by converting them from Ruby to Python . "
So a good old - fashioned technology free - for - all might be fun , here .
More to the point , I 'll have real - world consequences -- we 're going to be influenced by your arguments .
If you do n't know what the heck I 'm talking about below , please ignore this thread .
This one 's just for the techies .
Language : Perl , Ruby , or Python ?
Java is right out , because I hate it and that much friggin ' typing screws with my carpal tunnel issues .
PHP is right out , because of security and other considerations .
The only three languages seriously being considered are Perl , Ruby , and Python .
As it turns out , people have strong preferences towards Perl , Ruby , or Python .
And I mean intense feelings about it .
This is probably because all three languages suck , as do all their language predecessors , but each language has a different philosophy about where it 's important to suck the least .
So which should we use ?
That ought to be a good flame war , right there , but there 's something just as important , and that 's the web framework itself ...
Framework ?
Core web framework is dictated by language choice , and vice versa .
If you 're using Ruby , you 're almost certainly using Ruby on Rails .
If you 're using Python , you might be using Django or Zope .
If you 're using Perl , you 're using mod_perl , maybe with one of the higher level frameworks available from CPAN that build on top of it ( Catalyst , Mason , etc . )
So , which is better ?
Anyone use more than one of them and have a real - world opinion ?
To prime the pump , I 'll say I 'm nervous about trying to do this site on Rails : I have little information on how well it will scale , and I 'm not certain how many of their most - hyped features we 'd just be immediately working around anyway ( like their data abstraction stuff ) .
These two concerns also apply to dozens upon dozens of other framework engines -- pretty much all of them , in fact , to one extent or another .
Note that we 've actually got rather specific technical requirements , here , and they revolve almost exclusively around speed .
The number of primary " pages " on Daily Kos is very few -- the frontpage , story page , etc .
But they 're always in memory , they 're always changing , and they get hammered hard .
Optimizing that behavior is far more important than prototyping them quickly .
Now , here 's the rub .
All of this might be moot , or at least secondary , if by some ( remote ) miracle we decided to use an existing ...
Content Management System ?
Is there an existing content management system powerful enough to use either out of the box , or with modifications ?
And one that can be so easily modified that we can be confident we 'd still want to be using it a few years from now , with whatever new features we might dream up ?
The entire reason we 're not going to be going with Scoop with this one is n't because of anything Scoop inherently does wrong : it 's because the site has already begun to diverge from what Scoop was originally intended for , and as it turns out , there 's large chunks of it that now do n't have much to do with Scoop at all .
I 'll be honest on this one .
I do n't see much value in using an existing CMS , because this is a very specialized application , and because the amount of customization and new features we expect to spec into DK4 ( including a lot of AJAX - based code , etc. ) means that we'd be ripping up as much of a CMS , percentage - wise , as we would save .
And that 'd put us right back where we are with Scoop now -- using a tool designed for one thing , but slowly frankensteined into something else .
But if you 've got one in mind that has remarkable , amazing , awe - inspiring features already built in , then tell us about it .
So there you go .
Suppose you 're in charge of how the backend of Daily Kos 4.0 gets built .
How would you do it ?

Kashmiri people are desperate to be allowed to cross the border
The move follows the massive earthquake on Saturday which killed at least 23,000 people in South Asia .
Both countries have also eased travel curbs , allowing some Kashmiri families to return home via Punjab .
A new earth tremor thought to be an aftershock has been felt in the Pakistani capital , Islamabad .
There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the quake recorded at 0123 local time Thursday ( 2023 GMT Wednesday ) by the US Geological Survey .
Map of earthquake zone
With a magnitude of 5.6 and centring on an area 135 km north of the city , it was the strongest tremor recorded since the weekend in Pakistan which has felt several dozen aftershocks .
Limited access
According to the Indian army , the Pakistani soldiers invited the Indians to help them rebuild some of their bunkers after sleeping in the open in increasingly cold temperatures .
QUICK GUIDE
Kashmir dispute
Normally , such a crossing would have resulted in bloodshed , says the BBC's Sanjeev Srivastava in Srinagar .
The Indian army expressed frustration that it could not do more .
One soldier pointed towards Muzaffarabad , the devastated capital of the Pakistani part of Kashmir , and said Indian helicopters could reach it with supplies within 15 minutes .
Instead , they are not permitted to cross the Line of Control .
In Muzaffarabad survivors are desperate for any aid
Enlarge Image
With the bridge connecting the Indian and Pakistani sectors of Kashmir destroyed , Delhi and Islamabad both also waived travel restrictions to allow some Kashmiri families to return home through the Wagah border in Punjab .
Our correspondent adds that there is growing demand for easier access across the divided valley , allowing people to cross over to try to help loved ones on the other side .
Eating grass to survive
In Balakot , close to the epicentre in Pakistan , US helicopters have been used for the first time to ferry in supplies and carry out the wounded .
But in outlying areas relief has yet to arrive .
Mukhtar Ali Khan , a resident of Alai , a town in Mansehra district in Pakistan 's Northwest Frontier Province , walked for 11 hours to seek help .
He told the BBC's Urdu service that there were bodies strewn all over the town and the survivors were starving and yet no help had arrived .
" I have seen people eating grass - people are dying of starvation , " he said .
A similar situation was reported in Kohistan where survivors are looting shops in a hunt for supplies .
Relief work got a boost on Wednesday when the Karakoram highway linking Pakistan with China through northern areas was re-opened after landslides and mudslides .
In Balakot , relief is finally getting through but such is the scale of the disaster that thousands of injured people are still waiting for medical treatment , says the BBC's Andrew North .
Our correspondent says doctors at the clinic can only offer first aid and they can only hope helicopters will ferry them away in time .
The prosecution , on the other hand , said Amero loaded the porn deliberately , and faulted her for not shutting the computer off fast enough once the children had witnessed it .
Since the conviction a legion of security experts have sided with Amero .
They say the jury 's lack of understanding of computer security technology blinded them to the presence of adware , which Amero - a computer novice - could not control .
She was originally scheduled to be sentenced on Friday in the US , but this was postponed to March 29 to allow her to beef up her defence team .
Meanwhile , security researchers at a Florida - based anti-spyware firm have pledged to get to the bottom of the mystery by conducting their own investigation , SecurityFocus.com reported .
Alex Eckelberry , president of Sunbelt Software , reportedly obtained an " image " of the contents of the computer 's hard disk drive .
Earlier this month , he put out a call to the security and forensics community for help in analysing the image .
The goal was to determine whether the porn pop-ups were deliberately loaded by Amero , or if they were caused by spyware .
Eckelberry , along with other security experts , dismissed the police and prosecutor 's claims that a forensic investigation of the computer showed the teacher was actively browsing porn websites the entire day on October 19 , 2004 , the same day she was accused of displaying porn to her students .
Amero 's husband , Wes Volle , wrote on his " Julie Amero Defense Fund " blog that his wife was tried unfairly .
" The court opted to deny / prevent the defense from presenting evidence to rebut the evidence introduced by the state , " Volle said .
" The states assertion of a deliberate attempt to access pornographic web sites can only be deemed as persecution of a political nature . "
Volle added that two independent forensic investigations had concluded that malicious code had caused the pop-ups , not a deliberate act by Amero .
In another blog post , the director of technical education at security software maker ESET , Randy Abrams , posed the question : " Can a legal system unversed in technology result in a fair trial . "
He said the prosecution 's " expert witness " , who presented evidence against Amero at the trial , was incompetent .
" The prosecutor in this case , David Smith hired a police detective who was entirely unqualified to investigate the case and incapable , through intent or ignorance , of sticking to factual testimony , " Abrams wrote .
" The jury was told that Amero had to have clicked on links when there was absolutely no evidence to support the conclusion . "
Amero now has a new attorney - criminal defence lawyer William Dow - who has offered to defend her for free and will reportedly pursue an appeal .

If Gov. Ted Kulongoski seems a little sluggish this week , he 's got an excuse : he could n't afford coffee .
In fact , the Democratic governor could n't afford much of anything during a trip to a Salem - area grocery store on Tuesday , where he had exactly $ 21 to buy a week 's worth of food — the same amount that the state 's average food stamp recipient spends weekly on groceries .
Kulongoski is taking the weeklong challenge to raise awareness about the difficulty of feeding a family on a food stamp budget .
Read more ...
This is so refreshing to see from a politician .
I applaud Governor Kulongoski and his wife for doing this and wish more would follow suit .
The gap between the wealthy and working class in America keeps getting wider and we know Bush and the Republicans do n't give a damn .
He 's never had to worry about making choices that many of us are forced to make every day such as choosing food and shelter over health insurance and medications .
How long do you think King George would last in the real world , forced to live like the average American ?

Jonathan Edwards , the Olympic champion who once refused to compete on a Sunday , has quit as presenter of the BBC 's long - running religious programme Songs Of Praise because he is no longer convinced of the existence of God .
He will make his penultimate appearance tonight as a man deeply troubled by the collapse of his Christian faith , the driving force of his life since his childhood in Devon , where his father was vicar of a parish in Ilfracombe .
A close friend explained : " Jonathan felt he had to leave Songs Of Praise as he felt profoundly uncomfortable doing the programme with the way he now feels . "
Edwards 's family has been devastated by his crisis of faith , especially his wife Alison , the daughter of an evangelist from the Hebrides .
" Jonathan has not hidden any of his feelings from those closest to him , but it has not been easy for Alison to come to terms with it , ' added the friend .
Yet the family has had time to absorb the impact of Edwards 's extraordinary change of heart .
His faith , I can reveal , has been under threat ever since he retired in 2003 , still holding the world triple jump record .
A family friend said : " Jonathan 's identity was tied up with him being an athlete much more than he imagined .
He was world record holder and Olympic champion - and it was n't until he retired he realised how much he depended on that .
Not long afterwards , he started to have doubts and uncertainties about his faith .
Those doubts have grown louder - and who knows where it will end . "
Edwards 's torment has been exacerbated by rumours that his 16 - year marriage is under threat from the spiritual upheaval and changing circumstances of his life .
While Alison brings up their two sons , Sam , 13 , and Nathan , 10 , at their six - bedroom home in Gosforth , near Newcastle , Edwards spends some time each month on business in London , where he is a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games , representing the athletes .
Until last year , he was also a member of Ofcom , the independent regulator for the UK communications industry .
For convenience - and as a financial investment - Edwards has bought a flat near Westminster .
Last week the flat and his home in Gosforth were besieged by journalists seeking to confirm rumours that his loss of Christian conviction had led him into the path of temptation .
Another friend of Edwards insisted : " Jonathan is adamant that their marriage is fine and he has nothing to hide . "
Edwards has never considered himself famous .
Yet the reality is that he was placed on a pedestal as a champion of the Christian cause from the moment he found unexpected stardom at the World Athletic Championships in Gothenburg in 1995 .
The world triple jump record he set there of 18.29 metres - making him the first man to jump over 60 feet - remains unbroken .
Edwards had already gained major attention four years earlier when he declined to compete at the 1991 World Championships as his event was scheduled for a Sunday and he refused to participate on a day he reserved exclusively for worship .
Later , he rescinded that decision .
And his world was turned upside down after his triumph in Gothenburg when 1,000 people awaited his return at Newcastle Airport .
Five months later , he won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year .
By the time he climaxed his career with a gold at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 , at the age of 34 , he was assured of millionaire status .
But humbly , he never ceased to remind his audience that his talent was a gift of God .
His charm and intellect - he graduated in physics from Durham University - brought him swift recognition from broadcasting companies .
His future looked golden , with clear indications that he would be fast - tracked into broadcasting both sports programmes and religious ones , too .
Six years ago , he was made a Commander of the British Empire and last year he received honorary doctorates from Exeter and Ulster universities .
As Edwards 's biographer , I have seen a fragility to his character that he is competent at disguising in public .
He lived to honour God , no question .
He has a deep , theological comprehension of the Bible , making his spiritual meltdown even more unlikely .
Even so , in the midst of his crisis of faith , Edwards will be accompanying Alison and their sons to their local church this morning .
" They still go to church as a family , ' explained a friend .
But throughout his medal - winning days as an athlete , Edwards always confessed to one abiding fear .
" I always believed success would be the biggest challenge of my faith , ' he said .
And so it has proved .
Last night Edwards , determined to protect his family , politely rebuffed all enquiries .
" I am going through a difficult period , and one deeply personal to myself and my family and I have no wish to comment , ' he said .
Funny .
Time 's " person of the year " is " You " , probably the biggest cop out in the magazine 's history .

Oops .
The Big Book Of Beastly Mispronunciations : The Complete Opinionated Guide For The Careful Speaker by Charles Harrington Elster offers suggestions on how to pronounce thousands of words and expressions .
Here are 100 examples !
Abdomen AB - duh -m e n . Occasionally , ab - DOH -m e n .
Veteran radio commentator Paul Harvey says ab - DOH -m e n , with the accent on the middle syllable , and some speakers still insist that this is the proper pronunciation .
Not so .
Both ab - DOH -m e n and AB - duh - m e n have been used in cultivated speech fore more than a hundred years , and both are acceptable .
However , since the 1960s AB - duh - m e n has become so prevalent that it has nearly eclipsed ab - DOH -m e n .
The Imperial Dictionary ( 1884 ) , Funk & Wagnalls Standard ( 1897 ) , the Century ( 1889 - 1914 ) , and Webster 2 ( 1934 ) all countenanced AB - duh -m e n as an alternative pronunciation .
Vizetelly ( 1929 ) noted that it was “ gradually displacing the more formal ” ab - DOH -m e n. Alfred H. Holt , in You Do n’t Say ! ( 1937 ) , remarks that “ there is something too forthright and booming about ‘ ab - dó - men , ’ though it has long been standard .
Five of the leading dictionaries now allow the first syllable accent , and one approves it . ”
When Kenyon and Knott ( 1949 ) and American College ( 1952 ) gave AB - duh - m e n preference , it was clear old ab - DOH -m e n was taking it in the gut .
Today AB - duh - m e n is the norm , and though current dictionaries still list second - syllable stress in good standing , even Paul Harvey would probably tell you that it ’s only a matter of time before ab - DOH -m e n goes belly up .

Accessory ak - SES - uh - ree .
Do not say uh - SES - uh - ree .
Despite what you may hear from the salesperson at your local department store , there is no such thing as an assessory .
Pronounce the double c in accessory like ks .
See the two previous entries , and also flaccid and succinct .

Alumnae uh - LUHM -nee .
Do not say uh - LUHM-ny .
Alumnae is the Latin feminine plural of alumna ( uh - LUHM - nuh ) , a female graduate .
The word is often mispronounced uh - LUHM -ny ( - ny as in night ) , which is the proper pronunciation for alumni , the Latin masculine plural of alumnus ( uh - LUHM -n u s ) , a male graduate .
Alumni can mean male graduates , or male and female graduates .
Alumnae ( uh - LUHM - nee ) refers only to female graduates , as the alumnae of Smith and Wellesley .
See algae , antennae , larvae , minutia , papilla(e ) , vertebrae .

American (s ) uh - MER - i -k i n( z ) , or uh - MAIR - i -k i n( z ) .
Do not pronounce American (s ) in three syllables , uh - MAIR -k i n(z ) , or , as Lyndon Johnson did , uh - MUR -k i n( z ) .
Make sure to say it in four syllables : A - mer-i-can(s ) .

Bacchus BAK - u s , not BAHK - u s .
The name of this Greek god of wine and drunken revelry is properly pronounced with the short a of back , not , as one increasingly hears , with the broad a of father .

Balsamic bawl - SAM - ik .
Do n’t say bawl - SAHM - ik .
Despite what you may hear from some slippery - tongued chefs on those gourmet cooking TV shows , the stressed second syllable of balsamic rhymes with ham , not calm .

Bonaparte BOH - nuh - pahrt , not BAHN - uh - pahrt .
The o is long , as in bone , not short , as in bonnet .

Buffet ( sideboard or self - service meal ) buh - FAY , buu -FAY , or boo-FAY .
According to Burchfield ( 1996 ) , the British pronunciation is BUHF - it ( rhymes with rough it ) for the sideboard and BUU - fay or BUHF - ay for the self - service meal .
In American speech , the u in buffet may have the sound of the u in but , or oo in book , or oo in boot .
Regardless of which sound you prefer for the u ( and many educated speakers will vary from one to another , which is no crime ) , the accent should be on the second syllable .
Random House II ( 1987 ) notes that first - syllable stress is common when the word is used as an adjective , as in buffet dinner , buffet service , and buffet car .
This distinction , which is relatively recent , seems a natural and inoffensive extension of the process of shifting stress ( e.g. , the unknown man and a man unknown to us ) .
For the noun , however , second - syllable stress is the norm and first - syllable stress should be resisted .
See address for more on shifting stress .

Chamois SHAM-ee .
Unless you are referring to the goat antelope Rupicapra rupicapra , any pronunciation other than SHAM - ee is beastly .

Chauvinism SHOH-v i - niz ’m ( SHOH - like show , rhyming with slow ) .
It is beastly to pronounce the first syllable SHAW - ( rhymes with jaw ) , and even beastlier to pronounce it SHOW - ( rhymes with cow ) .

Congratulations k u n-GRACH - uh - LAY - sh i nz , not k u n - GRAJ - uh - LAY - sh i nz .
The issue here is the sound of the t in the second syllable .
Whenever I ’m a guest language maven fielding questions on a radio show , invariably someone calls in to complain about speakers who pronounce this word as if it were spelled congradulations and had something to do with graduation .
This informal and rather sloppy pronunciation has become so frequent among educated speakers that some current dictionaries now recognize it .
Cultivated speakers , however , take care to pronounce the t like ch in congratulate , congratulatory , and congratulations .

Conservatism k u n - SUR - vuh - tiz’m .
Do not say k u n - SUR - vuh - tiv - iz’m .
There is no conservative in conservatism .
The word has five syllables , not six .
The spelling conservativism , modeled after the mispronunciation , is also nonstandard .

Costume Kahs - tyoom ( recommended ) or Kahs - toom .
“ If you are one of those who can say [ KAHS - tyoom ] without making it [ KAHS - choom ] , and without sounding affected , you have the privilege , ” says Holt ( 1937 ) .
“ The rest of us will probably say ‘ cos - toom . ’ ”
Good advice , I say .
If KAHS - tyoom , with the long u , comes naturally to you , fine ; if not , say - toom .
No one can legitimately find fault with you for using either pronunciation .

Demeter d i - MEE - tur .
All pronunciation mavens have an Achilles heel ( or two ) , and I must confess that until recently the weak spot of mythological magnitude in my spoken vocabulary was Demeter .
I had always pronounced the name of this Greek goddess of agriculture and fertility with the accent on the first syllable , DEM - i - tur .
Then , a few weeks ago , when the actress Demi Moore was getting a lot of attention for a film or something , I was puzzled when broadcasters would stress the second syllable of her first name , saying d i - MEE Moore instead of DEM - ee Moore , which seemed more logical to me .
Wondering if Demi was perhaps short for Demeter , this hapless maven went to a dictionary , and then another dictionary , and then another , and so on , until Zeus finally took pity on me and turned me into a parking meter in midtown Manhattan , where for the rest of time I could listen to New Yorkers saying , “ Hey , did ya feed Demeter ? ”

Diagnosis DY - i g-NOH - sis ( also -s i s ) .
The plural diagnoses is pronounced DY - i g - NOH - seez ( - seez like seize ) .
Take care not to confuse the singular and plural pronunciations .
Many speakers incorrectly say diagno - seez when they mean diagno - sis .
See basis , crisis , thesis .

Disastrous di-ZAS - tr u s .
Disastrous , like disaster , has three syllables .
Do not add an extra syllable and say di ZAS - tur - u s , as though the word were spelled disasterous .
This is a di-ZAS - tr u s- lee careless pronunciation .
See ambidextrous .

Doppelgänger DAHP - u l- GANG - ur ( rhymes with topple hanger ) .
Some authorities still prefer the German pronunciation , but I say this word is pompous enough without subjecting it to a throat - and - noseful of that .
English has employed doppelgänger for almost 150 years , and there ’s no excuse not to anglicize it .
Current orthography favors lowercase d but retains the umlaut of dieresis ( dy - ER - i - sis ) over ä .

Drowned has one syllable .

Error ER - ur or AIR - ur .
Do not say AIR .
Sportcasters , particularly those who cover baseball , are notoriously careless pronouncers of this word .
Many say it in one syllable instead of two , compressing error into air .
Affected speakers , on the other hand , overpronounce the terminal - or by giving it a full OR sound , like oar .
Both of these pronunciations are , in dictionary lingo , “ nonstandard , ” which in this book means beastly .
A third variant , ER - uh , with the final r silent , is not listed in dictionaries but is acceptable from speakers who normally drop their r’s ( e.g. , some New Englanders , New Yorkers , and Southerners ) and pronounce , for example , carrier as KAR - ee-uh and father as FAH - th uh .
The pronunciation ER - ur , with e as in pet , is chiefly Eastern and Southern ; the pronunciation AIR - ur ( AIR - as in pair ) , chiefly Midwestern and Western .
Use the one you are comfortable with .
Just remember to pronounce the word in two syllables .
See furor , mirror , and , for more on the overpronunciation of - or , juror .

Fifth FIFTH or FITH .

Flutist FLOO - tist
The word flutist was first recorded in 1603 , and FLOO - tist has been and still is the only acceptable pronunciation for it .
The variant flautist was adapted from the Italian flautista in 1860 .
The preferred pronunciation for flautist is FLAW - tist ( FLAW - like flaw )
The variant FLOW - tist ( FLOW - rhyming with cow ) , which mimics the Italian pronunciation of - au , appears in current dictionaries but only the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) prefers it .
Unless you have some special reason for preferring Italian spellings and pronunciations , stick with the English flutist ( FLOO - tist ) , which is both traditional and unaffected .

Forward FOR - wurd ( like four + word ) .
What has happened to the for in forward ?
In recent years I have heard more and more speakers , on the street and on the air , changing it to foh - ( rhymes with toe ) so that forward comes out more like foe word or faux word .
This is not a simple matter of r-dropping , because these same speakers retain the second r , in - ward , and most of them are not native r-droppers who pahk the cah and eat with a fawk and say fah - wood ( or faw - wood ) mahch .
Native r-droppers pronounce - or- roughly as - aw - or - ah- , but these folks are pronouncing it - oh- , with a long o as in go .
I have to conclude that it is simply an eccentricity , and instance of what might be called r-slopping .
C’mon , everybody , there is no foe in forward .
You either pronounce both r’s , or , of you ’re an r-dropping Southerner or New Englander or New Yorker , swallow them both .
Also , do n’t confuse forward with froward , which means stubborn , willful , refractory , and is pronounced FROH - wurd .

The word is acceptably pronounced either in three or two syllables .
Avoid , please , with all your might , the ugsome GROH - shuh - ree and GROHSH - ree .

Gymnast JIM - nast , not JIM - nist .
Gymnast is properly pronounced to rhyme with swim fast , not slim fist .
Webster 3 ( 1961 ) was the first to record the slurred JIM - nist for this word , which entered English in 1594 .
Of the four major current American dictionaries , three give priority to the traditional JIM - nast , and WNW 3 ( 1997 ) sanctions only JIM - nast .
JIM - nast is also the only pronunciation in Funk & Wagnalls Standard ( 1980 ) and OED 2 ( 1989 ) , and it is the preference of the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) , Frierson ( 1988 ) , and Jones ( 1991 ) .
Only Oxford American ( 1980 ) prefers JIM - nist .
You should clearly pronounce the - ast in bombast and bombastic , iconoclast and iconoclastic , encomiast and encomiastic , dynast and dynastic , sarcast ( a sarcastic person ) and sarcastic , epiblast and epiblastic , fantast ( a dreamer , visionary ) and fantastic , enthusiast and enthusiastic , gymnast and gymnastic .

Heinous HAY -n i s .
This word is so frequently mispronounced by well - educated speakers ( who ought to know better ) that you ’d think the dictionaries would have caved in by now and countenanced the blunder .
To their credit , they have not .
HAY -n i s is the only acceptable pronunciation of this word .
Do not say HEE-n i s or HEE - nee- i s ( HEE - as in heat ) , both of which are HAY -n i s and long - standing members of the Most Unwanted Beastly Mispronunciations Hit List .
Heinous has two syllables , not three , and the first syllable is pronounced like the word hay , never like he .

Interesting IN - tris - ting or IN - tur - uh - sting or IN - tur - ES - ting .
All three pronunciations are acceptable , though not so long ago only the second was considered cultivated while the first was considered British and the third was frowned upon by some authorities .
One reason there are so many accepted pronunciations is that most educated speakers do not say interesting in exactly the same way every time .
Slight , unconscious variation is natural in rapid and informal speech , and when a certain variation recurs often enough in educated speech , it usually becomes the norm .
The three - syllable IN - tris - ting is a victim of syncope ( SING - kuh - pee ) , the loss or omission of a sound or syllable from the middle of a word as in FAM - lee for family and KUHMF - tur - buul for comfortable ( which see ) .
It is now probably the most commonly heard pronunciation in American speech .
The noun and verb interest is also a victim of syncope and is usually pronounced in two syllables , IN - trist , although the older IN - tur - ist is still heard .
The verbal adjective interested is often pronounced in four syllables , IN - tur - ES - tid , but the evidence of my ears says the three - syllable IN - tris - tid is more common .
The four - syllable variant IN - tur - uh - sting , once the preferred pronunciation , is now much less common than the syncopated IN - tris - ting .
The somewhat overpronounced IN - tur - ES - ting never had great currency .
Speakers who normally say IN - tris - ting will sometimes use it for emphasis or ironically , drawing out the syllables , as in the stock phrase very interesting .
Avoid pronouncing interesting as if it were spelled inneresting .
The t of inter- must be preserved at all costs !
Also do n’t say IN - tur - sting , as if the word were spelled intersting .
These are both beastly mispronunciations .

Jaguar JAG - wahr .
WNW Guide ( 1984 ) , which gives JAG - wahr , adds that “ JAG - yoo - ahr is occasionally heard . ”
Not in standard American speech it is n’t — nor , for that matter , in standard British speech , where the pronunciation is JAG - yoo - ur ( swallow the r ) .
I have heard JAG - yoo - ahr in commercials for the British luxury car of that name , where it struck me as yet another example of the vocal affectation common in ads for upscale products .
Apparently Madison Avenue thinks the average American consumer associates affluence and prestige with fake British accents or an affected Continental intonation .
American speakers should heed the advice of Opdycke ( 1939 ) : “ The u is pronounced w .
Do n’t say jag ’ you are , but jag ’ wahr .
There are two syllables , not three . ”
And for goodness ’ sake do n’t say JAG - wyr ( - wyr like wire ) , which my wife reported hearing from a wildlife conservationist interviewed on NPR recently .
That ’s a truly beastly mispronunciation .

M- W 10 ( 1993 ) gives three variants : KAR - ee-OH - kee , a reasonable anglicization and the most commonly heard pronunciation ; kuh - ROH - kee , a clumsy loutish pronunciation and an abomination in both English and Japanese ; and KAH - rah - OH - kay , an approximation of the Japanese .
RHWC ( 1997 ) gives one pronunciation : KAR - ee -OH - kee .

Ketchup KECH - u p.
“ The word , however spelled , ” writes Evans ( 1959 ) , is “ an attempt to present in English the Malayan word kechap ( sauce ) , which , in turn , seems to have been an attempt to present a Chinese phrase in Malayan . ”
The Chinese is ke-tsiap or ketsiap , which Shaw ( 1972 ) translates as “ pickled - fish brine ” and Random House II ( 1987 ) says is akin to Chinese words for eggplant and juice .
Ketchup is without question the dominant spelling today .
Current dictionaries list catsup and catchup as alternative spellings but fail to note that while the former is still fairly common the latter is rarely used by anyone over the age of ten .
Regardless of how you prefer to spell the word , or what the label on your favorite brand says , the pronunciation most commonly heard is KECH - u p .
The alternative KACH - u p , based on the spelling catchup , is less common but acceptable .
The variant KAT -s u p , based on the spelling catsup , is sometimes heard , and dictionaries politely list it in good standing .
To my ear , though , KAT -s u p has a look - at - me quality that makes me wonder if the speaker expects to be congratulated for demonstrating a preference for the alternative spelling

Laboratory LAB - ruh - TOR - ee or LAB - uh - ruh - TOR -ee .
The British stress the second syllable , luh - BOR - uh - tree .
Do n’t say LAB - ur - TOR - ee ( like labbertory ) or LAB - uh - TOR - ee ( like labbatory ) .
These are beastly mispronunciations .
Some older speakers may insist that only the five - syllable LAB - uh - ruh - TOR - ee is correct , and that the four syllable LAB - ruh - TOR - ee — the result of syncope ( SING - kuh - pee ) , the loss or omission of sounds or letters from the middle of a word — is careless .
This is a misconception .
The four - syllable pronunciation is listed first in Kenyon & Knott ( 1949 ) , American College ( 1952 ) , and Random House II ( 1987 ) , and is preferred by Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) , the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) , and WNW Guide ( 1984 ) .

Library LY - brer-ee .
Do n’t say LY - ber -ee , as if the word were spelled liberry .
There is no berry in library .
The mispronunciation LY - ber -ee , according to M - W 9 ( 1985 ) and 10 ( 1993 ) , is heard “ from educated speakers , including college presidents and professors , as well as with somewhat greater frequency from less educated speakers . ”
That is the kind of insidious factoid that makes one view what little usage advice today ’s dictionaries dispense with a skeptical and cynical eye .
If a few college presidents and professors say LY - ber -ee , does that somehow make it less beastly ?
Are those anomalous academics paragons of elocution ?
Should we now emulate them and their bedfellows in beastliness , the “ less educated speakers ” ?
I have been involved in public library advocacy in San Diego since 1988 and have served on that city ’s Board of Library Commissioners since 1993 .
Consequently , I have spent countless hours discussing library issues , campaigning for libraries , attending city council meetings , appearing on radio talk shows , and listening to the testimony of hundreds of people from all walks of life , and in all that time , and all that talk I could count on my ten fingers the number of people — educated and not- so - well - educated — I have heard who said LY - ber-ee .
The fact is , most children in literate homes are admonished at an early age not to say LY - ber -ee , in the same way they are admonished not to say puhsketty for spaghetti , cinnamon for synonym , or pacific for specific .
Let ’s be honest here : in anyone older than twelve , LY - ber -ee is certain evidence of sloppy speech habits and inadequate education .
I do n’t doubt that Merriam - Webster ’s files , as they assert , contain LY - ber - ee citations from educated speakers .
But when an educated person says LY - ber - ee the plain truth is that he or she loses credibility in others ’ eyes ( or ears as it were ) .
Some well - educated people do speak poorly , but they are generally exceptions , and most of their mistakes involve difficult rather than common words .
If your college professor , or your child ’s professor , said LY - ber - ee — or perfesor , for that matter — would n’t you raise a concerned eyebrow ?
The note in Random House II ( 1987 ) and RHWC ( 1997 ) seems closer to the truth : “ [ LY - ber - ee ] is more likely to be heard from less educated or very young speakers and is often criticized . ”
The variant LY - bruh - ree , though chiefly British , is also standard in American speech .
Properly , library , should have three syllables , but a two syllable variant , LY - bree , occurs in educated and is listed in good standing in some current dictionaries .

Machination MAK - i - NAY - sh i n .
Do not say MASH - i - NAY - sh i n .
Properly , there is no mash in machination .
The ch should be pronounced like k , as in Machiavelli , not as in machine .
This word entered English in the 15th century .
From the time that dictionaries began indicating pronunciation in the 18th century until the 20th century , authorities countenanced only one pronunciation : MAK - i - NAY - sh i n .
The MASH - variant arose sometimes in the mid-20th century , based on false analogy with machine , a word that Walker ( 1791 ) notes is exceptional for preserving the French –sheen for –chine .
Webster 3 ( 1961 ) was the first to recognize MASH - i - NAY - sh i n , but the variant appeared preceded by that dictionary ’s infamous Obelus of Opprobrium , an esoteric mark [ ÷ ] used to indicate a controversial pronunciation , one that occurs in educated speech but that many find unacceptable .
( The reader of this book , who presumably wishes to speak well and avoid pronunciations that other good speakers find objectionable , may safely assume that any pronunciation in a Meriam - Webster dictionary that is labeled with an obelus [ ÷ ] is best avoided . )
The lure of the false analogy with machine was irresistible for many , however , and the MASH - variant has since proliferated .
It now appears after the traditional pronunciation in three of the four major current American dictionaries .
However , WNW 3 ( 1997 ) sanctions only MAK - i - NAY - sh i n , which is preferred by Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) , WNW Guide ( 1984 ) , the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) , Everyday Reader ’s ( 1985 ) , and Burchfield ( 1996 ) .
Careful speakers should make an extra effort to hold the line on this word .

Medieval MEE - dee - EE -v u l or MED - ee - EE -v u l .
Medieval should be pronounced in four syllables .

These relatively recent and unfortunately rather common corruptions are best avoided — especially mid-EE -v u l , which manages also to mispronounce the first syllable .
You may begin the word either with MEE - or MED - .
The former , which is my preference , is the traditional American pronunciation ; the latter is originally British .

Nausea NAW - zee -uh or NAW - shuh ; nauseate NAW - zee - AYT ; nauseous NAW - sh u s .
The nightmarish thought of attempting to navigate a safe course through all the variant pronunciations for these words that have been heard in educated speech and recorded in 20th - century dictionaries is enough to make a pronunciation maven sick to his stomach .
( Current sources list from three to five variants for each word . )
Suffice it to say that the pronunciations recommended above are in widespread cultivated use , listed in current dictionaries , and preferred by various authorities .
For nauseous , evidence indicates that NAW - sh u s now prevails in American speech ; for the others it ’s a toss - up .

Niche NICH .
“ French no longer , ” says Holt ( 1937 ) .
“ Rhyme it with ditch . ”
OED 2 ( 1989 ) traces niche back to 1611 .
Since at least the mid-18th century the anglicized NICH has been preferred in cultivated speech .
Walker ( 1791 ) preferred NICH , and it is the only pronunciation countenanced by Worcester ( 1860 ) , Funk & Wagnalls Standard ( 1897 ) , the Century ( 1914 ) , OED 1 ( 1928 ) , Webster 2 ( 1934 ) , American College ( 1952 ) , and RHWC ( 1997 ) .
Orthoepists who prefer NICH include Ayres ( 1894 ) , Phyfe ( 1926 ) , Vizetelly ( 1929 ) , Opdycke ( 1939 ) , Kenyon and Knott ( 1949 ) , Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) , WNW Guide ( 1984 ) , and the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) .
Need I say more ?
Yes .
This word ’s long history has yielded two alternative pronunciations , NEESH and NISH .
The latter is eccentric , the former is pseudo - French , and both are best avoided .
NISH , which arose sometime in the 19th century , was stigmatized by Ayres and Opdycke and ignored by other authorities .
Webster 3 ( 1961 ) lists it , labeling it infrequent , but it does not appear in any current dictionaries .
WNW 3 ( 1997 ) calls NEESH British ( OED 2 does list it after NICH ) , but I have heard many un -British speakers use it — for example , Ed Koch , the former New York City mayor turned TV judge .*
American Heritage 3 ( 1992 ) sanctions NEESH as an alternative , but careful speakers would be wise to heed M - W 10 ( 1993 ) , which gives priority to NICH and labels NEESH with an obelus [ ÷ ] , indicating that it “ is considered by some to be objectionable . ”
I would argue that those “ some ” are in fact many , and those many are cultivated speakers who defend their traditional NICH .

Nuclear N( Y ) OO - klee-ur .
For Pete ’s sake , do n’t say NOO - kyuh - lur .
In his introduction to the fourth edition of the NBC Handbook of Pronunciation ( 1984 ) , veteran broadcaster and language commentator Edwin Newman remarks that when the nuclear age began in August 1945 , so did the nucular age .
Ever since nuclear entered the national vocabulary ( a hundred years after entering in the 1840s ) it has been mispronounced by millions of educated and otherwise careful speakers , including scientists , lawyers , professors , and presidents of the United States .
According to Newman , Dwight D. Eisenhower “ could not get it right ” ; Jimmy Carter , who had been an officer aboard nuclear - powered submarines , pronounced it NOO - kee - ur ; and Walter Mondale , in his 1984 bid for the presidency , repeatedly said NOO - kyuh - lur .
“ The word , correctly pronounced , ” writes Newman , “ somehow is too much for a fair part of the population , and education and experience seem to have nothing to do with it . ”
In The Diabolical Dictionary of Modern English , R.W. Jackson dryly echoes that sentiment by defining nuclear simply as “ nucyaler . ”
Newman ’s and Jackson ’s cynicism reminds me of a debate I once heard between William F. Buckley , Jr. , and the philosopher Mortimer Adler on whether everyone is inherently “ ineducable . ”
Of course , Adler , as a teacher , was of the former opinion , and Buckley , who earns his living trying to make his ideological opponents look hopelessly dull and impervious to illumination , was of the latter .
I choose to believe that anyone in the possession of physiologically normal organs of speech and at least half a brain is capable of pronouncing nuclear correctly .
As R.W. Burchfield ( 1996 ) points out , “ the spectacular blunder of pronouncing [ nuclear ] as if it were spelled nuc - u - lar ” is the result of a tempting misassociation with the many words ending in - ular ( circular , particular , cellular , secular , molecular , jocular , avuncular , etc. ) .
This error is one of the ear and eye more than the tongue , and it has persisted not because it is too difficult for some to say N ( Y ) OO - klee - ur but because they do not heed the spelling and hear the difference between the proper and improper pronunciations — which brings us to the matter of correction .
Those who do hear the mispronunciation and who say the word right ( still a substantial majority of us , I think ) are understandably reluctant to correct those who do not .
Can you imagine , as Edwin Newman puts it , “ how other and lesser members of the Carter administration found it tactful to pronounce [ nuclear ] during Cabinet meetings , ” when President Carter and Vice President Mondale were mangling the word , albeit unwittingly at every turn ?*
In Shaw ’s Pygmalion , the arrogant dialectician Henry Higgins “ experiments ” without the slightest compunction on his social inferior , the “ guttersnipe ” Liza Doolittle , teaching her to speak Received Standard English so he can win a bet .
But who else feels comfortable correcting the pronunciation of anyone but a child without being asked to do so ?
It is a tricky matter even to correct family members and friends , and so with a neighbor , acquaintance , or coworker , most of us will not — and should not — presume to offer an unsolicited opinion .
( Writing a book on the subject is different , for a book lays open its opinions only to those who freely choose to read it , and who are equally free to accept or reject the advice it contains without compromising their dignity . )
On the other hand , we should and do reserve the right , in matter of language , to speak as we fit , to decide for ourselves what is acceptable and unacceptable , and to pass tacit judgment on our peers .
When I began writing this book nearly every person with whom I discussed its contents asked ( and in some cases implored ) me to decry .
NOO - kyuh - lur , which made me wonder whether it might the Most Disdained and Detestable Beastly Mispronunciation in the language .
People who care at all about how words are pronounced ( with the expectation of linguist and lexicographers ) seem to reserve their most vehement antipathy for NOO - kyuh - lur and it comes as no surprise to me that a whopping 99 percent of the usage panel of Morris & Morris Harper Dictionary of Contemporary Usage ( 1985 ) condemned it .
In usage notes devoted to a lame defense of the mispronunciation , M - W 10 ( 1993 ) and RHWC ( 1997 ) both admit that NOO - kyuh - lur is “ disapproved of by many , ” yet by just how many it is impossible to determine .
On behalf of the indeterminate many who pronounce the word correctly , then , I appeal to the inadvertent many who do not : listen , and be errant no longer .
Molecular comes from molecule , and particular comes from particle , but there is no nucule to support nucular .
Nuclear comes from nucleus — N ( Y ) OO - klee - us — which is almost never mispronounced .
If you can say nucleus and you can nuke ( the informal verb meaning to attack with nuclear weapons or , humorously , to microwave ) , then the proper pronunciation of nuclear is but a suffix away .

Obscure uhb - SKYUUR .
The ob - in obscure is properly pronounced like ab - in about .
Lately there has been a tendency among educated speakers to overpronounce this unstressed ob - and say ahb - SKYUUR ( ahb- rhyming with slob ) .
This overly audible ob - is fastidious to a fault and unnecessary .
Although American Heritage 3 ( 1992 ) and M - W 10 ( 1993 ) now list the ahb- variant first , WNW 3 ( 1997 ) gives priority to the established uhb- , and Webster 2 ( 1934 ) , American College ( 1952 ) , WNW Guide ( 1984 ) , and RHWC ( 1997 ) countenance only uhb - .

Official uh - FISH - u l .
Do n’t say oh - FISH - u l .
Some speakers think it sounds more uh - FISH - u l to say oh - FISH - u l. , with the initial o long , as in no .
This is an overpronunciation .
Modern phoneticians call the initial vowel sound in this word a schwa ( SHWAH ) .
Lexicographers of the 19th and early 20th century called it “ obscure . ”
All that means is that the first syllable of official , because it is not stressed , is pronounced like the a in ago , not like the o in open .

Often AWF - i n or AHF - i n .
Do not pronounce the t .
Before I give you my two cents on the t in often , let ’s take a look at what various authorities have said about it since the late 18th century .
John Walker ( 1791 ) , whose Critical Pronouncing Dictionary was one of the most respected and popular references both in England and America well into the 19th century , declared that “ in often and soften the t is silent . ”
“ The sounding of the t , ” proclaims the legendary H.W. Fowler in Modern English Usage ( 1926 ) , “ which as the OED says is ‘ not recognized by the dictionaries , ’ is practised by two oddly consorted classes — the academic speakers who affect a more precise enunciation than their neighbours …& the uneasy half - literates who like to prove that they can spell … . ”
“ The t in glisten is silent , even as it is in castle and often , ” says Frank H. Vizetelly ( 1929 ) , editor of Funk & Wagnalls New Standard ( 1913 ) , “ yet one occasionally hears pedants and provincials pronounce them [ GLIS - t e n ] and [ AWF - t e n ] .
No pronouncing dictionary with a reputation to lose ever sounds the t in these words . ”
“ You do n’t want a t in here any more than in soften , ” advises Alfred H. Holt ( 1937 ) .
Webster 2 ( 1934 ) , which sanctions only AWF - i n , notes that “ the pronunciation [ AWF -t i n ] , until recently generally considered as more or less illiterate , is not uncommon among the educated in some sections , and is often used in singing . ”
According to Random House II ( 1987 ) ,
OFTEN was pronounced with a t- sound until the 17th century , when a pronunciation without the ( t ) came to predominate in the speech of the educated , in both North America and Great Britain , and the earlier pronunciation fell into disfavor .
Common use of a spelling pronunciation has since restored the ( t ) for many speakers , and today [ AWF - i n ] and [ AWF -t i n ]… exist side by side .
Although it is still sometimes criticized , OFTEN with a ( t ) is now so widely heard from educated speakers that it has become fully standard once again .
“ Nowadays , ” says R.W. Burchfield ( 1996 ) , editor of the OED 2 ( 1989 ) , “ many standard speakers use both [ AWF - i n ] and [ AWF -t i n ] , but the former pronunciation is the more common of the two .
What is going on here ?
After two hundred years of censure , has the t in often scratched and clawed its way back into acceptability ?
I would caution those who might be consoled by the comments of Random House II and Burchfield to heed the admonitions of the past and avoid pronouncing the t. Current dictionaries , including Random House II , do not give priority to AWF -t i n , and it is much less common in educated speech and far more often disapproved of by cultivated speakers — particularly teachers of English , drama , and speech — than Random House II makes it appear .
In 1932 the English lexicographer Henry Cecil Wyld called AWF -t i n “ vulgar ” and “ sham - refined , ” and today the bad odor of class - conscious affectation still clings to it as persistently as ever .
As if that were not enough , analogy is entirely unsupportive : no one pronounces the t in soften , listen , fasten , moisten , hasten , chaste , christen , and Christmas — so , once and for all , let ’s do away with the eccentric AWF -t i n .

Parental puh-REN -t u l .
Do not say PAR - e n-t u l .

Pathos PAY - thahs ( - thahs rhyming with pos in posse ) or PAY - thaws ( rhymes with play - toss ) .
The first pronunciation has the greater authority and is recommended .
In pathos , bathos , and ethos , the first vowel should have its long sound ( PAY - , BAY - , and EE - ) and - os is preferably pronounced –ahs , with a short o as in hot and jostle .
PAY - thahs is preferred by Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) , the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) , Everyday Reader ’s ( 1985 ) , and Barnhart ( 1988 ) , it is the only pronunciation in Oxford American ( 1980 ) , Funk & Wagnalls Standard ( 1980 ) , and OED 2 ( 1989 ) , and it listed first by all four major current American dictionaries .
These same four also recognize the alternative PAY - thaws ; only two list the variant PAY - thohs ( with a long o as in dose ) , which is not recommended .

Patriot PAY - tree- i t .
According to Burchfield ( 1996 ) , the British say PAY - tree- i t. ( PA - as in pat ) or PAY - tree- i t ( PAY - like pay ) , “ with the first perhaps slightly more common . ”
In the U.S. PAY - tree - i t rules the roost .
Current American dictionaries also recognize the variant PAY - tree - aht ( - aht rhyming with dot ) .
I have never heard anyone use that pronunciation , which strikes me as ridiculously exaggerated and pretentious , like saying chari-aht for chariot or idi-aht for idiot .
Americans and Brits may differ on how to pronounce the first syllable of patriot , but we are happy to agree that the last syllable has an obscure o , as in riot and carrot .

Pecan pi-KAHN ( - KAHN rhyming with John ) or pi-KAN ( - KAN like can ) .
These are the pronunciations most often listed , and sometimes the only ones listed .

Other recognized variants , in descending order of frequency listed , include PEE - kan , which the evidence of my ears tells me is chiefly Eastern and which Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) prefer , and Pee - KAHN which my ears tell me is chiefly Southern .
Do n’t say ( ugh ) PEEK - i n .

Porsche PORSH .
In my experience , how you pronounce this word / name depends largely on whether you own the automobile in question .
Porsche does not appear in any of my references , so I must rely solely on the evidence of my ears , which tells me that those who own a Porsche ( or wish they did ) tend to prefer the disyllabic POR - shuh , while those who do n’t ( and could not care less ) tend to prefer the monosyllabic PORSH .
Because the great majority of us do n’t own ( or aspire to own ) a Porsche , I recommend the monosyllabic pronunciation as less ostentatious .

It is not !
It ’s beastly , and no other dictionary countenances it .
Finally , do n’t say PRES - uh-d i nt , with an s as in press .
I have heard numerous newscasters make this mistake , and it irks me that they do not realize they are confusing the pronunciations of president ( z for s ) and precedent ( s for c ) .
The s in president should have the sound of z , and a peek into any dictionary will prove it .

Rabid RAB -id .
Do not say RAY - bid .
Rabid and rabies have different pronunciations .
Rabid properly has a short a , as in rabbit .
Rabies has a long a , as in ray .
The beastly mispronunciation of RAY - bid , with the long a of ray , is quite recent ; M - W 7 ( 1972 ) is the first of my sources to record it .
Two current dictionaries list RAY - bid — M - W 10 ( 1993 ) and WNW 3 ( 1997 ) — but both label it infrequent , and the two other leading current American dictionaries , American Heritage 3 ( 1992 ) and RHWC ( 1997 ) , sanction only the proper pronunciation , RAB -id .
Be careful : this recent RAY - bid is now running wild .

American dictionaries gave priority to RAY - sh i n until the 1940s , but since then RASH - i n has been listed first ( as it is in the four leading current American dictionaries ) .

Repeat ( verb , noun , adjective ) r i - PEET .
The careful speaker always stresses the word repeat , in all parts of speech , on the second syllable , never on the first .
When you ask someone to say something again , you say “ Would you please repeat that ? ” ( never repeat that again , which is redundant ) .
When speaking of a TV or radio show that comes on the air again , you say it is a rebroadcast , a rerun , or a rePEAT , not a REpeat .
And when using the word in its newest sense , as an adjective , you say that it ’s a rePEAT performance , not a REpeat performance , and that someone is a rePEAT offender , not a REpeat offender .
First - syllable stress for the noun repeat dates back at least to the 1930s , when Opdycke ( 1939 ) sternly objected to it .
His disapproval is shared by many cultivated speakers today , apparently , for only one of the four leading current American dictionaries recognizes REE - peet as an alternative pronunciation , while the other three sanction only r i - PEET .
Larsen & Walker ( 1930 ) point out that most disyllabic words beginning with re- have their stress on the second syllable , “ whether used as verbs , nouns , or adjectives ” — for example , refrain , relate , release , remove , reply , repeal , report , request , respect , result , retreat , return , revenge , revolt , and reward .
The word repeat belongs squarely in this category and is a long standing exception to the rule for disyllabic nouns and verbs discussed under decrease .
See also recess , recourse , redress , and research , which traditionally have their accent on the second syllable but which in varying degrees have been bucking the trend .

Route ROOT or ROWT .
ROOT has been preferred or listed first in dictionaries since the mid-19th century .
ROWT , however , has a long history as ROOT , and was preferred by many of the earliest authorities .
In the first half of the 20th century ROWT was often labeled colloquial , provincial , or military ; it is now well established in various engineering , transportation , delivery , and sales contexts .
I prefer ROOT for all senses of the word route , but it is difficult to fashion an argument that goes further than saying that is how I was taught to pronounce it , that is how most educated speakers around me said it , and that is the pronunciation that feels right and cultivated to me .
In my vocabulary , route will always be ROOT and rout ROWT , but many speakers nowadays prefer to pronounce both words ROWT .
Since it cannot be stated unequivocally that one pronunciation of rout is right and the other wrong , I present the following historical evidence , which you can use to make up your mind , bolster your case , or live and let live , as you prefer .
In his Critical Pronouncing Dictionary of 1791 , the English elocutionist John Walker prefers ROOT but notes that the word “ is often pronounced so as to rhyme with doubt by respectable speakers . ”
In a later edition , Walker changed his course .
“ Upon a more accurate observation of the best usage , ” he wrote , “ I must give the preference to [ ROWT ] … notwithstanding its coincidence in sound with another word of a different meaning ; the fewer French sounds of this diphthong we have in our language the better . ”
Worcester ( 1860 ) , who prefers ROOT , says , “ Most of the orthopeists more recent than Walker give the preference to the pronunciation [ ROOT ] . ”
Ayres ( 1894 ) says hat “ there is abundant authority for pronouncing the word rowt ; but this pronunciation is now very generally considered inelegant . ”
Vizetelly ( 1929 ) says the “ best modern usage pronounces the word as if written root , ” and Opdycke ( 1939 ) assigns ROWT to “ colloquial and provincial usage . ”
Funk & Wagnalls Standard ( 1897 ) countenances only ROOT , but the Century ( 1889 - 1914 ) sanctions ROWT as an alternative .
Webster 2 ( 1934 ) says that ROOT “ is now the generally accepted pronunciation , but in certain special cases rout ( ou in out ) prevails , as in military use , among railroad men , and , colloquially , of a delivery route . ”
Since then ROWT has gained a good deal of ground , but ROOT still appears to hold the lead among educated speakers , and all four major current American dictionaries list in first .
Morris & Morris ( 1985 ) observe that “ people like Army engineers , bus and plane dispatchers , and other professionally engaged in planning routes tend to pronounce route so it rhymes with ‘ out . ’
Pronouncing it as if it were spelled ‘ root ’ is , however , equally acceptable .
In Watching My Language ( 1997 ) , William Safire writes , “ [ President George ]
Bush frowned on ‘ the tax - and - spend route , which he pronounced ‘ ROWT . ’
That is not incorrect … .
Most of us , however , have come to use ‘ ROOT ’ to mean ‘ way , itinerary , journey , map ’ spelled route , and pronounced the same as the root of a plant .
We use ‘ ROWT ’ to pronounce the word spelled rout , meaning “ resounding defeat ; disorderly flight from battle ; electoral debacle ’ ” [ p. 34 ] .
It is perhaps worth noting that if Safire received any letters objecting to this assessment when it first appeared in his column The New York Times Magazine , he does not reprint them in his book .

Senile SEE-nyl. ( like see Nile ) .
Do not say SEN - yl .
Senile is accented on the first syllable , which rhymes with glee , and the second syllable should rhyme with file .
Formerly the word was sometimes pronounced with a short i , SEE - nil , second syllable rhyming with pill .
In the 20th century this variant has gradually faded from the dictionaries and since the 1960s a new one has risen in its place : SEN - yl ( SEN - as in send , - yl like aisle ) .
The evidence indicates it is a homegrown American variant .
It may have been a pedanticism based on the source of the word , the Latin senilis , pronounced se-NEE - lis , which comes in turn from senex , old , pronounced SEN -eks .
Of course this “ etymological pronunciation ” ignores the more pertinent fact that the English word is divided se · nile , which calls for a long e in the stressed first syllable .
At any rate , the eccentric SEN - yl first appeared in Webster 3 ( 1961 ) labeled “ appreciably less frequent ” ; today all four major dictionaries list it as an alternative , with two labeling it less common .
OED 2 ( 1989 ) and Jones ( 1991 ) , both British authorities , give only the traditional SEE - nyl , which , despite its venerable age — it was the preference of John Walker ( 1791 ) and other orthopeists of his day — shows no signs of infirmity or dotage .

Syrup : SIR - u p or SUR - u p .
John Walker ( 1791 ) and Noah Webster ( 1828 ) , among other early authorities , preferred the pronunciation SUH - r u p ( first syllable as in supper ) .
In the 20th century , this was modified to SUR - u p ( first syllable like sir ) .
Though older authorities preferred SIR - up , Webster 2 ( 1934 ) noted that syrup “ is nearly pronounced [ SUR - u p ] by makers of maple syrup ” and Holt ( 1937 ) reluctantly acknowledged that the first syllable was “ headed in the same direction ” as stir , stirrup , and squirrel .
Today SUR - u p ( my preference ) is perfectly acceptable , and “ both pronunciations seem to be heard with equal frequency , ” says WNW Guide ( 1984 ) .

Canadian also tuh - MAT -oh .
I have a wonderful cartoon above my desk that captures everything I could say in ten books on pronunciation .
It shows two scowling men standing back - to - back at daybreak .
Each is holding a basket of tomatoes , one marked tomato , the other marked to - mah - to .
In a moment , one presumes , they will engage in a duel to a saucy death .
My mother , having grown up outside of Boston , has always said tuh - MAH - toh , even after fifty - odd years of living in New York City , where just about everyone says tuh - MAY - toh , and after forty - odd years of living with my father , who grew up in Indiana and also says tuh - MAY - toh .
Miraculously , they have managed to get along , though duels over language , and language duels ( at twenty paces ) , have been known to break out .
The majority of Americans say tuh - MAY - toh — which , despite my mother ’s formidable influence , is my pronunciation , but it is clear that the tuh - MAH - toh sayers are not going to give in ( they ’ll just die out , I suppose ) , and there is no reason why they should .
Not only is it what they grew up with and are accustomed to saying , it is also a matter of pride for many of them .
So if you are a New Englander who says tuh - MAH - toh , or perhaps a Southerner who prefers tuh - MAH - toh , or if you are a Brit trying to fathom the ( from your perspective ) nasal - twanged U.S. of A. , by all means do your thing .
Just do n’t criticize the rest of us for saying tuh - MAY - toh .
If you lay off , we ’ll lay off .
Besides , there are a lot more of us than there are of you .
A warning for all speakers : do not slur the last syllable into an –uh or –ur sound .
In his book On Language ( 1980 ) , William Safire prints a letter from Liz Smith of The York Daily News :
In regard to “ You say potato , I say potahto ” there is a joke that when this unusual song was sung in English theater auditions , nobody got it because the singers invariably sang it : “ You say potahto and I say potahto , You say tomahto and I say tomahto… . ”
But when I was at the University of Texas , we had our own linguistic joke that went like this : “ You say potato and I say pertayter , You say tomato and I say termayter ! ”

Tribunal try - BYOO -n u l .
Pronounce tri- like try ; and stress the second syllable , never the first .
The noun tribune is properly accented on the first syllable , TRIB - yoon , but when it occurs in the names of newspapers one often hears second - syllable stress .

Vacuum VAK - yoom .
With the advent of the vacuum cleaner in the early 20th century the three - syllable VAK - yoo- u m swiftly became endangered .
Apparently it survives in Britain — OED 2 ( 1989 ) and Jones ( 1991 ) prefer it — but in American speech it is as rare as a spotted owl .
Nevertheless , current American dictionaries all list it and will probably continue doing so for several generations after the poor creature is extinct .

Vase VAYS ( rhymes with case and lace ) or VAYZ ( rhymes with haze ) .
VAYS has been the prevailing American pronunciation since the days of Noah Webster , though VAYZ is just as venerable and is used by many cultivated speakers today .
Both pronunciations were once widely heard in cultivated speech in England .
In his Critical Pronouncing Dictionary , John Walker ( 1791 ) prefers VAYZ but remarks that
Mr. [ Thomas ] Sheridan [ 1780 ] has pronounced this word so has to rhyme with base , case &c .
I have uniformly heard it pronounced with the s like z , and sometimes , by people of refinement , with the a like aw ; but this , being too refined for the general ear , is now but seldom heard .
OED 2 ( 1989 ) notes that Jonathon Swift ( 1731 ) rhymed vase with face , and Lord Byron ( 1822 ) and Ralph Waldo Emerson ( 1847 ) rhymed it with grace .
The pronunciations VAHZ and VAWZ , noted by Walker above , are British .
The former is the prevailing pronunciation , but the latter “ has still some currency in England , ” says OED 2 .
In an American speaker , say Morris & Morris ( 1985 ) , VAHZ “ is a mark of affectation . ” I agree .
In You Do n’t Say !
Alfred H. Holt ( 1937 ) offers this amusing bit of verse :
Some greet with lusty “ Rah ”s A reference to a vase .
Another bares his claws
At folks who do n’t say vase .
But many use the phrase , “ Please put these in a vase , ” While still a stronger case We now can make a vase .

Visa VEE - zuh , not VEE - suh .
The s is properly soft , as in rose .
In recent years , more and more people have been pronouncing this word VEE - suh ( with s as in sun ) , no doubt in part because of the numerous TV commercials for the popular credit card , in which the voice - overs habitually mispronounce it VEE - suh .
Webster 3 ( 1961 ) was the first to recognize the variant , marking it “ appreciably less common . ”
Today it is unfortunately quite common , although two of the four major current American dictionaries — American Heritage 3 ( 1992 ) and RHWC ( 1997 ) — do not sanction it , and OED 2 ( 1989 ) also lists only VEE - zuh .
Visa came into English from French around 1830 .
In French , a single s between vowels is soft — pronounced like English z in maze or s in rose ( e.g. , maison ) — and this has been the established way of pronouncing the s in visa since the word entered English .
VEE - suh , with a hard s as in vista , is appropriate in Spanish , but not in English .
Be sure to put some pizzazz in your visa .
Say VEE - zuh .

Wassail WAHS’l ( rhymes with fossil and jostle ) .
Some speakers put a sail in wassail and say WAH - sayl or wah - SAYL , and these variants can be heard in certain old Christmas songs .
Others pronounce the first syllable with a flat a as in wag : WAS’l or WAS - ayl — so say the dictionaries , anyway , though I have never heard these variants .
All these pronunciations , along with WAHS’l , are represented in 20th - century dictionaries .
However , the preponderance of authority from Walker ( 1791 ) to Worcester ( 1860 ) to Webster 2 ( 1934 ) to the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) favors WAHS’l , and all four major current American dictionaries list this pronunciation first .
Wassailing — as in

With WITH ( th as in this and there ) , not WITH ( rhymes with pith and myth ) .
This is an avowed pet peeve of mine , and by no means do all authorities agree with me on this punctilio , though many do .
I believe firmly that in cultivated speech , with and words beginning with it — withal ( wi th - AWL ) , withdraw , wither , withhold , within , without , withstand — should be pronounced with the “ voiced ” th of bathe , lather , and rather , and not with the “ voiceless ” th of path and bath .
One advantage of following this rule is stronger , clearer speech .
The voiced th is resonant ; the voiceless th is lispy and weak .

Xenophobia ZEN - uh - FOH - bee - uh , not ZEE - nuh - FOH - bee-uh .
Xenophobia , fear and hatred of foreigners or of anything strange or foreign , first appeared in print in 1919 .
Its antonym , xenomania ( ZEN - uh - MAY - nee - uh ) , an inordinate attachment to foreign things , was coined about 1879 but is rarely used today .
OED 1 ( 1928 ) recorded xenophobia as a nonce word and Webster 2 ( 1934 ) deemed it unworthy of its own entry , but both were kind enough to give its proper pronunciation : ZEN - uh - FOH - bee - uh , first syllable rhyming with men .
Until quite recently there was no confusion about this word .
People pronounced the first syllable ZEN - and dictionaries continued to record only that pronunciation .
Then one day , as the story goes , someone unfamiliar with the conventions of the language — probably a foreign spy — malevolently and methodically began to mispronounce the first syllable ZEE - .
Soon all the xenomaniacs — in particular those members of the literati who delight in finding new outlets for their xenophilia ( ZEN - uh - FIL - ee-uh ) , love of foreigners and foreign cultures — began copying this evil example , and the beastly mispronunciation ZEE - nun - FOH - bee -uh slipped into the dictionaries .
For those who like to keep a dossier on such events , the point of infiltration was M - W 8 ( 1975 ) .
No authority I am aware of favors this alien and erroneous ZEE - .
All four major current American dictionaries and WNW Guide ( 1984 ) give ZEN - priority , and Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) , the Quintessential Dictionary ( 1978 ) , the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) , Everyday Reader ’s ( 1985 ) , Barnhart ( 1988 ) , OED 2 ( 1989 ) , and Jones ( 1991 ) prefer it .

Yarmulke YAHR -m u l-kuh .
I grew up in New York City hearing Jews and gentiles alike pronounce this word YAH - muh - kuh , without an r and without an l , as if it were spelled yamaka .
This pure laziness and an affront to the word ’s linguistic and sacral tradition .
“ The caplet perched on the top of the head by observing Jewish males , ” says Leo Rosten in The Joys of Yinglish ( 1989 ) , is “ pronounced YAHR - m’l - keh , to rhyme with ‘ bar culpa . ’ ” YAHR -m ul - kuh is the preference of Lass & Lass ( 1976 ) , the NBC Handbook ( 1984 ) , Everyday Reader ’s ( 1985 ) , and Barnhart ( 1988 ) , and the first pronunciation in WNW Guide ( 1984 ) and three of the four major current American dictionaries .
Only M - W 10 ( 1993 ) gives priority to the uncultivated YAH - muh - kuh .

Yolk YOHK ( like yoke ) .
The spelling pronunciation YOHLK , with an audible l , was Noah Webster ’s preference in his dictionary of 1828 and the preference of several earlier English authorities .
This was undoubtedly due to the variant spelling yelk , pronounced YELK , which Dr. Johnson ( 1755 ) , Walker ( 1791 ) , and Smart ( 1836 ) favored .
Since Worcester ( 1860 ) , however , the spelling yolk and the pronunciation YOHK have prevailed , while yelk has disappeared and YOHLK has fallen into disfavor .
According to M - W 10 ( 1993 ) , YOHLK survives in the South among some cultivated speakers .

The craft and art of binding books by hand was vividly chronicled in an exhibition at Princeton University ’s Firestone Library .
Entitled " Hand Bookbindings : Plain and Simple to Grand and Glorious , " the exhibition ran from November 10 , 2002 through April 20 , 2003 in the Library ’s main gallery .
While conventional wisdom holds that books cannot be judged by their covers , visitors had a chance to do just that from the most humble of volumes to the most luxurious ; from the monastic manuscripts of the twelfth century to the special editions of the twentieth .
Now that the exhibition has run its course , it has been turned into an online display of over two hundred bindings .
They are divided thematically into twenty - six categories , listed above .

Ghimbi , Ethiopia --
First , the police threw Tesfaye into a dark cell .
Then , each day for 17 days , it was the same routine : Electric shocks on his legs and back , followed by beatings with rubber truncheons .
Four or five officers would then surround and kick him .
At last , a large bottle of water would be tied around his testicles .
He 'd pass out .
Tesfaye 's crime ?
Maybe it's that he refused to join the ruling party of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi .
He was accused of organizing street protests in late 2005 .
Police suspect he 's a member of a rebel group called the Oromo Liberation Front .
Tesfaye does n't know for sure because no court ever charged him with a crime .
" They took us turn by turn to a dark place , and they would shock us and say , ' What do you think now ?
You wo n't change your ways now ?
Do you want to be a member of our party now ? ' "
Tesfaye recalled of his time in prison early last year .
He refused to give his last name for fear of being rearrested .
Accounts like this are common in today 's Ethiopia .
Interviews with dozens of people across the country , coupled with testimony given to diplomats and human rights groups , paint a picture of a nation that jails its citizens without reason or trial , and tortures many of them -- despite government claims to the contrary .
Such cases are especially troubling because the U.S. government , a key Ethiopian ally , has acknowledged interrogating terrorism suspects in Ethiopian prisons , where some detainees were sent after being arrested in connection with Ethiopia 's invasion of Somalia in December .
There have been no reports that those jailed have been tortured .
The invasion ousted an Islamic movement accused of having ties to al Qaeda that threatened to topple an interim Somali government struggling to control the country .
The Bush administration maintains that Meles ' government , a leading partner in its war on terror in East Africa , is committed to democratic and human rights reform .
The government was severely criticized for a 2005 crackdown that saw tens of thousands of opposition members jailed and nearly 200 people killed following elections in which the opposition made major gains .
People across Ethiopia recounted stories of a government backsliding on human rights issues .
They told of confinement for days in tiny , dark cells with their hands bound 24 hours a day ; electric shocks ; beatings with rubber clubs ; police who held guns to prisoners ' heads ; mutilation or pain inflicted on the genitals .
" If you think differently , that is enough to put you on the side of the opposition , " said 34 - year - old Teferi , who recently was released from prison after two months without being charged with a crime .
" If you say , ' This is not right , this is right , it 's good to rule peacefully , ' if you talk something fair , it 's over for you because there is no fairness from them . "
Teferi said a police source told him that he was arrested because he played too much pingpong -- and that police suspected he was recruiting people to a rebel group while he played .
He said he was imprisoned at a police training camp called Sankele outside the city of Ambo , which the International Committee of the Red Cross has been barred from visiting .
Ethiopian officials dismiss stories of torture as lies , and have taken the further step of expelling everyone from foreign journalists to representatives of human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch .
Ethiopian reporters for the U.S. - financed Voice of America must work in secret for fear of harassment .
Bereket Simon , a top adviser to Meles , said it's in the interests of rights groups to lie about the situation , and he rejected the idea that torture occurs in Ethiopia .
" No way .
No way .
No way .
I think you know , these are prohibited by laws , by Ethiopian laws -- torture , any human treatments , " Bereket said .
" In fact , we have been improving on our prison standards .
We 've been working hard to train the police forces , the interrogators . "
U.S. officials say Washington 's close alliance with the government in Addis Ababa allows it to raise concerns about Ethiopia 's record privately .
The State Department is requesting more than $ 500 million for Ethiopian aid in fiscal 2008 , almost all of it for HIV / AIDS relief .
The United States trains Ethiopian troops , and the two governments have shared intelligence about Somalia .
U.S. Ambassador Donald Yamamoto said he wants to investigate claims of abuse , but warned against making allegations about Ethiopia 's actions without proof .
" There 's a lot of misinformation about Ethiopia -- I mean , it 's amazing , " Yamamoto said .
" The problem comes in trying to divide or separate what is fact and what 's fiction , and trying to keep an open mind on every issue .
...
There are problems , and we 're free to admit that , and the Ethiopians are open to admitting that as well . "
Ethiopia 's critics are skeptical of the government 's promises to improve its human rights record .
" Over the years , the more I see , the more I become convinced that not only does the government tolerate it , but I think they direct this kind of behavior , " said Ethiopian - born Theodros Dagne , a senior aide to Rep. Donald Payne , D - N.J. , a leading critic of Ethiopian practices on human rights .
European diplomats and employees of Western aid groups , speaking on condition of anonymity , said they keep quiet about abuses because they fear the government will freeze them out of aid work .
About 2.8 million of Ethiopia 's 75 million people depend on foreign food aid .
Washington 's steadfast support has led some Ethiopian opposition leaders to assert that Meles ' government has only been emboldened .
" We fully believe that the international community is not going to democratize this place -- it 's going to be the tough task of the Ethiopians , " said Beyene Petros , a lawmaker and leader of the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces , a coalition of opposition groups .
" Simply , the U.S. State Department 's or the U.S. government 's position on Ethiopia is that it's a friendly government , and how can you go and quarrel with your friend because somebody told on him ? "
The News Corporation , making one of its largest bets on the Internet , announced today that it is paying $ 580 million in cash to acquire Intermix Media Inc. , a Los Angeles - based company whose chief asset is MySpace.com , a Web site that is enjoying surging popularity with young audiences .
The acquisition 's price is sure to ignite debate about valuations and durability of new media companies because MySpace , the main attraction among Intermix 's 30 - odd Web sites , is only two years old .
MySpace.com is a youth - oriented music and " social networking " site that has grown to more than 16 million monthly users .
Its members spend hours on the site , exploring areas devoted to personal classifieds , music , blogs , video games and chat rooms .
Several prominent music groups , including the Black Eyed Peas , R.E.M. and Nine Inch Nails , have introduced their latest releases by streaming them on MySpace .
Also , major advertisers including Procter & Gamble and Sony Pictures have advertised on the site , and NBC ran a streaming preview of the comedy " The Office " earlier this year .
According to News Corporation , MySpace attracts the fifth - most page views of any Web site .
Forget VC Money , Fund Yourself
It was 1999 , at the height of the boom , a few months before the bust of April 2000 so he can be forgiven .
I stood before a crowd of entrepreneurs gathered at a hotel on Route 110 in Melville , on Long Island .
They 'd each paid $ 50 to come hear the collective wisdom of bankers , other entrepreneurs , lawyers , accountants , and venture capitalists .
I was the keynote speaker and before me stood a twenty - something entrepreneur with that look in his eye .
The look said it all .
He had the idea .
He was going to solve the problem .
He was going to be rich .
All he needed was the capital to make his idea -- putting free postcards in the checkout aisles of supermarkets ; postcards that were really ads -- graphically - enticing , hip images of Entenmanns 's chocolate donuts and Tony the Tiger -- but nonetheless ads .
He stood during the Q&A period and he told his story as a prelude to asking his question -- the question .
I braced myself :
" So , even though I 'm cash - flow positive , I can't even get a meeting with a VC .
Why is that ? "
I blew out the air from my lungs and surprised him with my response .
" Why do you want to sell half of your profitable business ? "
In 1999 , though , I knew the answer to my question .
After the huge run-up in the value public companies -- companies that had been backed by VCs -- entrepreneurs came to see venture funding as a requirement , the key to that elusive golden door behind which all happiness lay .
I went on .
" Look ' ¦this is your first business , right ? "
I turned to the audience , most of whom were in their mid-forties and fifties , " How many of you have run businesses before ? "
A few hands shot up .
I zeroed in one guy , your typical gray - haired exec .
He told us his first business -- his current business -- was manufacturing specialty airplane engine parts .
He 'd launched the business in the late 1970s after he'd left Grumman .
" And how did you raise the capital to get going ? "
He smiled ; he 'd just finished paying off the second mortgage he'd taken out to get going , he said .
I looked at the parts manufacturer , pointed to my young questioner still standing in the dark room , and said , " And what would you have done if your business had low - initial capital requirements and was cash - flow positive from the get - go ? "
He , and a bunch of his peers , burst out laughing .
My young entrepreneur was still puzzled .
I tried to explain .
" The best possible way to finance your business is from free cash flow .
If you can meet your capital needs without selling equity or without taking on personal debt , do it .
It 's that simple . "
Moreover , I continued , if growth continued the way it had -- he 'd done more than $ 3 million in revenue and $ 1 million in EBITDA in his first 18 months -- than he'd have a very valuable business ; something he should want to own as much of as possible .
But , as I said , he should be forgiven .
Given the amount of attention venture capital gets , it 's easy to assume that selling equity is the only , if not the best , way to raise capital .
But the truth is , even if you one day do need to sell equity , put off that moment as long as possible .
At the end of the talk , I grabbed my young friend and explained why I felt VCs were n't interested in his business ( the idea is easily replicated ; it 's labor - intensive to refill racks in checkout aisles -- which is why the magazine - rack business is dominated by a few large players .
It 's not scaleable .
Moreover , it 's unlikely the business by itself could go public so the only exit strategy is a trade sale and , at that moment in time , VCs were interested in finding businesses the public would buy . ) .
Naturally , he continued to pursue VC backing , without much luck .
When financing your business , look at all your options first ; look to your savings , look at your personal expenses and see if there are ways you can do without .
One VC I know used to ask prospective investees if they really felt they could afford to be an entrepreneur .
That 's partly a purely financial question ; can you really cut your expenses to the point that you could drastically reduce , or even forego altogether , your salary .
If not , are you sure that running your own business is right for you ?
Moreover , are there friends or family from whom you can borrow the initial capital to get your business launched ?
Often times , a wealthier parent , sibling , or relative is an ideal source of capital .
But be warned : borrowing from friends and family carries a huge emotional risk .
One woman I know has a challenging relationship with her now - retired father ; much of her adult life has been defined by a quest to seek his approval .
She recently took money from him as an investment ( he bought stock in her new company ; he did n't lend her money ) .
If her business fails , she will have an even more challenged relationship with her father .
Only borrow money ( or allow take an investment ) from friends and family if you 're absolutely certain they can afford to lose it all and that doing so will not jeopardize your relationships .
In the end , the best way to finance any business , and pay your bills , if - of course - out of cash flow .
That is , make the business pay as it goes .
Need to expand to take advantage of market conditions ?
Use your profits .
If you do n't have the profits , maybe you should n't be expanding .
Of course , that 's a simplification .
Many small business owners know that making a profit and receiving the cash that goes along with that profit are two different things .
There are a number of ways to use your accounts receivables to smooth out the an unpredictable cash flow .
Companies as diverse as American Express and UPS to your local bank all offer mechanisms that can help .
After worshipping at the Prayer Palace this morning , Hyacinthe Houghron will , as she does every second Sunday , stuff her tired green minivan with a small feast : six coolers of homemade soup , a mountain of sandwiches , cakes and sweets .
Loaded down with second - hand clothes pulled from the ceiling - high piles in her hair salon , she 'll give out the goods to homeless people on downtown Toronto 's grittiest streets .
Missions like this are n't cheap for people like her and other volunteers at the church .
" We 're poor folks , " says Houghron , describing the majority of the 3,000 - strong congregation who attend the spaceship - shaped church at Hwy .
400 and Finch Ave .
The hairdresser scrapes together $ 600 of her own money each month to keep up the program because the Prayer Palace – one of Canada 's largest evangelical churches – stopped running it five years ago .
Other charitable works , like a promised orphanage in Brazil , either dried up or never materialized .
Meanwhile , the three white pastors – Paul Melnichuk and his 40 - year - old twin sons , Tim and Tom – lead lavish lives in contrast to the mainly working - class black families that make up the bulk of the church .
Between them , the pastors have amassed a real estate fortune worth about $ 12 million .
Each owns a multi-million - dollar country estate north of Toronto ( Tim 's is worth as much as $ 5.5 million ) , they share a Florida vacation villa , and the pastors and their wives drive luxurious cars – among them a Porsche Cayenne SUV , a Lexus RX 330 SUV and a Mercedes - Benz CLK 320 convertible .
Congregants are largely unaware of the pastors ' extravagant lifestyles .
" Wow , " says Leslie Stewart , 63 , who works in a paint factory six days a week and gives 10 per cent of his income to the church .
" I never heard of anything like that .
But if I release my tithe and they misuse it , they have to face God . "
The Prayer Palace has a devoted congregation .
Most worshippers believe in tithing , the practice of donating 10 per cent of one 's income to the church , and each year they give a reported $ 3 million .
" The people love ( the Melnichuks ) , " Houghron says .
" Pastor Paul ... loves the Lord .
He does God 's work . "
In addition to personally funding the homeless program , Houghron – a staunch supporter of Pastor Paul – tithes and also gives him $ 100 to $ 200 cash for his birthday .
" He 's never given me gifts like that but he 's given me spiritual gifts , " says Houghron .
" He encourages the work I do for the homeless . "
The Prayer Palace offers several exuberant religious services each week .
Conducting them , combined with the pastor 's church - building efforts , qualifies the Prayer Palace as a charity under federal law , making the church exempt from taxes .
However , a continuing Star investigation into Canadian charities has found the church devotes little money to charitable work .
In fact , the church 's most recent financial statements show that only $ 9,443 was spent on " benevolent and charity " activities in 2005 .
The church 's annual " missions " fluctuate between $ 500 and $ 36,704 in the past few years .
The Star was unable to get access to the Prayer Palace 's internal documents , and so could not determine if money donated by congregants went into the pastors ' houses .
The church and the pastors refused requests for an interview .
In response to a series of written questions , the Star was told that the church exists " to point people to a better life through Jesus Christ . "
The church provided a long list of charitable works , including Houghron 's homeless work , which were counted as its own .
During sermons the pastors exhort worshippers to give generously if they want the Lord 's blessing .
" What 's half a million dollars to a congregation like this ?
Peanuts , " 72 - year - old Pastor Paul thundered one recent Sunday morning , asking members to help fund an " evangelical explosion " in Toronto .
In another sermon , he said : " Abraham received wealth , blessing and prosperity – not because he worked , but because he believed in a God that was bigger than the economy . "
The Canada Revenue Agency , which regulates charities , has a policy that forbids it from discussing specific charities .
In response to a general question , a CRA official said strict rules govern the use of charitable donations and assets .
People involved in a charity cannot financially benefit from their efforts .
Asked how the pastors could afford their lifestyle , Prayer Palace officials responded that the question " is not related to charities . "
In his sermons , Pastor Paul works hard to convey to his flock the notion that he and his family are simple people who shop at discount stores .
However , the Star found that the three pastors ' houses are extravagantly appointed .
Tim's King City house boasts nine - metre ceilings , a state - of - the - art , nine - seat home cinema , Italian onyx floors and a five - car garage , and was recently put on the market for $ 5.5 million .
What 's more , Pastor Paul and his twins fly to family reunions in a helicopter , and they frequently travel to their Florida vacation villa , which was built last year .
Church financial documents show a number of items related to the family 's recent flurry of activity in the U.S.
Those include a $ 1 - million transfer of Prayer Palace funds to a " Florida mission " during the same time the pastors built a Spanish - style waterfront home there and bought a small church .
In researching this story , the Star interviewed more than three dozen current and former church members , contractors who worked on the Prayer Palace and other Melnichuk building projects , and other family associates .
The church 's most devout followers say that if wealth ends up in the pastors ' hands , it 's because God sees fit .
Still , in looking at the church construction and several of Melnichuk 's personal house - building projects that overlapped it , the Star found the lines between the two often blurred .
For example , as the church prepared to turn sod on the $ 27 - million Prayer Palace , Melnichuk had a construction company pave his own driveway instead of paying the full cost of renting space on church property for storing equipment .
Also , a valuable strip of Prayer Palace land was sold to a company connected to the Melnichuks .
The church 's financial documents raise numerous questions .
Total salaries for the pastors and other staff ( it 's unclear how many are paid ) was listed on Prayer Palace documents as more than $ 1 million in 2005 , the last year reported , up from about $ 750,000 two years earlier .
The most recent documents show one salary of more than $ 119,000 – likely that of Pastor Paul – and three salaries between $ 80,000 and $ 119,000 .
In addition , Prayer Palace financial statements show " housing allowances " of more than $ 125,000 , but the documents do n't specify the recipients .
The documents also show annual vehicle and travel expenses have doubled in the past two years , jumping to more than $ 175,000 .
The original cost of the vehicles in the Prayer Palace fleet is over $ 500,000 .
Documents obtained by the Star show the red Mercedes convertible is registered to the Canadian church but kept at the pastor 's Florida villa .
The Star found the pastors and their wives also drive , besides the Lexus and Porsche SUVs , an Audi A6S sedan , BMW 7 Series and 3 Series sedans , a Lincoln LS and Towncar , and a red , oversized Dodge pickup .
The Lexus is also kept in Florida .
With pastor
Tom contemplating construction of a helipad at his Caledon home , the family 's opulence is on an upswing at a time when the Canada Revenue Agency has recently removed the charitable status of several religious charities .
Audits obtained by the Star show they got in trouble by using vehicles for non-charity business , sending money out of country for work deemed not charitable , and paying high salaries to leaders .
John Pellowe , head of the Canadian Council of Christian Charities , said laws do n't compel churches to be open about their finances .
Speaking in general terms about accountability , he said church members must themselves press their boards for transparency : " Are they doing what they said they would do with your money ? "
Pellowe 's group conducts audits of council members who voluntarily provide their financial information .
The Prayer Palace is not a certified member of the group .
The music usually dies down after an hour , when Pastor Paul leaves his front - row seat .
His tan gleaming against his white shirt and dark suit , he nimbly jogs up the red-carpeted stairs to his pulpit on the stage .
His presence so moves some members that they leave their seats and , arms flailing , sprint around the centre aisles while the pastor begins to speak .
At a recent service his opening words caused one woman to stand up , tilt her head skyward and scream out an unintelligible rant to the Lord , then collapse .
" Let her go , " the pastor said .
He 's been watching members connect similarly with God for 50 years , he told congregants , and has no plans to stop .
" You 'll never get rid of me .
The only way you 're getting rid of me is in a casket . "
A charismatic , southern - U.S. - style preacher , Melnichuk has built the Palace from humble beginnings at a small Etobicoke church .
With the help of his sons , Melnichuk has also built satellite churches in south Florida and Barrie , Ont. , and maintains a devout television following on Canada 's Miracle Network .
Many of his current followers have been with the pastor for decades , including Houghron , who attended her first Pastor Paul sermon in 1981 .
" The moment I walked in , it was like someone just put their arms around me and hugged me , " she recalls .
" He has a great anointing on him . "
Paul eventually went to Eastern Pentecostal Bible College in Peterborough , where he met his wife , and took his first posting with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada at a small church in Nova Scotia 's highlands .
The pay there was meagre , and Paul and his young wife , Kathleen , had difficulty .
" His wife had to go through ( donation ) bins ... to find nylons , " Kloetstra recalls .
" He said she 'd never do that again . "
By 1979 , the pastor had moved his family back to Toronto .
Two years later he split from the Pentecostal Assemblies to start his own charismatic church in Etobicoke , Faith Cathedral .
There , his efforts were dogged by controversy .
In 1981 the Pastor came under fire for publicly insulting Jews in a taped sermon .
" I would never pray for a Jew ; I think they 're the most miserable people in the whole world , " Melnichuk said .
" You ( Jews ) cheat us on everything you do . "
He also referred to the Roman Catholic Church as " that big whore . "
Melnichuk publicly apologized for both comments months later .
In spite of the hate incidents , Melnichuk 's church continued to prosper , buoyed by a rising tide of West Indian immigrants , who fed off his trademark , southern - style preaching .
People who'd never seen him heard his audiotapes .
" The word got around about this man who preaches like a black man , " says Houghron .
" Jesse Jackson is peanuts compared to the way this man preaches . "
By the late 1980s , the pastor 's flock had outgrown the church .
He built a larger building in the Jane St. and Finch Ave. W. area , and began using the name the Prayer Palace .
By 2001 , the church expanded again , opening its current colossus .
" Nobody has left a religious mark on the city the size of that man's , " says Al Bowen , the long - time head of north Toronto 's Abundant Life Assembly .
" I see him as a religious Mel Lastman or Ed Mirvish .
I see him as a movie star . "
For example , the church advertises that it runs a weekly food bank .
While churches often use donated money to stock the shelves , the food at the Prayer Palace , which helped about 1,150 families last year , is actually supplied by the North York Harvest Food Bank .
In 2001 the Prayer Palace also stopped busing homeless people to the church to allow them to eat , shower and sleep .
Houghron says she recently asked to use one of the two buses the Prayer Palace owns to restart that program , but was told no .
" I'm on the verge of trying to get my own bus , " she says .
In its response to the Star , the Prayer Palace said it also provides hospital visitation , and a mission in Nicaragua , and helps abused mothers in the Congo .
Prayer Palace members do visit people in the hospital , but they say it costs nothing .
As to the overseas missions the Prayer Palace mentioned , the Star could find no evidence to confirm this claim .
At each Prayer Palace service , sometimes twice , yellow - jacketed ushers carrying buckets collect donations – in both loose cash and envelopes bearing donors ' names .
The money is taken to a counting room and stored in a vault .
Some former church members interviewed by the Star listed the way the church handles money as a key issue in their decision to cut ties with the Prayer Palace .
A former office worker questions why the Prayer Palace keeps a binder of blank cheques in its office , pre-signed by the president of the board .
" It struck me as very unusual , " the person says .
" They can be given to anybody . "
A woman who attended the church for nearly a decade and quit last year complains that , " If they knew where you lived and the type of house you had , you were expected to give more .

" It 's not a church , it 's a business .
It 's not a place we could call home . "
" The $ 300 ones break easily , " he told church members .
" The dollar glasses at the bargain store do n't .
I believe that God has invented the dollar store for people like you and me . "
Yet Paul Melnichuk enjoys a level of domestic luxury most of his congregants could n't even imagine .
Without its hulking iron gates , anchored by towering stone pillars and accented with gold leaf detailing , his mansion would be easy to miss .
The three - winged stone house at 3510 Sixteenth Sideroad in King City is set so far back from the street – linked to it by a 300 - metre driveway – and nestled inside such a thick , forested landscape , it 's nearly invisible to passersby .
Apart from the gates , the 15 - acre property 's only visible markers to onlookers are a few life - sized stone statues and the man -made pond made picturesque by a nearby weeping willow .
The home , which area real estate agents say would sell for at least $ 3 million , is the latest in a long line of properties the Melnichuks have bought north of the city since putting down roots in Toronto .
Supporters of the Melnichuks say a series of good real estate decisions helped Pastor Paul and his wife , known at the church as " Mrs. M , " get to their current affluence .
" Mrs. M is smart with money , " says Diane Risser , a mother of seven and the wife of long - time church board member Tal Risser .
" She 'd hide money under the rug in the early days so her husband would n't give it all away . "
Kathleen also taught her boys to invest early in real estate , Risser says .
Tim Melnichuk 's five - acre King City château , on Dearbourne Ave. , is being advertised as " country living at the highest level " in the real estate listing , with a home cinema , five - car garage , seven bathrooms and seven bedrooms .
The other twin , Tom , recently bought a $ 1.35 - million retreat in Caledon .
The two - storey stone structure set atop a heavily treed hill has undergone significant renovations since
Tom moved in , including landscaping so extensive he sheared off the top of a hill and adorned it with a small mountain of rocks .
Tom , also a helicopter pilot with the Toronto - based company Four Seasons Aviation , owns shares in the latest in a series of south Florida properties his parents have bought over the past 20 years .
They include a Spanish - style villa in Bradenton on the Manatee River that Paul , Kathleen and Tom have visited several times since Christmas .
The home was built in 2005 , the same year the Prayer Palace 's Canadian office transferred $ 1 million to its " Florida mission . "
The home , worth well over $ 1 million U.S. and in an exclusive neighbourhood called Pleasant Point , has an outdoor pool and spa , a covered sunroom and a lengthy dock with a Sea - Doo .
Neighbours there say the Melnichuks have approached them to buy their properties too .
One of those deals has its roots in a 1999 agreement he struck with Armbro Construction , which has since been purchased by Aecon , the country 's largest public construction company .
At the time , the company was under contract to resurface a section of Hwy .
400 , and wanted to rent space to store equipment at the Prayer Palace .
Instead of making full rent payments to the church , Melnichuk senior asked Armbro to build his 300 - metre King City driveway , a company source confirms .
Documents obtained by the Star show the driveway , built in December 1999 , cost $ 45,000 .
The curbs alone cost $ 23,000 .
" It was better than the 401 , " a former Melnichuk insider says of the driveway 's quality .
The company source , who asked not to be named for fear of losing his job , says the deal " is not the way our company normally does business , " and was about " keeping the peace or something ... it 's partly the cost of doing business . "
Aecon 's top public relations official would not comment .
A source who worked on the project says there were other deals as well – " It was n't run like a normal job where you 'd have checks and balances . "
That lack of accountability , the source says , enabled the family to capitalize on the church 's construction to obtain discounts from trades people for renovations at their homes .
Stonemason Valerio Vuaran says he experienced the deal - making first hand .
Vuaran was brought in to bid on brickwork for the new church , but says Paul Melnichuk asked him to first raise the chimney at the home of his son Tom .
After Vuaran completed the job and presented a bill for just over $ 6,000 to the pastor , he says , he had " to fight " to get Tom Melnichuk to agree to pay just $ 4,000 .
The Star also uncovered an unusual land deal involving the most commercially viable part of the Prayer Palace 's undeveloped property .
The land fronts onto Finch Ave. west of Hwy .
400 .
If developed , it could have been worth millions for the Prayer Palace .
Charities are required by law to use property for the benefit of the organization 's mission .
However , during construction , the Prayer Palace sold that land to a company called Katpa Holdings Inc. , which appears to be named after Kathleen and Paul Melnichuk .
The company 's sole director was their son- in - law , husband of daughter Miriam Patey .
The Prayer Palace says the sale was done to raise money for the construction of the church .
Documents obtained by the Star show that Paul and Kathleen funded Katpa with more than $ 1 million to make the purchase .
Today , Katpa still owns the property , which is slated for development .
Frank DeLuca , the Melnichuks ' friend and the church 's real estate agent , says he now owns the company and its land , and the Melnichuks are no longer involved .
However , he wo n't say what he paid for it .
Canadian Prayer Palace members interviewed by the Star say they have little knowledge of the Florida church , for which the Palace set aside more than $ 1 million , according to financial statements .
The Star recently attended a Sunday evening service at the aging stucco church .
It 's unclear how it supports itself , since there were only 10 congregants .
Pastor Archilles Decarolis referred questions to the Prayer Palace .
Melnichuk has no plans to stop expanding .
He recently announced to his Toronto congregation a new vision for growth : another church , bigger than all the others .
" The devil wants to keep us right here ! " he roared .
" We 've got to remove the devil ! "
He described a church to accommodate up to 20,000 people anchored on a 20 - to 50 - acre lot somewhere north of the city .
" We 're going to keep on going , " he vowed , " until we reach every part of the city of Toronto . "
Bindschadler , a veteran of Antarctic research , knew all about the trouble the team faced : crevasses .
Antarctica ’s ice moves slowly , but it always moves .
As a result , it often splits apart to form crevasses — cracks in the ice that can be tens of meters deep , tens of meters across , and many kilometers long .
If every one were a visible , gaping hole , crevasses might merely be annoying , but when they hide beneath the snow , these cracks in the ice become deadly dangerous .
On December 9 , 2004 , Robert Bindschadler , a glaciologist at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center , got a phone call from a colleague in New Zealand .
A team of technicians was trying to complete an overland traverse across the frigid vastness of Antarctica , from McMurdo Station near the coast to the South Pole .
And the team had run into some trouble .
“ Snow blows around in Antarctica a lot , ” Bindschadler explains .
“ It builds these snow bridges , so as a crevasse opens up , the snow sort of stretches across the top of it .
It can be a few meters thick , or it can be centimeters thick . ”
A lightweight skier might be able to cross a thick snow bridge safely by distributing his or her weight over a wide area , but heavy vehicles do n’t stand a chance .
“ So that ’s the danger : that you walk right on top of a snow bridge and you just break through and you fall . ”
In their approach to the Transantarctic Mountains , the Antarctic traverse team members had run into an area filled with crevasses they had n’t anticipated , as many as 10 in a single mile .
They called George Blaisdell , operations manager for the U.S. Antarctic Program , who then called Bindschadler .
Blaisdell posed a simple question :
Can you help the team find a way out ?
Beating a Path to the Pole
Targeting children , single mothers , and other people who have no clue what they did wrong .
The RIAA precisely selects its prey , the less money , the better .
Everything that ’s vulnerable is perfect .
Completely ignorant to the fact that peoples lives are completely RUINED .
Do n’t get me wrong , I ’m not advocating piracy here , I just want people to know that the RIAA is acting totally out of line here .
Come on , how low can they get ?
Most victims have absolutely NO clue , hardly know how a computer works , have NO money to fight back , and have NO life left .
To illustrate how desperate people get , read this email that Ray Beckerman , who ’s representing a number of RIAA victims , received from the father of one the RIAA ’s latest victims .
I am being sued by the RIAA for copyright infringement , and the case has been going on for the past 2 years .
So far they have deposed all 5 of my children , and my wife , and myself .
I also had to fill out admissions and interrogatory answers twice so far and they are still not satisfied with my answers .
Most of them I answered that I did not know .
I did not know , and was completely unaware of whatever the RIAA is claiming happened .
My responses were honest , but that was not good enough for them .
I am defending myself in this case because I can’t afford a lawyer , and it ’s hard for me to understand all of the paperwork and the rules of the court .
The RIAA is on its 6th different group of lawyers .
It seems like they are bottom feeders .
I was just in court in Philadelphia with the RIAA ’s Philadelphia representative .
I had been called into court by the judge , Judge Cynthia Rufe , because I had not responded to the RIAA ’s second motion to compel even more discovery .
The judge gave me additional time to send in the paperwork , and stated that she intends to set up a trial date sometime in May .
The real shame is that I had no knowledge of any of this until I was served in the mail .
Apparently my daughter who was 12 years old at the time had been listening to music on Kazaa I do not even know how it got on the computer .
I know that I did n’t do anything wrong and I am going to defend myself , but I ’m scared to death of the outcome .

Mr. Wolfowitz apologized at a news conference Thursday and at the atrium meeting , after the staff association disclosed that it had found the dated memorandum from Mr. Wolfowitz to a vice president for human resources at the bank , apparently instructing him to agree to the terms of a raise and reassignment for Ms. Riza .
The transfer and a subsequent raise eventually took her to a pay of $ 193,590 from $ 132,660 , tax - free because of her status as a diplomat , and exceeding the salaries of cabinet members .
“ In hindsight , I wish I had trusted my original instincts and kept myself out of the negotiations , ” Mr. Wolfowitz said .
“ I made a mistake , for which I am sorry , ” he added , pleading for “ some understanding ” of the “ painful personal dilemma ” he faced when he left the Pentagon to become bank president .
Mr. Wolfowitz said he had been seeking to avoid a conflict of interest by having Ms. Riza , with whom he had a personal relationship , transferred from his supervision .
What drove the anger at the bank was not that Mr. Wolfowitz had denied earlier that he had sought Ms. Riza ’s transfer , but that he had been less than fully candid in discussing it until documents surfaced showing his direct role .
Even before the release of the documents today , his earlier insistence that he had consulted with ethics officials was disputed by some of them , who say they were not involved in the salary aspect of discussions .
Mr. Wolfowitz , who is divorced , has been close to Ms. Riza for several years , according to people who have worked with them .
She was a communications officer in the Middle East and North Africa bureau of the bank when Mr. Wolfowitz arrived in 2005 , and was transferred that September to the Middle East and North Africa bureau to help set up a semi-independent foundation to promote democracy in that region .
Her initial supervisor at the State Department was Elizabeth Cheney , whose father , Vice President Dick Cheney , has been a longtime associate of Mr. Wolfowitz .
Ms. Riza now serves as a consultant to the foundation , the Foundation for the Future , while drawing her World Bank salary , the State Department said .
Mr. Wolfowitz , in his talk to the bank staff , essentially implied that his fate was up to the board .
“ I proposed to the board that they establish some mechanism to judge whether the agreement reached was a reasonable outcome , ” he said of the arrangement for Ms. Riza .
“ I will accept any remedies they propose . ”
不二家は報道被害で会社をつぶされた。
不二家に問題がなかったわけではないが、テレビでの集中的な不二家バッシングにおける報道内容はほとんど事実無根で、少なくとも実際にあった問題とは質的に違う問題として取りあげられている。
TBS の捏造報道として問題になっている 「 賞味期限切れのチョコレート再利用」の件だけでなく、他局の報道に出てきた以下の問題は事実無根である。
3秒ルー ル
カビの生えたケーキや床に落ちたケーキを販売
虫混入とか金属片混入とか
以下の問題は、問題の内容が大幅に変質している。
消費期限切れ牛乳の使用→(プロセスに不備があり記録から期限内の使用を立証できない)
プリンの消費期限延長 →(出荷前に最終検査があることを前提に厳しすぎた社内規定を緩めた)
大腸菌の検出された食品を出荷した→(大腸菌群と大腸菌という専門用語の誤解で問題はない)
日々のオペレーションで全く問題の無い企業は存在しない。実際にあった問題の歪曲報道と捏造報道の組合せで、テレビ局から集中的にバッシングされたら、大半の企業には対抗することは難しいだろう。
私が、これらが報道被害であると考える理由は、4/3の信頼回復対策会議の最終報告以降、マスコミ各社は不二家バッシングをピッタリやめてしまったからである。
もし報道各社がこれらの事実に確信を持っているのであれば、指摘された多くの問題点について、問題の存在自体を認めず、当然何の対策も講じていないこの最終報告について批判すべきである。報道された問題が事実であれば、追加取材して裏付けを取ることは簡単であり、実際そうするだろう。
週刊文春は元パート従業員90名に取材したが、同様の事実を見聞きした人はいなかったと言っている(4月12日号)。自分が働いていた工場で、そういうとんでもないことが行なわれていたら、誰かにしゃべりたくなるのが人情であり、テレビでたくさんの匿名の告発が行なわれているのを見たら、いくらでも証言者が現れてくるだろう。
不二家には、経営レベルの問題はいくつかあった。また、現場の衛生管理が「職人による経験的な管理」であったことも大きな問題で、これが放置されていたら、将来的に、実際に健康被害につながるような大きな問題を起こす可能性はあったと思う。それは、報告書でも指摘されている。ただ、現状においては、最低レベルではあるがその管理が機能しており、実際に不二家の食品で健康被害を受けた人はいない。
そのような問題点については最終報告書で指摘されているが、報道の内容はその報告書とはかけ離れたものである。
テレビ局がこの報告書に対して無言であることは、これが正しく自分たちの報道が出鱈目であったことを暗黙に認めているとしか思えない。
たくさんの捏造報道の中で、報告書がTBSの「賞味期限切れのチョコレート再利用」に焦点を当てているのは、これが訴訟に耐えうるだけのハッキリした証拠があり、抗議に対する事後の対応が特に悪質だったからだろう。この件だけでなくほとんどの報道は事実無根であり、「証言者」なる者も大半が「仕込み」であったと私は推測している。そうでなければ、不二家バッシングが簡単に終息するはずがない。
ＴＢＳ 広報部は「チョコレートを再利用していたという証言の根幹部分は現在も信用性が高いと考えている」としている。
「 朝ズバッ 」は自称 「 謝罪報道 」を行なったが(参照( J- CAST ニュース ) ) 、それを受けての取材に対して、TBSはこのように言っている。「伝聞」であり「10年以上前のこと」(証言者の女性は若く20代にも見える)であり、牛乳やカントリーマアムの件など事実に反する内容がたくさん含まれているのに(参照 : アンカテ( Uncategorizable Blog ) - TBS 「 朝ズバ」捏造は「あるある」よりはるかに悪質!)、なおも「根幹は間違ってない」と主張しているのだ。
こ の 「謝罪」を受けいれ る( J- CAST ニュース : 不二 家 「 TBS を提訴せず 」 謝罪放送受け ) というのは、もはや、「不二家」という企業は存在してないのと同じだ。
この 「経営判断」は、実質的には支援している山崎パンの判断であると見なすべきであろう。(参考 : 山崎パン、不二家を傘下に : 金融ニュース : マネー・経済 : YOMIURI ONLINE（読売新聞） )
これによって連結の業績が本当に良くなるのであれば、山崎パンの判断は批判すべきことではないと思うが、報道被害によって不二家という会社は実質的には消滅したわけで、被害回復を計る主体はもう存在していない。このことをどう考えたらよいのだろうか。
一方的なバッシングでつぶして消滅させてしまえばテレビ局の勝ちで反省も釈明も不要という決着に、社会は納得できるのだろうか。
テレビ局は何より事実を明らかにすべきである。報道内容に問題が無いとするなら、具体的な根拠を持って報告書と信頼性回復会議をさらに批判すべきであり、間違いがあったのなら、どこが事実と反していたか明解に説明し謝罪すべきである。その中間はあり得ない。
A US - based civil rights group today asked German prosecutors to take legal action against the former US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld for war crimes .
The Centre for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) lodged a complaint with the German federal prosecutor urging investigations of Mr Rumsfeld , who resigned last week , and other former US officials over alleged abuses in Iraq and at Guantánamo Bay .
Under a law enacted by Germany when the international criminal court was created in 2002 , the federal prosecutor can investigate and prosecute war crimes regardless of where they are committed or of the nationality of the perpetrators .
The prosecutor dismissed a similar case brought by the CCR in 2004 .
But the CCR , backed by other civil rights groups , said new evidence , including signed memos , had now strengthened its case .
It added that the former US brigadier general Janis Karpinski , a defendant in the earlier complaint as the commanding officer at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , was now providing testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs .
Ms Karpinski , who was relieved of her command and demoted to the rank of colonel last year , said her superiors had encouraged cruel treatment - though she denied having known about the abuses herself at the time .
In order to conceal what was going on at Abu Ghraib , those in charge of the prison had increased the scale of the abuses " incrementally over time " , Col Karpinski said at a news conference alongside the lawyers backing the case .
She told Reuters Television : " When I look back at it now , when I see the footage , when I see the Iraqi people , I see a loss of hope in their faces .
I see desperation in their faces , and I know that we in many ways contributed to this situation . "
Mr Rumsfeld 's resignation , on November 8 , meant he could no longer claim the immunity sovereign officials enjoyed from international prosecution for war crimes , the CCR said .
The suit is brought on behalf of 12 alleged torture victims - 11 Iraqis held at Abu Ghraib and Mohamad al - Qahtani , a Saudi held at Guantánamo whom the US has identified as a would - be participant in the September 11 attacks .
" None of these plaintiffs - and the hundreds of other detainees subjected to similar abuses - has seen justice , " the 220 - page complaint said , " and none of those who authorised these techniques at the top of the chain of command have been held liable for it , or even seriously and independently investigated . "
The CCR said Mr Qahtani had been subjected to 50 days of severe sleep deprivation , 20 - hour interrogations , forced nudity , sexual and religious humiliation and physical force , including being made to adopt stress positions for long periods .
Besides Mr Rumsfeld , the action names the US attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , the former CIA director George Tenet , the former commander of all US forces in Iraq , Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez , and eight others .
It alleges they ordered , aided or failed to prevent war crimes .
A case could not be brought with the international criminal court because the US was not a member , the CCR said ; neither could it be pursued through the UN , because the US had power of veto .
The CCR also said the military commissions act of 2006 , signed by George Bush , provided immunity for US officials and military personnel from prosecution for international crimes .
Wolfgang Kaleck , the German attorney leading the attempted litigation , said the suit 's backers would appeal if prosecutors refuse to take up the case , and raised the prospect of further attempts in other European countries .
The Pentagon and the German federal prosecutor 's office declined to comment , saying they had not yet received the suit .
A CNN poll released today reports that nearly 60 % of the public favors withdrawing American forces from Iraq by 2008 or sooner :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) —
Nearly six in 10 Americans want to see U.S. troops leave Iraq either immediately or within a year , and more would rather have Congress running U.S. policy in the conflict than President Bush , according to a CNN poll out Tuesday .
Though support for Bush ’s decision to dispatch additional troops to Iraq grew to 37 percent — up from 32 percent in a mid-January poll — a slim majority of 52 percent say Congress should block funding for the new deployment .
The CNN poll was conducted Friday through Sunday by Opinion Research Corp .
Pollsters interviewed 1,027 adults for the survey , which had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
If nothing else , this seems to be an indication that the President ’s surge has been , at the very least , a political failure given that it has failed to unite the country around the Bush Administration ’s central premise , which is that we must stay in Iraq until the job is “ done ” , whatever that might mean .
What will be interesting will be whether these opinions , if they persist into 2008 , will have an impact on the Presidential race .
Potentially , pro-war candidates like McCain , Giuliani , Romney , and Clinton could suffer setbacks while anti-war candidates like Obama , Hagel ( if he runs ) , and Ron Paul could benefit at the polls .
In either case , it is clear that the Iraq War has lost the support of the public .
For that reason alone , I do n’t think it will be long before we start hearing real talk of withdrawal .

The age of the British amateur inventor toiling away in his humble garden shed lives on - and Geoff Hatton is proof of it .
The former hovercraft engineer has designed and patented a flying saucer from his workshop in Peterborough that has grabbed the imagination of the American military establishment .
• Video :
Now watch the amazing flying saucers in action
Scroll down for more ...
" My son said it was a bloody silly idea , ' said Mr Hatton .
" Now I 've proved it works , he says sorry , he was wrong . "
The 68 - year - old has won a contract with the US government for his 3 ft - wide contraption , a cross between a hovercraft and a helicopter .
It is being considered for surveillance sorties .

" Unlike a helicopter , though , this is aerodynamically neutral and you can bump into walls and not smash the rotor , ' said the inventor .
" And , unlike a hovercraft , you can fly it as high as you want . "
The dome - shaped object is powered by an electricity - driven propeller on top that pushes air over the outer surfaces , and has controllable flaps .
The device , which was rejected by the Ministry of Defence , was funded partly by a £ 43,000 development grant from the Department of Trade and Industry five years ago .
The Americans are convinced that it has potential .
" It 's a unique approach which lends itself to a surveillance platform , ' said Sal Gomez , of the US army 's International Co-operative Programs centre .
" It could be useful in urban areas because if it bumped into walls it could recover .
This is just the earliest of days , like the Wright Brothers . "
Mr Hatton built his first model hovercraft for a church fete in 1964 and later helped build them in Britain and Canada .
Divorced , he returned to England in 1979 and spent ten years as a market trader in Clacton .
" I was always going on to people about how hovercraft could become flying saucers , " he said .
" They got fed up with it and said , " Get on and make one then ! "
So I did . "
He set about turning his workshops into his own mini-Area 51s - the secret US military testing sites in the Nevada desert .
Mr Hatton won backing from friends , including business consultant David Evans .
He said : " It 's an idea that you look at and say to yourself , " Do you want to be like the first record producers who turned down The Beatles ? " '
Dr Holger Babinsky , an expert in aerodynamics at Cambridge University , also offered his expertise .
Geoff 's Flying Saucers - the original name for his GFS Projects company - are based on an aerodynamic principle that has been around for nearly 100 years .
Known as the Coanda Effect , after a Romanian jet - engine pioneer , the principle is today used primarily in helicopters that have no tail rotors .
Patents covering Mr Hatton 's design were filed in March 2005 and the first controlled flights took place that year .
Mr Evans said : " We can see a lot of prospects besides the military .
Farmers in America already use unmanned aerial vehicles to inspect crops .
Then there 's search - and - rescue , aerial surveying and getting close to roofs . "
FULL PRODUCT VERSION :
All current versions ( 1.4.2_13 , 1.5.0_11 , 1.6 ) ADDITIONAL OS VERSION INFORMATION : Anything CUSTOMER DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :
" The recent change to the definition of EST timezone to remove DST awareness has broken basic functionality in date handling .
The problem is very simple .
The DateFormat parser uses the contents of String zoneStrings [ ] [ ] in class DateFormatSymbols to identify the timezone based on the zone value in the input date string .
The zoneStrings [ ] [ ] array defines " EST " before " America / New_York " so sets the timezone for the parser to the now non-DST aware " EST " zone . "
The customer feels this is a serious issue .
STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM : Compile and run the test code below as shown .
First run as java - Duser.timezone=America/New_York
Moh and the output is correct : Wed Jun 06 14:00:00 EDT 2007
Then run as java - Duser.timezone=America/Los_Angeles
Moh and the output is wrong : Wed Jun 06 12:00:00 PDT 2007
The correct output would be 11:00:00 PDT 2007 .
EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR : EXPECTED -
In the test case when in the Los Angeles time zone I expect the time to be 11:00:00 PDT but it wrongly displays 12:00:00 PDT .
ACTUAL - As above .

It has always surprised me that in the US , where holidays are valued and children get about 6 weeks more annual holiday than the UK , that adults get such a derisory amount of annual vacation .
Americans have more disposable income than many other countries , value family time , have a very well developed leisure and recreation economy yet have next to no time to enjoy it in .
The standard annual vacation when you join a US company is 10 days ( plus about 9 federal holidays ) .
So there goes your two week break in the summer then .
Take that and there 's no time off at any other time of the year .
The standard UK holidays are 20 days minumum with at least 25 being more usual .
Then there 's usually 8 public holidays on top of that .
This year , I have 34 days annual leave , 33 of which I can take when I choose .
This is against a background of most independent observers saying that people in the UK work too hard and work more than our European neighbours .
Perhaps an American company could offer European holidays , with a corresponding reduction in salary and see how much more productive its workforce becomes when they can enjoy all that money they 've earned , spend time with their families , enjoy recreational time and get enough holiday to have a decent break abroad .
Would Americans take an 6 % salary cut for an extra three weeks of annual leave to bring them onto a par with Europe or would Europeans prefer a 6 % raise to get American holidays ?
Most of us need the money , but how much holiday is enough for a productive and happy workforce ?
TONY JONES : Now to our interview and despite growing US opposition to the war in Iraq the troop surge in Baghdad continues .
Today the commander of American forces in Iraq has recommended that heightened troop levels be maintained for at least another year .
Meanwhile the American public has been asking exactly how things went so wrong .
Well , the story of one individual soldier can only provide clues rather than answers but Joshua Key 's book The Deserter 's Tale still makes for sobering reading .
The book details basic training techniques in which , if the author is to be believed , Iraqis , Afghanis and all Muslims , in fact , are systematically demonised .
Key was just a private soldier but examines his own reactions to Iraqi civilians and those of his fellow soldiers during his tour of duty and concludes that American soldiers were behaving like terrorists .
It 's a staggering conclusion and we should bear in mind that Joshua Key is still seeking asylum in Canada , having deserted the army rather than returning to Iraq .
It 's impossible for us to verify elements of his story but you can judge his authenticity for yourself .
I spoke to him in Toronto earlier today .
Joshua
Key thanks for joining us .
JOSHUA KEY , US ARMY DESERTER : Thanks for having me .
TONY JONES :
Why did you get involved in writing this book in the first place ?
JOSHUA KEY : I would say the main purpose of it was to get my story out , for it to be heard and for everyone to hear it .
TONY JONES :
You know , I 'm sure , what the consequences will be .
Some people will regard you as a hero , but your critics are going to say that you 're a traitor .
JOSHUA KEY :
Of course you 're going to have that anyway , of course .
I 'm not a coward , nor am I a traitor .
I went and fought for my country .
The only reason I left , of course , was the things I witnessed .
That 's what I made my decision on and to me it was a moral decision .
I do n't believe myself as being that .
TONY JONES :
We 'll talk about some of the details in a moment , but let me take you back to your account of basic training .
Because it 's here you argue your minds were poisoned .
Could you describe to us just how you were taught , what people were saying to you about Iraqis and Muslims ?
JOSHUA KEY :
You know of course they were never called Iraqis or Muslims , they were always used in derogatory terms as hajis , habibs and so on .
I would say it was definitely a form of dehumanising .
I mean , if you see something - that effect all the time - they were never referred to as civilians or Iraqis or Muslims .
TONY JONES :
You say of the training that you were told that all Muslims were terrorists , that all Muslims were responsible for September 11 .
Were people actually saying that to you specifically ?
JOSHUA KEY : Yes , and then I got it to the term that instead of being , what would you say , not guilty until proven guilty , I would say to us it's " they 're guilty till they 're proven innocent " , to us all Muslims were terrorists .
That 's the way we were taught and it's the way we conducted our business .
TONY JONES :
You say it 's the way you conducted business .
Did you actually see soldiers in Iraq behaving as if they actually believed this ?
JOSHUA KEY : Very much so , very much so .
Even in our actions from raiding homes to traffic control points to every day manoeuvres in Iraq .
It was very systematic .
It was never referred , as civilians are people .
It was always derogatory terms , always something to dehumanise them , to put them beneath us .
TONY JONES : Did you see or feel this in your own behaviour ?
JOSHUA KEY :
Of course in my own behaviour at first , I 've seen it and I did it .
Of course I changed after the months went but , no , at first I was one of them .
Yes .
TONY JONES : Did you abuse Iraqi civilians yourself ?
JOSHUA KEY : Yes , I did , yes .
TONY JONES : Now of the numerous raids and other incidents you participated in you 've written , " It struck me that the American soldiers themselves were the terrorists . "
Now people back home , your own family , are going to be horrified to hear you say that .
JOSHUA KEY : I 'm sure they will be , but the way I look at it , that was the truth .
We had no justification after all them homes that I raided , there was no justification .
I felt that we were more antagonising , causing in my picture to myself , we had become the terrorists .
I was n't getting terrorised .
I was more doing the terrorising .
TONY JONES : In what regard ?
What do you mean by that ?
JOSHUA KEY : Raiding the homes , taking their sons and their husbands .
If they were over five foot tall they were sent off regardless of whether anything was found in that house or not .
Through everyday night raids , of course , illumination rounds - used to do the rounds all night long , complete patrolling of the streets non-stop .
It was more antagonising .
We were n't - we would go out on a patrol it's not - we would be saying derogatory names even to the Iraqi women .
We antagonised , we brought it - we made it the way it was .
TONY JONES : Now you were in some of the worst fighting in Fallujah and you claim to have seen at least 14 civilians killed .
Can you tell us about the circumstances ?
JOSHUA KEY : From one of the incidents , we were at a mayor cell , which is sort of where you would - like where the mayor of the city stayed .
I was in the back part ; I saw the after - effect of it .
Of course the ground was - outrageous amount of gunfire .
Of course we were getting ready ourselves .
It came over the radio that , you know , that something in the front was happening .
I guess the overall circumstances of it were , the end result was 12 Iraqi civilians were killed .
The reason why is because somebody had gotten trigger - happy and that was one of my first instances with death there , of course , was that .
I mean , it was apparent very very - the first day we got into Iraq that if you felt threatened you shoot , you ask questions later .
Our actions were completely unsupervised and we did , as we will .
Just - as well with the 12 Iraqis there was no reason for them to be dead .
Somebody got trigger - happy , there 's death .
TONY JONES :
When civilians were killed , what happened ?
Did your officers make reports ?
Did they try and investigate what had happened ?
JOSHUA KEY : I myself never got questioned in the course of my ranking I had no idea what my commanding officers were doing , if anything was wrote or not .
I know in many of the circumstances I witnessed myself in Iraq I asked later on if any mission statements had been written .
Has anything been written about what happened last night and I was told on many occasions that it was none of my concern and none of my business .
TONY JONES :
One of the most horrific incidents you record was in the night during a raid in Ramadi and you describe the circumstances with one of your sergeants actually saying , " Tonight is retaliation time in Ramadi . "
Tell us about that incident ?
JOSHUA KEY : Well , we had many - for that incidence , for the retaliation , prior to that there had been a commander in the third Army Recovery Regiment which was the regiment I was with that had gotten injured .
I do n't know exactly , I do n't even know if he was a fatality .
That was said after that fact .
In Ramadi the second time there was so many incidents , of course .
You 're on a QRF mission , which is like you 're the quick reaction force for the military .
It 's like you 're a swat team .
For that 24 - hour period you 're in control .
If anything happens within that city then you 're sent out to , as they say , calm down the uprising .
The night we got the call we were on it , we were going to our designated spot .
We took a sharp right turn by the banks of the Euphrates River .
On the left side I saw bodies that were decapitated .
My truck stopped .
I was asked to see if there were - of course I was the lowest ranking and I was told to get out to see if I could find evidence of a fire fight , which means , you know , shell casings .
When I got out of the back of my truck I heard one American soldier screaming that we had lost it .
I mean , I looked to the other side and I seen American soldiers kicking the head around like a soccer ball .
I got back inside of my APC , which is an armoured personnel carrier , said I would n't have no involvement .
Of course the next day I asked if anything had been filed for that , because to me that was completely unacceptable .
That 's when my - I said that 's when my will started to change , of course .
TONY JONES : I have to get you to go back over that because of the way you just described it .
Are you saying you saw American soldiers kicking around the decapitated head of a dead Iraqi ?
JOSHUA KEY : Yes , that was - of course I live with that nightmare every day .
That 's something I have a lot of problems with , of course .
But to me that was completely - there 's no justification and no reason why that should have happened like that .
There 's nothing - there 's no reason ; it only takes one shot to kill a person , even if it was for that standpoint .
But there 's no reason whatsoever to decapitate a human person by means of gunfire .
TONY JONES :
Were these people civilians , or were they insurgents ?
Was there any evidence that they were armed ?
JOSHUA KEY : No , no evidence whatsoever .
To me they were civilians .
TONY JONES :
It 's such an horrific scene that many Americans are going to believe that you 've invented this for your book .
JOSHUA KEY : I 'm sure they will , but the way I look at that is every day there 's other soldiers ' coming out with facts just like mine from their own personal experiences .
I mean , it 's just a matter of time until it all comes out .
I 'm not the first one of course nor am I going to be the last one to say these atrocities are happening .
What 's happening there will be dealt with later on .
TONY JONES :
In your account of that incident you include the names , and details of members of your platoon including a sergeant and staff sergeant .
Will any of those people back up your account ?
JOSHUA KEY :
You know , I do n't know that right - it depends on how do they look at the war now , of course , since they 've been out .
Of course they 're going to see me as a total , whatever you might want to call it , they 're going to see me as a lot different since I deserted , of course and I do n't know where they stand .
I would say a lot of soldiers come back and they , of course , have - they come to their conscience .
So I would say it 'll be reported .
I hope that it will be .
If not I 've witnessed , I 've seen it and it 's my facts .
TONY JONES : Now if it 's true , what you saw was a war crime .
Would you be willing to give sworn evidence about that before a court or a tribunal ?
JOSHUA KEY : Oh well , of course .
That 's involved and of course I would .
TONY JONES : Joshua Key , the victims you describe were not all adults .
You also graphically describe the killing of a very young Iraqi girl .
Can you tell us that story ?
JOSHUA KEY : Yes .
I was pulling guard on a Ramadi children 's hospital .
I did for many , many times .
On one same position , because you would always change your position every so many hours , on the one side there was a house adjacent to the fence and there was a seven , eight - year - old girl .
She would always run over , Mr Food , Mr Water .
Of course after a short number of times I gave in to her .
I would give her my MREs , I would give her my water .
To me it was a kind face , it was a smile .
I did n't have any idea what she was saying .
She herself would bring me bread , would bring me water .
That continued , continued , until one day she 's just like normal , she 's coming across the street to get her MRE and her water and then the way I look at her I heard a shot and her head exploded like a mushroom .
To me that shot - after being in war , of course , I would say that anyone could say who 's been there , there 's a definite distinction between an AK - 47 shot and an M 16 shot .
It was an M 16 shot .
TONY JONES :
One of your own men shot her , is that what you 're saying ?
JOSHUA KEY :
You know , I do n't know for sure , of course .
That 's my speculation , yes .
TONY JONES : Could there have been any other reason for an accidental shooting ?
Did she suddenly appear ?
Could she have appeared to be somehow a danger to your troops ?
JOSHUA KEY : I would n't think so , not for how many times .
There was other soldiers in my squad that gave her food as well so I could not see somebody seeing a danger or a threat in her , no .
TONY JONES : What happened to her body ?
What happened after she was shot ?
JOSHUA KEY : Her mother came ; some other family and I do n't know what happened to it afterwards , I do n't know what happened with her .
TONY JONES :
You saw her body collected , though ?
JOSHUA KEY : Yes , yes .
TONY JONES : Was her death reported ?
JOSHUA KEY : I do not know again .
I look at that and out of complete honesty I was a PFC .
I did not have no idea what was going on , what missions were filed , what things had happened , what was told .
I do not know .
TONY JONES :
What did these kind of incidents that you witnessed or took part in , what did they do to your effectiveness as a soldier ?
JOSHUA KEY : It made me devastated .
It 's one thing to go to another country and fight for democracy and to bring freedom , to rid weapons of mass destruction , rid the world of the evil tyrant Saddam Hussein .
That 's one thing , rather than going to a country for you do n't know what reasons , committing the atrocities and acts that we were doing with no justification whatsoever .
I live with the effects of that every day .
If it was a justified and a legal war with reason I would still be there today .
I left because there was no reason , it was unjustified , illegal and immoral to myself .
TONY JONES :
You 're one of 35 US deserters trying to convince the Canadian Government to treat you as if you were refugees .
What would happen if you were sent back to the US ?
JOSHUA KEY : Of course I 've heard many different things .
I could n't tell you the truth because , of course , I have n't been sent back .
The last I was told was up to five years in prison .
I respond to that , even one day in prison , no one should have to spend one day in jail for doing the right and moral thing , especially when 95 per cent of the world knows we are .
It 's just the other five .
That should n't happen .
No one should have to .
TONY JONES :
Are you in contact with some of those Vietnam deserters who also went to Canada decades ago ?
JOSHUA KEY : Yes , I 'm in contact with - - -
TONY JONES :
What do they say to you ?
JOSHUA KEY : I 've heard many times that it was n't like a ball game for the first few that came .
They had to fight for their right to stay here as well , and of course the provision was given afterwards .
The way I look at it is still today I will fight and fight and fight until - you know , I 'm not asking for refugee status .
I am on the one hand but I 'm not .
I 'd much rather have a provision for all of us to stay so every single soldier that comes here does not have to go through this .
They should n't have to and obligations , international law obligations - we should be allowed to stay in Canada .
TONY JONES :
In the very last line of your book you say that you will never apologise for deserting , and finally you say this , " I owe one apology , one apology only , that 's to the people of Iraq . "
Why did you say that ?
JOSHUA KEY :
That 's my apology , if my apologies go .
I apologise for raiding their homes , I apologise for doing the things I did , for any sense of anything I did , from stealing from them - completely , but as far as being to the US Government , no , no , because they lied , they falsified and they 're the ones that put us all there .
No .
I apologise and I apologise to one and that 's the Iraqi people .
TONY JONES : Joshua Key , we 'll have to leave you there .
We thank you very much for taking the time to come and talk to us .
JOSHUA KEY : No , thank you .
Some years ago , a very enthusiastic cleaning lady took all my books out to dust them while we were away and put them back in such a strange order I 've never been able to find anything since .

I should write a follow - up to my earlier piece on Al Franken , but time flies , writers plod .
In the meantime , Jane Mayer of the New Yorker has an excellent piece on the entire fiasco , albeit she ’s more sympathetic to Leeann Tweeden than I am .
Senators who regret their hasty and pandering decision : too damn late .
A remarkable number of Franken ’s Senate colleagues have regrets about their own roles in his fall .
Seven current and former U.S. senators who demanded Franken ’s resignation in 2017 told me that they ’d been wrong to do so .
Such admissions are unusual in an institution whose members rarely concede mistakes .
Patrick Leahy , the veteran Democrat from Vermont , said that his decision to seek Franken ’s resignation without first getting all the facts was “ one of the biggest mistakes I ’ve made ” in forty - five years in the Senate .
Heidi Heitkamp , the former senator from North Dakota , told me , “ If there ’s one decision I ’ve made that I would take back , it ’s the decision to call for his resignation .
It was made in the heat of the moment , without concern for exactly what this was . ”
Tammy Duckworth , the junior Democratic senator from Illinois , told me that the Senate Ethics Committee “ should have been allowed to move forward . ”
She said it was important to acknowledge the trauma that Franken ’s accusers had gone through , but added , “ We needed more facts .
That due process did n’t happen is not good for our democracy . ”
Angus King , the Independent senator from Maine , said that he ’d “ regretted it ever since ” he joined the call for Franken ’s resignation .
“ There ’s no excuse for sexual assault , ” he said .
“ But Al deserved more of a process .
I do n’t denigrate the allegations , but this was the political equivalent of capital punishment . ”
Senator Jeff Merkley , of Oregon , told me , “ This was a rush to judgment that did n’t allow any of us to fully explore what this was about .
I took the judgment of my peers rather than independently examining the circumstances .
In my heart , I ’ve not felt right about it . ”
Bill Nelson , the former Florida senator , said , “ I realized almost right away I ’d made a mistake .
I felt terrible .
I should have stood up for due process to render what it ’s supposed to — the truth . ”
Tom Udall , the senior Democratic senator from New Mexico , said , “ I made a mistake .
I started having second thoughts shortly after he stepped down .
He had the right to be heard by an independent investigative body .
I ’ve heard from people around my state , and around the country , saying that they think he got railroaded .
It does n’t seem fair .
I ’m a lawyer .
I really believe in due process . ”
More recently , there 's Jessica Rich , a 24 - year - old former Army reservist who one night early last month climbed drunk into her Volkswagen Jetta and drove south on a northbound interstate outside of Denver .
She slammed head - on into a sport- utility vehicle , killing herself and slightly injuring four others .
After a nine - month tour of Iraq in 2003 - and according to former soldiers who'd been in group therapy with her , having been raped during her service - PTSD was diagnosed .
Her friends say she never got past those experiences .
'' She was having nightmares still , up until this point - flashbacks and anxiety and everything , '' one told The Denver Post .
'' She said it was really hard to get over because she could n't get any help from anybody . ''
V. ' What 's Wrong With Me ? '
Earlier this winter , hoping to understand more about PTSD and its effects , I visited a couple of female Iraq vets who felt their postwar lives had been shaped - if not temporarily ruined - by the ' ' double whammy ' ' of combat and sexual stress .
Both happened to live in Colorado , though each had deployed to war through units located in other states .
I met Keri Christensen one morning at her home in a tidy subdivision outside of Denver , where she recently relocated from Wisconsin with her husband and two daughters .
She had just taken her daughters to school , and her husband was away on a business trip .
Christensen is 33 , blue - eyed and outwardly perky , with an easy smile .
By the time she was deployed to war in 2004 , she had finished 13 years of part - time service in the Wisconsin Army National Guard as a heavy - equipment transporter .
Prior to her deployment in Iraq , she loved her role in the military .
'' Before we were married , my husband was in awe of it , '' she said , laughing .
'' He was like , ' I met this girl and she hauls tanks ! ' ''
She added that she was good at what she did , receiving several awards over the years .
Beyond commitment to the Guard of one weekend a month and two weeks ' training each summer , Christensen spent the previous six years as a stay - at - home mom .
Her life , she said , had been a generally happy one .
But the stresses of deployment were surprisingly manifest : she agonized over leaving her daughters , who were then 6 and 2 years old .
Stationed in Kuwait , Christensen 's unit ran convoys of equipment back and forth from the port to inside Iraq .
'' It was really scary , '' she said , explaining that her convoy had been mortared during an early mission .
'' But it was like , Hey cool , we 're on a mission . ''
Then one day in February 2005 , Christensen was accidentally dragged beneath a truck trailer and run over , breaking a number of bones in her foot and injuring her knee and back .
She was assigned to a desk job in a tent in Kuwait , mostly working the night shift .
It was there , she said , that a sergeant above her in her command - a man she 'd known for 10 years - began making comments about her breasts and at one point baldly propositioned her for sex .
Something inside of her broke , she said .
Christensen claims that she was punished for even mentioning the situation to her company commanders - written up for minor infractions ; accused , she says falsely , of being intoxicated ( for which she was demoted ) ; and reassigned for duty to an airfield near a mortuary , where she occasionally helped load coffins of dead soldiers onto planes bound for the U.S. ( The Wisconsin Army National Guard denied that Christensen was punished for making a sexual - harassment claim and stated that the claim was investigated and dismissed for lack of evidence . )
Christensen says that a combination of war stress , harassment and the reprisals that followed were so upsetting and demoralizing that she considered suicide on several occasions .
Her military records show that during her deployment , she was given a diagnosis of depression and PTSD .
After Christensen 's experiences in Kuwait , she allowed her military enlistment to expire , which given that she was six years short of receiving military retirement benefits , only added to her pain .
'' That was my career , and they stole it from me , '' she said , sitting on an overstuffed couch in the family room of her home , idly fiddling with one of her children 's stuffed animals as she spoke .
'' They make you feel like you 're crazy .
And I 'm not just the only one .
There 's other women out there this has happened to .
Why is the attitude always ' Just shut up and leave it alone ' ? ''
Christensen had been home from war then for just over a year , having returned to her life as a stay - at - home mother , yet she could not shake what the deployment had done to her - the accident , the confusion and shame of her sexual harassment , and then what she felt was an ignominious demotion and marginalization after reporting the incidents .
And while there are those whose image of PTSD is still tied to Vietnam War movies - the province of men who earned their affliction only after having their best buddies die in their arms in a gush of blood - Christensen shares the same diagnosis .
That is to say that no matter what constituted her war experience , the aftermath was much the same .
She suffered from severe headaches and forgetfulness .
'' I feel like I 'm always forgetting something , '' she said .
'' I leave the house and I do n't know if I 've left something on - the stove or a candle .
I can't trust my memory . ''
She told me that her 8 - year - old , Madison , recently had to tell her the family 's new phone number .
She 'd lost friends and had ' ' rough spots ' ' with her husband .
Afraid of crowds , she started grocery shopping at 6 in the morning and was having her mother buy clothes for her children .
Driving , too , made her fearful , since she felt '' foggy ' ' and more than once ran a stop sign or a red light with her kids in the car .
Though she went for counseling and medical treatment at a local V.A. while living in Illinois after she returned from Iraq , Christensen had not yet found her way to the Denver V.A. for treatment .
The thought of getting in her car and making the 20 - minute drive petrified her .
A veteran F.B.I. agent on a bank - robbery detail was fatally wounded yesterday morning , apparently when another agent ’s weapon accidentally discharged during a confrontation with three gunmen outside a bank in a quiet town in central New Jersey , the authorities said .
While the circumstances were still under investigation , a statement by the F.B.I. said that the agent , Barry Lee Bush , 52 , of the bureau ’s Newark office , “ may have been fatally wounded as a result of the accidental discharge of another agent ’s weapon during a dynamic arrest situation . ”
In the 99 - year history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Mr. Bush , who was married and the father of two grown children , was the 51st agent killed in the line of duty , and the first to be fatally shot in 10 years .
He had worked for the bureau for almost 20 years , in Newark , Kansas City , Mo. , and elsewhere .
The events yesterday that led to the agent ’s death were part of an extensive federal , state and local task force investigation organized in response to a series of bank robberies this year in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties .
Teams , some with shotguns , some in SWAT gear , wearing bullet - resistant vests and armed with assault rifles , have staked out some banks in central New Jersey in recent weeks .
The team yesterday was following a group of suspects .

Imagine this for a moment .
You are a young man , totally indoctrinated in your religion .
Anyone who does n't follow your religion is evil and is condemned to hell .
Those who seem to follow that religion , but are called by a different name are worse than almost anyone else .
Got all that ?
Now , suppose that your country is invaded by the country that your preachers and leaders have told you is worse than anyplace else on Earth , where they do n't understand , or want to understand your religion , your culture , your history or your society .
The invaders depose your elected leader , who has been accused of being a war criminal , and install a government that favors the invader .
The invader can't understand why this would tick people off , and instead of trying to work with and understand the people , goes to towns where the unrest is at its highest , shells the towns with heavy artillery , forces all the people to leave their homes , and arrests hundreds of young men , simply because they 're young and from that town .
Perhaps one of these young men is your brother , or your cousin .
While your relative is in jail , his family is suffering .
He is n't available to help with chores , or to bring in money for food or medicine .
While your relative is in jail , you have no communication with him .
Suddenly , you see pictures of the invaders torturing and humiliating these young men , pictures that are spread all over the world .
You hear rumors that some of these young men have been sent halfway around the world to stand trial , and you do n't understand why this should be .
Now suppose your name is John Smith , the country is the US , and the invader is China or the UN .
What would you do ?
Would you sit there idly and watch your country subjugated ?
Or would you make improvised explosive devices and plant them to go off when enemy convoys were going by ?
Would you try to destroy your enemy and his puppet government ?
Would you set off bombs in public places , in order to try and kill some enemy troops and puppet officials ?
Would you try to kidnap and kill those who have destroyed your country and your society ?
Would reprisals make you back off , or would you just be sneakier , make it harder to find specific individuals and groups to blame ?
Would you stop at anything to free your country ?
Once you can honestly answer this question , then you can look at US behavior in Iraq and Afghanistan and understand that the war there will never end , not so long as one US troop is there .
Our political masters know this .
They know that the ' temporary ' measures they have instituted , for the ' duration of the war ' are permanent .
The only purpose of these various acts and temporary measures is to solidify power in the hands of the federal gooferment .
Guess what ?
Soon ( as in it 's already happening ) you will have to have ID to step outside of your house .
You will be stopped for any or no reason and asked to show your ' papers . '
Unless this crisis is curtailed , there will eventually be rationing of gas , oil , or other ' resources vital to national security . '
Unless this crisis is curtailed , at some point the paranoid imbeciles in power will use some excuse to declare martial law , just so they feel secure in their power .
This might be a ' terrorist attack . '
It might just be something like 'we have credible evidence that a terrorist attack will occur . '
It might be another major storm , like Katrina .
The excuse would be ; 'oh , we 're making sure the failures of agencies during Katrina wo n't be repeated , therefore all emergency response will be centralized out of one office . '
It does n't really matter what the excuse is , at some point , some event will arise that will serve .
Wake up , people !
The country we all grew up in is DEAD !
It was killed by grasping , scheming politicians and corporations and other special interest groups .
The illusion of freedom is long gone , buried under a morass of laws designed to crush our spirits .
All that 's left is the decaying corpse of an ideal , an ideal that many people still believe in .
Hell , I believe in it myself !
Unfortunately , the only ones who profit by continuing the ideal are the maggots in positions of power , feeding off what 's left of our freedoms .
That does n't change the fact that unless we begin to take active steps to bring the ideal back to life , we are condemned to live in a police state for the foreseeable future .
Worse , our kids and grandkids will have to face that as well .
And they wo n't even have the memory of what once was to hearten them .
What can we do ?
Get loud !
Let the politicians know you 're mad as hell .
If you vote , vote against every incumbent .
Write letters to the editor of your local paper .
If you do this , make sure your arguments are reasoned , calm , and rational .
You do n't want to come across as a wild - eyed revolutionary or commander of the tin beany brigade .
Do n't make comparisons to Hitler .
It does n't matter how apt such comparisons may be , too many people automatically shut off their thinking processes when they hear that .
( The old " It Can't Happen Here " syndrome . )
Can we make a difference ?
I really do n't know .
I do know that it is unconscionable to not make an effort .
I honestly fear what may happen in the near future under the current Chimp - in - chief and his minions .
I fear that they may lead us into a conflict that will not end until it results in such a catastrophe as has never been seen before in living memory on this planet .
For all of us .
For your kids and grandkids .
For yourself .
Make the effort .
Please .
Last week a vast bronze sculpture was unveiled in Montrose , on the east coast of Scotland , by Prince Andrew .
It depicts a hero of the second world war , wearing a seaman 's cap , who was decorated with " the equivalent of the George Cross " .
It 's a bit late , perhaps , but otherwise unsurprising - until I tell you that the hero was a dog .
The statue depicts a St Bernard called Bamse , which reputedly rescued two Norwegian sailors .
It is the latest manifestation of the new Cult of the Heroic Animal .
The Imperial War Museum in London is currently running an exhibition called The Animals ' War .
It features stuffed mascots , tales of the " desperate plight " of 200 animals trapped by the fighting in Iraq , and photos of dogs wearing gas masks .
It tells us about the " PDSA Dickin medal - the animals ' Victoria Cross " , which has been awarded to 23 dogs , 32 pigeons , three horses and one cat for " acts of conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in wartime " .
The museum resounds with cries of " aaah ! " and " how sweet ! " .
War is now cute .
Last year Disney released an animation called Valiant about the heroics of a group of messenger pigeons in the second world war .
In 2004 a vast sculpture called Animals at War was unveiled by Princess Anne on Park Lane in London .
It cost £ 1.5 m and is dedicated " to all the animals that served and died alongside British and allied forces in wars and campaigns throughout time ...
From the pigeon to the elephant , they all played a vital role in every region of the world in the cause of human freedom .
Their contribution must never be forgotten . "
In Liverpool there are now two statues commemorating a dog - Jet - that was used to find victims of air raids in the second world war .
I have no objection to remembering the suffering of animals .
If someone started a subscription for a statue of a battery pig or a broiler chicken ( conveniently forgotten by almost everyone ) , I might even contribute .
But the emphasis given to animals ' suffering in war highlights a failure to acknowledge the suffering of human beings .
The tableau in Park Lane carries the justifying motto : " They had no choice . "
Nor did the civilians killed in Iraq , the millions of women raped over the centuries by soldiers , or the colonial subjects who died of famine or disease in British concentration camps .
You would scour this country in vain for a monument to any of them .
Bamse has been dead for 62 years .
Both the Park Lane memorial and the exhibition at the Imperial War Museum were inspired by a book by Jilly Cooper - the patron saint of English bourgeois sentiment - called Animals in War .
But it was first published in 1983 .
It is only since the invasion of Iraq that this Disneyfication of war seems to have become a major industry .
Animals have featured in war memorials for at least 4,000 years .
But they have , for the most part , been used as representations of human dominance and courage .
The tableau in Park Lane , depicting a weary shire horse , two exhausted pack mules and an Irish setter seeking his master , could almost be a response to Landseer 's insouciant lions in Trafalgar Square .
If these beasts were conceived , like his , with anthropomorphic intent , they would represent the mute , trudging foot soldiers of the imperial army , prey to Trafalgar Square 's top predators .
The inscription might have read : " What passing - bells for these who die as cattle ? "
But they were n't .
No metaphor is intended here ; we are asked to concentrate on the suffering of the animals , not the infantry .
The monument has an interesting list of sponsors .
Alongside the RSPCA , Battersea Dogs ' Home , the Household Cavalry and the Amalgamation of Racing Pigeons is an odd collection of industrialists .
There 's Sir Anthony Bamford , who runs JCB and who was exposed a few days ago as the president of the Midlands Industrial Council ( MIC ) , which has donated almost £ 1 m to the Conservative party .
The Labour party accuses the MIC of exploiting a loophole in electoral laws , which oblige donors to reveal their identity .
There 's Lord Ballyedmond , who - both directly and through his company Norbrook Laboratories - gave £ 1.1 m to the Tories in 2001 .
They are joined by the PR company Spa Way ( best known for representing the " private security contractor " Tim Spicer ) ; the late property developer and former Conservative councillor Sir Stanley Clarke ; and Eva and Kirsten Rausing , the niece and daughter - in - law of the Swedish industrialist Hans Rausing , whose tax affairs have caused some controversy here and who has donated £ 343,000 to the Conservative party .
Perhaps the most interesting name on the list is William S Farish III .
An old friend of the Bush family , he is a major donor to the Republican party and was the US ambassador to Britain from 2001 to 2004 .
One of his tasks here was justifying the war with Iraq .
He inherited much of his money from his grandfather , the Texan oil millionaire William S Farish II .
In 1942 William S Farish II pleaded " no contest " to charges of criminal conspiracy with the Nazis , and was denounced by Senator Harry Truman for behaviour that " approaches treason " .
Through the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey , of which he was president , he was alleged to have run a cartel with the German company IG Farben .
Farben manufactured Zyklon B , the poison used in the gas chambers , and ran a plant using slave labour at Auschwitz .
Among other deals , William S Farish II had agreed to share patents for making synthetic gasoline and artificial rubber with Farben , while withholding them from the US navy .
He was fined and died soon afterwards .
His son died a few weeks later in an air accident , leaving the family fortune to William S Farish III .
So what is going on ?
What is so appealing about these memorials to the members of the royal family who agreed to unveil them , to the crowds who have packed the new exhibition , and to the rightwing multimillionaires who financed the giant tableau ?
Why , when the war we started in Iraq appears to have killed hundreds of thousands of human beings , have we become obsessed by the non-human victims of conflict ?
I 'm not sure , but the last panel in the Imperial War Museum 's exhibition offers a possible explanation .
It reproduces the inscription on a monument erected by the British in Port Elizabeth , South Africa , raised to commemorate " the animals that died in the Anglo - Boer War , 1899 - 1902 " .
This was a war of almost unprecedented brutality in which the British beat the Boers by burning down their homes and herding them into the world 's first large - scale concentration camps , where more than 40,000 people died .
" The greatness of a nation , " the inscription says , " consists not so much in the number of its people or the extent of its territory , as in the extent and justice of its compassion . "
This is a worthy index , on which Britain would have been placed close to the bottom , unless we were judged by our compassion - or sentiment - for animals .
These monuments , perhaps , permit us to see ourselves as kind people , even as unspeakable acts are committed on our behalf .

Oversize clothes should have obesity helpline numbers sewn on them to try and reduce Britain 's fat crisis , a leading professor said today .
And new urban roads should only be built if they have cycle lanes , according to Naveed Sattar , Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow .
Also see
• Surgeons to carry out plastic surgery on obese children
• Major obesity surgery for children will be available on the NHS
He is calling for more government intervention with a central agency set up to deal with the problems of obesity .
Britain's fat problem is so acute that it could even bankrupt the health system if nothing is done .
More than half of the UK population is overweight and more than one in five adults is obese .
Obese people are at high risk of health problems and treating them takes up an estimated 9 per cent of the health budget .
Prof Sattar is calling for more political intervention .
He and his colleagues say food manufacturers should also display energy content of all meals and snacks at retail and catering outlets .
The saturated fat content of all ready meals and snacks should also be clearly labelled .
New urban roads should only be built if they have safe cycle lanes and new housing complexes should be constructed only if they have sports facilities and green park areas , he says .
He also wants to see adviceline numbers attached to all clothes sold with waists above 102 cm for men , 94 cm for boys , 88 cm or size 16 for women and 80 cm for girls .
Such measures would affect comedian Dawn French who runs her own clothes shop Sixteen 47 , catering for women up to a size 47 .
Prof Sattar also wants ads for slimming services without independent evaluation banned , TV ads for sweets and snacks stopped before 9 pm , higher tax on high fat and high sugar foods and tax breaks for genuine corporate social responsibility .
In this week 's British Medical Journal , Prof Sattar says education should be provided at all levels to change behaviour towards diet and physical activity , and obesity made a core part of all medical training .
" People clearly have some responsibility for their health , but society and government have a responsibility to make the preferred , easy choices healthier ones , " he said .

At first glance , shoppers passing the advertising hoarding might be surprised to see David Beckham manhandling a curvy blonde who is quite obviously not his wife - but they would be mistaken .
Incredibly , the woman in the photo really is Victoria - given what can best be described as the J - Lo treatment .
The former Spice Girl , who is a size six , has had her body shape dramatically changed by airbrushing in the artwork advertising the couple 's perfume , Intimately Beckham .
The most striking difference is on her rear , which has been lifted and expanded , giving it a look more than reminiscent of famously curvy actress Jennifer Lopez .
She has also been given Tina Turner - style thunderthighs instead of the spindly legs fans are uesd to seeing squeezed into drainpipe jeans .
Airbrushing expert Chris Bickmore , who has retouched pictures for several magazines , said yesterday : " Victoria 's skin has been retouched to such an extent that there is no detail in it at all .
This just is n't natural .
" Also , everyone knows that Victoria is a really skinny woman yet he she seems to suddenly have a voluptuous backside . "
The Beckhams ' his 'n'hers perfumes were unveiled by Superdrug yesterday , in pink bottles for Victoria 's and brown for David's .
A spokesman said the scents ' convey their world of sophistication , luxury and intimacy ' , but by yesterday morning only 50 people in the whole country had requested the perfume .
Every day , 17 Americans die of organ failure .
In Israel , the average wait for a kidney transplant is four years .
In response , a global gray market has bloomed .
In India , for example , poor sellers are quickly matched with sick buyers from Taiwan .
Critics call it " transplant tourism . "
Proponents say the market is meeting a need .
The Monitor follows three men : an unemployed Brazilian and an ailing Israeli , as well as a South African investigator who helped bust an organ - trafficking ring .
The case raises anew hard legal and ethical questions , such as : Who owns our bodies ?
Should it be illegal to sell an organ if it could save someone 's life ?
What is the government 's role in protecting two vulnerable groups - the poor , who are willingly exploited , and the sick , who are desperate for healing ?
On a warm afternoon in Recife , a city on Brazil 's northeastern coast , Hernani Gomes da Silva sits alone in the Bar Egipcio , quietly nursing a drink , ruminating about his predicament .
He is 32 years old and still lives in his mother 's two - room house .
Rain comes in through the roof , and cockroaches and rats scuttle across the cement floor .
He has three kids , a wife who loathes him , and a mistress 20 years his senior .
He is unemployed with no money , no skills , and a criminal record .
The future is bleak .
Suddenly the words " we pay people $ 6,000 " leap out at him from behind .
His radar clicks on .
" I do n't mean to eavesdrop , " he says , turning to the bald man sitting at a nearby table .
" Were you talking about earning money from transplants ? "
He has heard of others in Recife who have sold their organs and can't believe his good fortune .
" Yes , " says the man .
" Which organ ? " Hernani asks .
" The kidney .
Why , are you interested ? "
" Of course I 'm interested . "
" What blood type are you ? " the man asks .
" O- positive , " says Hernani .
The man nods - it 's the most compatible blood type .
It 's 2002 and Hernani has passed the first test for selling a kidney to an organization that will stretch across three continents ; make hundreds of thousands of dollars for the people behind it ; and rouse the interest of police , politicians , ethicists , and doctors around the world .
Soon Hernani is walking home , dreaming of a motorbike and a roof that does n't leak .

More than 5,000 miles away across an ocean , Arie Pach , a stout Israeli lawyer in failing health , sees his future flash before him .
It makes him shudder .
As he heads to an appointment on the sixth floor of Jerusalem 's Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital , he walks past the dialysis ward .
Below the glare of fluorescent lights , the thin , feeble - looking patients sit in special armchairs hooked up to oven - sized machines that click and whir and simulate the job of the human kidney :
They clean the patient 's blood .
It 's a life - preserving process for people whose kidneys have failed , but they have to be connected roughly three hours at a time , three days a week .
In February 2002 , Arie 's doctors told him his kidneys were beginning to falter .
By early 2003 , he 's had minor surgery to prepare for dialysis , but he is already formulating plans to avoid the ward .
" I do n't want to be one of those people with big needles in my arm , getting my blood changed in and out of the machine like a car going for an oil change , " he thinks .
Then there 's the expense of dialysis to the healthcare system - about $ 45,000 to $ 50,000 per year .
And only some 10 percent of dialysis patients live more than 10 years , according to the US National Center for Health Statistics .
Arie has too many things left to do in life .
He loves to travel abroad with his wife .
One of his two sons will marry this summer .
To see any grandchildren , he 's got to stick around .
But the doctors warn him that his blood could soon start to become toxic .
They give him two choices : dialysis or a kidney transplant .

In the seaside resort city of Durban , South Africa , private investigator Johan Wessels is working in his home office , plinking away at the computer keyboard .
The phone rings .
It 's a woman from the health department .
She wants to know if he'd be willing to work on a case under something called the Human Tissue Act .
In 24 years as a police detective and private investigator , Johan has tackled all kinds of cases - smuggling , embezzlement , bribery .
He 's achieved a 98 percent conviction rate .
But he 's never heard about this act and has little idea what he 's getting into as he says yes .
Hanging up , he yells to his wife , Carol , in the kitchen .
" That was the health department .
They want me to investigate some case about human tissues . "
His partner of 29 years is pleased .
" I 've been praying all morning about you getting more work , " she says .
Both are " reborn Christians . "
They read the Bible daily and sit up front at church on Sundays .
His curiosity piqued , Johan is faxed a copy of South Africa 's Human Tissue Act and scans it .
Sect. 1 : " [ T ] issue means ... any flesh , bone , organ , gland , or body fluid .... "
Sect. 28 : " No person ... may receive any payment in ... the ... acquisition ... of any tissue .... "
Section 33 : Violators " shall be ... liable ... to a fine not exceeding 2,000 Rand or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year .... "
One year in jail or a fine of about $ 300 .
This thing has " no teeth , " Johan thinks .
Maybe that 's why they 're buying and selling organs in South Africa .
It 's June 2003 , and Johan is embarking on what will become one of the toughest cases of his career - not only a test of his detective skills , but also of the ethical and religious values he holds dear .
Hernani goes to South Africa
Hernani has big dreams for the $ 6,000 he 's expecting to get for one of his kidneys .
But he also has doubts .
One day as he 's walking home - wondering if the South Africans will take a lung or cornea , too , or just abandon him in a country where he can't speak the language - he bumps into a friend who 's driving a shiny white Volkswagen .
He 's heard through the grapevine that this friend is one of dozens from Recife who went to South Africa and came back alive .
The early ones got $ 10,000 for their kidneys , a fortune in a neighborhood where many earn the minimum wage - about $ 1,000 a year .
Hernani gets in the car .
He is not normally the inquisitive type , but today he pelts his friend with questions .
" How much did you get paid ? " he asks .
" Do they pay in advance ? "
" How were you treated ? "
" What is the operation like ? "
" Do they take care of you ? "
" Will I be OK ? "
The friend says all the right things .
Ten minutes later , Hernani gets out of the car , his mind at rest .
He is going to South Africa to sell his kidney .
* * *
In the months since they met in Egipcio's , Hernani and the little bald man - he calls him Captain Ivan - have become fast friends .
Ivan Bonifacio da Silva , a retired police officer , has taken Hernani under his wing , patiently explaining how the kidney switch works , and assuaging his lingering concerns .
He 's also been shepherding him into a whole new world .
He tells Hernani where to get the tests to prove he 's healthy enough for the operation .
He 's with Hernani when he gets the passport that will allow him to leave Brazil for the first time in his life .
And in October 2002 , on the eve of Hernani 's trip to Durban , Captain Ivan hands him $ 500 - and assures him there is another $ 5,500 waiting for him when he gets home .
Six thousand dollars .
It 's somewhere near the average going rate for kidneys in today 's global organ trade .
Palestinian men who sold their kidneys in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq after the first Gulf War got just $ 500 to $ 1,000 .
They helped make Iraq the organ - trading hub of the Arab world until the latest war broke out .
In the slums of Manila , where corneas , livers , and lungs are also offered for sale , kidneys fetch about $ 2,000 , according to Nancy Scheper - Hughes , cofounder of Organs Watch , a group at the University of California , Berkeley , that tracks the trade .
Some Israeli organ donors have gotten $ 20,000 , she says .
And a few American sellers have gotten $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 for their kidneys .
But $ 500 is more than Hernani has ever held in his hands .
Captain Ivan tells him to make sure Daisy , Hernani 's wife , has enough for when he 's gone , and to buy some new clothes .
Hernani hardly has to be told twice .
Within an hour , he 's walking through the sliding doors of the Shopping Recife mall and into a new life .
The lights are bright and the giant windows are filled with personal beer kegs , colorful shirts , and tiny cameras that seem to seduce him , whispering :
You 've got money now , you can afford it , come in , buy me .
Hernani quickly succumbs to the mall 's sirens .
He buys five or six polo shirts .
He buys a new pair of lace - up shoes .
He buys two pairs of jeans , tripling the number of long pants in his wardrobe .
He goes to the food court and fulfills a lifelong dream of buying a cappuccino .
At the supermarket he fills his cart with rice , beans , bread , milk , eggs , and the ultimate luxury food - meat .
For about $ 2 he buys enough beef to feed his family for a month .
This is just the beginning , he thinks , as he sits down later that night at a fancy restaurant .
Things are different now .
I am somebody .
I 'm a consumer .
* * *
But when he opens the metal door to his house just after midnight , he realizes money can't change everything .
Daisy is lying on the carpet they call their bed .
She 's angry .
She knows he 's been to see his mistress , Antonia .
And she knows he has spent most of the money on himself , even though it was supposed to be the down payment on their new life .
Yet no matter how much she has come to detest him over the past few years , she can't stop herself from worrying .
" Do n't go , " she tells him as he lies down beside her .
" You do n't know what might happen .
They could do anything , take anything .
You do n't know who they are or what they want . "
" Shut up , " Hernani barks .
" Let me go to sleep . "
" It could be a trap , Hernani , " she persists .
" You might not get out alive . "
Actually , in this brave new world of kidney selling , donors rarely die .
But Daisy 's fears are n't totally unfounded .
In India , about 2,000 people sell a kidney each year .
One study there in 2002 found 86 percent of organ sellers saying they had significant declines in their health in the three years after surgery .
In the eastern European nation of Moldova , some 300 peasants sold their kidneys between 1999 and 2002 .
A study by Organs Watch found 79 percent of Moldovan donors with health problems in the months and years after the procedure .
But in the darkness of their house that night , with the promise of a payday to beat all paydays , Hernani ignores his wife 's anxious pleading .
" Daisy , I 'm doing this , " he says , cursing her .
More harsh words are exchanged , and she flees to the next room to sleep with her son .
The next morning he pecks her on the cheek , slips quietly out the door , and heads to the airport .
* * *
Hernani lands in the lush , hilly city of Durban , which sits on the Indian Ocean .
How different and luxurious things are here , he thinks .
The house where his hosts keep him and several other Brazilian kidney donors is enormous .
The living room alone is bigger than his whole house back home .
There 's even a hot tub .
An interpreter stays with them all day , and a facilitator buys them a CD player so they can dance around the living room to Brazilian songs that remind them of home .
Sometimes the hosts take them out to dinner .
Hernani , who rarely has enough money to buy even pork , tries ostrich meat .
October 2002 blends into November .
Mostly , they spend their days lying about the house , waiting for the call .
When it finally comes , Hernani is whisked off to St. Augustine 's Hospital , a sprawling modern complex set high on a green hillside overlooking the ocean .
He and the others are , after all , here for business .
They are several of the roughly 300 Brazilian and Israeli sellers that police say were brought to South Africa between 2001 and 2003 .
The syndicate was run , police say , by an Israeli named Ilan Perry .
He and the other organizers were making hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits .
They probably picked South Africa because it has top - notch medical facilities and one of the world 's best transplant - success rates .
It also has weak laws regulating the sale of human organs .
Hernani has signed lots of forms , including one that says he 's " related " to the man to whom he 's about to give his kidney .
Finally he meets this man - an Israeli named Amiram Aharoni - for the first time .
Walking into the room , it 's then that Hernani understands the magnitude of what he 's about to do .
Mr. Aharoni is all swollen and pale .
He cries when he sees Hernani .
He 's too weak to lift himself up .
But his wife passes along their message with a tender hug .
" You are part of our family now , " she says .
" From this moment on , you are our flesh and blood . "
The operation takes place on Nov. 26 , 2002 , and lasts several hours .
Lying in two nearby operating rooms , Hernani and Aharoni undergo surgery at the same time .
Hernani has three surgeons operating on him because of the complexity of the procedure , which sometimes involves removing a rib .
When Aharoni wakes up , he has a fresh kidney and a new lease on life .
When Hernani comes to , he feels a tightness where the wound has been stitched shut .
But three days later , when he finally boards the plane back to Brazil , he is a happy man .
He is going to be rich .
* * *
That joy fades fast as he arrives back at his mother 's house in Recife .
It 's been almost 24 hours since his plane landed , and Daisy is scowling at him .
She suspects he 's been to see Antonia .
She 's both relieved and depressed to see him alive and back in her life .
She 's tired of their sad marriage .
She 's sure he does n't really care about the three children jumping around the street - or about Daisy herself , who dropped out of school at 14 to set up a home with him .
Even after weeks on the other side of the world , the man taking a red bicycle out of the taxi does n't even look at her .
" Luiza , go and get yourself ready .
We 're going into town to get you a bicycle , " he shouts to his 9 - year - old daughter as he hands the new bike to his son , Hernandes .
Then he turns his back and walks toward the local plaza .
He 's determined to have some fun .
After all , he has money in his pocket - $ 5,500 in crisp new $ 100 bills handed to him by Captain Ivan under the table at a fast - food restaurant near a local branch of Citibank .
For someone who has been poor all his life , money is to be spent , not saved or budgeted .
And spend it he does .
In the first few months of 2003 , Hernani pays $ 1,700 to replace the roof , the floor , the walls , the windows , and the wiring in his mother 's house .
He uses $ 1,600 to pay off her credit cards .
Another $ 1,200 buys him a brand new Honda CG 125 motorcycle , which he insists the dealer deliver to his house so his neighbors can see .
On New Year 's Eve , he buys Daisy a new blouse and skirt .
He figures that leaves him somewhere between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 to spend on drink and other women .
Life is good .
Paying a healthy stranger
While Hernani is busy blowing through his money , in Israel Arie Pach is hoping to avoid a life tied to a dialysis machine .
But he 's running out of options .
He 's been ruminating over them since 1995 when doctors first detected a problem with his kidneys .
He knows that patients who get kidneys tend to live longer than those on dialysis .
So he considers turning to his wife or sons for a kidney .
Since they come in pairs , a healthy person can live on just one .
But his wife and oldest son have the wrong blood type .
His youngest son is a match , but he has health problems similar to Arie's .
So getting a kidney from a related donor is out .
Another possibility : Signing up for Israel 's national waiting list , which already has more than 500 people on it .
But the wait time can be as long as four years for someone of Arie 's age - those under 18 get priority - which means most go onto dialysis .
For religious reasons , Israel 's cadaver donation rate is relatively low , although its rate of donation among living relatives is above average .
And anyway , organs from live donors are more effective than cadaveric ones .
So Arie and Mary , his wife of 36 years , feel they have no other alternative .
They 're left to consider paying a healthy stranger for a kidney .
Mary has been an operating - room nurse for more than 25 years .
She encourages Arie to find a living donor .
" If you go for a transplant at the very end , after years of dialysis , your body is all worn out , " she says .
" If you do it before you get to dialysis , you have a much better chance of the surgery being successful . "
Buying a kidney in Israel is against Health Ministry regulations , but there 's no penalty associated with the rule - yet .
As in many countries , the legal ground is soft .
Going abroad for a kidney operation is perfectly legitimate , and in such cases questions are rarely asked about how the organ was obtained .
Even under a new proposal that would punish brokers , recipients would not be prosecuted because they 're victims of failing health and opportunistic organ brokers , says Meir Broder , legal adviser to the Health Ministry .
For Arie , who has spent a lifetime practicing law , the ethics of a kidney purchase are still complicated .
He does n't want , for instance , to exploit a poor person who 's just trying to feed a family .
Yet he 's torn .
" Everyone is the boss of his own body , and if someone healthy wants to give away one of his own kidneys , I can't see why it should n't be done , " he says .
" There has to be informed consent . "
Then there 's the religious element .
Arie and Mary are n't particularly devout , but they discuss the guidance Judaism offers .
Arie finally concludes , " There really is nothing holy except for God and human life , " and since " donating an organ is saving a life , " it 's entirely ethical .
Religious beliefs often figure in decisions about organ trading .
They 're invoked both to encourage and discourage it .
The Old Testament story of Hagar bearing a child for Abraham ( because his wife , Sarah , is " barren " ) , is often cited as the first case of surrogate motherhood .
Some people use this scripture to justify paying someone to be a surrogate for an organ , says Dr. Scheper - Hughes of Organs Watch .
Or as one Israeli doctor said to her , " God performed the first transplant " when he took a rib out of Adam and created Eve .
In many Christian circles , too , there 's the belief that " your body is a gift from God , " says Scheper - Hughes , " or that you have use - rights over your body , but that it belongs to God . "
Yet one reason Israelis rarely donate organs after death is that many Jews believe the body is sacred , and should be whole at the time of burial .
Orthodox Jews believe that the deceased should be intact for the Resurrection they believe will follow the coming of the Messiah .
But views are shifting .
" If someone needs to save his life and the only way to motivate someone to help him do that is by financial incentive , then I do n't think they should prevent people from doing that in order to save lives , " says Robert Berman , the founder of the New York - based Halachic Organ Donor Society , which has enlisted prominent rabbis to encourage donation .
" The fact is that people are dying and that there are not enough organs going around to save their lives , " he says .
" There 's a widespread misperception that organ donation is categorically prohibited by Jewish law .
It is not .
Jewish law supports saving lives . "
Meanwhile , after many conversations , Arie and Mary agree they 're making the right choice .
" This decision , " says Mary , " completely changes the course of your life . "

Arie soon discovers buying a kidney is a pretty easy path to take in Israel .
In dialysis units , in doctors ' offices , even in newspaper classified ads , the names of organ brokers - people who arrange kidney trades - are an open secret .
For $ 60,000 to $ 150,000 , a new kidney can be purchased .
Arie starts surfing the Web , looking at clinics in the United States that do transplant surgery .
A friend suggests a medical - advice hotline run by an aide to an influential rabbi .
" People call him and say , ' I need an operation ' and ' Who 's good ? ' " says Arie .
He tries it and gets the name of a doctor in Tel Aviv .
Soon , he 's put in touch with a broker who tells him a transplant , done in South Africa , will cost $ 100,000 , with 10 percent paid up front .
It 's a lot of money , but Arie figures he can at least manage the down payment from his retirement fund .
Many Israelis , even those without great wealth or savings , find ways to cover the cost .
Israel 's health - insurance funds reimburse patients as much as $ 70,000 for any medical procedure done abroad .
Technically they 're not supposed to pay for illegal operations , but if it 's done outside Israel , it 's off their radar screen .
Critics say the health - care companies are turning a blind eye to an international racket .
Government and health officials say there 's no way to control what a patient does outside Israeli territory .
There is an attractive economic component to this setup .
Paying $ 70,000 for one kidney transplant is far cheaper than $ 50,000 a year for life in dialysis bills .
But it 's more than money .
The transplant recipient is healthier , and has a better quality of life than a dialysis patient .
Some argue that since the trade is already flourishing , and is difficult to stop , the best way to protect sellers is to decriminalize it and create a regulated market .
Michael Friedlaender is one of Arie 's doctors after the operation and heads the kidney - transplant follow - up unit at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem .
He once opposed organ sales .
Now he advocates a legal market .
Under the current system , he says , if something goes wrong during surgery , or if the financial transaction turns out to be a scam , neither the donor nor the recipient has any legal recourse .
A regulated system , he says , would change that , and allow for things like malpractice suits , which help safeguard the process .
In a free market , Dr. Friedlaender argues , it 's unethical not to pay for an organ .
" Someone 's saving your life , " he says , " and you 're not going to reward him ?
We pay for every other service in the world . "
Donating an organ is one of the most valuable services , " because it saves a life . "
* * *
Only a few weeks after making contact with the broker , Arie gets the call .
" We have a donor for you in South Africa , " the broker says .
Then things move fast .
Plane tickets are delivered .
He gives the broker a $ 10,000 downpayment , with the rest payable when he 's admitted to the hospital for surgery .
Suddenly he and Mary are on their way to South Africa .
On April 8 , 2003 , they arrive at St. Augustine's .
With its warm yellow walls , highly polished floors , and views of the ocean , the transplant ward is one of the most luxurious in the country .
They 're struck by the professionalism of the staff .
But they hit a snag .
It turns out that Arie 's donor has high blood pressure and is rejected by the syndicate .
This comforts Arie and Mary , and persuades them that the doctors and brokers are n't just trying to scam them or the Brazilians .
But the first donor is n't the only Brazilian there .
Arie and Mary often hear Brazilian music wafting through the hospital hall , and the TVs are tuned to soccer .
After several days of more tests , a suitable donor is found .
Arie soon meets the young man ( Arie wo n't reveal his name ) who 's going to change his life .
He 's tall , thin , and youthful .
He grins constantly .
Through a translator he says he does n't smoke or drink .
He just wants to improve his life by getting married and going to college to become an architect .
As they talk , Arie keeps trying to remember how to say " thank you " in Portuguese .
" Ob... , Ob ... , " he stutters .
" Obrigado , " Mary chimes in .
Through his interpreter , he asks the Brazilianif he really consents wholehearteldy to giving his kidney .
The young man smiles , and says , " Yes . "
He offers his hand to Arie , and the two men shake as they are wheeled into the operating room .
Surgery falls on the eve of Passover , the Jewish holiday that celebrates the Children of Israel 's passage from slavery into the freedom of the Promised Land .
As he 's lying on the gurney , being wheeled into the operating room , he whispers , " Shma Yisrael , " a Jewish prayer that affirms God 's oneness and the commandment to love God with all one 's heart , soul , and mind .
That evening , back at the hotel , Mary feels lonely and apprehensive .
Some local Jewish families have invited her to celebrate Passover with them , but she does n't feel like being cheery and social .
In her room , she lights some candles and reads the Passover story .
Perhaps the surgery will finally let her husband find a new freedom of his own .
The next day she sees him , and he does n't look well .
He 's pale gray and connected to machines she 's seen all her professional life , but it 's different when it 's her husband .
To her relief , the doctors say the surgery was a success .
In the following days , Arie meets his donor again .
They pose for photographs .
The Brazilian wraps an arm around Arie , flashes a thumbs up sign , and beams .
In his bright red shirt , he looks like a fan whose team has just won the championship .
The ring is busted
Unknown to him , under South Africa 's 1983 Human Tissue Act , Arie and his donor have broken the law .
But the organ brokers and doctors are the ones making the biggest profits - and are the real targets of the police .
Buying and selling kidneys across three continents is , in some ways , the perfect 21st - century crime .
That 's what South African investigator Johan Wessels realizes as he gets further and further into his new case .
For one thing , it occurs in several jurisdictions , all of which are thousands of miles apart .
And it's hard to determine where exactly the crime - handing over the money - takes place .
And if one country starts cracking down , the syndicate can hop to another .
In working the case , Johan has teamed up with a group from the elite Commercial Branch , South Africa 's equivalent of the FBI 's white - collar - crime unit .
The team is headed by Capt .
Louis Helberg , a reserved man .
By the middle of 2003 , the team has a firm idea of what 's going on .
Donors are getting $ 6,000 to $ 18,000 for their kidneys .
They 're coming from Israel , Brazil , and maybe Russia and Romania , given the Eastern European - sounding names on the hospital records .
Two doctors at St. Augustine 's appear to be heavily involved .
It looks as if some of the South Africans have pocketed as much as $ 450,000 doing more than 107 operations .
Police say the organizers meet 11 of the 12 criteria for a " syndicate " - a criminal enterprise akin to the mafia .
There 's only one criterion the group has n't met : no one has been killed , say the investigators .
* * *
After one long day working on the investigation , Johan , Captain Helberg , and another detective head to a burger joint .
They get some weak coffee and fall into conversation about the case .
" How far would you go if one of your kids needed a kidney ? " asks one detective .
The question opens a debate on the validity and ethics of the very law they 've sworn to uphold .
For most people , the initial response to buying or selling a body part is revulsion .
It 's what bioethicists call " the yuck factor . "
But the moral underpinning of that feeling - which in turn becomes codified as law - is often hard to articulate , says Walter Robinson , a pediatrician and bioethicist at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge , Mass .
" It 's a violation of ' naturalness , ' " he says .
" But ' naturalness ' is difficult to describe . "
It can emanate from people 's moral or religious values , subtle prejudices , or tradition .
Personal or societal definitions of " naturalness " can change , Dr. Robinson observes .
They have shifted in the US for instance , regarding interracial marriage and homosexuality .
Revulsion aside , " If one of mine was sick , I 'd do anything , " even though it 's illegal , Johan says , thinking of his two children .
" I 'd borrow lots of money .
I 'd even sell the farm , " he says , referring to one of his favorite places in the world , a 700 - acre spread that 's been in his family for four generations .
It 's a typical parental response - doing anything for a child .
In fact , growing numbers of doctors and ethicists agree that people like Johan or Arie should be able to buy kidneys , and that people like Hernani should be able to sell them .
They argue , for instance , that banning organ sales robs sellers , who are often poor , of a rare option to escape poverty .
They also argue that high - minded efforts to shield the poor from themselves can be paternalistic or hypocritical .
" If the rich are free to engage in dangerous sports for pleasure ... it is difficult to see why the poor , who take the lesser risk of kidney selling ... should be thought so misguided as to need saving from themselves , " says Dr. Friedlaender in Israel .
But as the detectives ' coffee cools , they weigh the other side , too .
They wonder if rumors about " organjacking " - people being killed for their organs - might be true .
Critics say the current system has already jump - started a dangerous commodification of the human body , which could turn the world 's slums into reservoirs of body parts for the rich .
Today , in Manila 's slums , the selling of kidneys has led to sales of lungs and corneas .
As the detectives talk it through , Johan 's views develop .
" Life is already really cheap in our society , " he says later .
" People will kill each other for a firearm and a little cash . "
And if you start giving people money for their kidneys , " you 're going to start finding a lot of dead bodies with no organs . "
These kinds of gruesome scenarios are what seal Johan 's opinion .
The detectives get up from the table , strengthened in their resolve to break open the case .
* * *
A few weeks later , Johan adds another plank to his position .
As he 's eating breakfast , he tunes into an American TV news show .
A reporter is interviewing a mother whose 17 - year - old son , as Johan recalls , was killed in a car crash .
With the mother 's consent , doctors salvaged 47 organs and tissues from the boy 's body - corneas , kidneys , liver , lungs , heart .
" I did n't know they could get that many organs from one body , " Johan thinks to himself .
The reporter asks if the mother thinks she should be paid for all the organs her son gave away freely .
How could I take money for them ?
Johan remembers her saying .
God gave each of us the body we use when we 're alive .
He gave it to us for free .
How could we charge someone else for part of it ?
He calls his wife right away .
" This makes more sense to me as a Christian than anything else I 've heard , " he says to her .
* * *
The detectives have been toiling for months now , slowly piecing the trafficking puzzle together .
But in late November they get a major break .
The police team gets a call , out of the blue , from an officer at a nearby police station .
The cop has two Israelis with him .
One is accusing the other of stealing $ 18,000 , and there 's something about a kidney .
When the detectives later question the two men , they can't believe their ears .
One man , known as S. Zohr , admits he received $ 18,000 for agreeing to sell his kidney .
He 'd actually been lying on the operating table at St. Augustine 's , just moments away from surrendering his organ to an ailing Israeli man named Agania Robel , when he got spooked .
Zohr jumped off the table , grabbed his clothes , and bee - lined for the airport , trying to take the $ 18,000 with him .
But then , a man named Shushan Meir , who later is charged with being part of the syndicate , called the police and told them Mr. Zohr was stealing the money .
Mr. Meir apparently hoped , strangely enough , that the cops would help prevent this illegal deal from going sour .
It was the final confirmation the police needed to bust up the ring .
On the morning of Nov. 27 , 2003 - a year and a day after Hernani went under the knife - Johan , Helberg , and a police team that includes a photographer and several plainclothes detectives converge on the back parking lot at St. Augustine's .
They walk quickly up the hill into the facility 's transplant division .
Helberg , the team leader , announces that they have a search warrant and will be seizing files .
Johan adds that he's an independent investigator looking into crimes committed under the Human Tissue Act .
He does n't need a search warrant and can look at any of the clinic 's files at any time .
He steps into a side office where a whiteboard hangs on the wall .
Scrawled on it are two names - " A. Robel " and " Rogerio Bezzera " - and today 's date .
" What are those ? " he asks Lindy Dickson , a staff member who would later be arrested and charged with complicity in the scheme .
She tells him the two men are , at this moment , on operating tables upstairs .
Robel .
That 's the guy who was left stranded when Zohr jumped off the table last week , Johan realizes .
And he 's already been paired up with another donor , a Brazilian named Rogerio Bezzera da Silva .
With this , Johan gets a glimpse of the efficiency and sophistication of the syndicate .
Only days after one donor gets cold feet , the group has another one on the operating table .
This one , he will learn , is getting only $ 6,000 for his kidney .
Robel , the recipient , is paying $ 45,000 for a new organ .
Police decide against arresting the two men while they 're on operating tables , but several days later , they make three arrests .
Robel , the recipient , pleads guilty .
He 's fined about $ 770 and returns to Israel .
Two apparently low - level syndicate operatives , including Meir , are charged .
One makes a plea bargain , while Meir will be tried beginning July 13 .
Mr. Bezzera da Silva is n't charged , but he forfeits his $ 6,000 .
That same week , Brazilian police also arrest two Israelis and nine Brazilians .
The $ 6,000 is gone
Nearly a year after his South African trip , every last bit of Hernani's $ 6,000 is gone .
Daisy sells popsicles to pay the bills .
Hernani sold his motorbike after sliding off the road one rainy night and running into the back of a truck .
He now walks with a limp .
Hernani continues to see Antonia .
There is no dialogue between Hernani and Daisy , only the occasional monotone orders for her to get the phone , go shopping , mind the children .
He will not hold 9 - year - old Luiza 's hand when they walk around the neighborhood together , and he cannot , or will not , pay for her to play organized soccer , even though she controls the ball better than half the boys during their games in the street .
Hernani's plight is common among kidney sellers .
According to the study in India , organ selling actually increased poverty .
Some 54 percent of sellers were extremely poor before losing a kidney .
A year later , 74 percent were still in debt , and the average family income had declined by about 30 percent .
For Hernani , things could hardly get worse .
But they do .
On Tuesday , Dec. 2 , 2003 , Hernani , like 40 million other Brazilians , is watching the nightly news on TV Globo .
He 's had a tough day .
He 's heard that the friend with the white VW , who was instrumental in convincing Hernani to sell his kidney , was arrested in a surprise raid that morning .
No one knows why the Brazilian FBI would be after him .
Sitting on the couch that night with another friend , Hernani discovers why .
Police in South Africa have broken up an international organ - trafficking ring , he hears the announcer say .
Authorities have detained 11 people in the last 24 hours and expect to make more arrests .
The words " organ trafficking " and " arrests " jump out at him , just like that day when he heard a man behind him say : " We pay people $ 6,000 . "
But this time he 's full of dread .
" Man , you 've got to get out of here , " his friend warns .
One word that keeps coming into his head : " Why ? " I have done nothing wrong , harmed no one .
I crossed the world to give life to a dying man .
I sold only what was mine .
Why are they doing this ?
Why me ?
I am going to jail , Hernani thinks to himself .
Within minutes , he has changed his clothes and slips out into the night .
Soon he 's banging on the metal door of a local hot - sheet hotel , where rooms are rented by the hour .
The receptionist is surprised to see a single man looking for a room , but he accepts Hernani 's credit card and hands him a key .
Afraid and agitated , Hernani lies on the grotty hotel bed staring at himself in the mirror overhead .
He 's not reviewing his decision to sell his kidney .
He 's not worrying about the police finding him .
He 's worrying about whether he has enough money in the bank to pay the hotel bill - about $ 7 per night .
* * *
As the investigation continues into 2004 , Johan is still unsettled about his religious perspective on organ sales .
As he drives home one night , he realizes he's had a change of heart from his first inclination to " do anything " to save himself or one of his family members , including buying a kidney .
Knowing what he knows now , he'd try to figure out something legal .
For instance , he , his brother , and his best friend all have O - negative blood .
And they 've got an understanding :
If one of them ever needs blood - or maybe an organ - the others would step up .
He knows people who have done so .
A couple of years ago , a woman at his church donated her kidney to a fellow church member .
" It was such a huge sacrifice , " he thinks .
He realizes he 's become pretty passionate about this stuff .
But he still has n't found biblical guidance .
That night at home he goes to his bedroom and picks up his Bible .
He sits down on the bed and speaks into the silence .
" Lord , there has to be something in this book of yours about this , " he says .
He opens to a verse he had n't considered before .
Romans 12:1 .
He reads these words from Paul 's letter : " Give your bodies a living sacrifice . "
Paul may have meant something else when he wrote it , but to Johan it now feels important to donate his organs after death .
" Jesus sacrificed himself for everyone - gave his whole body for all mankind . "
The least we can do , he thinks , is give part of our body to someone else in need .
Finally he has what he 's been looking for .
* * *
Today , 14 months after his surgery , Arie Pach , now 57 years old , is living a new life of freedom - sort of .
His youngest son is getting married this summer , and Arie will be there under the wedding canopy .
But he 's told he 'll have to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of his life .
And he 's photosensitive ; he can't go out in the midday sun much and finds himself missing a day at the beach .
He used to like to swim , but now , on doctors ' orders , he has to beware of contracting an illness by going to public pools .
" I 'm more philosophical and more resigned about my own fate , " he says on a cool afternoon at home , where pastel flowers are in bloom in the tiny backyard garden .
" There are so many things in life that could have been worse , but thank God I 'm fine now , " he says .
And even though he has a new kidney from across the world , he 's still searching for a better solution .
" I have n't become religious , " he says , " but I guess you could say I pray more , to ask for a refuah shlema - a full healing . "
Epilogue
As far as investigators know , the syndicate that orchestrated kidney swaps for at least two yearsin Durban between Brazilians and Israelis is dismantled .
But the global trade - and the debate about it - rolls on .
In South Africa , four alleged syndicate members have been charged and await trial .
Johan Wessels and Captain Helberg and his team have expanded the investigation to hospitals in Johannesburg and Cape Town .
In Brazil , Captain Ivan is one of 28 ringleaders who have been indicted .
In all , some 50 cases are being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is expected to submit its findings in September .
Hernani has been helping , despite receiving death threats .
When he testified before Parliament in January , he wore sunglasses and a shirt up over most of his face to hide his identity .
Daisy , meanwhile , has made up her mind to leave him - as soon as she can raise the money to support herself and their children .
At one point , she considered selling a cornea .
She 's heard the going rate is nearly $ 30,000 .
Around the world , meanwhile , organ - sale laws are shifting .
In Israel , for instance , one proposed law by the Ministry of Health aims to halt the country 's involvement in the trade by targeting organ brokers - including penalties of up to three years in prison .
Another proposal would allow voluntary organ donors to have all of their related healthcare costs picked up , as well as compensation for lost time at work when recuperating from the surgery .
Others in Israel , such as Friedlaender , argue that the government should set up a fund to give substantial compensation to those who volunteer to be living donors .
In the US , Wisconsin recently became the first state to give living donors a tax deduction of up to $ 10,000 , to write off lost salary , and medical and travel costs .
At least 14 other states are considering similar measures .
And in April , President Bush signed the Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act , which reimburses living donors for expenses incurred during the process and funds research projects aimed at increasing donations .
But laws may not keep pace with a global market moving at the speed of commerce .
There is , for instance , skyrocketing demand for pieces of livers , which can grow into a fully functioning organ in a recipient .
Now a website - liver4you.org - promises " transplant surgery in as short as 10 days " in the Philippines .
Sitting in his office in Jerusalem , Friedlaender points to a small trinket hanging from one of his bookshelves .
One of his patients brought it to him a couple of months ago after going abroad to get a new kidney .
It 's from a country that may already have replaced South Africa as a hot spot for body - part trading .
It 's a red paper lantern from China .
Editor 's note
This report was written as a nonfiction narrative .
Specific scenes and dialogue are based largely on recollections of those who participated in the kidney - transplant trade , but did not know then it was illegal in South Africa .
The reporting was done over five months in four countries .
Correspondent Andrew Downie flew to Recife , Brazil , and met with Hernani Gomes da Silva and his wife , Daisy , four times over four days , reconstructing what happened .
Later , he confirmed more facts and details by phone with the da Silvas , their attorney , and Brazilian police .
The Monitor paid Mr. Gomes da Silva its standard photo fee for use of a picture of him with his Israeli kidney recipient in South Africa .
Normally , the Monitor does not pay interview subjects for information to avoid conflicts of interest .
In this instance , that risk seemed marginal .
Staff writer Abraham McLaughlin went twice to Durban , South Africa .
He spent four days meeting with police and investigators and visiting St. Augustine 's Hospital .
From South African court documents , and a photo provided by Hernani , the Monitor tracked down the Israeli recipient of Hernani 's kidney .
But the recipient declined to be interviewed by staff writer Nicole Gaouette .
In Jerusalem , staff writer Ilene R. Prusher met twice with Arie Pach and his wife , Mary , who were willing to relate their experience .
They also spoke nearly a dozen times on the phone .

If you are living in the Northeast and is affected by the weekend storm , IRS will give you two extra days to file your income tax return beyond the April 17 deadline .
According to the IRS announcement ,
Victims of the major storm affecting several Northeastern states on Monday , April 16 will have two additional days to file their tax returns beyond the April 17 tax deadline , the Internal Revenue Service announced today .
Taxpayers directly impacted by the storm have until midnight April 19 to meet their tax filing obligations without incurring late filing and payment penalties .
All you need to do is making a mark on your return :
Even if you 've been following our saga of Microsoft 's 1975 Altair BASIC here and here , - one question remains unanswered .
Was it any good ?
Reuben Harris has been disassembling a binary with some help from Monte Davidoff , the third author of Altair BASIC ( along with Gates and Paul Allen ) and who we interviewed here last week .
He has the same question in mind :
" ' Could Bill Gates Write Code ? '
Or was he merely the luckiest man alive , " before concluding ... " Yes He Bloody Could ! "
Although Reuben 's analysis is not quite complete , he tells us that Gates , Allen and Davidoff threw every trick at the book to squeeze the interpreter into 4 kilobytes .
They succeeded and left some headroom for the programs themselves - without which it would have been pretty useless , of course .
" It was pretty incredible - they were pretty good at what they were doing , " he tells us .
Reuben draws out attention to a particularly Mel - like feat .
" I found a jump instruction that jumped to the middle of another instruction .
Why was this extraordinary ?
Well , on the 8080 , instructions were 1 , 2 , or 3 bytes in size .
Since instructions could be more than one byte in length a programmer had to be careful that he did n't jump to , say , the second or third byte of a three - byte instruction ; since he'd be executing arbitrary instructions that would almost certainly crash the whole program .
What was going on ? ? "
Reuben concludes this was entirely intentional .
" Rather than skip over some small bit of conditionally - executed code that we do n't want to execute , if that bit of code was small enough ( ie one or two bytes ) you could simply encode those one or two bytes inside a two or three byte instruction thus saving the three - byte instruction needed to jump over it .
The best example of this technique is in BASIC 's error message code "
All that ... for three bytes .
You can play with Altair BASIC online , if you have a telnet client .
It 's at the splendid Online Software Museum here and a selection of " mindbendingly dumb " games are included .
Reuben has also pointed out the similarities between the Altair BASIC 's error codes and the error codes returned by modern Microsoft Basics .
Plus ca change .
Of course Monte Davidoff , who worked on two BASICs for Micro - Soft in all , tells us that the better algorithms could be used when the developers had more memory space .
And we know from Bill Gates ' foreword to Gordon Letwin 's Inside OS / 2 ( Microsoft Press , 1988 ) that Letwin ripped up the designs for the earlier interpreters when he arrived at Microsoft .
But that is n't really the point - the Altair BASIC is rightly feted not for being the most elegant , but for being the first and the smallest .
And that 's enough . ®

If you 're facing a problem you can't get your head around , you might be told to sleep on it .
Now scientists have shown that the advice is more than just an old wives ' tale .
Apparently sleep strengthens the memory and helps the brain extract themes and rules from the masses of information we soak up during the day .
More here ...
• Sleeping makes me a monster
Lead researcher Bob Stickgold , professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School , said : " We 're not just stabilising memories during sleep .
We 're extracting the meaning .
" Sleep helps us extract rules from our experiences .
It 's like knowing the difference between dogs and cats , even if it 's hard to explain . "
The US research team studied how well participants remembered connections between words and symbols .
They compared how they fared if they had had a sleep between seeing the words and having the test , and if they had not slept .
They found that people were better able to recall lists of related words after a night 's sleep than after the same time spent awake during the day .
They also found it easier to recollect themes that the words had in common .
But they forgot around one in four more themes if they had been awake .
In another experiment , people were shown cards bearing symbols , followed by descriptions of a particular weather condition .
In the test , a diamond shape might be followed by rain for 70 per cent of the time .
Twelve hours after training , participants felt able to predict the weather based on the symbol shown to them on a card .
But after they had slept , their predictions were 10 per cent better .
Prof Stickgold presented his findings , which were reported in Thursday 's edition of New Scientist , at a meeting of the Science Network in California last week .
Other recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of sleep .
Last year it was shown that taking a daytime nap helped boost the memory and make it easier to recall important facts .
Another study showed that men's brainpower can be reduced if they share a bed , because their sleep is more disturbed .
Middle - aged people are at an increased risk of high blood pressure if they sleep for less than five hours a night - and afternoon naps cut the risk of heart disease .
Sleeping can also make you thin : women who only sleep for five hours a night are more likely to end up obese than those who sleep for seven hours .
But sleeping too much is not good for the health .
People who sleep for nine hours a day are more likely to develop Parkinson 's disease than those who sleep for six , another study showed last year .
John Groeger , professor of cognitive psychology at Surrey University 's Sleep Research Centre , said : " People have been puzzling for years about what the purpose of sleep is , as we know that only certain aspects of it have a recuperative value .
" It 's only relatively recently that we 've begun to understand the extent to which sleep helps you remember .
" What we know now is that sleep serves the function of a tidying process .
" The barin is highly organised when it comes to memories - it does n't just chuck everything into the bottom drawer .
" Sleep is part of that proces of consolidation , perhaps because when we are asleep our brain is less distracted by all the noise and irrelevant information we come across when we are awake .
" It 's as if the brain plays all the day 's experiences in a type of weird fast - forward , and then sorts them out - saying that goes with this ; I 'm going to store that in this place .
" We form and store huge numbers of experiences in the head every day , and sleep seems to be the way the brain copes with it all . "

Does the US suck at design ?
The Difference Between the US and Switzerland
The Difference Between the US and Japan
I 'm just asking ...
I know the US is full of brilliant designers .
So why do we have some of the ugliest bank notes on the planet ?
When I first got to Switzerland , a shopkeeper had to pry the 10 out of my hand ... it was that sexy .
[ UPDATE : it seems that people who are n't my regular readers , and do n't know me , are mistaking this little BLOG POST for ( choose all that apply ) :
A ) An " editorial "
B ) An academic " thesis "
C ) An " article " in a peer - reviewed journal
This is a blog post .
That 's it !
Spare time .
A few random observations in hopes that the real smart people would provide the real value in the comments .
Criticize it , yes , of course .
Mercilessly .
But as a BLOG POST , not an Essay On The State Of International Design .
I had hoped that the Barcelona - girls - are - hot line would be a clue that this was not a Really Serious Work , but I am not a good enough writer to have made that clear .
Believe me , I 'm just as unhappy as you are that this post is getting far more exposure than it wants or deserves .
So , you will find NO Academic Rigor here .
you 've been warned . ]
When I travel outside the US ( a lot , lately ) , I keep finding a culture of design .
A culture of aesthetics and style that seems natural in that country , but rarer ( and often forced ) in the US .
Here in the US , we have Designers , Artists , Architects , etc .... and then the rest of us ..
But in the places I 've been visiting , those lines are often blurred .
Outside the US , the appreciation for -- and ability to create -- beauty is not just something " left to the professionals . "
This design sensitivity / sensibility does n't touch everything , but it seems far more pervasive than it does here .
And I say this having spent most of my adult life in southern California , where you can't swing a cat without hitting a design school grad .
It 's not our US designers that have gone missing ... it 's a culture of design we seem to lack .
A few more , small examples :
The restaurant / cafe decor in much of western Europe looks like it was ripped out of a MOMA installation .
In much of western Europe , the graffiti is f'n amazing .
It feels like thousands of urban artists were set free to construct beautiful murals everywhere .
In Barcelona , all the women are gorgeous .
( And I mean that in a I 'm - not - gay - but - wow - these - women - are - fabulous kind of way . )
They have a sense of style that 's casual , natural , and beautiful .
The men are n't bad either , but geez ... and these are real olive - oil - consuming women here .
This is n't about fitting the classic definition of " attractive model type " .
Even the much older women have that , " I love my body and yes , as a matter of fact I AM hot " look .
The architecture outside the US has so much more history .
Real history .
There 's a joke ( kind of ) in Steve Martin 's LA Story movie where he 's showing someone around the city and enters a neighborhood where he proudly claims , " Some of these buildings are more than TWENTY years old ! "
And it 's not just the visual style that we lack .
I swear that New Zealand must have chosen ( along with an anthem , bird , and flower ) a National Audio Ambience .
And it 's currently ambient / electronica .
In the US , you expect the airport to play elevator / grocery - store music ( Barry Manilow covers , anyone ? ) .
In Wellington 's airport , you get Portishead , Banco de Gaia , Delerium .
In restaurants , shops , and train stations .
Nearly everywhere you go , you feel like you just stepped into the W , or some ultra-cool lounge .
These things matter .
Aesthetics matter .
Beautiful things WORK better .
We all know it intuitively , and the designers in the US know it explictly .
Which brings me back to ... money .
What 's up with ours ?
It 's dull , non-memorable ( pop quiz for Americans : who is on the $ 5 dollar bill ?
The $ 10 ?
The $ 20 ?
What building is on the back ? ) and as inspiring as a parking ticket .
And US dollars get an F on usability !
The distinctions between one note and another are too subtle , and there 's no way to use them if you 're blind .
What Switzerland bank notes have that US dollars do not :
1 ) Dramatically different , beautifully saturated colors .
You do n't need to read the number ... the color is a vibrant , clear cue .
2 ) Different sizes for the different values .
The size - to - value mapping is perfect -- the higher the value , the bigger the size .
3 ) Rich , visually - stimulating , interesting designs .
US dollars demonstrate a sense of history , but say zip / zero / nothing about our culture .
But these Swiss notes ( along with money from so many other countries ) gives you a sense of what 's special about the country that goes beyond its history and leadership .
4 ) Tactile cues for the vision - impaired
Each denomination of Swiss note carries a distinct tactile symbol - - circle , square , triangle , etc. -- that you can feel .
With US dollars , if you can't read the printing , you 're screwed .
Between the strikingly different color and design , plus meaningful differences in size , these notes are way more user - friendly than US dollars .
With US dollars , the information is largely on a single - channel - - you have to read the print .
But with Swiss ( and so many other ) notes , you get several chances to " get it " as the info comes in over multiple channels ( all that 's missing is a unique sound or smell for each denomination ; )
And one more thing about what our bank notes say about our culture ... with US bank notes , the emphasis is all on the Big Guys .
Founding Fathers .
Key ( male ? ) figures from the past .
People In Control .
And on the back , you get historical / political buildings that nobody but a history buff gives a crap about .
But take a look at the New Zealand five :
It celebrates two wonderful things about New Zealand .
Sir Edmund Hillary is a citizen of the country .
A citizen who did something deeply inspiring -- the first Everest summit .
And on the back side of Hillary , there 's a penguin .
Seeing penguins play , fight , socialize , and flirt is a once - in - a - lifetime experience ( go to Oamaru , trust me ) , and New Zealand is one of the best places in the world to see wild penguins .
[ For a look at the other New Zealand dollars , see this wikipedia entry ]
There 's a lot more about the design of money in this fascinating money design critique by Canadian ( and design / creative goddess ) Marian Bantjes on Under Consideration 's speakup blog .
That post has a ton of links to sites about money design , and there was also a good discussion on Cash Usability at Signal vs.
Noise last year .
And finally , those manhole covers .
That comes from a much earlier post I did on The Difference Between Japan and US .
If you 're interested in design and beauty , you can find more external resource links on my earlier Code Like A Girl post .
It 's clear that design -- and designers -- in the US do not suck .
I 'm guessing that half of you reading this blog are US designers , and damn good ones .
So it 's not the designers that have gone missing .
Why oh why do n't we have a culture that recognizes , celebrates , and appreciates design the way so many other countries do ?
Did we have it and lose it , or was it always like this ...
Designers out there ( I comment on design , but I 'm not one ) , can you help the rest of us learn to place greater value on design and aesthetics ?
There 's reason for hope , though ... younger generations are tuned for design ( I 've talked on this before ... visit a skateboard shop to see some what some of the top graphic designers are doing ) .
Then again , all those MySpace pages could be a real setback ... ( not that we do n't have a soft spot for MySpace , but it 's not the page aesthetics that we love about MySpace )

I 'm pretty convinced it 's because American culture regards anything too " designy " ( tasteful , beautiful ) as effete and European and foreign and probably gay and darn near un-American .
Acceptable objects of beauty in American culture are customized trucks and cars , and other things that can obviously display the wealth of their possessors .
Money is sacred to Americans and will never change its design .
EVER .
Do n't get your hopes up .
Posted by : Cargo | Jul 13 , 2006 11:58:38 PM
I agree with cargo that Congress would find it easier to amend the New Testament than to get Americans to change their beloved greenback .
I think the general reaction to European style bills is that it looks too much like play money and does n't carry the gravitas of the USD .
We have fairly nice bills in India , in spite of the fact that the designers had to cram the denomination in 16 languages on one side .
Posted by : Kingsley Joseph | Jul 14 , 2006 12:12:08 AM
Kathy , maybe its the picture or maybe it 's just me but I find the visual aesthetics of the Swiss notes quite unappealing , though of course their size and tactile nature do grant those notes a definite advantage .
I believe that a country loses a lot of creativity the more bureaucracy it has , so people that would otherwise blend in their designs do n’t see it as their jobs to give the product a better look , or do n’t feel like filling out the forty minutes worth of paper work to get time on their bosses calendar to see them about making something look better when it ’s “ their job to just code the thing ” .
Posted by : Allan Barger | Jul 14 , 2006 12:18:28 AM
I thought it was commonsense to have different value notes of different sizes and with different colours so you could quickly distinguish notes when out shopping .
Therefore I always thought US money was strange compared to the rest of the world .
Posted by : Olly | Jul 14 , 2006 1:27:50 AM
Australia 's notes .
You can tell at a glance how much money you have , plus it 's plastic , so it can go through the was in your pocket and live to tell the tale .
I 'm pretty sure they get longer as they get more valuable .
Also , we have poems and the national anthem printed in teeny - tiny text around the pictures that you can only read with a magnifying glass or really good eyesight .
I like our money ( especially when it 's in my pocket ; ) ) .

Australian notes have been colour - and size - coded for many years ... ( since we changed to decimal currency in 1966 ) and they 've been a form of plastic since 1988 .
We celebrate all sorts of people on our notes - poets , scientists , statesman ( not necessarily politians ) , including women .
Our coins are pretty neat too !
Wikipedia article showing the notes : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar#Polymer_series; and another for the coins : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_coins#Decimal_currency.
The coins are different sizes and shapes too - the 50 c piece , for example , has many sides .
Every time I 've travelled in the US , I have to closely watch the currency as I make a payment as it's too easy to tender a ten instead of a one - at least for those who are n't familiar with it on a day - to - day basis .
I 've always wondered how the visually impaired got on with the currency , then earlier this year I had a chance to ask someone who is blind .
He uses a folding technique and placement technique in his wallet to differentiate the notes .
But he has to trust that the shopkeeper etc. has told him the right thing otherwise he could be easily duped .
Posted by : Sandgroper14 | Jul 14 , 2006 3:00:31 AM
I remember at some point in the past watching a documentary on bank note design that said that the main reason why US bank notes have n't changed since around 1920 is that , unlike most other currencies , the USD is frequently used in transactions in countries all round the world ( Africa , South America ) because it is trusted more than the local currency .
The argument went that if the design changed then most of the people outside the US would not hear about it , and when they saw the new notes they would n't believe they were real .
Confusion and economic instability etc would ensue .
So I guess my point is that even though I agree that the design is pretty rubbish , there might be other factors in play here ...
Posted by : Chris Webb | Jul 14 , 2006 3:14:00 AM
I often wondered why the US is so advanced in terms of website accessibility but so retarded in money accessibility .
How does the blind person fold the money , as mentioned above ?
Who does it for them ?
Why do they have to fold the money ?
Why does someone not challenge the accessibility of the greenback under the ADA legislation ?
Posted by : Peter Warne | Jul 14 , 2006 3:26:47 AM
Peter
We went to lunch with this person and asked him how he dealt with the notes .
I can't recall EXACTLY what he did , but his system went something like this - he folded the 20s so they were a long , narrow rectangle ; he folded the 10s in half so they were almost square ; he folded another one with the corner down so it was sort of triangular ; he put another denomination in front of , say , the rectanglar ones , and yet another behind the square ones .
The point is , is that he had a system that worked for him .
We watched him get his money out and pay his share of the bill - he had no problem at all .
Interestingly enough , he did a presentation at the conference we were all at on software accessibility issues for the blind and visually impaired !
One other thing - when he got change from a cab or shop , he always asked the person handing out the change what note was what and folded them on the spot as per his system .
As I said before , he had to trust he was told the right thing ... and equally had to trust that a person receiving his notes would n't say that he'd been underpaid and therefore rip him off .
He said he'd never been ripped off like this to his knowledge , which restores my faith in humanity !

I never noticed this before , but this lack of differentiators ( size , color ) may be the reason americans often call the bills by the name of the presidents on them .
Face recognition is a very very very accurately trained feature of the mind , so I suppose people actively prefer to recognize the bills by the ' face ' , rather than by the numbers .
i hope this insight is worth a george :)

i still think that the new u.s. twenty dollar bill was partially designed with microsoft word art .
on the right side where it says " twenty usa " under the seal , it looks like some high up executive saw the design , said it needed something , and then pulled up powerpoint and said , " add something wavy that looks like this . "
it 's only a theory .
but the rest of the bill has a historical design feel , except for that " word art " looking thing .

Nobody mentionned the Canadian banknotes , but I think they 're really nice .
They 've been all redesigned in 2001 and include notes with people playing hockey , images depicting peace and remembrance and even images for human rights .
The good thing about color - coding the notes is that the redesign in 2001 was really easy on the people because we where all ready used to checking the color and that stayed the same .
I think our notes say a lot about the canadian culture and are easily recognised , but still retain a seriousness that ensures it does n't look like play money .

And one more thing about what our bank notes say about our culture ... with US bank notes , the emphasis is all on the Big Guys .
Founding Fathers .
Key ( male ? ) figures from the past .
People In Control .
And on the back , you get historical / political buildings that nobody but a history buff gives a crap about .
I 'm not sure I follow this .
On the one hand ( earlier in your post ) , you commented about architecture outside the US having so much more " history . "
And yet here you seem to be implying that we should n't acknowledge our history on our currency .
Also , when you think about the usability factors ( which is what many of your points are ) , remember usability for shopkeepers .
I know that other countries have obviously solved this , but when you want to talk about suddenly changing the size of the bills to denote value , you 're talking about asking every store in the US to get new cash drawers .
Every change machine , every ATM , every vending machine , every self - checkout kiosk would have to be re-engineered to handle different currency .
IIRC , that 's one of the main reasons why the dollar coin has n't caught on : Stores do n't want to redesign the cash drawer to accommodate another coin .
I 'm not arguing that we should n't redisign our currency ; I 'm just saying it 's not quite the no-brainer you seem to be implying .

I have to wonder if we are starting to see the effect of the slash - and - burn policy for arts education that has been going on for the last decade or so .
Married to a former art teacher , I 'm by no means unbiased on this subject , but I certainly think about the bookstore you went to and compare it to the hordes of Da Vinci Code readers here ... and it just seems sad .
And I can't see how to reverse the trend -- can you imagine going to a city council and saying " I know you need to cut the budget , but could we have new manhole covers so they look prettier ? "
Incidentally , Roy , I do n't think Kathy 's objection to the Important White Men was about not having our history -- but about the fact that it 's only a very , very narrow sliver of our history , of specifically government leaders .
How about a $ 10 with Rosa Parks on it ?
Or a $ 20 with Sam Shepard ?
Robert Johnson on a $ 1 bill ... now would n't that be something .

Long - time listener , first - time caller , love the show .
The US and UK have a rather different appreciation of the term " art " than the rest of Europe .
For the US and UK , government policy , Protestantism , and artistic history has ended up with a culture of artisanship , where " art " is something created by a small professional class and looked at for " improving reasons " by those who are " trained " to appreciate it .
There 's not a culture in either of our countries of art as a participatory form .
Now , contrast that with somewhere like Sweden , where design and art are pretty much national obsessions , and there 's a whole ton of government money to support artistic endeavours whether by professionals or amateurs , and you see where the difference between the countries arises .

Design is at best an afterthought in the institutions of everyday American life .
And traveling abroad does force you to notice .
But we seem to love functional aesthetics given the opportunity .
Even hardcore PC users like myself will readily admit Macs are very , very pretty .
And * everyone * loves " Trading Spaces " ...
There must be other values we hold higher which force separation between engineering and design as a general rule .

As an American living in Switzerland , I have a couple of thoughts on the subject of Swiss money and the Swiss attitude to design in general .
When I first got there I had a hard time getting used to how colorful it was .
I had the same initial reaction to the bank notes that a couple of the commenters here had - " omg it 's like play money " , etc .
As I got used to it though , I came to appreciate the beauty and utility of the designs .
Printing these notes is a very complex process , and the Swiss take great pride in their printing technology .
So , besides the designs themselves representing something special , the actual process of making the notes is a reflection of a part of Swiss national pride .
I think the major difference between the U.S. and Switzerland is the conservative attitude , or lack of , towards institutional and public design projects .
Commercial design in the U.S. can be quite avant - garde ... like the W hotels , or the Apple stores , or privately funded museums .
But try to get a publicly supported design project to use any sort of modern or different design ... you 're usually doomed , whether it 's bank notes or a building .
In Switzerland , people are much more open to modern design , and so do n't raise huge objections or bring up ' tradition bla bla ' about it - even , or especially , government officials .
( And in case people think that a few government officials can dictate design to the masses ... that simply can't happen , since the Swiss can and do have direct referendum votes on everything . )
Anyway , for a modern design junkie like me , Switzerland is a pretty wonderful place to live .

I have one gripe about your article , in that you 're using old US bills :
The new $ 20 is , by comparison to the old one , garish :
There 's peach all over the darn thing .
I can't remember if the $ 10 is next , or if the $ 10 is already out there , and the $ 5 is next .
I do n't use that much cash as a telecommuter , and " yuppie food stamps " ( double sawbucks ) are typically what I 've got in my wallet .
I 'm sure fewer people overall are using cash : between credit cards , debit cards , PayPal , Google Checkout ... why bother redesigning it ?
The other thing about the US bills is a very high standard for durability ( did you know the original ones were a hemp paper ?
now it 's a high cotton percentage ) : holograms and tactile features wo n't stand up to the " crush test " , washing machines , etc .

I wonder if the lack of design aesthetic in the US is historically rooted in the Puritans that landed on it 's shores so many years ago ?
Though the USA likes to style itself as a very advanced country , and is in many ways , there is an undercurrent of conservatism and puritanism that exists to this day .

The comments to this entry are closed .
There is an oft repeated business saying that sales organizations should “ Go after the low hanging fruit ” .
The meaning obviously is to close the easy sales before you have to work to climb after the more difficult sales .
Its a maxim that is rarely wrong .
For major media companies , and an ever growing list of Web 2.0 video - hosting companies , the low hanging fruit right now is selling advertising around video content available via broadband connections over the net , and to a lesser degree , available through Video on Demand from cable and satellite .
Advertisers want to buy it .
They are as ripe as ripe can be and sales - reps are grabbing their dollars before they fall from the tree and hit the ground .
Because there is so much low hanging ad money there for the taking , many in both traditionally big media companies and Web 2.0 firms see it as the money pot at the end of the rainbow that will be the catalyst for future growth .
No question its a growing market , But the biggest Internet video bulls seem to forget that what is happening now is not very different than the introduction of Digital Satellite and Digital Cable to viewers and advertisers .
Imagine if all of the sudden there was digital bandwidth available across the world .
That anyone who wanted to buy a small dish , or add a digital set top box , could do so and easily receive access to Gigabits of bandwidth . of video .
Right to their TV for anywhere from 30 to 120 dollars per month .
Imagine what would happen to the TV industry .
The change would be incredible .
Channels would pop up out of no where .
Just about anyone could create a channel and get it distributed across the country .
Tens of millions of people would get what would seem like unlimited number of TV channels .
Thats exactly what has happened over the last 12 years .
The number of TV channels exploded .
The amount of advertising spent on non broadcast TV exploded .
But , here we are 12 years later and the distribution of those non network ad dollars goes to the networks that have an audience .
Plain and simple .
If you had an audience , you could get ad dollars .
If not , not .
If you are a network that cant draw a . 1 for its prime time shows .
Forget about it .
Its not impossible of course , but you are gonna have to work your tail off to get ad buys .
Work your tail off may in fact be an understatement .
Talk to people in the cable industry .
TV
Ad buyers do n’t like to make ad buys that require them to aggregate smaller network audiences .
Its a hassle for them to buy 10 different networks , let alone 100 or 200 .
its a hassle for them to audit the buy .
There are actually services that monitor ads to make sure they ran and provide the results to advertisers .
If its a hassle for ad buyers to buy 100 TV networks , how much of a hassle do you think its going to be for them to buy 100 websites and get them audited ?
Whats more , what do you think all those Web 2.0 sites who are easily selling video ad inventory today because its a nice experiment for advertisers do when they cant sell their video inventory any longer ?
Or when the biggest advertisers tell them they have to work through a publisher network like Yahoo or Google in order for them to get a buy ?
Well , the first thing they are going to do is lower their ad prices .
Which is exactly what we saw happen both on smaller digital video networks and on websites trying to sell display advertising .
Its history repeating itself .
You know who has this figured out ?
Google and Yahoo and the major media companies . .
They all know that ad buyers are never going to deal with individual websites to buy video ads .
They are n’t going to put themselves in a position where they have to deliver and audit video files across hundreds of sites .
Thats why Google and Yahoo and the big media companies are so excited about Internet video .
They each want to be the one stop for Internet video advertising .
They want their publishing networks to be gatekeepers to advertisers .
Google thinks they can monetize ads better and deliver them far less expensively ( because of their data center delivery ) , Yahoo hopes it can do the same .
The big media companies know they can bundle Internet video with their cable and broadcast audiences , along with their existing Internet properties to create a more comprehensive solution .
Plus , if worst comes to worst , they bundle it as a free add if they need to implode the market pricing of Internet video .
Which is exactly what I think they end up doing over the long run .
The less Internet video can stand on its own as a business , the less Internet video sites can invest in content and promotion to create an audience and the bandwidth to deliver that content .
Thats a good thing for media companies who have to spend millions per episode for broadcast network shows and who get paid by the subscriber by cable and satellite companies .
It also makes it a smart move for them to cross license their content to create a Youtube competitor .
Not that i think they can have the social impact of Youtube , or reach their traffic levels .
They probably cant
But what they can do is drive enough of an audience that they can create a package that more economically and simply lets advertisers reaches Youtube users on non Google properties by combining their Internet , TV and Youtube Jr. sites into a single ad buy .
Plus , if advertisers buy ads on their Youtube competitor as part of a bigger package , they are n’t buying from Google .
That makes it a smart move .
Which brings me to HDTV .
HDTV is the Internet video killer .
Deal with it .
Internet bandwidth to the home places a cap on the quality and simplicity of video delivery to the home , and to HDTVs in particular .
Not only does internet capacity create an issue , but the complexity of moving HDTV streams around the home and tp the HDTV is pretty much a deal killer itself .
Together , internet video is destined for the PC monitor for a long time to come .
The only wild card that will have an impact is gaming consoles , but they dint offer access to internet video , they all kill themselves by only offering access to content inside their walled gardens .
Internet video wo n’t replace TV .
It wont even complement TV offerings .
It will flourish in the office .
It will be a fun way to share personal content privately or publicly .
It will be Community Access TV .
On the flip side , HDTV is here and now .
Its gone from being a future technology that could be cool in our living room to being the King of this holiday shopping season .
10s of millions of HDTVs have been sold and will be sold in the next year .
The number of households with HDTVs is exploding .
Yet for reasons I cant figure out , the broadcast networks are ignoring the opportunity it presents .
The 4 broadcast networks are really the only 4 companies that create content on a daily basis that can put smiles on the faces of all those HDTV buyers .
They broadcast most of their prime time signals over the air and have the greatest reach on cable and satellite HD delivery .
Bob Iger , Les Moonves , Bob Wright , Peter Chernin , why in the world are your networks not promoting the hell out of the fact that everything looks better in HD ?.
Where is the “ Congrats , you just bought an HD set , here is how to get our best programming ever , in HD .
And oh by the way , if you have n’t called your cable or sat company or hooked up an antenna , you are n’t getting HD .
Call your cable or sat company to see what you are missing ”
Every study about HD viewing says over and over again that people with HD sets , particularly those who just bought them will tune to HD networks first .
Not only do viewers turn to HD first , but more families are gathering around their brand new HDTV that they just bought and are truly excited about .
Why in the world are n’t you taking advantage of this opportunity ?
This is a unique point in time where you can grab viewers from non HD networks simply by promoting what you are already doing .
It could be the year where
broadcast ratings explode because of HD .
Then there is the advertiser side .
Sure internet video is the hot sexy thing now .
But where do advertisers get the greatest value ?
From putting their TV ads on the net ?
By creating 10 second spots for pre or post roll and showing them on PC monitors ?
Or by creating commercials in HD that look beautiful on the brand new HDTV that millions of homes just installed and are excited to see new programming , including commercials on ?
Whats worst , is that by letting your advertisers continue to show commercials in Standard Def , you are making them look clueless to all those new HDTV viewers .
How many things could be more brand damaging than looking like you dint have a clue ?
This is a unique point in time for all networks broadcast in HD to push the ball forward .
HDNet is going to start a big ad push in 2007 .
Maybe we can carry the ball , but either way , its absolutely crazy , and stupid to not leverage this opportunity to the hilt .
Last year I said that Disney was brilliant for breaking the logjam and selling their shows on Itunes .
This coming year , 2007 will be known as the year Broadcast TV leveraged HD to create a golden age of TV with huge gains in ratings vs non HD networks , or it will be looked back upon as the year Broadcast Networks blew it .
Either way , HDNet and HDNet Movies will be right in the middle of the High Def revolution

There are now 128 women MPs in Westminster
The women MPs who swept into the House of Commons in 1997 , swelling their numbers to 120 , say life at the heart of democracy has been anything but easy .
Some even claim they have had to resort to ancient art of " nagging " to get their voices heard and laws changed .
Their struggle to win equality in the chamber and to crack the code of its " Old Boys ' Club " mentality there is detailed in a new book about female MPs , along with an accompanying radio programme .
" Women in Parliament - The New Suffragettes " , written by Boni Sones , with Margaret Moran and Joni Lovenduski , and BBC Radio 4's " A Monstrous Regiment " , produced by Deborah McGurran , are based on a series of frank interviews with dozens of past and present female MPs .
' Strip search ' offer
Labour 's Barbara Follett - one of the 1997 intake and one of " Blair 's Babes " - says it is not just verbal abuse the female MPs have had to deal with .
" Sometimes when women got up to speak , some of the men - not thankfully on our side of the House - would put their hands on their chests , wiggle them around and go ' melons ' .
It was like a school boy type of humour , " she said .
It 's all willy jousting and there is much more of that in the British Parliament than in the European Parliament
Oona King
Ex -women 's minister Joan Ruddock says she became a particular target when she tried to address the issue of strip - searching of women in Northern Ireland in a debate on the army .
" I heard completely audibly in the chamber one of the men on the Tory side say 'oh , I 'd like to strip search you any day ' , " she said .
And Tory ex-Cabinet minister Gillian Shepherd said one Tory MP " called us all Betty " because " you are all the same " .
Labour 's Margaret Moran said women MPs had noted a number of male colleagues who were " particularly prevalent in their kind of abusive behaviour , words and gestures and barracked women during the course of their speeches " .
Jibes
Ex -Labour MP
Oona
King uses her own terminology to denounce the adversarial nature of the still male - dominated Commons chamber .
" It 's all willy jousting and there is much more of that in the British Parliament than in the European Parliament , " she says .
Miss Widdecombe says female MPs are being ' over sensitive '
" You really did n't know how to crack the code of the club . "
However , the former teacher said she did find humour one method of defence against jibes by Tory John Bercow , who made constant references to her schooling at Cheltenham Ladies '
College , whenever she spoke about education .
" I said : ' I have no more influence over where I went to school than the honourable gentleman had over your lack of inches - I imagine we have both been affected by our experiences ' , " she said .
" He 's a complete short arse - and since I did that he stopped it . "
' Pathetic '
But former Cabinet minister Ann Widdecombe says she believes some of her female colleagues are just being " sensitive " to comments made about them , particularly those made by the media .
She said ex-Tory leader William Hague 's baldness and Tory leadership hopeful Ken Clarke 's Hush Puppies had also been fair game .
I look now at the new intake coming in - to be frank I fear for them because many marriages will go
Barbara Follett
" Come on , once again it 's women being sensitive , saying 'it 's just because I 'm a woman that the press are saying this ' .
Oh , it 's so pathetic ...
I 'd like to bang their heads together , " she says .
And Tory Theresa
May , she of the stiletto shoes fame , said she did not mind the comments made about them because it showed " MPs can be human and like shoes " .
It also drew people into politics who might otherwise have not been interested , she said .
Bitterness
However , the change from family friendly hours in the Commons , back to a late night sitting on a Tuesday , is one topic that has angered many of the female MPs .
Ms King said she " lost it " when she heard of the changes .
" I started shouting and swearing .
The point is it 's one thing if they want to be held hostage there , but why should they need to hold me hostage too ? "
Ms King likens the adversarial nature of the Commons to ' willy jousting '
Ms Follett says that kind of pressure can take its toll on MPs ' families and personal life .
" I look now at the new intake coming in - to be frank I fear for them because many marriages will go . "
Achievements
One marriage that ended precipitously was that of Tory MP Eleanor Laing , who had a baby shortly after the 2001 election and was back at the dispatch box only 10 days after the birth .
She said not only had it been " incredibly difficult " fighting an election while pregnant , but coping with a young baby at that time .
Ms MacTaggart says humour can diffuse tension in the Commons
" I think if they are constantly being described by their clothes , their weight and their hair styles , it does belittle what they do and what they achieve .
" They really enjoy the job of being an MP and they particularly enjoy their constituency work .
" When you ask them what achievements they are proudest of , it 's their constituency work . "
' Persistent voice '
Deborah McGurran , producer of A Monstrous Regiment , in which 17 MPs feature , said she was surprised how they failed to blow their own trumpet , yet used the domestic wile of " nagging " to get their own way .
" A lot of the women quietly , behind the scenes , in select committees and standing committees , and in the House - wherever they could , keep pushing and pushing to get things done , " she said .
" A number of them talk about persistence to get what they want . "
:: Archive Hour - A Monstrous Regiment will be broadcast on Saturday , 10 September , on BBC Radio 4 , 8 - 10 pm BST .

If you are too much in the habit of being skeptical about everything , you are going to miss or resent it , and either way you will be standing in the way of understanding and progress .

Should the income tax system include a tax credit for short taxpayers and a tax surcharge for tall ones ?
This paper shows that the standard utilitarian framework for tax policy analysis answers this question in the affirmative .
This result has two possible interpretations .
One interpretation is that individual attributes correlated with wages , such as height , should be considered more widely for determining tax liabilities .
Alternatively , if policies such as a tax on height are rejected , then the standard utilitarian framework must in some way fail to capture our intuitive notions of distributive justice .

DIGG THIS
The forces of evil have been trying to eradicate the United States since its founding .
The most alarming threats have historically been external .
For forty - five years , some Americans harbored a genuine fear of Communism .
As a result , American taxpayers threw trillions of pesos at the military - industrial complex , 58,000 Americans died trying to rescue a peninsula in Southeast Asia , and no one had permission to visit Cuba .
The government " saved " us from the Red Menace — right before it collapsed .
Then the terrorists struck .
The government is now in the process of " saving " us from this threat , which debuted on September 11 , 2001 .
Over the last week a new threat has emerged .
This time the evildoers reside within our national borders .
That factor alone should make citizens more nervous .
We do not have oceans protecting us .
Legal constraints limit our military from confronting the menace head on .
The willful repudiation of the Second Amendment by our courts has disarmed the average American .
Luckily , we have Ms. MeMe Roth of New Jersey spearheading our defenses against … the Girl Scouts !?
Exhibiting an inimitable , preening self - virtue , Ms. Roth has called for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies .
In a press release (! ) issued February 19th , Ms. Roth , President of National Action Against Obesity ( " NAAO " ) , reasoned thus , " Girl Scout Cookies are high - calorie , high - sugar , high in saturated fat and nearly devoid of nutrition .
Using young girls as a front to push millions of cookies onto an already bloated population further exacerbates an alarming crisis , no matter how cute the uniforms are .
The Girl Scouts sell up to 200 million boxes yearly — that ’s about one box for every overweight American . ”
Perhaps we should not laugh at Ms. Roth ’s one - woman imitation of the Nanny State .
Using history as precedent , boycotts can turn ugly .
And unsuccessful boycotts can turn even uglier .
Shortly after taking office in April 1933 , Adolf Hitler called for the boycott of Jewish owned shops , department stores , and banks .
Never one to shy away from inflaming an already ugly situation , Hitler enlisted his Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels to publicly defend the boycott in a speech at the Berlin Lustgarten .
Goebbels railed against anti-German " atrocity propaganda " spread by " international Jewry " in exhorting Germans to forego transacting with Jews .
If Goebbels ’ words did not spur Germans to avoid Jewish businesses , a backup plan existed .
Hitler stationed his menacing Sturmabteilung with placards reading " Germans !
Defend Yourselves !
Do n’t buy from Jews ! " in front of Jewish stores .
Yet the boycott message fell on deaf ears .
While Hitler and Goebbels fulminated against abstractions like " Jewish finance capital " and " Judeo - Bolshevism , " most Germans lived in the reality of day - to - day dealings with Jewish merchants .
For the time being Jews appeared to be safe .
But Hitler ’s ardor burned on .
Shortly after this rare domestic political failure , the Nazi regime passed a series of laws limiting Jews in numerous ways .
These laws prevented Jews from holding civil service positions , a prestigious career in Germany of the 30s .
In the field of education , the Nazis banned Jews from teaching at universities and limited their enrollment in public schools .
Additionally , Jews could not work as journalists .
Subsequently , all German newspapers fell under Nazi control .
The immediate price German Jews paid for their fellow Germans ’ insolent disobedience of the boycott orders portended a horrific future .
As we know all too well , the story ends as one of history ’s darkest moments .
Hitler ’s boycott orders represented one of the early steps in his grand scheme .
One can only wonder if a boycott called against innocuous 12 - year - old girls likewise has ulterior motives .
At what point would Ms. Roth ’s organization recognize that buyers of Girl Scout cookies in the United States of 2007 face no pressure to transact in comparison to Germans under the threatening stare of Nazi brown shirts in April 1933 ?
Should she succeed in routing the wholesome girls in green shirts , where will Ms. Roth and her minions set their sights next ?
With her latest foray into the absurd , we should not be surprised when Ms. Roth calls for mandatory exercise programs for anyone she deems unfit .
Never underestimate the imagination or zealotry of a Nanny State Gauleiter .
In the meantime here is a suggestion for Ms. Roth .
Perhaps she might consider changing her title from President of the NAAO to Frau Präsident .
The Teutonic version fits better .

George Osborne , Britain 's shadow chancellor of the exchequer , has stuck the Conservative Party 's banner firmly on the internet bandwagon .
Speaking at the Royal Society of Arts yesterday , he applauded the " democratisation of information " brought about by the internet .
And he championed the Open Source movement by stating how the British government should save money by ditching its conventional software licenses .
Osborne suggested that the principles of transparency used in open source software development could also be applied to political discourse and the workings of the establishment .
" We need to harness the internet to help us become more accountable , more transparent and more accessible - and so bridge the growing gap between government and governed , " he said .
However , one Open Source guru who is advising Osborne told The Register that he could n't speak to us on the record for fear of losing his new - found links to power .
It was too great an opportunity for the Open Source movement to pass up , he said .
Bottoms up
According to Osborne , the internet phenomenon was " rapidly eroding traditional power and informational balances " .
It is an alluring idea , and one that enamours British politicos , boxed in as they are by spin and secrecy .
Osborne described the internet ideal as well as any suited - and - booted revolutionary - with a touch of condescension : " The Internet is like a child pushing at boundaries of authority and challenging the established way of doing things . "
" The challenge is for the pushed to resist the urge to push back - to regulate and legislate ; to try to tame and control , " he said , in contrast to the Labour government 's instinct to regulate the internet , and suggestion that the freedom child , since having been proven so effective on the web , should be shown upstairs : " Top down politics is no longer sustainable in a bottom - up age . "
The internet phenomenon has inspired in Osborne three policy ideas , he say .
The first is the democratisation of information , in the name of which his Government Spending Transparency Bill was being pushed through the legislature .
This would involve the details of government spending to be published online for all to see .
But his office said just what information was published would be limited with the commercial in confidence arrangements it struck with its suppliers .
Hilary Benn is running in Labour 's deputy leadership contest
The international development secretary told a meeting in New York the phrase gives a shared identity to small groups with widely differing aims .
And Mr Benn , a candidate for Labour 's deputy leadership , confirmed that UK officials would stop using the term .
The White House coined the phrase after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
' Disparate groups '
Mr Benn said : " In the UK , we do not use the phrase ' war on terror ' because we can't win by military means alone .
" And because this is n't us against one organised enemy with a clear identity and a coherent set of objectives . "
By letting them feel part of something bigger , we give them strength
Hilary Benn
Key quotes from speech
It is " the vast majority of the people in the world " against " a small number of loose , shifting and disparate groups who have relatively little in common " , he said .
" What these groups want is to force their individual and narrow values on others , without dialogue , without debate , through violence .
" And by letting them feel part of something bigger , we give them strength . "
' Battle of values '
In a New York meeting organised by the Center on International Cooperation think - tank , Mr Benn will urge world leaders to find common ground with potential enemies , rather than relying on " hard " military power .
" The fight for the kind of world that most people want can , in the end , only be won in a different battle - a battle of values and ideas . "
Mr Bush first outlined the concept of a " war on terror " shortly after New York and the Pentagon were attacked by Islamist terror group al - Qaeda on 11 September 2001 .
At best it is a superficial approach , at worst a failure to tackle the serious issues
Michael Moore
Lib Dems
" Our war on terror begins with al - Qaeda , but it does not end there , " he told Congress nine days after the attacks .
" It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found , stopped and defeated . "
Downing Street refused to be drawn on the contents of Mr Benn 's speech .
The prime minister 's official spokesman said Tony Blair " has always made clear we believe in fighting terrorism not just by military means but by political means as well " .
Asked about using the phrase " war on terror , " he said : " We all use our own phraseology . "
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Michael Moore said " war on terror " had " always been a flawed concept " and questioned Mr Benn 's motivation .
" At best it is a superficial approach , at worst a failure to tackle the serious issues .
" Many will be cynical about Hilary Benn waiting until he is running for deputy leader of the Labour Party before making these comments .
" This apparent change of heart must also herald a substantive change of policy to one which tackles the root problems that give rise to international terrorism , " Mr Moore added .

Americans do n't think the execution of the former Iraqi president will improve the situation in Iraq .

John McCain was interviewed by Bill Bennett yesterday and this is the claim McCain made about American public opinion on the Iraq war :
This " reasoning " has become a standard line for McCain and his dwindling band of war supporting comrades in order to argue that Americans really do , deep down , support their pro-war views .
It is hard to overstate just how dishonest and incoherent it is .
Let 's leave to the side the utterly inane notion -- advanced now by McCain -- that public opinion should be discernedby looking at polls which are scientifically designed to gauge public opinion on specific issues , but instead , by trying to mystically interpret isolated election results from a single state .
McCain obviously wants to find a murkier and inference - dependent method for assessing public opinion because the scientific poll method conclusively demonstrates that his views on the war are rejected by Americans with such overwhelming force that it renders him a fringe extremist .
But let 's indulge McCain 's alternative method of divining the meaning of election results in order to determine Americans ' views on the war .
Last November , four Republican incumbent Senators , all of whom were steadfast supporters of the Iraq war , were booted out of office -- George Allen in Virginia , Conrad Burns in Montana , Jim Talent in Missouri , and Mike DeWine in Ohio .
Those states are red to varying degrees , but they are all red enough to have each voted twice for George Bush for President .
Moreover , the most hawkish extremist when it comes to the " war " generally , Rick Santorum , lost by a margin so huge that it can only be described as humiliating .
And he based his whole candidacy on the need to be more militaristic against Islamic extremism .
And that 's to say nothing of the scores of pro-war , Republican House incumbents who were fired by the American electorate , including many in red districts .
In sum , the pro-war Republican Party suffered as comprehensive an electoral defeat on every level as could be imagined .
So , applying John McCain 's newly invented , anti-poll methodology for determining public opinion , how is Joe Lieberman 's win in tiny Connecticut some sort of proof that Americans love the Iraq war and want to stay forever ( and even escalate ) , in light of the emphatic rejection by Americans of the pro-war Republican Party generally , along with the defeat of four pro-war , Senate incumbents ?
Fathom the pure dishonesty and shameless hackery required for McCain to isolate the Connecticut Senate race , while ignoring everything else , in order to claim that Americans have n't turned against this war .
That really is about as dishonest as it gets .
It goes without saying that McCain is free to run around the country ranting about how we should escalate our war efforts in Iraq .
But for the fact that the President himself is embracing that position , that view is not even within the parameters of mainstream public opinion , even broadly defined .
But McCain is entitled to spout those views as much as he wants .
But he should not be permitted to continuously claim with impunity that Americans have not turned against the war , or that they do not " want us out of Iraq , " because that is just .
Journalists ought to make clear that his claims in this regard are factually false .
The latest CBS public opinion poll ( h/t Media Matters ) , like virtually all others which preceded it , simply leaves no doubt about that .
This latest poll was conducted between January 1 and January 3 -- after the Glorious Execution of Saddam Hussein -- and revealed that Americans oppose the war by a 67 - 31 % margin -- a gap of .
Only 11 % favor the McCain / Lieberman plan of sending more troops to Iraq --.
Directly contrary to McCain 's repeated statements , a majority of Americans -- 54 % -- favor withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year .
The most significant -- and most encouraging -- aspect of the poll is this :
This constitutes a genuine and impressive shift in how Americans think about the war and terrorism .
The President , and Republicans generally , have spent the last five years squeezing gallons of political gain out of melodramatic events where the U.S. military captures or kills " bad guys " -- the original capture of Saddam , the shooting of his sons , the killing of Zarqawi , the parading around of Khalid Shaikh MohammedSaddam 's trial , etc .
These events have been the emotional pay - off following the endless fear - mongering -- the captures and kills are when we get to feel powerful and triumphant and Victorious over the Evil Enemies who want to kill us , when we all feel such gratitude towards the Leader for " protecting us " from all the bad and scary people in the world .
Though the reality is that , with rare exception , these events have achieved very little in the way of actually " making us safer , " Americans have been willing to overlook all of the administration 's fraud and deceit and ineptitude because the President 's allegedly resolute pursuit of the evil - doers provided so much fulfillment , especially when he scored a kill .
Those events obscured the realities of the President 's failures and deceit and the complexities of these issues .
But that tactic just is n't working any longer .
There is a vastly improved maturity on the part of the American electorate with regard to these matters .
They are not fooled any longer by cartoon depictions designed to obscure reality , or attempts to manipulate their fears and baser instincts in order to induce them to support a failed and incredibly self - destructive war .
That is the lesson of the November elections , and it is what public opinion polls conclusively prove .
Even as our country is plagued by a failed press and a decrepit Beltway culture , Americans have largely reached these conclusions all on their own -- slowly , but decisively .
And all of that bodesill for John McCain ( as well as for Republicans generally ) , whose entire political purpose is to fuel these fears and milk these instincts with mindless militarism .
That is why McCain is running around the country making false statements about American public opinion .
It 's because Americans ' views on the war reveal just how out - of - touch and extremist McCain is , so his only hope is to shut his eyes tightly and simply deny these facts , and hope that his worshippers in the national media let him get away with it .
That is what worked for George Bush for several years , and it is McCain 's only hope for succeeding .
As several people have quickly pointed out in Comments , Lieberman did everything he could during the campaign to make the election be somethingthan a referendum on Iraq and , more so , did everything he could to leave the impression that the war would end soon and that this is what he wanted .
Thus , even if it were somehow rational to look only to the Connecticut Senate race and ignore every other data point in the universe to determine American public opinion on the war , even that would hardly provide support for the idea that Americans support the war .
One could certainly make the argument that the " running - away - from - Iraq " campaign which Lieberman had to run in order to win proves the opposite .
I have an article in the current edition ofconcerning the dishonesty of pro-war and pro-Bush pundits , specifically the way in which they simply ignore or outright lie about their history of false and misleading claims .
The article features the illustrative examples of Michael Ledeen , Charles Krauthammer , Peggy Noonan , and Ralph Peters . :
As FDM notes in Comments , John McCain previously made the -- literally -- as the one he is making now .
After the midterm elections , McCain went on CNN and said this about why the Republicans lost the election :
So just weeks ago , McCain wasthat Lieberman won in Connecticut because that election was .
In fact , McCain expressly admitted that But now that he is desperate to show that Americans still support the war , McCain saying exactly the opposite by claiming that the Connecticut electionabout Iraq and that Lieberman 's victory therefore proves that Americans have n't turned against the war .
There are many descriptive phrases for what McCain is doing here , but " straight talking " is n't one of them .
But that , of course , is nothing new

What is Hecl , and why I 'm writing it
Have you ever wondered what it 's like to create your own programming language ?
This article covers the design , and above all , implementation of the Hecl programming language .
It explains , in detail , how we go about taking some text in a file , and making the computer carry out the instructions written therein .
Since
Hecl is not a fancy , complicated language , but rather a small , simple , humble language , it should be pretty easy to follow .
If you are working on your PhD in computer science , you probably wo n't find this interesting , as you most likely already know more than I do about the subject .
But for everyone else , I hope to provide an interesting glimpse into what goes into the making of a programming language .
A form created with Hecl , running on the J2ME emulator .
As I said above , Hecl is a small , simple language .
It 's that way for a reason - first of all , because I wanted to have it up and running quickly , but most of all , because I wanted something that would run in the space constraints of my J2ME mobile phone .
Furthermore , despite - or perhaps because of - having a simple design , Hecl is quite flexible and extensible , meaning that it could grow into a lot of different niches .
And , of course , it makes a good subject for an article , rather than the entire book that would be necessary to describe more complicated languages .
I started working on Hecl when a couple of things happened : I bought a cell phone that ran J2ME , and I decided it was probably time to learn some Java .
This was a fortuitous combination , as I 'm not very good at learning things without a project to hack on as an incentive , and the cell phone provided just what I needed .
Java does n't hold a lot of fascination for me - it's got some nice aspects , but most of my programming needs are covered either by dynamic languages like Tcl or Ruby , or C for the fast , low - level bits .
However , J2ME is a very interesting space to work in , because it 's already out there on millions of phones , and many of the phones that support it can't run anything else .
The Symbian platform offers a bit more - you can port regular C code to it , but when I purchased my phone , that was still limited to relatively expensive models .
Time will tell which platform will win , but in the meanwhile , I liked the idea of writing something that will work on millions of devices .
And while there are some other scripting languages for Java , there only a few others that can run on the J2ME platform , because it imposes quite a few limits on what you can do with Java .
For example , the reflection API , which is heavily used by languages like Groovy , does not exist .
The Hecl code that creates the above form .
With a goal in mind , and fingers itchy to starting laying down code , my last stop was to consider the language 's overall design .
In reality , this was n't so hard .
I really like the Tcl programming language , especially its syntax , which borrows more from Lisp than a lot of people realize or give it credit for .
Tcl is , on the surface , a pretty simple language , which in turn allows it to be incredibly flexible .
It 's possible to write an object ( classes , inheritance , and so on ) system in Tcl itself , and even to add new control structures ( like ' if ' and ' while ' ) that are written in Tcl itself !
It is also an easy language to learn - it " scales down " , something that I place a lot of value on because it means that the language is accessible to more people , even if they are n't great programmers or do n't have a degree in computer science .
Tcl is n't perfect , but since I 'm not trying to write a Tcl clone in Java , I am also free to take what I like , improve what I do n't like , and be creative where I need to be .
Once again , the decision to abandon
Tcl compatibility was , in part , driven by the need to keep things small , and in part to maximize the fun value of the project - it 's more exciting to work without pre-established limits .
There is already a version of Tcl written in Java called Jacl , but it is far too large for my phone 's scarce memory .
The rest of this article deals with the technical details of the Hecl language .
For those interested in seeing exactly how the code described fits into the rest of the system , it 's possible to browse
Hecl 's code on line here : https://github.com/davidw/hecl - in particular the core classes , located here : https://github.com/davidw/hecl/tree/master/core/org/hecl
How Hecl works
Parser
So - how does the computer recognize and act on some scribblings in a file ?
The first thing that Hecl must do is read what 's in the file , and turn it into small chunks that it can make sense of .
This portion of Hecl is the parser , defined in Parse .
java .
As mentioned previously , Hecl is a simple language .
So in order to more easily discuss what 's happening , let 's look at a bit of Hecl code :
set txt [ getprop $ tf text ] if { ne $ txt " " } { # a comment stringitem label " You wrote : " text $ txt puts " hello " ; puts " world " ; }
Hecl 's parser only recognizes a few characters as special : " " [ ] {} $ # ; and newline .
The parser reads each line of text , and breaks it into pieces according to simple rules :
Commands and their arguments are divided into words by spaces .
A command is ended by either a newline or a semicolon - ' ; ' .
{curly braces} group the arguments inside , which are passed to the command ' as is ' .
This includes backslashes , newlines , and anything else
" double quotes " group everything between them into one word , but allow for substitution , so that you can do puts " The variable a is equal to $ a "
[ square brackets ] evaluate the command inside and return its value .
So where in a language like C , you might do foo = bar ( ) , in Hecl , you would do set foo [ bar ] .
, in Hecl , you would do .
$ dollar returns a reference to the value contained in the variable named .
\ backslash quotes the next character .
For instance " foo\ [ bar " would contain a literal left bracket instead of trying to evaluate bar as a command , as an unquoted brace would do .
would contain a literal left bracket instead of trying to evaluate bar as a command , as an unquoted brace would do .
# is the comment character .
Everything after # on a line is ignored .
That 's all !
Hecl 's syntax rules can be described by just 8 rules .
Even if that looks a little complex , think about what it would take you to describe the syntax of a language like Ruby , Python , or C ( or Perl , for real masochists ! )
With that in mind , let 's look at the snippet of code above .
The first line can be broken up like so :
A command , set .
An argument to that command , txt A third argument , some text to be evaluated , [ getprop $ tf text ] .
Hecl does n't evaluate it immediately though , it just stores it and makes a note that it should be evaluated .
The second bit of code , also a single command , is similar .
A command , if , followed by two arguments , which happen to contain more Hecl code : ne $ txt " " # a comment stringitem label " You wrote : " text $ txt puts " hello " ; puts " world " ;
This is important to understand , because it 's very different from how many languages work .
In Hecl , if is an ordinary command just like any other , whereas in C or Python it is part of the syntax , rather than a function that users can define or modify .
In any case , what Hecl does as it reads in the source code is create an " internal representation " of the various commands and variables it is reading about .
It does this so that it can store the whole thing , and then run it when it 's ready , rather than trying to execute it piece by piece .
This speeds things up some when code gets executed multiple times - the code in a while loop , for example - because Hecl does n't have to re-parse it each time .
When taken at as a whole , the parsed Hecl program could be viewed as a tree , with each node a part of the program as described below .
Hecl " Things "
This brings up a discussion of how Hecl stores values , which we need to cover before we come back to our discussion of parsing and Hecl 's internal representation .
Since the term " object " has been used far too much in the realm of computer science , for Hecl I decided to revert to the equally vague , but more anglo - saxon term " thing " .
All values in Hecl are covered by the Thing class , which holds another value internally depending on what type of value it 's holding .
As far as more or less standard types of things , Hecl has StringThings , IntThings , ListThings , and HashThings , as well as DoubleThings for non-J2ME versions of Hecl .
These are all pretty standard data types / structures found in most scripting languages . [ 1 ]
Hecl also has an ObjectThing , which can contain any Java object , with the caveat that if it 's transformed into its string representation , it will lose the reference to the object it contains .
Where things get tricky is in the internal types , where Hecl has CodeThings , GroupThings , and SubstThings , which , along with plain old StringThings , cover the internal representation of Hecl code .
SubstThings are the simplest .
When the parser encounters a variable with a dollar sign or ampersand , it creates a SubstThing to place in Hecl 's internal view of the script .
To understand how this case works , consider the following script :
set i 0 while { < $ i 100 } { puts $ i incr $ i }
Obviously ,
Hecl needs to reexamine the value contained in ' i ' each time through the script rather than substituting it once !
SubstThing lets
Hecl do that , because it knows it 's dealing with something that really stands for something else - " $ i " in this case refers to an integer , but a different one each time through the loop , so it must be substituted each time through .
Things get a bit more complex , though , because Hecl , like many scripting languages , lets you do " string interpolation " .
Consider this example :
puts
" The value of ' i ' is still $ i and 1 + 1 is still [+ 1 1 ] "
We use the GroupThing class to handle this case .
As the name suggests , it 's a group of other things , as shown below :
GroupThing s evaluate their components when Hecl needs to know what the GroupThing itself contains .
Things are implemented in Java like so : a Thing class that contains a RealThing , which is its actual value :
public class
Thing { public RealThing val ;
CodeThing , GroupThing , StringThing and all the others implement the RealThing interface , so that Hecl can deal with them more or less interchangeably .
The implementation of IntThing is a good starting point , because it 's pretty easy to understand what an IntThing is and does .
public class IntThing implements RealThing { private int val ;
We see that an IntThing holds an int - the real value that we are actually interested in after all this indirection !
There is a convenience method in IntThing for the creation of new Things representing integers :
public static Thing create ( int i ) { return new Thing ( new IntThing ( i ) ) ; }
Which gets used a lot like so : Thing foo = IntThing.create ( 56 ) ;
However , in terms of importance , the heart of what makes
Hecl 's types dynamic are two methods :
private static void setIntFromAny ( Thing thing ) throws HeclException { RealThing realthing = thing.val ; if ( !( realthing instanceof IntThing ) ) { thing.setVal( new IntThing ( thing.getStringRep ( ) ) ) ; } } public static int get ( Thing thing ) throws HeclException { setIntFromAny ( thing ) ; IntThing getint = ( IntThing ) thing.val ; return getint.val ; }
What 's happening here is that when you need to get an int from a Thing , you do call get like so : int foo = IntThing.get ( foothing ) ; as you can see , this code examines the thing 's internal value , and in case it's not already an IntThing , turns it into a string and tries to parse it into an integer .
Of course , that might fail , because if you try and get an integer out of a string " bleagh " , it 's just not going to work out !
That 's why both methods are capable of throwing HeclException , which we 'll cover shortly .
Evaluation
Prior to understanding how Hecl code is actually evaluated , let 's return to our discussion of parsing for just a moment .
Now that you know how Hecl actually stores things internally , it 's easy to understand what happens when Hecl code is parsed - it gets turned into Things :
puts " foo bar " ->
StringThing ( puts ) and a GroupThing ( foo bar ) .
puts $ i -> StringThing ( puts ) and a SubstThing ( i ) set i [+ $ i 10 ] -> StringThing ( set ) , StringThing ( i ) , followed by a CodeThing .
The CodeThing is parsed up like so : + $ i 10 -> StringThing (+ ) , SubstThing ( i ) , StringThing ( 10 )
You may be wondering why the 10 above is a StringThing when it 's pretty obvious that it 's actually a number and intended to be used like one .
Your intuition is correct , but Hecl initially parses everything as strings , and only transforms them into other types of things when the code is evaluated .
To understand how Hecl is actually evaluated once we have a representation stored in memory , we need to examine CodeThings , which are the real motor of Hecl .
You 've probably guessed from the name that they contain code , which is indeed correct .
CodeThings are divided into " stanzas " , which are equivalent to individual commands .
For instance , in the following code , the actual code would be transformed into a CodeThing with two stanzas , puts $ i and incr $ i .
Each time the CodeThing is asked to run , it loops through the Stanzas , and in turn , calls their run method .
The actual evaluation takes place in the stanzas .
To Hecl , the first stanza looks something like this :
StringThing ( puts ) SubstThing ( i )
In order to do something with that , it needs to look up " puts " as a command .
The Interp class contains a hash table that maps command names such as " puts " , " if " , " proc " , " + " , " list " and so forth , to the respective Java classes that implement that code .
The " puts " command maps to the PutsCmd class , which is very , very simple :
class PutsCmd implements Command { public void cmdCode ( Interp interp , Thing[ ] argv ) throws HeclException { System.out.println(argv[1].getStringRep ( ) ) ; } }
All command classes implement the Command interface , and therefore must have a cmdCode method .
But let 's not get ahead of ourselves ...
The stanza that contains the puts command also has something to pass to it as an argument , in this case a SubstThing .
For each of the command 's arguments in the stanza , Hecl checks what type it is .
If it 's something simple like an IntThing or StringThing , it gets passed on to the command sans modification .
SubstThing s GroupThing s and other CodeThing s are recursively called in order to find out what value they actually represent , so that the actual command might be called like so :
puts 23
The arguments ( including the command name ) are passed to the cmdCode method as an array of Things : Thing [ ] argv array .
In the case of PutsCmd , all it does is print out the string representation of the first argument .
This is how all Hecl commands work , even if and while , which take code as arguments , evaluate it , and act accordingly .
This simple strategy is n't blazingly fast , but it is very , very flexible .
You can replace code on the fly , rename commands , and do all kinds of other interesting tricks .
Additionally , it 's easy to implement this system in the constrained J2ME environment .
Variables
Astute observers will have noted that when we covered SubstThings above , we did n't really explain how they work .
How does
Hecl go from a variable name - say , " foo " , to a value contained therein , like 42 ?
Hecl uses a simple hash table lookup scheme where each " stack level " has its own hash table that associates names to values .
What this means is that inside a ' proc ' , a new hash table is created to hold local values .
To see this in action :
set a 0 puts " a is $ a " proc foo {} { set a 10 puts " in foo , a is $ a " } foo puts " a is $ a "
when run , gives us :
a is 0 in foo , a is 10 a is 0
In terms of program flow , you can see in the above figure that at 1 , the global variable lookup table is in effect .
When program evaluation enters the foo procedure , the global lookup table is replaced by a new one for the procedure being executed .
At 3 , when the procedure exits , the hash table that was created in the interpreter to hold its variables is set to null and left for Java 's garbage collector to clean up .
The stack itself is implemented with the convenient java.util .
Stack class .
The variable hash table lookup routines are contained in the Interp class ( along with the command lookup hash table ) .
Interp
Indeed , the Interp class is the central data structure that holds everything together .
It contains the program 's state in terms of variables , existing commands and procedures , exceptions , and so on .
For Java developers looking to include
Hecl in their own code , one of the handy aspects of Interp is that you can have more than one of them at a time .
Imagine , for instance , a server that evaluates
Hecl code for clients .
Each authenticated client could have their own separate Hecl interpreter without interfering with the others !
The most commonly used methods in an interpreter are those which exist for modifying its state .
Make a command visible to Hecl :
interp.commands.put (" newcommandname " , new ClassThatImplementsCommand ( ) ) ;
Create and set a variable :
interp.setVar(" temperature " , new Thing ( 99 ) ) ;
Evaluate code :
interp.eval ( new Thing ( " puts { hello world} " ) ) ;
Set the result from a command :
interp.result = new Thing ( " ok , like , that worked , and stuff " ) ;
Errors and Exceptions
So far , we 've described how things should work .
Life , however , has a habit of not going exactly as we 'd planned , and that applies to Hecl programs as well .
We need a way to deal with errors .
Java itself has a featureful exception mechanism , so we take advantage of that in Hecl .
Anything that could cause an error in Hecl throws a HeclException , so that this code , in Stanza .
java , can catch that and deal with it appropriately :
try { interp.result = new Thing ( " " ) ; tmpcommand.cmdCode( interp , newargv ) ;
This is the actual command being executed .
} catch ( HeclException e ) { if ( newargv [ 0 ] != null ) { e.where ( newargv[0].getStringRep ( ) ) ; } throw e ;
We tell the exception what command it happened in , so that we can get a stack trace to show the chain of commands that failed .
} catch ( Exception e ) { String msg ; msg = e.getMessage ( ) ; if ( msg == null ) { msg = " ( null exception of type " + e.getClass ( ) + " ) " ; } else { msg = " Exception of type " + e.getClass ( ) + " : " + msg ; } throw new HeclException ( msg ) ; }
And in the case of a regular Java exception , we catch it and create a new HeclException , so that it can be dealt with in Hecl itself .
Hecl has a command , catch , that can be used to catch exceptions and deal with them programmatically .
It works by evaluating the code passed to it , catching any exceptions that code may have thrown , and then simply returning those exceptions to the caller of the command in the form of a Hecl variable .
In other words :
set cmds " some code to evaluate " catch $ cmds result
This will evaluate the code in cmds and place any results in the result variable .
For programs that must not halt , even on errors , catch affords the programmer a means by which he or she may attempt to handle errors gracefully .
Exceptions have another purpose , besides errors .
If you think about a while loop , it might look like this :
while { true } { if { > $ somevar 100 } { break } do_other stuff incr $ somevar }
How does the break command work ?
It stops execution of the loop when it 's run , yet it 's not an error .
It throws a HeclException itself , tagging it as a break exception : throw new HeclException ( HeclException .BREAK ) .
At that point , it 's up to commands implementing loops to catch it .
Here 's what the while command looks like :
while ( Thing.isTrue ( interp.eval ( argv [ 1 ] ) ) ) { try { interp.eval ( argv [ 2 ] ) ; } catch ( HeclException e ) { if ( e.code == HeclException .
BREAK ) { break ; } else if ( e.code == HeclException .CONTINUE ) { } else { throw e ; } } }
Remember , while is a command with two arguments - the condition , and the code .
As long as the condition is true , the loop keeps executing - each time through , the code is evaluated .
However , we also look out for the two special exceptions and act on them .
Break causes the loop to end , while continue causes the loop to short - circuit back to the evaluation of the condition .
If , however , the HeclException is not one of these special types , the error is thrown again and percolates its way up the stack .
Mixing Hecl and Java
As discussed at the beginning of this article , Hecl is n't meant as a replacement for Java , but rather to work alongside it .
It 's unlikely that an entire software system would be written entirely in Hecl at this point in time ( although it 's likely to evolve in this direction ) , so it 's important to discuss the integration of Hecl and Java .
There are two ways of doing this :
Calling Hecl from Java
If you have a program written in Java , and you 'd like to make it scriptable , adding a Hecl interpreter to it is very simple .
This would be an appropriate strategy if you wanted to let users change some variables , or create callbacks that are executed at certain points in the life cycle of your program .
A simple example might be a web server that evaluates
Hecl scripts when certain URL's are requested .
The place to look at for an example of this technique is the Hecl command line itself , specifically the file commandline / Hecl.java .
Here 's the main method :
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { try { int i ; Interp interp = new Interp ( ) ; /*
Add the standard packages in . */ new HeclFile().loadModule ( interp ) ; new org.hecl.fp.HeclFloat().loadModule( interp ) ; new org.hecl.load.HeclLoad().loadModule( interp ) ; Vector argv = new Vector ( ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < args.length ; i++) { argv.addElement( new Thing ( args [ i ] ) ) ; } interp.setVar ( " argv " , ListThing.create( argv ) ) ; if ( args.length > 0 ) { HeclFile.sourceFile( interp , args [ 0 ] ) ; } else { Hecl.commandLine( interp ) ; } } catch ( Exception e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } }
Simple enough .
First , the interpreter is created , some modules loaded in , and the command line arguments examined .
If there is a command line argument , it 's treated as the name of a file containing Hecl code to evaluate , which is done via the HeclFile.source
File method .
If there are n't any command line arguments , Hecl runs the commandLine method , a " REPL " , or read - eval - print loop , reading Hecl commands from standard input , evaluating them , printing the result , and so on .
That code is pretty simple too :
while ( true ) { System.out.print ( " hecl > " ) ; System.out.flush ( ) ; line = buff.readLine ( ) ; /*
Exit on end of file .
*/ if ( line == null ) { System.exit(0 ) ; } try { interp.eval ( new Thing ( line ) ) ; if ( interp.result != null && Compare.compareString(interp.result , new Thing ( " " ) ) !=
0 ) { System.out.println(interp.result ) ; } } catch ( HeclException he ) { System.out.println ( he ) ; } }
The key points are that to utilize Hecl code from Java , you need to initialize the interpreter , and then use it to evaluate code .
Creating Java Extensions for Hecl
The other model is to write your program in Hecl , and add Java extensions to perform specific tasks .
For instance , to create the charts for some programming language popularity statistics that I ran ( http://www.dedasys.com/articles/language_popularity.html)
I wrote the program in Hecl , and wrote a Hecl extension that provides an interface to the JFreeChart library .
This model is very popular with mature languages like Tcl , Ruby and Python , where the scripting language contains all the functionality necessary to write a fully functioning system , and extensions ( usually written in C ) , are needed only to deal with specific external libraries or devices .
In any case , it 's easy to do with Hecl - the basic trick is to write a class that implements the org.hecl.modules .
HeclModule interface , like so :
public class JFreeChartHecl implements Command , HeclModule { public void cmdCode ( Interp interp , Thing[ ] argv ) throws HeclException { ... command implementation ... } public void loadModule ( Interp interp ) throws HeclException { interp.commands.put ( " barchart " , this ) ; interp.commands.put ( " savechart " , this ) ; } public void unloadModule ( Interp interp ) throws HeclException { interp.commands.remove(" barchart " ) ; interp.commands.remove(" savechart " ) ; } }
In this case , the module also implements a command - the basic goal of any extension to Hecl will be to add one or more commands that provide access to some external library or resource
This can then be compiled into a . jar file , and then loaded into Hecl with the load command :
load JFreeChartHecl { /home / davidw/hecllib/build/jfreechart/ /home/davidw/downloads/jfreechart/lib/jfreechart-1.0.0-rc1.jar
/home/davidw/downloads/jfreechart/lib/jcommon-1.0.0-rc1.jar }
Which tries to load the named class and its dependencies from the specified URL's .
Simple ( local ) files are transformed into URL's .
In this case , it tries to load JFreeChart , which it finds in the jfreechart / build directory of hecllib .
That in turn requires code from jfreechart and jcommon , which are loaded from the respective jar files .
Conclusions , the Future , and Further Reading
As you 've seen from this tour through Hecl , an interpreter is an involved piece of software that requires many decisions .
But that 's what makes it so much fun - there is a lot of room both for both clever technical solutions , and elegant design - although as they say , " beauty is in the eye of the beholder " !
In any case , Hecl is a small and simple enough language that anyone with a bit of Java knowledge should be able to use it for their own experiments .
The software , by the way , is covered by the very liberal Apache license , Version 2 ( which can be found here http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), meaning that you can even include it in proprietary , commercial offerings , so by all means , use it in your own software .
Hecl 's Future
I aim to keep
Hecl small and simple enough to run on as many cell phones as possible , meaning that the core itself will stay as small as possible .
I am a big believer in the " make it , make it right , make it fast " strategy , and we are still making Hecl , so there is lots of room for people to help out in terms of adding features and extensions , and , since Hecl is at such an early stage , even experimenting with the language itself .
Creating a programming language has been very challenging , creative endeavor , and those interested in participating in shaping Hecl 's future are welcome .

Frogs Fading Into Silence
By Stephen Leahy
The extinction of amphibians in Latin America has reached alarming proportions : 209 species in Colombia and 198 in Mexico alone are in danger of disappearing forever
Mar 5 ( Tierramérica ) – Frogs and other amphibians are rapidly becoming extinct around the world and in Latin American countries in particular .
In the Caribbean as many as 80 percent of these species are endangered , while in Colombia there are 209 and in Mexico 198 amphibians may soon disappear .
Environmental degradation along with habitat loss , ultraviolet radiation , disease and climate change are all factors involved in these unprecedented losses .
At least 43 percent of amphibians are in decline worldwide .
An estimated 170 frogs , toads and salamanders may already have become extinct in the past two decades .
“ Amphibians are telling us that there is something wrong with our ecosystems , ” says Robin Moore , amphibian conservation officer with Conservation International ( CI ) , a U.S. - based international non-governmental organization .
Amphibians have very porous skins , which seems to make them more vulnerable to environmental changes than mammals , birds and reptiles .
Some scientists consider them as bellwether animals for the Earth ’s health .
According to the Global Amphibian Assessment , which examined the status of the nearly 6,000 known amphibians , the highest levels of threat are found in the Caribbean , where more than 80 percent are threatened in the Dominican Republic , Cuba , and Jamaica , and a staggering 92 percent in Haiti .
“ There are huge numbers of amphibians that we do n’t even know about yet , ” Moore told Tierramérica .

The Mount Everest of evidence proving IBM's Linux contributions infringed SCO 's intellectual - property rights amount to little more than a mole hill , according to a lawyer for Big Blue , who recently told a federal judge SCO has identified only 326 lines of offending code , compared with more than 700,000 lines of IBM 's GPL 'd code in the Linux kernel .
( Note : an earlier version incorrectly said out of a base of 700,000 lines . )
Of the 326 lines , most are comments , header files and other statements that are n't eligible for copyright protection , the IBM attorney , David Marriott , argued .
To be copyrightable , a work must be the result of originality and creativity , not a mindless variation of something already out there .
In 2003 , SCO CEO Darl McBride publicly declared SCO had a " mountain of evidence " that would prove that Linux was a direct descendant of Unix .
Marriott pounced on that assertion at the March 7 hearing .
" They claimed rights to more than a million lines of code in Linux , " he said at a hearing last week .
" At the end of the day , there 's 326 lines of code in which they have rights , and they have sought to exert the supposed monopoly they have and copyrights they claim to have over technology plainly owned by others . "
The transcript , along with plenty of commentary ridiculing SCO 's every argument in microscopic detail , were provided by Groklaw .
According to the Groklaw screed , 121 of the 326 lines at issue are #define statements that specify abbreviations .
That 's tantamount to trying to copyright the abbreviation 10 Cir. when referring to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals , which is where this case will likely land ( assuming SCO does n't go bankrupt first ) .
Be that as it may , such shorthand is n't eligible for copyright protection , even if IBM did lift them from SCO , and Groklaw is confident IBM did not .
Also among the contested lines are what are known as structure declarations , which identify things , such as the type of OS a computer is using .
A third class of header files being fought over are function prototypes , which specify which operations can be carried out and how .
According to Groklaw , an expert hired by SCO has argued that even the choice of list names put in alphabetical order and the assignment of sequential numbers requires a level of creativity sufficient to qualify for copyright protection .
Marriott took aim at that claim , saying a US Supreme Court decision shows such code lacks the required originality to be protected . ®
In what may become the next in a series of knuckle - headed moves , Bush ’s Interior Department has finalized a plan to expand the areas that oil companies are allowed to drill .
Areas off of Alaska , Florida and Virgina , some of them fishing regions , are to be opened up to massive oil exploration in the hungry attempt to maintain our “ addiction to oil ” .
Drilling had been banned in most of these areas previously , but in January , Bush lifted the bans in the central Gulf of Mexico and in Alaska ’s Bristol Bay .
The removal of the ban makes most of the Gulf south of the Florida panhandle open for drilling .
The 5.6 million acres opened up in Alaska is the home of endangered whales and the worlds largest sockeye salmon run .
Estimates put the oil under these federal waters are about 200 million barrels of oil , and about 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
The US currently uses about 20 MILLION barrels of oil A DAY , in 1998 ( last numbers I could find ) we used 21.34 tcf / year ( that ’s trillion cubic feet ) of natural gas .
Meaning that this reserve would have less than half a years worth of oil , and natural gas .
Bristol ’s Bay in Alaska was put off limits to drilling in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez tanker spill .
The republican congress lifted that ban in 2003 , but it remained under a presidential ban until January when Bush lifted it .
Clearly the oil company has a poor record of safety .
Do we really want to let them drill in even more spots , for what is already understood to be a drop in the bucket of our yearly energy needs ?
This is not an unexpected move from the same administration run by a former oil man , and containing many members of the cabinet that have ties to big oil ( Condoleeza rice has a tanker named after her ) .
Congress will have until the end of June to review the final drilling plan .
Exposing sensitive habitat to the the dangers of oil is the wrong strategy .
Even if we were to find untold billions of barrels of oil in these regions ( which we wo n’t ) we should n’t pump it out .
The problems we are having with global warming are because of our rampant burning of fossil fuels .
Finding more oil will only allow for the continued reliance on this dirty and old fashioned energy supply .
Renewable energy like wind , solar , tidal , and geothermal should be our top priorities .
Long after the paltry amount of oil in these regions has been pumped out , the wind will continue to blow , the sun will continue to shine .
If the president really wants to build something in these regions why not a nice wind farm ?
I guess his “ addiction to oil ” comments in the state of the union can be lumped together with is other lies ( “ mission accomplished ” , “ Iraq has weapons of mass destruction ” , “ we do not tortue ” , etc ) .
The sudden appearance of large animal fossils more than 500 million years ago – a problem that perplexed even Charles Darwin and is commonly known as " Darwin ’s Dilemma " – may be due to a huge increase of oxygen in the world ’s oceans , says Queen ’s paleontologist Guy Narbonne , an expert in the early evolution of animals and their ecosystems .
In 2002 , Dr. Narbonne and his research team found the world ’s oldest complex life forms between layers of sandstone on the southeastern coast of Newfoundland .
This pushed back the age of Earth ’s earliest known complex life to more than 575 million years ago , soon after the melting of the massive " snowball " glaciers .
New findings reported today shed light on why , after three billion years of mostly single - celled evolution , these large animals suddenly appeared in the fossil record .
In a paper published on - line in Science Express , Dr. Narbonne ’s team argues that a huge increase in oxygen following the Gaskiers Glaciation 580 million years ago corresponds with the first appearance of large animal fossils on the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland .
Now for the first time , geochemical studies have determined the oxygen levels in the world ’s oceans at the time these sediments accumulated in Avalon .
" Our studies show that the oldest sediments on the Avalon Peninsula , which completely lack animal fossils , were deposited during a time when there was little or no free oxygen in the world ’s oceans , " says Dr. Narbonne .
" Immediately after this ice age there is evidence for a huge increase in atmospheric oxygen to at least 15 per cent of modern levels , and these sediments also contain evidence of the oldest
large animal fossils . "
Also on the research team are Don Canfield ( University of Southern Denmark ) and Simon Poulton ( Newcastle University , U.K. ) .
Geochemical studies by Drs. Canfield and Poulton included measurements of iron speciation and sulphur isotopes to determine the oxygen levels in the world ’s oceans at the time these sediments accumulated in Avalon .
The close connection between the first appearance of oxygenated conditions in the world ’s oceans and the first appearance of large animal fossils confirms the importance of oxygen as a trigger for the early evolution of animals , the researchers say .
They hypothesize that melting glaciers increased the amount of nutrients in the ocean and led to a proliferation of single - celled organisms that liberated oxygen through photosynthesis .
This began an evolutionary radiation that led to complex communities of filter - feeding animals , then mobile bilateral animals , and ultimately to the Cambrian " explosion " of skeletal animals 542 million years ago .

In Part 1 and Part 2 of this series , we focused on writing the lexer and parser for our scripting language .
In this entry , we focus on writing a tree walking grammar to build custom objects from our AST .
When we closed the previous entry , we had modified our parser to generate the AST we wished to build but were reviewing our options for actually building our own objects from that AST .
Before we dive into that , let ’s first step back and write some simple objects that will hold the output state of this transformation .
The objects are Script , which holds a series of named Block s , each with a list of Command s , which have a name and properties .
In the interest of brevity , I ’m not going to show the code here ( see the links at the end ) .
I defined a toString ( ) on each object that should reproduce a valid script ( we ’ll use that for testing later ) .
Tree grammar rules are written with a lisp - ish notation # ( node child1 child2 … ) .
This will match a node ( based on token ) if it has children child1 , child2 , etc .
Deeper structures can be embedded within this .
Let ’s build this tree grammar from the top down .
First we ’ll start with the script node itself .
We ’ll look for a SCRIPT token with child tokens that are BLOCKs .
class ScriptWalker extends TreeParser ; script returns [ Script script ] { script = new Script ( ) ; } : #( SCRIPT ( block [ script ] ) * ) ;
This tree parser has a single rule ( “ script ” ) which matches the SCRIPT node , then matches any number of “ block ” sub-rules .
We see some new notation here as well .
The script rule has a returns [ Script script ] section that defines the return type of this rule ( and the generated Java method ) .
The [ ] are used instead of ( ) as the ( ) is used as a grouping construct in the rule definitions instead .
Then we see a code block or action in { } that initializes the Script instance .
Within the rule itself , we see a reference to the block rule and the script variable is passed as an argument to the rule .
The script variable will collect Block objects as they are found .
Let ’s continue defining the tree grammar by defining the block rule :
block [ Script script ] {
Block block = null ; } : #( BLOCK ( b:STRING { block = new Block ( b.getText ( ) ) ; } ( command [ block ] ) * ) ) { script.addBlock ( block ) ; } ;
Here the block rule takes a parameter in [ ] , which is the Script to add to .
We look for a BLOCK token with a child block name ( the STRING token ) and any number of commands , as defined in a separate command rule .
Let ’s finish it out with the command and property rules :
command [ Block block ] {
Command command = null ; } : #( COMMAND ( c:STRING { command = new Command( c.getText ( ) ) ; block.addCommand(command ) ; } ( property [ command ] ) * ) ) ; property [ Command command ] : #( PROPERTY ( p1:STRING ( p2:STRING ) ? { if ( p2 == null ) { command.addProperty ( p1.getText ( ) ) ; } else { command .addProperty ( p1.getText ( ) , p2.getText ( ) ) ; } } ) ) ;
These should now be pretty familiar .
One note is on the property rule – the second STRING child node is optional ( only there if using the key=value syntax ) and that ’s indicated with the ? , just as in the other grammars .
One item of interest here is what happens if the string is a quoted string .
In that case , the quotes will be included in the token .
So , we need to strip the quotes if they exist .
To do this , you can add an arbitrary chunk of code after the definition of the ScriptWalker that defines a helper method :
class ScriptWalker extends TreeParser ; { private String removeQuotes ( String value ) { if ( value != null && value.startsWith ( " \ " " ) ) { return value.substring (1 , value.length ( ) - 1 ) ; } return value ; } }
And then we just wrap a call to removeQuotes ( ) around each call to getText ( ) in the prior functions .
And that ’s it !
We ’re all done with our ScriptWalker .
Here ’s a dumb test class to try parsing the file into an AST , then running the walker to generate objects , then print the objects back out as a script :
import java.io.BufferedReader ; import java.io.
FileReader ; import java.io.
Reader ; import antlr .
CommonAST ; public class TestWalker { public static void main ( String args [ ] ) throws Exception { System.out.println ( " Walking : " + args [ 0 ] ) ; Reader reader = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( args [ 0 ] ) ) ; ScriptLexer lexer = new ScriptLexer ( reader ) ; ScriptParser parser = new ScriptParser ( lexer ) ; parser.script( ) ; CommonAST t = ( CommonAST ) parser.getAST ( ) ; //
Traverse the tree created by the parser ScriptWalker walker = new ScriptWalker ( ) ; Script script = walker.script(t ) ; System.out.println( script ) ; } }
I ’ve defined my tree parser in the same file along with my lexer and parser , so I need to call antlr .
Tool again to regenerate everything .
You ’ll see a new generated file ScriptWalker .
java show up .
Compile , then run java TestWalker test . script to try it out :
Walking : src/test.script morning { wake_up ; eat bacon ; brush_teeth ; wash hair=true minutes =10 ; } evening { read book = " How To Be a Ninja " ; brush_teeth ; sleep hours=8 ; }
Success !!
We can now move on to writing an interpreter for this generic scripting language .
For the complete lexer , parser , and tree parser , see script.g in the file list below .
Everything is in one file and even with comments , it ’s not too long .
For a language as simple as this , you might wonder why you would go to the trouble of learning and using a tool like Antlr or JavaCC .
For one reason , that code is tedious , error - prone , and very likely to be a maintenance nightmare .
For another , languages often start simple and increase in complexity with new requirements .
Generally speaking , a simple change in the language will result in a simple change in the grammar .
With a hand - written parser , often a simple change in the language can be a daunting task .
Hopefully you had fun working through this example with me .
I ’m considering writing a follow - up series to show the actual interpreter code as well .
If you would be interested in such a series , drop me a note by email ( see upper - right corner ) or comment .
Thanks for reading !

The Escopetarras
These instruments are known as “ Escopetarras ” , a fusion of gun and guitar , created by Cesar Lopez .
Lopez got the inspiration for the invention while standing outside a bombed Bogotá club and noticing the similarities between his guitar and a soldier ’s rifle ( whaaa ? ) .
Partnering up with musical instrument craftsman , Luis Alberto Paredes , he has been creating the instruments ever since .
Initially made out of Winchester rifles , they are now made mostly from everyone ’s favorite Cold War assault rifle , the AK47 .
I do n’t really see any use for these , and the acoustics can’t work too well because of the body and shape of the guitar , but , I do n’t think anyone purchasing a fusion gun and guitar are going to sit around sing Goom - By - Ya .

Angela Merkel was born in Hamburg in 1954 ( Federal Republic of Germany ) .
Shortly after her birth , her family made the unusual choice of moving to the East .
Her father , a pastor in the Lutheran church , then founded a seminary in the German Democratic Republic and became director of a home for handicapped persons .
He refrained from making any public criticism of the regime and enjoyed a privileged social status , having two cars and making frequent trips to the West .
Angela Merkel was a brilliant student , graduating as a doctor of physics .
She married a physician , Ulrich Merkel , whom she soon divorced .
She then moved in with Professor Joachim Sauer , divorced like herself but already the father of two children .
Angela Merkel obtained a research post in quantum physics at the Academy of Sciences .
At the same time , she became politically involved in the Freie Deutsche Jugend ( Free German Youth ) , the state organisation for young people .
She rose within the organisation to the post of Secretary of the Agitprop department , becoming one of the main experts in political communication in the communist dictatorship .
For professional and political reasons , she often travelled within the Soviet bloc , above all to Moscow , particularly since she spoke Russian fluently .
Although for many years hoped and prepared for , the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 nevertheless took all governments by surprise .
The CIA attempted to take over by recruiting senior individuals under the old system who were willing to serve the USA like they had previously served the USSR .
One month later , Merkel changed sides from one day to the next and joined the Demokratischer Aufbruch ( Democratic Revival ) , a new movement inspired by the West German Christian Democrat party .
She immediately took over the same functions that she had held before , except that the position was now , in West German terminology , “ Press spokesperson ” .
However , it soon became known that the president of Demokratischer Aufbruch , Wolfgang Schnur , had been a collaborator of the Stasi , the political police under the communist dictatorship .
Merkel herself informed the press of this painful news , obliging Schnur to resign and enabling herself to be appointed in his stead as president of the movement .
Following the last parliamentary elections in the GDR , she joined the government of Lothar de Maizière , becoming the latter ’s spokesperson , although Demokratischer Aufbruch only picked up 0.9 % of the votes .
During this period of transition , she was actively involved in the “ 2+4 ” negotiations that ended Berlin ’s quadripartite status and the allied occupation , as well as in the negotiations aimed at reunifying Germany .
In order , as she said , to avoid a mass exodus from the East to the West , she argued strongly in favour of getting the GDR to join the market economy and the Deutschmark zone .
Her partner , Joachim Sauer , was recruited by the US company Biosym Technology , spending a year at San Diego ( California ) at the laboratory of this Pentagon contractor .
He then joined Accelrys , another San Diego company carrying out contracts for the Pentagon .
For her part , Angela Merkel was perfecting her English , which she soon spoke fluently .
Once the GDR had been reunified with the Federal Republic and the Demokratischer Aufbruch had become part of the Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , Angela Merkel was elected member of the Bundestag , the German federal parliament , and joined Helmut Kohl ’s government .
Although strict in matters of morals , he selected this young childless divorcee from the East living with a partner as Minister for Family , Youth and Women .
Within 14 months , the communist Agitprop leader of the DDR youth movement had become a Christian Democrat minister of Youth in the Federal Republic .
Incidentally , she achieved very little in her first period as minister .
Continuing her career within the CDU , Angela Merkel launched an unsuccessful bid to get herself elected president of the Brandenburg regional party .
However , Lothar de Maizière , who had become deputy president of the national party , was convicted of having distant relationships with the East German political police and was obliged to resign , to be replaced by Merkel .
In 1994 , Klaus Töpfer , the Minister of the Environment , the Protection of Nature and Nuclear Security , was appointed director of the UN environment programme , following a series of clashes with the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce , which accused him of underestimating economic reality .
Helmut Kohl then ended the crisis by appointing his protégée Merkel as Töpfer ’s replacement .
Immediately after assuming office , Merkel sacked all the senior officials of her ministry who had remained loyal to her predecessor .
It was during this period that she formed a friendship with her French counterpart at the time , Dominique Voynet .
In 1998 , Chancellor Kohl informed the USA of his opposition to an international intervention in Kosovo , while the Social Democrats under Gerhard Schröder and the Greens under Joschka Fischer compared Slobodan Milosevic to Adolf Hitler and were calling for a humanitarian war .
The pro-US press then thundered against the Chancellor , accusing him of the economic difficulties that the country was suffering from as a result of reunification .
In the September 1998 elections , the Christian Democrats were swept out of power by a wave of red and green , Schröder becoming Chancellor and appointing Fischer his Foreign Minister .
However , Helmut Kohl and his closest associates had apparently accepted money from obscure sources for the CDU , but refused to reveal the names of the donors , arguing that they had given their word .
Angela Merkel then published a courageous article in the Foreign Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung [ 1 ] in which she distanced herself from her mentor .
In this way , she forced him to withdraw from the party , with Wolfgang Schäuble , CDU party president , resigning shortly afterwards .
Thus , in the name of public morality she grabbed the presidency of the party and , in the same surge of morality , adopted the Christian Democrat line and married her partner .
From then on , Angela Merkel was publicly supported by two press groups .
Firstly , she was able to count on the support of Friede Springer , who had inherited the Axel Springer group ( 180 newspapers and magazines , including Bild and Die Welt ) .
The group ’s journalists are required to sign an editorial agreement laying down that they must work towards developing transatlantic links and defending the state of Israel .
Angela Merkel can also rely on her friend Liz Mohn , director of the Bertelsmann group , the number 1 in the European media world ( RTL group , Prisma group , Random House group , etc. ) .
Ms. Mohn is also vice - president of the Bertelsmann Foundation , an intellectual pillar of Europe - American relationships .
Angela Merkel relies on the advice of Jeffrey Gedmin , specially dispatched to Berlin to assist her by the Bush clan .
This lobbyist first worked at the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) [ 2 ] under Richard Perle and Mrs. Dick Cheney .
He enthusiastically encouraged the creation of a Euro with Dollar parity exchange rate .
Within the AEI , he led the New Atlantic Initiative ( NAI ) , which brought together all the America - friendly generals and politicians in Europe .
He was then involved in the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) and wrote the chapter on Europe in the neocon programme .
He argued that the European Union should remain under NATO authority and that this would only be possible by “ discouraging European calls for emancipation . ” [ 3 ]
Finally he became the administrator of the Council of the Community of Democracies ( CCD ) , which argues in favour of a two - speed UN , and became director of the Aspen Institute in Berlin [ 4 ] .
Subsequently he turned down the offer from his friend John Bolton [ 5 ] of the post of deputy US ambassador to the UN so as to be able to devote himself exclusively to Angela Merkel .
In 2003 , the State Department entrusted Jeffrey Gedmin and Craig Kennedy with a huge programme of “ public diplomacy ” , in other words propaganda , including the clandestine funding of journalist and opinion formers in Western Europe [ 6 ] ..
In 2003 , Chancellor Gerhard Schröder opposed the Anglo - American intervention in Iraq .
Angela Merkel then published a courageous article in the Washington Post [ 7 ] in which she rejected the Chirac - Schröder doctrine of European independence , affirmed her gratitude and friendship for “ America ” and supported the war .
In May 2004 , she established a new situation by pushing through the election as President of the Federal Republic of the banker Horst Köhler , main author of the Maastricht Treaty and creator of the Euro , later president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) and director of the IMF .
She then began a “ patriotic ” campaign against radical Islamism .
Throughout the 2005 electoral campaign she criticised the increase in unemployment figures and the Social Democrats inability to deal with it , gaining for the CDU a lead of 21 percentage points in public opinion polls .
It was then that her mysterious adviser , Jeffrey Gedmin , published an open letter to her in Die Welt .
After criticising the German economic model , he wrote : “ Before advancing the country , you need to defeat intellectually those nostalgic individuals who are dragging their feet .
If Sarkozy succeeds Chirac , France might experience an upswing .
It would be regrettable if Germany continued to decline . ”
In reply to this invitation , Merkel finally revealed her solutions .
She promoted one of her advisers , the former Constitutional Court judge Paul Kirchhof , and entrusted him with the Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft ( Initiative for the New Social Market Economy ) .
She announced the abolition of graduated income tax , proposing that the rate should be the same for those who only just have what is necessary and those who live in luxury .
The outgoing Chancellor , Gerhard Schröder , severely criticised this proposal in a televised debate .
The CDU ’s lead was decimated , and in the actual election , the CDU polled 35 % of the votes and the SPD 34 % , the remainder being spread amongst a number of small parties .
The Germans did n’t want Schröder any longer , but nor did they want Merkel .
Following long and laborious negotiations , a Grand Coalition was agreed , with Merkel , although Chancellor , obliged to surrender half of the minister posts to her opponents .
She pushed through the participation of a German contingent in the multinational force under US command in Afghanistan .
Then , when Israel intervened in Lebanon , she successfully achieved the involvement of the German navy in the FINUL , arguing that “ if Germany ’s raison d’être is to guarantee Israel ’s right to exist , we cannot say , now that this existence is threatened , that we will do nothing . ”
As of 1 January 2007 , Angela Merkel is the president of the European Union .
She has never made any secret of her intention to force France and the Netherlands to accept the equivalent of the Constitutional Treaty project that they both rejected in referendums , nor of her intention to relaunch the proposed merger of the North American Free Trade Area and the European Free Trade Area , thereby creating a “ great transatlantic market ” to use the words once pronounced by Sir Leon Brittan .
Economy Housing Bubble Like Badly Applied Wallpaper By Ryan McGreal
Published April 17 , 2007
Will the bursting of the US housing bubble bring down the economy ?
After the US government bailed out the entire nation of Mexico in 1994 ( Mexico effectively tried to default on its debts by formally devaluing the peso , which would have ruined several US banks ) , anything 's possible .
The mortgage crisis has exposed a real vulnerability on Wall Street , because the banks packaged blocks of mortgages ( including risky mortgages to subprime or otherwise overextended borrowers ) and sold them as securities to investment firms , which in turn multiplied their profits severalfold through derivitives schemes .
That means the economic risk is actually significantly higher than the value of the mortgages at risk of default , and it inheres as much or even more in investment firms like Goldman Sachs and as in banks .
The House Financial Services Committee is currently holding hearings on the matter .
It 's in the interests of all the players - borrowers , banks , and investment firms - to prevent a wave of foreclosures , so the result will probably be something like what the US gave to Mexico : cash transfers ( to the rich players , not the poor debtors ) , renegotiated terms , easier interest rates , and so on to keep those borrowers barely solvent and making payments for a few more years .
They 'll probably get away with it , avoiding a short - term crisis but costing overextended borrowers more long - term hardship .
It might even bring the US housing market into the clear .
A year or two ago I would n't have believed it was possible to recover from the biggest financial bubble in history , but too many powerful people have too much to lose in this brouhaha to let the bottom fall out .
However , salvaging the real estate bubble , like salvaging the dot com bubble before it , is kind of the macroeconomic equivalent of pushing down on badly applied wallpaper .
The bubble will simply pop up somewhere else down the road .
With the US economy on such shaky foundations , OPEC countries starting to abandon the petrodollar system , and global oil production sliding into decline , loss of confidence in the dollar and the threat of hyperinflation will constrain the the government 's capacity to spend its way out of the next crisis .

Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Bedbugs bounce back : Outbreaks in all 50 states 1 / 8 Back to Gallery
Walter has stopped hugging his friends .
He is throwing out his clothes and furniture , and he rarely comes out of his Tenderloin hotel room anymore .
He 's not suicidal , but darn near .
He has bedbugs .
Nearly eradicated in the United States 50 years ago , resistant strains of " super " bedbugs are infesting mattresses at an alarming rate .
In what 's being touted as the biggest mystery in entomology , all 50 states are reporting outbreaks of the blood - sucking nocturnal critters .
Pest control companies nationwide reported a 71 percent increase in bedbug calls between 2000 and 2005 .
Left alone , a few bedbugs can create a colony of thousands within weeks .
" We never treated bedbugs until 2002 .
Now we have a dedicated bedbug crew working on this every day , " said Luis Agurto , president of Pestec in San Francisco .
Agurto's arsenal includes a vacuum , steam heat to cook the bedbug eggs and targeted spraying of insecticides .
It takes three , eight - hour visits and about $ 500 to $ 750 to exterminate one room .
A whole house would cost closer to $ 5,000 .
The bulk of Agurto 's clients live in low - income hotels and shelters in the Tenderloin , but he 's been called to five - star hotels and suburban homes in Walnut Creek .
Bedbugs have been found in moving vans , public transit seat cushions , airplanes , college dorms and even a Bay Area meditation retreat .
They spread by hitching a ride on your clothes or in your luggage and crawling off to infest your home or apartment building .
Nearly 300 bedbug infestations were reported to San Francisco health officials in 2006 , more than double the number in 2004 .
Most of the cases involved travelers discovering bedbugs in upscale hotels .
The size and shape of a lentil , bedbugs lay eggs during the day and hide in your bed , clothing and light sockets .
At night , they suck your blood , leaving itchy bumps on your skin and little bloody excretions on your sheets .
They do n't pass diseases , but they are incredibly difficult to exterminate , even following their blood hosts who move to new apartments trying to get away .
The bedbug resurgence has sparked Web sites like bedbugger .com , where people share extermination tips , bite mark photos and counsel each other through the stigma .
There are bedbug symposiums , cover stories in American Entomologist magazine and dozens of videos depicting infestations on YouTube .
California just issued its first state bedbug guidelines , and New York lawmakers want to ban the sale of reconditioned mattresses after 4,600 bedbug cases were reported in 2006 .
" The Laundromat near my building is packed , the tenants are in there , washing everything they own and giving each other knowing glances , " said Walter , who has been battling bedbugs for five weeks and fears he will be kicked out of his Tenderloin studio and made a pariah if he reveals himself .
Lady Bug , a beagle professionally trained to sniff out bedbugs , makes regular rounds with Agurto 's Pestec crew in San Francisco .
On Friday , the dog inspected Tina Blade 's room at the Empress Hotel in the Tenderloin , smelling the bed frame , baseboards and carpet .
To Blade 's relief , Lady Bug deemed the room all clear .
Blade is not among the dozen people who have had bedbug infestations in the 90 - room Empress , but she has been bitten at other single - room occupancy hotels in the neighborhood .
" I 'd always heard that nursery rhyme , ' Do n't let the bedbugs bite , ' but I never knew it was real until I moved to San Francisco , " she said .
Empress manager Roberta Goodman is proactive about bedbugs .
She conducts tenant meetings , keeps Pestec on call and has Lady Bug in every month to make sure the bugs are staying at bay .
" I can keep our community educated , but I can't control the guests who are coming in and out ; that 's why we do monthly checks , " she said .
Bedbugs were nearly eradicated after World War II , when exterminators and homeowners used DDT to get rid of the pests .
Experts say bedbugs are making a comeback because of increased global travel and a shift toward less - toxic pest control .
As people are backing away from harsh chemicals and indoor spraying , the bugs are becoming increasingly resistant to the pesticides .
" We do n't use as harsh chemicals as we used to , we do n't spray mattresses with insecticide before selling them anymore , and the bugs are getting increasingly resistant to the few chemicals we have left , " said public health biologist Laura Krueger , who wrote the new bedbug guidelines for the California Department of Health Services .
Nearly all exterminators use pyrethroids , which are a synthetic version of pyrethrum , the substance found in chrysanthemum flowers .
But last fall , at the University of Kentucky , some of the nation 's best bedbug researchers delivered some sobering news -- while they could kill bedbugs born in the lab with pyrethroids , four groups of adult bedbugs brought in from the outside were unaffected .
Because bedbugs are such a new phenomenon , people do n't know what to do about them and are often unwittingly making their problem worse , said Nobugsonme , a New York woman who runs the bedbugger .com Web site to help sufferers cope .
A victim herself who wanted to remain anonymous , Nobugsonme said in a phone interview with The Chronicle that a series of pest control visits is the only way to get rid of the bugs .
Moving the mattress , sleeping in the living room , using a bug fogger or moving in with a friend will only relocate the bugs , she said .
" People who throw away all their possessions and battle this for months and spend thousands on pest control only to relocate and have the bugs reappear are really traumatized , " she said .
" They are getting only a few hours of sleep at night , they feel itchy all the time , some go to therapy over it . "
Thirty percent of people do n't have skin reactions to bedbug bites , and may not notice an infestation until it has gotten out of control .
Pest control researchers are experimenting with alternatives such as steaming or freezing the bugs to death , and some New Jersey exterminators are gassing them with the termite killer Vikane .
UC Berkeley urban entomologist Vernard Lewis is trying to get grant money to build a baited bedbug trap .
Bedbugs give off a distinctive odor , described as rotting coconuts , and that 's probably how the males and females find each other , he said .
" If we can mimic that funk , that stink , I think we could make baits and monitor them , " Lewis said .
Until the experts figure it out , bedbug sufferers will have to help each other fight back and raise awareness .
When Atlanta filmmaker Kyle Tekiela made a short bedbug film noir and put it on YouTube , he was shocked by how many people contacted him begging for help with bedbug problems .
" Students from all over the country sent me videos of their dorm rooms , " Tekiela said .
" This one guy did a 360 where the ceiling meets the walls and there was a three - inch band of bedbugs all the way around . "

ALL ABOUT BEDBUGS
BEDBUG FACTS
-- Wingless insects of the family cimicidae .
-- Small , flat , oval , reddish - brown body .
Adults are about the size of an apple seed .
-- Feed on human and animal blood .
-- Active at night and bite any areas of exposed skin .
-- Can infest a home and hide in crevices or cracks around beds or furniture .
--
While some bites may go unnoticed , bites may also result in localized swelling and itching , and the areas may become inflamed or infected when scratched .
-- Are not believed to transmit diseases to humans .
-- Females lay from 200 to 500 eggs , which are covered with a glue and hatch in about 10 days .
There are five progressively larger nymphal stages , each requiring a single blood meal before molting to the next stage .
-- Can go without feeding for as long as 550 days .
-- Can suck up to six times its weight in blood , and feeding can take 3 to 10 minutes .
-- Adults live about 10 months , and there can be up to three to four generations of bedbugs per year .

BEDBUG TIPS
When traveling :
-- Check your hotel bed mattress for bedbugs .
Look in the seams of the mattress and box spring .
Look behind the headboard , and pull out the drawers and check the seams underneath the drawers .
Report any bugs to the manager and move to another room , but not next door , directly above or directly below the infested room .
-- Keep your luggage on the luggage rack .
-- Vacuum your suitcase and wash all of your clothes in hot water after you return from a trip .
Use dryer on hottest setting .
Day to day :
-- Inspect carefully before buying used furniture .
-- Use metal instead of wood bed frames .
-- Live minimally -- get rid of the figurines , picture frames and clutter near your bed , which make a perfect playground for bedbugs .
Bedbugs in your house :
-- Call a professional exterminator , who will need to make several visits over one to two months to kill all the adults and eggs .
-- Wrap your mattress and box spring with a plastic or allergen cover and place the bed legs in cups of water .
-- Fill wall cracks .
-- Wash infected clothing and sheets in hot water and dry on the hottest setting to kill the bugs .
--
When discarding infected possessions , wash and double - bag them in plastic first .
-- Vacuum repeatedly , and immediately put the vacuum bag in double - plastic and discard .
--
Do not move your mattress , sleep in a different room or sleep at a friend 's house -- that will guarantee spreading bedbugs to other locations .
--
Do not buy household insect sprays or bombs -- bedbugs are resistant and will move to another room and infect more parts of your dwelling .
In San Francisco :
-- Reluctant landlords who fail to eradicate bedbugs can be reported to the San Francisco Department of Health , Environmental Health Section , ( 415 ) 252-3800 .
Tenants can also file a complaint at 1390 Market St. , Suite 210 , San Francisco .

Claim : Thousands of Japanese pet owners were victimized by swindlers who sold them sheep and told them the animals were poodles .
FALSE
Example : [ The Sydney Morning Herald , 2007 ]
When it comes to pulling wool over the eyes … the net is buzzing with a story about thousands of Japanese being swindled in a scam in which they were sold Australian and British sheep and told they were poodles .
When it comes to pulling wool over the eyes … the net is buzzing with a story about thousands of Japanese being swindled in a scam in which they were sold Australian and British sheep and told they were poodles .
Flocks of sheep were reportedly imported to Japan and then sold by a company called Poodles as Pets , marketed as fashionable accessories , available at $ 1,600 each .
That is a snip compared to a real poodle which retails for twice that much in Japan .
The reported scam was uncovered when Japanese moviestar Maiko Kawamaki went on a talk - show and wondered why her new pet would not bark or eat dog food .
She was apparently crestfallen when told it was a sheep .
So , it seems , sheep that good at playing the part of poodles .
The story goes that hundreds of other women got in touch with police to say they feared their new “ poodle ” was also a sheep .
It seems one presumably shortsighted couple said they became suspicious when they took their “ dog ” to have its claws trimmed and were told it had hooves .
Japanese police believe there could be 2000 people affected by the scam , which operated in Sapporo and capitalised on the fact that sheep are rare in Japan , so many do not know what they look like .
“ We launched an investigation after we were made aware that a company were selling sheep as poodles , ” Japanese police said , The Sun reported .
“ Sadly we think there is more than one company operating in this way .
“ The sheep are believed to have been imported from overseas – Britain , Australia . ”
Many of the sheep have now been donated to zoos and farms .
Origins :
This tale of dog lovers in Japan taken by swindlers who “ imported entire flocks of sheep from the UK and Australia ” and sold them as poodles hit the news in April 2007 when it was published
in some UK newspapers ( including the Metro and the Sun ) known for their not infrequent detours into the fantastic .
Many readers spotted its remarkable similarity to the hoary “ Mexican Pet ” urban legend , in which unsuspecting tourists traveling in a foreign country adopt a small stray dog , only to discover later that their new pet is actually a very large form of rat .
The notion that anyone who had ever seen a dog ( which is most everyone ) could be fooled by sheep proffered as poodles is as implausible ( if not more so ) as the idea that anyone could really mistake a rat for a dog .
( The claim that “ sheep are rare in Japan and most people do not know what they look like ” is just silly : even schoolchildren who have never seen live sheep learn to identify them from pictures and drawings and can recognize them as something distinctly different than dogs .
Certainly the creatures ’ bleating instead of barking and having hooves in place of paws are some basic , easily recognized clues . )
And in this case the tale is not something that supposedly happened to the indefinite “ some tourist ” in “ a foreign country , ” but to thousands of Japanese in their homeland , people who were reportedly shelling out the equivalent of $ 1,600 per sheep - dog before anyone caught on to the scam and blew the whistle .
Aside from its basic implausibility , a number of other details tolled the death knell for this version of the legend :
This astounding story seems to have completely escaped the notice of the news media in Japan ( where it should have been receiving the greatest amount of coverage ) , and police in Sapporo said they had not heard of the scam .
The company identified as the outfit behind the sheep - as - poodles swindle , Poodles As Pets , did n’t seem to exist in Sapporo ( or anywhere else in Japan ) .
As Cerebral Soup !
pointed out , the very same story had been posted as a blog entry ( in Japanese ) back in February 2006 .
Cerebral Soup !
also noted it was n’t the case that , as claimed in the English - language articles , “ Japanese moviestar Maiko Kawamaki [ sic ] went on a talk - show and wondered why her new pet would not bark or eat dog food . ”
Actually , Ms. Kawakami appeared on a Japanese television show ( Gokigenyou ) and merely said that she had heard a story about someone else ’s being sold a sheep as a poodle .
All in all , this was yet another case of an urban legend ’s being recycled by a few news sources who were n’t about to let the truth get in the way of a good story .
In April 2013 English - language news outlets such as the UK ’s Daily Mail ran a similar story based on an Argentinian television news report supposedly showing that scammers in Argentina were selling ferrets which had been “ pumped up on steroids ” to unsuspecting buyers and passing them off as toy poodles :
Gullible bargain hunters at Argentina ’s largest bazaar are forking out hundreds of dollars for what they think are gorgeous toy poodles , only to discover that their cute pooch is in fact a ferret pumped up on steroids .
Gullible bargain hunters at Argentina ’s largest bazaar are forking out hundreds of dollars for what they think are gorgeous toy poodles , only to discover that their cute pooch is in fact a ferret pumped up on steroids .
One retired man from Catamarca , duped by the knock - down price for a pedigree dog , became suspicious he had bought what Argentinians call a ‘ Brazilian rat ’ and when he returned home took the ‘ dogs ’ to a vet for their vaccinations .
Imagine his surprise when his suspicious were confirmed – he had in fact purchased two ferrets that had been given steroids at birth to increase their size and then had some extra grooming to make their coats resemble a fluffy toy poodle .
Sightings :
On 28 April 2007 , venerable radio personality Paul Harvey broadcast as a news story the tale of Japanese poodles as his For What It ’s Worth offering of the day , reporting , “ Thousands of women paid many thousands of dollars for miniature white poodles which are now growing up and turning out to be furniture - eating sheep . ”

Fox had Foley emails , chose not to run RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday October 3 , 2006 Print This Email This Fox News had copies of emails written by Congressman Mark Foley ( R- FL ) to a Louisiana boy , but chose not to run the story , according to a passage in an Associated Press report .
The relevant excerpt follows : # The FBI has begun an inquiry into Foley 's computer contact with pages , and Hastert wrote a letter to Florida Gov. Jeb Bush asking for an investigation into whether state laws were broken .
Meanwhile , Florida newspapers  who were leaked copies of the e-mail with the Louisiana boy last year  defended their decision not to run stories .
Both The St. Petersburg Times and The Miami Herald were given copies of the e-mail , as were other news organizations , including Fox News .
" Our decision at the time was ... that because the language was not sexually explicit and was subject to interpretation , from innocuous to ' sick , ' as the page characterized it , to be cautious , " said Tom Fiedler , executive editor of the Herald .
" Given the potentially devastating impact that a false suggestion of pedophilia could have on anyone , not to mention a congressman known to be gay , and lacking any corroborating information , we chose not to do a story . "

Reporters Without Borders is claiming that Yahoo aided in the jailing of a Chinese dissident in 2003 , the second such accusation for Yahoo ( more on the first – a journalist – here ) .
The organization is requesting that Yahoo disclose its dealings with the Chinese government .
From the report :
Reporters Without Borders called on Yahoo to supply a list of all cyberdissidents it has provided data on , beginning with 81 people in China whose release the worldwide press freedom organization is currently campaigning for .
It said it had discovered that Yahoo customer and cyberdissident Li Zhi had been given his eight - year prison sentence in December 2003 based on electronic records provided by Yahoo .
“ How many more cases are we going to find ? ” it asked .
“ We were sure the case of Shi Tao , who was jailed for 10 years last April on the basis of Yahoo - supplied data , was not the only one .
Now we know Yahoo works regularly and efficiently with the Chinese police .
“ The firm says it simply responds to requests from the authorities for data without ever knowing what it will be used for .
But this argument no longer holds water .
Yahoo certainly knew it was helping to arrest political dissidents and journalists , not just ordinary criminals .
The company must answer for what it is doing at the US congressional hearing set for February 15 . ”

March 3 , 2007  --
While Americans are planning and scheduling their lives more than ever before , it seems they can never quite catch up .
A recent survey found 15 to 20 percent of the U.S. population is " consistently late , " especially when it comes to work .
Chronic lateness is n't just annoying -- it 's expensive .
American CEOs are late to eight out of every 10 meetings , according to a 2006 survey by Proudfoot Consulting .
And when CEOs are late by 10 minutes every day , it costs the U.S. economy $ 90 billion in lost productivity .
" It 's a huge drain on productivity when meetings consistently start 10 or 15 minutes behind , and tardiness has a snowball effect as one person 's lateness affects the productivity of his or her colleagues , " said Diana DeLonzer , author of the recently published " Never Be Late Again , 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged . "
For some , being chronically late can be damaging and embarrassing .
For others , it 's a way of showing power or prestige .
In a 1997 San Francisco State Univeristy study , DeLonzor found that the punctually challenged often shared common personality characteristics such as anxiety , low levels of self - control , or a penchant for thrill - seeking .
" People who tend to who have low self - control , for instance , will tend to procrastinate more in general because they have difficulty motivating themselves , " she said .
A Lifetime of Lateness
Althea Kippes is a San Francisco lawyer who 's been late for most of her life .
She was even late to her college graduation at the University of California -- Berkeley .
" Other people have addictive behaviors that keep them from being all they could , " she said .
" This is sort of like that . "
Kippes ' schedule is jam - packed .
A typical day starts with a personal trainer appointment at 8 a.m. , a meeting with her boss at 10 a.m. and a client lunch at 11:30 a.m..
But Kippes is guilty of ignoring her alarm clock and sleeping in , which means she struggles to catch up for the rest of the day .
After she showed up to lunch with her client an hour late , Kippes admitted she needed help .
" I 'm actually kind of shooting myself in the foot because I 'm just really , I 'm not able to meet all these expectations I 've created for myself , " she said .
Experts say there are many different types of chronically late people .
First , there 's the rationalizer -- the type that blames outside factors , like their children or spouse .
Then there are the absent - minded professor types -- those who are forgetful .
The most common type of tardy person is someone like Kippes , a deadline - driven adrenaline junkie .
" Adrenaline , it can be addictive in a sense , " DeLonzer explained .
" Your heart pounds faster .
Your temperature rises .
And the tension can be a very pleasurable experience . "
Finally , there 's the rebel type -- someone who defies authority , who can actually get a physiological high by keeping others waiting for them .
" They might even get a bit of ego boost when they keep other people waiting , " DeLonzer said .
" They feel as though they are important , and people are willing to wait for them . "
Tips for Tackling Tardiness
Regardless of the reason , most people who are chronically late want to get their lives back on track .
DeLonzer suggested the following tips for tackling tardiness .
Plan to be early .
Tack on a 15 minute buffer before getting anywhere .
Learn to tell time .
For a week , track how much time it takes to get certain tasks done .
Set a kitchen timer to ring when it 's time to leave the house .
Learn how to say " no . "
Pare down activities and do n't over - commit .
Do n't be a perfectionist .
Agonizing and obsessing over details only contributes to lateness -- so loosen up .
Limit distractions .
Turn off the radio and TV .
Get out the door .
Resist the impulse to rush back into the house for " just one more thing . "
Make up a threat .
Tell friends that if you 're late to dinner , you 'll buy wine for everyone .
If the threat of being inconsiderate is n't enough , a hit to the wallet might do the trick .
Israel said its planes buzzed the summer residence of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia , flying low enough to cause a noise on the ground .
Israeli officials said on condition of anonymity that Assad was targeted because of the " direct link " between Syria and Hamas , the Palestinian militant group holding Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit , 19 , in the Gaza Strip .
Syria hosts Khaled Meshaal , Hamas ' exiled supreme leader .
The Syrian state television report did not mention the overflight of Assad 's residence , saying two Israeli planes flew " at a low altitude " near Syria 's Mediterranean coast around dawn on Wednesday .
" The overflight by two Israeli planes near the Syrian shores is an aggressive act and a provocation , " the television news said , quoting an unindentified Information Ministry official .
It said " national air defences opened fire in the direction of the planes , and they dispersed and left the area . "
Israeli TV said four planes were involved in the overflight and that Assad was home at the time .
Officials did not report that the jets came under fire from the Syrians .
The flyover was the second time Israel has buzzed Assad 's summer palace .
In August 2003 , warplanes reportedly flew so low that windows in the palace shattered .
At the time , Israel said the flyover was aimed at pressuring Assad to dismantle Palestinian militant groups based in his country .
In October 2003 , Israeli warplanes bombed an Islamic Jihad training base deep in Syria .
It was the first attack on Syrian soil in more than two decades .
The airstrike followed a suicide bombing by Islamic Jihad that killed 19 Israelis in a restaurant .
But this would be a rare instance of the Syrian military firing back on Israeli forces .
The two militaries clashed in Lebanon in the 1980s during that country 's civil war .
In 1996 , Israeli warplanes launched heavy raids on positions in Beirut in reponse to Hezbollah rocket fire .
During those raids , Israel said Syrian air defences in the Lebanese capital fired on its planes , so the Israeli air force demolished a Syrian base there .
But since then , the Syrians - whose military is far outmatched by Israel 's - are not known to have fired on Israeli forces .
The overflight brought Syria into Israel 's confrontation with Hamas over the abduction of 19 - year - old Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit on Sunday .
Israel accused Hamas ' Mashaal of masterminding the kidnapping and has threatened to try to assassinate him .
Syria denied the Damascus - based Hamas leadership had any connection to the kidnapping .
" If the goal of this ( overflight ) is to blame the political leadership of Hamas for the abduction of the Israeli soldier , then Israel is making a big mistake that is goes beyond logic , " the Information Ministry official said , according to the TV report .
The official said the abduction " is an operation that could not have taken place by remote control " by orders from the Damascus - based leadership .
He said the overflight " reflects Israel 's failure and its domestic troubles , which it is trying to export to the outside as it makes accusations against others . "
Hours after the overflight , Assad maintained his normal schedule , meeting in the afternoon with Lebanon 's parliament speaker and Jordan 's prime minister in Damascus .
There was no sign of unusual military precautions in the Syrian capital .
The overflight brought criticism from one of Assad 's top opponents , Lebanese prime minister Fuad Saniora .
" This action is condemned .
We condemn violation of any Arab country 's airspace , " Saniora told reporters today .
Apparently , lampposts really do n't get enough credit for all they do , as not only do they provide a crucial light source for us night - owls , but we 've got them to thank for WiFi hotspots , surveillance checkpoints , and if Philips has its way , on - road warning signs .
The oft overlooked street lamp could be getting a bit of an upgrade according to a recent patent application from Philips , as the company envisions a " traffic information system " designed to convey messages to drivers without requiring them to look away from the road ahead .
By installing a high - powered " laser " and matching it up with movable mirrors , the firm hopes to divulge pertinent information such as upcoming hazards , weather conditions , or other random tidbits of knowledge onto the pavement for drivers to view .
Moreover , the units would be RF / IP controllable in order to change the messages nearly on - the - fly , giving motorists a quick heads - up about recent traffic changes or detours .
Still , the premise of beaming warning signs on the road ahead sounds perfectly viable if you 're on a rural two - lane at 2:00 AM , but we can't imagine things being very legible when it 's beaming messages onto hoods of angry commuters in your average city .

Interesting article in the Chronicle of Higher Education : Top Colleges Should Select Randomly From a Pool of " Good Enough , " by Barry Schwartz :
In the college - admissions game , both the applicants and the institutions are behaving like what I have elsewhere called " maximizers . "
Both believe that only the best will do .
Research by my colleagues and I has shown that such maximizing is a self - defeating strategy , at least subjectively , in that it leads to stress , anxiety , frustration , regret , and , ultimately , disappointment with outcomes that are excellent but fail to meet either expectations or aspirations .
Maximizers may do better than nonmaximizers ( we call them " satisficers " ) objectively , but they tend to feel worse about how they do .
Maximizing is almost certainly a self - defeating strategy objectively as well .
Many years ago , the social scientists Detlof von Winterfeldt and Ward Edwards articulated what they called the " principle of the flat maximum . "
The principle asserts that in many situations involving uncertainty -- and college choice is certainly such a situation , from the perspectives of both applicants and institutions -- the likely outcomes of many choices are effectively equivalent .
Or , to put it perhaps more accurately , the degree of uncertainty makes it impossible to know which excellent school ( or student ) will be better than which other excellent school ( or student ) .
Said another way , there are many " right " choices .
Uncertainty of outcomes makes the hair - splitting to distinguish among excellent colleges or students a waste of time and effort .
There is more uncertainty about the quality of the student - college match than there is variation among colleges -- at least within the set of excellent , selective colleges .
So once a set of " good enough students " or " good enough colleges " has been identified , it probably does n't matter very much which one you choose ; and if it does matter , there is no way to know in advance ( because of the inherent uncertainty ) what the right choice is .
Government scientists , armed with copies of heavily edited reports , charged Monday that the Bush administration and its political appointees had soft - pedaled their findings on climate change .
The accusations led Democrats and Republicans at the congressional hearing to accuse each other of censorship , smear tactics and McCarthyism .
To underscore their charges of the administration ’s oil - friendly stance , Democrats grilled an oil lobbyist who was hired by the White House to review government climate change documents and who made hundreds of edits that the lawmakers said minimized the impact of global warming .
“ You were a spin doctor , ” Rep. John A. Yarmuth ( D - Ky ) told the lobbyist .

Republicans targeted a NASA director who testified about administration pressure , accusing him of political bias , of politicizing his work and of ignoring uncertainties in climate change science .
And they disputed his contention that taxpayer - funded scientists are entitled to free speech .
“ Free speech is not a simple thing and is subject to and directed by policy , ” said Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - Utah ) .
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing was marked by an open confrontation between Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) and the ranking Republican , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Vista ) -- a rare display of direct debate in otherwise carefully choreographed hearings .
The hearing was the latest effort to challenge what the Democratic congressional majority sees as the Bush administration ’s unchecked use of power .
In the past few weeks , Democrats have held inquiries or announced plans to examine the unmonitored use of national security letters that allow the government to spy on Americans , the dismissal of U.S. attorneys and the identifying of former covert CIA operative Valerie Plame , among other issues .

Waxman has been particularly aggressive , pursuing inquiries about intelligence in the lead - up to the Iraq war and the politics of global warming .
To support their charges Monday , the Democrats produced hundreds of pages of legal depositions , exhibits and e-mail exchanges between administration officials .
The paper trail illustrated how officials with no scientific training shaped the administration ’s climate change message and edited global warming reports , inserting doubt in the place of definitive statements and diminishing the role people play in the planet ’s rising temperatures .
Waxman ’s committee received more than eight boxes of papers from the White House Council on Environmental Quality that he said provided disturbing indications of political interference .
“ There may have been a concerted effort directed by the White House to mislead the public about the dangers of global climate change , ” said Waxman , who also cited the administration practice of “ controlling what federal scientists could say to the public and the media about their work . ”
Advertisement
“ It would be a serious abuse if senior White House officials deliberately tried to defuse calls for action by ensuring that the public heard a distorted message about the risks of climate change , ” Waxman said .
One example showed how a report originally said the U.S. National Research Council had concluded that “ greenhouse gases are accumulating in the atmosphere as a result of human activities , causing surface air temperatures to rise and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise . ”

Edits by ex-oil lobbyist

Philip Cooney , the oil lobbyist who became chief of staff at the Council on Environmental Quality , changed that to read : “ Some activities emit greenhouse gases that directly or indirectly may affect the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation , thereby potentially affecting climate on regional and global scales . ”
James Hansen , director of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , said the edits confused public understanding of the issue .
“ If we push our climate system hard enough , it can pass tipping points , ” he said .
“ That is not a situation we want to leave for our children . ”
Hansen decried political interference in climate change science .
“ Scientists should n’t be hired to parrot some line . ”
But he also said the real weapon against scientists was the budget .
Last year , he said , the administration slashed climate change budgets retroactively by 20 % .
Advertisement
Cooney , now with Exxon Mobil Corp. , came to the White House in 2001 after more than 15 years with the American Petroleum Institute , the oil industry lobby group .
His last post there was leader of the climate team .
Waxman quoted an internal API document that identified climate change as the group ’s highest priority .
He said a key API tactic was to spread doubt about climate change science , exaggerating scientific uncertainty and downplaying the role of humans in climate change .
“ What bothers me is that you seem to take the exact same approach in the White House , ” Waxman told Cooney .
Cooney , soft - spoken but increasingly red-faced as the hours went by , repeatedly stressed that his job was to align reports with administration policy , as reflected by a 2001 National Academy of Sciences report that indicated some doubt about climate change models .
Advertisement
He denied his aim was to sow doubt or that he had any loyalty to the oil industry , even as lawmakers pointed to some 181 changes he made to one document , which Rep. Peter Welch ( D - Vt. ) said “ had the effect of emphasizing or exaggerating the level of uncertainty surrounding global warming science . ”
“ How is what you were doing ... any different than the work of the so - called scientists during the whole tobacco debate when they were sowing doubt about whether there was any link between tobacco and lung cancer ? ”
Welch asked .

Republican rebuttals
Advertisement
Republicans , in turn , came down hard on Democrats and Hansen , often sparking verbal fisticuffs .
Rep. Mark Souder ( R - Ind . ) raised Hansen ’s work on “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” the documentary on Al Gore ’s global - warming efforts , as evidence of Democratic sympathies .
Hansen is a registered independent .
Several Republicans criticized Hansen for comparing administration efforts to limit and monitor scientists ’ speech with similar efforts in Nazi Germany .
Issa said he hoped Hansen was n’t influenced by money tied to a prize named after John Heinz , a former Republican senator and deceased husband of Teresa Heinz Kerry , the wife of Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) .
Advertisement
Waxman turned to Issa , who sat beside him .
“ I think the gentleman ’s smearing Dr. Hansen , ” Waxman said .
Issa stared , started to speak , but Waxman cut him off , repeating himself .
“ Are you recognizing yourself ? ” Issa asked , using the formal phrase to see if Waxman was allotting himself time to speak .
“ Well , I recognize you , ” Waxman shot back as the crowd laughed .
“ I think you ’re smearing him .
Do you want to comment on that ? ”

Issa offered his rebuttal , noting that Hansen “ clearly disliked ” the Bush administration and the lawmakers moved on .

Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is not the typical first lady , who can be seen next to the president of such a conservative country like France .
She has repeatedly been accused of breach of official protocol events .
She even affords to openly criticize the Pope .
Bruni walks the distance from the catwalk to the Elysee Palace , form the first man of the rock music – Mick Jagger to the first man in the country – Nicolas Sarkozy .
Carla Bruni was born on December 23 , 1968 in Turin , Italy .
Comes from a wealthy family that owns a company for production of tires .
When she was 5 she moved with her parents to France , due to threats of kidnapping .
Carla grew up in Paris and later on graduated a school in Switzerland .
At the age of 19 , she returned to Paris and no longer after she started a career of a model .
Carla Bruni entered the world of fashion and quickly became one of the 20 most expensive top models , earning $ 7.5 million per year .
She worked for the most famous designers and fashion houses , including Givenchy , Dior , Paco Rabanne , Sonia Rykiel , Chanel , Versace and many others .
Bruni quickly became a darling of the tabloids , thanks to her relationships with famous men like Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton , Donald Trump , Kevin Costner and Vincent Perez .
She became famous with the words that that she is easily bored by monogamy , and that “ love lasts a long time , but the burning attraction between men and women – just a week or two .
In 1998 , Bruni leaved the catwalk and dedicated her time to her other great passion – singing .
Her first album “ Somebody said to me ” ( 2002 ) enjoyed a huge interest across Europe .
In 2007 she released her second album .
However , in 2001 she did something more important : she gave birth to her son , Aurélien .
The media are very interested of the news , as the boy ’s father is the French philosopher Raphael Entoven .
The truth is that Carla had a relationship with his father some years before …
On February 2 , 2008 Carla Bruni again called the attention to her personality and becomes a media sensation .
The occasion is her wedding with the French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
Reviews were contradictory and varied from strong approval of the new first lady to absolutely negative .
There were many vicious comments like “ The Third Mrs. Sarkozy ” …
Despite her new duties , Carla did n’t sop singing .
On the contrary – just a few months after becoming a first lady of France , she promoted her new album .
The funds available from its sales were given to various charities and humanitarian causes .
In July 2009 Carla Bruni was invited to sing during the 91st birthday of Nelson Mandela .
As the first lady of France , Kalra Bruni-Sarkozy is always observed with a magnifying glass .
For example , during her visit to Britain , she was admired on her choice to be dressed in a suit from Christian Dior .
The reason ?
This is a French brand , leaded by a Britain ’s chief : the designer John Galliano .
Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has always demonstrated personal position and did not hesitate to criticize even Pope Benedict XVI in connection with his position on AIDS .

Dennis Quaid Provides Voice Talent in TimeShift
Dennis Quaid ( In Good Company , The Day After Tomorrow , The Rookie , Far From Heaven and Traffic ) is supplying the voice talent for Sierra Entertainment 's TimeShift according to a press release from the company .
Quaid will provide the voice of Colonel Michael Swift , a man who is haunted by the tragic loss of his daughter .
Colonel Swift accepts an offer from the US Government to test an experimental set of time - control devices and he becomes the world 's first " chrononaut . "
Unfortunately he inadvertently alters time during one of the tests and returns to a present changed beyond recognition .
The democracy he left has become a fascist nightmare -- and his knowledge of his time travel saga has made him an enemy of the state .
It sounds like a terrific plot device .
It would have been even cooler if the character was also based on Quaid .
TimeShift will be out for the Xbox 360 this September .

こんにちはこんにちは！！
今日もプチプチ、回線切れてますか！
ネットゲームなんかだと致命的だよね…！
ノイズとかで切れちゃうのって！
光にするのって、ただ速いだけじゃなくて、
そんなところにもメリットがあるんだと思います！
でも 「うちは引けないなー」って諦めてるひと、案外多かったりしませんか！
たとえば 、
大家さんが認めてくれないよきっと…とか、
市営・都営住宅だし…とか、
すでに、マンショ ンVDSLタイプが導入されてるけどなんか調子悪いとか、
いつまでたっても数ヶ月後にマンションタイプの計画がとかなんとか…！
さて今日は、そんなきみに、
さくっと部屋まで光ファイバーを引き込めちゃうかもしれない方法をお教えします！
とりあえず 、NTT の、
・ハイパーファミリー ( 安くて速いやつ )
もしくは
・ベーシック ( 高くて、もうちょっとだけ速いやつ )
を、導入するって前提でいきますね！
こ れ「 一戸建て住宅向け」って書いてあるけど、大丈夫！
マンション、しかも高層階でも引き込めるよ！
１． 光を引くための条件を知ろう！
・提供エリアであること ( エリア外ならさすがにむりです＞＜ )
・大家さんとかビル管理会社の許可を得ていること ( 口頭でokだよ！ )
これだけです！ たぶん ！
つまり、電話で良いから、大家さんに許可さえもらっちゃえばいいってことだね！
２． さっそく大家さんに電話しよう！
ここですよね！ 超難関！ ちょこっとコツを覚えよう ！
・「 PCとかよく知らない子」になりき る
つい、 「 いや、だからねGE-PONが…」とかなんとか言っちゃいそうなきみも
このときばっかりは専門用語っぽい難しい言葉を忘れちゃおうね！
つまり …
・ 「 インターネット 」 「光ファイバー」って言葉をつかわない
大家さんにとっては、大事なビルなんだから、
そんなわけのわからないもの、聞いただけで拒絶反応なんです＞＜
これだけ ！
え！ そんなのでどうやって引き込み工事の交渉するのって思いますよね…！
以下の要領で進める感じです！
き み 「 こんにちはこんにちは！！ 」 大家 「 はいこんにちは…！ 」 きみ 「 ご相談です！ ちょっ とNTT の新しい電話にしたいんですけど、いいですか！ 」 大家 「 電話？ 」 きみ 「 うんそう！ NTT で『ひかり電話』とかいう安いタイプのがでたらしくて、 それに変更したいんですぼく！ 」 大家 「 あー。でも、なんか穴あけたりとかされるのは困るんだけど…！ 」 きみ 「 あ、それは大丈夫！ NTT に聞いてみたよ！ もともとの電話の穴 に10 分くらいの簡単な工事するだけで、 穴とか一切あけないし、元の状態にも簡単に戻せるって言ってました！ 」 大家 「 あーそんなのなら、いいかな 」 きみ 「 もしかしたら、工事のときに配電盤みたいなの開けるのかもしれないから、 その時はまた連絡しますね！ ありがとう大家だいすき！ 」
こんな感じ！ 簡単だよね ！
あとは 、NTTに電話し て「 Bフレいっこください！ 大家さんに許可もらってるよ！ 」って言えばok！
気になるなら一緒 にIP電話も申し込んでおけば、全然ウソついたことにもならないよね！
ぼくもむかし、市が管理してるマンションの、かなり上の階に住んでたことがあったんだけど、
そんなところでも、Bフレッツベーシック引き込めてたんだから、きっときみも大丈夫だよ！
ちなみにプロバイダは、bb.excite が安くていいですね！
バックボーンの IIJ と、ガッチリつながってて速いよ ！

PRISONERS ' VOICES | HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH REPORT , " NO ESCAPE "
People living near a pagan statue that draws thousands of tourists every year to Northern Ireland 's lakelands are threatening a campaign of civil disobedience amid concerns it could be moved to Belfast .
The Janus , which has stood in the Caldragh graveyard on Boa Island in Co Fermanagh since it was put up by the Celts more than 2,000 years ago , inspired the Nobel prize - winning poet Seamus Heaney to write the poem , ' January God ' .
Locals hold the 2ft tall figure , depicting a man on one side and a female on the other , in awe .
But now rumours are circling that the statue may be moved to the Ulster Museum for its own protection .
Opponents say it would be like moving Stonehenge to London .
Gerry Carrigan has lived a mile and a half from the Janus site for more than 60 years .
' I will cling on to it myself if I come across anyone trying to uproot it , ' he said .
' The Janus has been here for more than 2,000 years .
This place is its home , not some museum in Belfast . '
Looking around last week at his fellow protesters gathered inside the graveyard where the statue stands , Carrigan added : ' These people and more like them are prepared to do the same .
We will physically stand in the way of anyone trying to take the Janus away . '
But there is concern among some archaeologists that the elements have badly eroded the statue .
A spokesman for the National Museums Northern Ireland refused to state if they wanted it moved to Belfast .
' The Ulster Museum is committed to preserving objects of historical importance , ' the spokesman said .
' The museum 's position on any valuable public asset which is of value to our heritage is that this would be best preserved in a protected , sheltered and conditioned environment .
In the case of any scheduled monument on private property , such a decision is down to the landowner and the Department of the Environment . '
Jim Cunningham , a local historian , tour guide and headmaster of nearby St Davog 's Primary School in Beleek , said there was an alternative way of protecting the Janus .
' If this statue was situated five miles away across the border in the Irish Republic , there would be no question of moving it , ' he said .
' In Tara the famous High Cross was not moved out of the centre of Kells but rather placed in protective glass .
This was what happened to statues in Clonmacnoise too .
They were moved into protective casing just 20 yards from their original location .
' In the summer , whenever I take tourists around Fermanagh one of the main things they ask to see is the Janus figure .
It is a world - famous attraction .
Look at any book on Celtic civilisation anywhere on the planet and you will find a picture of the Janus in its pages . '
A mile and a half from the graveyard in Kells , a popular tourist attraction for fishing , local bed and breakfast owners said that moving the statue would damage tourism .
A local filmmaker and B&B owner , Alwyn James , said there were concerns that the authorities were planning to uproot the Janus and replace it with a plastic replica .
' It would be an insult if the statue was replaced by a Celtic version of a plastic gnome , ' he said .
Historians believe that Boa Island was a place of pagan worship , and that is why the Janus figure was placed there originally .
There is , however , a debate over whether a Christian building was constructed on the site in the post - pagan world .
There are Christian graves dating back to the 13th century at the spot , but no evidence of any Christian church .
Procrastination is the antithesis of productivity , yet you ’ve likely found yourself asking , “ Why do I procrastinate ? ” more than once in life .
Procrastination is a habit , and one that many people do n’t even realize they ’re engaging in .
However , it ’s possible to learn how to overcome procrastination once we know why people procrastinate .
Procrastination slows your goals and dreams way down .
It can create stress and feelings of frustration .
It can make time management useless .
This often appears at work with day - to - day projects and tasks .
So why do people procrastinate and self - sabotage in this way ?
Essentially , there are 5 main reasons behind procrastination .
See if you can identify with any of these in your own life and learn how to tackle the source .
1. The Perfectionist ’s Fear
Procrastination is sometimes a subconscious fear of failure .
If you put off a task long enough , then you do n’t have to face up to the potential ( and usually imagined ) negative results .
If you ’re a stickler for minor details , the stress of getting things “ just right ” may be too much and cause you to delay continuing the task .
Either way , fear is at the root cause and can sabotage your desire to move forward .
How to Tackle It
Try visualizing the completion of your task in a positive way .
Advertising
For example , you have a presentation that your boss wants you to conduct for a potential client .
Visualize yourself standing in the meeting room confidently , meeting the eyes of the client and seeing them light up as you explain the concept simply and concisely .
Imagine your boss telling you how impressive your presentation was .
Think about how it would feel and focus on this as you move forward with the task .
Perfection does n’t exist .
Simply put in your best effort and realize that ’s all you can do .
This will help you stop asking , “ Why do I procrastinate ? ”
2. The Dreamer ’s Lack of Action
This is a person who is highly creative and has many brilliant ideas but ca n’t quite seem to bring them to fruition .
The main reason for this is because there ’s usually no structure or goal - setting involved once the idea has been created .
This aimless approach ends up manifesting as a lack of decision - making and significant delays on a project .
How to Tackle It
Once you have your idea , write down a timeline of what you want to achieve and by when .
Ideally , do this daily to keep yourself on track and accountable .
Creative minds tend to jump from one idea to the next , so cultivating focus is essential .
For example , if you ’re designing and creating a new product at work , set out a task list for the week ahead with the steps you want to focus on each day .
Doing this ahead of time will stop your mind from wandering to different ideas .

3. The Overwhelmed Avoider
This is one of the most common answers to the question “ Why do I procrastinate ? ” : the sheer overwhelm of a daunting task .
The complexity of a task can cause the brain to lose motivation and avoid doing it altogether , choosing instead to stay in its comfort zone .
The search then starts for a more enjoyable task , and the harder tasks are put off .
This can cause stress and dread when the task inevitably comes up to be completed .
How to Tackle It
Break the challenge down into smaller tasks , and tackle each one individually .
For example , if you have a project that has technical elements to it that you know you ’ll find challenging , list each step you need to take in order to complete these difficult elements .
Think of ways you can resolve potential hurdles .
Perhaps you have a coworker that may have time to help , or even consider that the solution may be easier than you initially think .
Put each task in order of most daunting to least daunting .
Ideally , try to deal with the more challenging parts of each task in the morning so that momentum is created as the tasks get easier through the day .
A reward system will also help you stay motivated so , once completed , you can enjoy your treat of choice .
4. The Busy Bee Who Lacks Prioritization
If you ’re asking , “ Why do I procrastinate ? ” it may be that you either have too many tasks or do n’t truly acknowledge the differing importance of each task .
The result ?
Getting nothing done .
Advertising
Time is spent switching constantly from one task to another , or spending too much time deciding what to do .
This often happens to people who like to multitask or have a variety of things to do all the time .
Things can get mixed up , and prioritization can become an issue .
How to Tackle It
It ’s all about priorities and choosing important tasks over urgent ones .
Make sure to question the value and purpose of each task , and make a list in order of importance .
For example , throughout your work day , you can waste a lot of time dealing with “ urgent ” emails from colleagues , but you need to ask yourself if these are more important than working on a task that will affect , say , several office projects at once .
If you ’re not great at prioritization , you can use the Eisenhower Matrix , which helps to organize tasks based on their importance and urgency :
5. The Distraction - Prone
Another common answer to “ Why do I procrastinate ? ” is simply distraction .
Advertising
Research has shown that our brains are n’t wired to focus for long periods of time , and it looks for something else .
Throw in a bunch of chatty colleagues or the desire to mindlessly check social media , and you ’ve got a recipe for ultimate procrastination .
However , this type of procrastination may not always be an unconscious decision to sabotage and put off work .
It ’s simply a result of your work setup or types of coworkers you have .
Only you know the answer to that .
It ’s also important to note that our attention spans depend largely on the task and on our individual brain .
Dr. Gemma Briggs , a psychology lecturer at the Open University , explained , “ How we apply our attention to different tasks depends very much about what the individual brings to that situation ” .
How to Tackle It
Be mindful of your workspace and potential distractions .
Schedule a specific time to converse with your coworkers , put headphones on to minimize listening to what ’s going on around you , and switch your phone off .
Aim to do this for 20 - 30 minutes at a time , and then take a break .
This will be a much more efficient way of working and getting things done .
This is also why scheduling down time is so important for productivity .
Whether this type of procrastination is self - sabotage or being a victim of a distracting environment , either way you can take control .

“ We came for an alien souvenir , ” said Shihgo Miyamoto , 29 , who was holding his wife , Yoko , both shivering in the high - desert wind .
I took their picture under an official Nevada Department of Transportation Extraterrestrial Highway sign , a sprawl of trailer homes in the background .
“ So cold , so empty , ” said Mr. Miyamoto , looking to the desert beyond his rental car .
SOUTH -CENTRAL
Nevada is , by and large , a vast wasteland , scrubby and unpopulated , dotted with dry lakes , streaked with tan rocky peaks , ravines and wide alluvial plains .
Government land is ubiquitous .
Cattle guards rumble under tires on the barren highways , which cut through sand and open range .
To drive the Extraterrestrial Highway — a route that snakes northwest for 98 empty miles , intersecting no other major roads — is to drive one of the most desolate stretches of pavement in the country .
Gasoline is unavailable for its entire length .
R.V. ’s cannot hook up in Rachel , the only town on the road .
According to the Nevada Department of Transportation , an average of about 200 cars drive some portion of the Extraterrestrial Highway every day , making it one of the state ’s least traveled routes .
On my midday drive up the highway in February , I saw only six other vehicles .
Coming north from the town of Alamo , where I stayed overnight in a cabin , the Extraterrestrial Highway began as an innocuous flat road through scrubby highlands .
A mile or so in , a large silver Quonset hut announced itself as the New Alien Research Center , but its driveway was gated , so I drove on by .
The road bobbed through a Martian landscape , red valleys raked with lines , flat expanses of gravel and dead shrubs , all ringed by hulking mountains of stratified stone .
A hawk hung high in the air .
Joshua trees reached for the sun , their bristled bunches aglow , seemingly illuminated from within .
March 30 , 2006  --
When 19 - year - old " Jane , " who asked that her real name not be used , was in prep school , she said several of her classmates obtained notes from psychologists diagnosing them with learning disabilities , even though they did n't have any learning problems .
They faked learning disabilities to get extra time to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test , or SAT , in the hopes of getting a higher score , she said .
" I had a friend who is a good math student but is no math brain , and she got extended time and got a perfect score on her math SAT , " Jane said .
That friend now attends an Ivy League school .
Some call this scheme the rich - kids loophole .
With intense competition to get into Ivy League and other elite colleges , students say they need nearly perfect SAT scores , as well as great grades and impressive extra-curricular activities .
A rising chorus of critics say high school students from wealthy ZIP codes and elite schools obtain questionable diagnoses of learning disabilities to secure extra time to take the SATs and beef up their scores .
Jane believes that to get into Harvard or Princeton , she 'd need to score at least a 1500 .
The highest SAT score is 1600 .
" I got below 1400 and I knew I did n't have a shot getting into an Ivy despite my grades and extra-curriculars , " she said .
' Hired Guns ' Give Diagnosis
Approximately 300,000 students will take the three - hour - and - forty - five - minute SAT this Saturday ; about 30,000 taking the test this year will be given special accommodations , including extra time .
For decades , the College Board , which administers the SAT , has allowed up to twice as much time to accommodate students who have legitimate learning disabilities , such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
But with college admissions more competitive than ever , guidance counselors and other educators say privileged kids have gamed the system .
At the elite Wayland High school outside Boston , the number of students receiving special accommodations is more than 12 percent , more than six times the estimated national average of high school students with learning disabilities .
Wayland guidance counselor Norma Greenberg said that it's not that difficult for wealthy , well - connected students to get the diagnoses they want .
" There are a lot of hired guns out there , there are a lot of psychologists who you can pay a lot of money to and get a murky diagnosis of subtle learning issues , " Greenberg said .
" ' Subtle ' is a word that is really a red flag .
' Executive functioning ' is another red flag , something that is kind of a new thing . "
Other high school guidance counselors told ABC News that " diagnosis shopping " has given rise to a cottage industry of doctors and medical professionals , all willing to give students the documentation they need to get the extra test time they want .
Concentrated Privilege
The natural proportion of learning disabilities should be somewhere around 2 percent , the College Board said , but at some elite schools , up to 46 percent of students receive special accommodations to take the tests , including extra time .
Harvard graduate student and researcher Sam Abrams conducted a study on students in Washington , D.C , where the number of students receiving accommodations is more than three times the national average .
" We see outright overperformance ... scores that , on average , in the disability population , would qualify you without question to the elite universities , " Abrams said .
" This strikes me as very compelling evidence that people are taking advantage of the system in Washington , D.C. "
Abrams believes the abuse has become more frequent since fall 2003 , when the College Board stopped " flagging " the scores of students who took the SAT with extra time .
Since the " flag " was dropped , colleges have no way of knowing that the test was taken under nonstandard conditions .
Abrams and his co-author , Miriam Freedman , believe this has made it more appealing for students who do n't need the extra time to seek it out .
The College Board notes that there has not been an increase in the number of students receiving special accommodations .
It acknowledges that scores for those students have increased but said that 's evidence the students had learning disabilities .
The College Board said students without learning disabilities did not show any marked improvement in scores when given extra time .
In Chicago 's wealthy northern suburbs , SAT tutor Jay Brody sees the same " diagnosis shopping " phenomenon as Greenberg .
" Parents have asked me on numerous occasions if I know doctors who specialize in this , " Brody said .
" I know if you get on the Internet there are doctors who advertise that they perform this service , and there 's really no incentive for doctors not to do it , and so I think it 's pretty easy for anyone to find . "
Mouton's Services
Steven Mouton , a licensed clinical psychologist in Pasedena , Calif. , has a Web site that advertises a number of services , including assessment of learning disabilities .
Mouton charges more than $ 1,500 for a diagnosis and said he diagnosed a learning disability about 90 percent of the time .
Business is up , he said , and most of his clients are from wealthy neighborhoods in Los Angeles .
Though not all -- Mouton advertises a special " fly - in " service to the local airport for those who want to see him and secure his expertise .
" What I recommend is to take the SAT under the regular conditions and then give yourself an additional 50 percent more time on the practice test , " Mouton said .
" And if you see a significant difference , then there is a high probability that you would benefit from the additional time . "
Mouton said it 's impossible to game the system .
" All of those people that are getting the accommodations , those that are getting independent tests to have these accommodations supported , are doing so and in a justified way , " Mouton said .
But in 2000 , the California State Auditor Board reported that " the basis for accommodations [ in the state ] was questionable in 18.2 percent of cases . "
Jay Brody , the tutor , said that extra time is as good as adding a couple hundred points to a student 's score .
In today 's competitive admissions atmosphere , that point jump can mean the difference between getting admitted or rejected from a top - tier school or receiving enough financial aid to actually attend one .
" Accommodations are supposed to level the playing field , " said education lawyer Miriam Freedman .
" They are not supposed to change the game .
This one changes the game at the high range . "
The College Board , however , denies this is a problem at all .
" The board has put into place a rigorous system so that students who should n't be getting special accommodations don't , " said Jim Montoya , a vice president at the College Board .
But out in the trenches , many disagree with the College Board .
Mark Magazu went to a modest high school in rural New Jersey .
He had to take a year off between high school and college to beef up his SAT scores .
Years later , as an SAT tutor , he saw students exploiting the rich - kids loophole , " and he thought it was unfair .
" I mean , I was right on the cusp for everywhere I applied ; I could have used the extra 50 or 200 points , " Maguza said .
" It makes me more mad to know that there are some kids that do n't get accepted , that went through what I did .
I could n't go to school for a year . "
In addition to casting doubt on students who have legitimate special needs , what kind of lesson does this " loophole " teach honest students ?
When ABC News asked Jane , who is now a freshman at Georgetown University , whether in retrospect she 'd wished she had gotten a diagnosis that would have secured extra time for her to take the SAT , she immediately said yes .
But after a second of thought , she changed her mind .
" No , " she said .
" Because I 'm happy here and I got in . "

Tony Walsh has , as others do , some doubts about whether Second Life is sustainable as a business .
But he also poses another question that I had n’t come across before : “ Is Second Life sustainable ecologically ? ”
He quotes Philip Rosedale , the head of Linden Lab , the company behind the virtual world : “ We ’re running at full power all the time , so we consume an enormous amount of electrical power in co-location facilities [ where they house their 4,000 server computers ] …
We ’re running out of power for the square feet of rack space that we ’ve got machines in .
We ca n’t for example use [ blade ] servers right now because they would simply require more electricity than you could get for the floor space they occupy . ”
Walsh notes that on average there are between 10,000 and 15,000 avatars in Second Life at any given time , a number that ’s growing rapidly .
He wonders : “ How much power do 15,000 human beings consume daily compared to 15,000 avatars ? ” Hmm .
That ’s an interesting question .
So let ’s do the math .
If there are on average between 10,000 and 15,000 avatars “ living ” in Second Life at any point , that means the world has a population of about 12,500 .
Supporting those 12,500 avatars requires 4,000 servers as well as the 12,500 PCs the avatars ’ physical alter egos are using .
Conservatively , a PC consumes 120 watts and a server consumes 200 watts .
Throw in another 50 watts per server for data - center air conditioning .
So , on a daily basis , overall Second Life power consumption equals :
( 4,000 x 250 x 24 ) + ( 12,500 x 120 x 24 ) = 60,000,000 watt - hours or 60,000 kilowatt - hours
Per capita , that ’s :
60,000 / 12,500 = 4.8 kWh
Which , annualized , gives us 1,752 kWh .
So an avatar consumes 1,752 kWh per year .
By comparison , the average human , on a worldwide basis , consumes 2,436 kWh per year .
So there you have it : an avatar consumes a bit less energy than a real person , though they ’re in the same ballpark .
Now , if we limit the comparison to developed countries , where per-capita energy consumption is 7,702 kWh a year , the avatars appear considerably less energy hungry than the humans .
But if we look at developing countries , where per-capita consumption is 1,015 kWh , we find that avatars burn through considerably more electricity than people do .
More narrowly still , the average citizen of Brazil consumes 1,884 kWh , which , given the fact that my avatar estimate was rough and conservative , means that your average Second Life avatar consumes about as much electricity as your average Brazilian .
Which means , in turn , that avatars are n’t quite as intangible as they seem .
They do n’t have bodies , but they do leave footprints .
UPDATE : In a comment on this post , Sun ’s Dave Douglas takes the calculations another step , translating electricity consumption into CO2 emissions .
( Carbon dioxide , he notes , “ is the most prevalent greenhouse gas from the production of electricity . ” )
He writes : “ looking at CO2 production , 1,752 kWH / year per avatar is about 1.17 tons of CO2 .
That ’s the equivalent of driving an SUV around 2,300 miles ( or a Prius around 4,000 ) . ”
ナレッジマネジメント系のブログである「 how to save world 」 でちょっと前になるがおもしろい内容が載っていたので、ここで紹介。
「メールを使ってはいけない時」という内容のこの記事では、最近はメール以外のツールも増えてきてそのほとんどは無料でも使えるということを前提に、以下の１０個の場面ではメールではなく他のツールを使うべきだと説いている。
悪いニュース、苦情または批評を伝える時 曖昧な情報や複雑を情報を探す（求める）時
承認を求めているとき（複雑な議論のあるものに）
数名に複雑な指示をするとき 長文ドキュメントにコメントを求めているとき
定期的に繰り返しグループから情報を要求する時
指示を多くの人々に伝える時 コンセンサスを達成したいとき アイデアや議題を探索する時 ニュース、おもしろいドキュメント、リンク、方針、ディレクトリ最新版、および他の'FYI'ものを送るために
（それぞれの詳細の解説も原文には書いてあるので、詳しく知りたい人はそっちを読んで欲しい）
ここにあげられた場面の大半は、これまでもいろんな人が言っていた内容とほぼ同じ事だ。悪い情報や重要な情報、複雑な事を伝達するのにはメールを使ってはダメだというのは既に多くの人が言っている。
私がこれを読んで今風だと思ったのは、１０のFYI（For Your Information）をメールで送らないようにというやつ。どうせ紹介するならば、参考情報元のリソースに直接受信者がアクセスしたり継続的に後からのFeedsを購読できるような仕組みを作ってWebに置いたほうが良いと言うことらしい。ごもっともである。
ここ最近のSBM（ソーシャルブックマーク）の普及や機能進化を見ても、こうしたFYI的な情報はSBMで提供・共有するほうがメールよりも何倍も便利だと私も思っている。
他にこの１０箇条で注目したのはもう一つ。９のアイデア探索時の代替法としては“オープンスペース手法を使え”という説明。残念ながら私はこの“オープンスペース手法”をまだ具体的に経験した事がないのでとても興味をそそられる。
あとは１０個の場面には入っていないけれども、皆から意見調査をするときにはメールではなくアンケートツールを使ったほうがよいということと、スケジュール調整ならその専用ツールを使うことも勧められている。確かに最近だと日本でも「Mr.アンケート」といった簡単な意見収集サービスやスケジュールに特化した「ちょー助」といった無料サービスもあるからこういうのを使えば良いと言うことだろう。
こうしてみると私自身のメール発信スタンスにもまだまだ改善の余地がありそうだ。日々送られてくる何百通のメールの処理に閉口した、などとぼやく前にまず自分のメール発信スタンスから見直そう。
I had the nice opportunity to speak at the Pacific Free and Open Source Software Convention ( PFOSSCON 2007 ) in Honolulu , Hawai'i , last weekend .
This was done as part of my job at Vyatta .
While I managed to acquire a cold after coming home , earlier this week , the conference was great .
Kudos to Scott Belford , Jim Thompson , and Julian Yap for putting everything together .
Along with me speaking , the infamous Richard Stallman , Free Software Foundation , and Barton George , Sun Microsystems , spoke as well .
The summary is that after meeting Stallman , I was n't very impressed .
I have been reading his writings , such as the GNU Manifesto , since the mid-1980s .
I 'm not sure what I was expecting , but I did n't get it .
My reaction to both the man and the message fall into a few broad categories .
I think I 'll blog in more detail about these things in the future sometime , but here are the broad reactions :
Richard is not the best spokesman for the FSF .
Sure , he founded the organization .
And I was n't expecting him to wear a shirt and tie .
But to be honest , he 's just a shabby guy .
If you ever wonder why generally Free Software went nowhere inside corporate circles until Linux came along , this is one reason .
Just at a personal level , Linus is a better spokes - model than Richard .
He 's just as geeky , without looking shabby .
I react very negatively to Richard 's use of " GNU / Linux " versus " Linux . "
Richard 's contention is that all the userland for Linux came from GNU and thus Linux is really just the kernel while the whole OS should be called " GNU / Linux . "
Whether that is true or not , the fact is , Linus built his own operating system and he should have the right to name it .
If Free Software is truly as Free as Richard wants to claim it is , naming should be one of the things where the Freedom shows .
Put another way , I have no issue if the FSF and GNU want to put out their own Linux distribution and name it " GNU / Linux , " or even just " The GNU System , " that 's fine .
I have big problems with Richard trying to convince me that I should tack " GNU " onto the front of " Linux " for some reason .
I would worry that at any time Richard might claim that the use of GPL code might warrant changing the name of your application to " GNU / Foo . "
This is all the more annoying because Hurd still sucks and without Linux the overall goals of the original GNU project would still be unmet .
Simply , this whole naming thing is a big case of sour grapes that Linux has been successful and has eclipsed GNU in terms of relevancy .
of " Linux " for some reason .
I would worry that at any time Richard might claim that the use of GPL code might warrant changing the name of your application to " GNU / Foo . "
This is all the more annoying because Hurd sucks and without Linux the overall goals of the original GNU project would still be unmet .
Simply , this whole naming thing is a big case of sour grapes that Linux has been successful and has eclipsed GNU in terms of relevancy .
My other big takeaway from the conference is that I do n't agree with Richard on the fundamental philosophy of free software .
There , I said it .
HORRORS !.
And here I am at an open source company .
Sorry , while I like open source and believe there are certain advantages to it , I specifically reject Richard 's moral basis for Free Software .
Richard tries to portray access to source code and redistribution for no charge as abstract moral rights that every person should have , something akin to " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . "
Using proprietary software , Richard says , is to make an immoral choice .
I do n't buy it .
I like using Linux better than Windows for a variety of reasons , but I do n't believe the people at Microsoft are immoral because they choose to keep their source code to themselves ( I do think some of Microsoft 's monopoly business practices are immoral , but those are another matter ) .
In my opinion , this is why the FSF has been largely ineffectual in getting people to think about " Free Software " as opposed to " Open Source " ( a term which Richard rejects as missing the point ) .
Simply , I do n't think most of the developers or users of software see a philosophical , moral argument to made with respect to closed software .
Again , I think Linus here wins hands - down as the leader of a large software movement because he focuses on the real issue : the open - source development model allows users to have more control and harnesses the innovation of a larger number of creative developers .
Well , that 's all for now .
In spite of my disagreement with Richard , I bought a copy of Free Software , Free Society from him and had him autograph it .
— The Berks County Democratic Committee located in eastern Pennsylvania , a mostly rural county region north of Philadelphia , has passed a resolution calling on the Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
The resolution , which passed unanimously on Friday , April 20 , cites such offenses as lying the nation into war , conspiring to put the country at war , violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act by ordering the National Security Agency to spy on Americans without a warrant , ordering the torturing of prisoners , stripping Americans of their rights by holding them indefinitely without charge , denying them access to an attorney , and denying them habeas rights to go before a court , bringing the U.S. into international disrepute , imperiling the nation , and violating their trust and subverting the Constitution .
It concludes that Bush and Cheney , because of their conduct in office , warrant impeachment and trial , and removal from office .
The resolution calls on the Pennsylvania legislature to submit the above charges to the U.S. House of Representatives and also calls on the Congress to immediately proceed with impeachment of the president and vice president .

This is the string we want to match against .
Note that the target message area below the target pane says " Match from 0 to 0 " - this is because we have n't typed anything into the regex pane yet and the regular expression is thus the empty string which of course matches the empty string in front of the first a in axcayycabaxxb .

Who knew you could play Pac - Man against real crickets ?
Find that and the cockroach - controlled robot after the jump .
Which one is your favorite ?
Cricket - Controlled Pac Man
In this game , players “ can play Pacman against real crickets , ” which replace the standard “ ghosts ” .
The computer game we used for our experiment is “ Pac - Man ” ( Namco , 1980 ) .
Instead of computer code , we want to have animals controlling the ghosts .
To enable this , we built a real maze for the animals to walk around in , with its proportions and layout matching the maze of the computer game .
The position of the animals in the maze is detected using colour - tracking via a camera , and linked to the ghosts in the game
Cockroach Controlled Mobile Robot
Put simply , this “ Cockroach Controlled Mobile Robot ” is one of the strangest creations we ’ve seen .
Basically , a Madagascan hissing cockroach controls a three wheeled robot by being placed atop a modified trackball .
It was developed by Garnet Hertz , who specializes in “ animal - machine - hybrids ” .
This project was inspired by a number of different things , including thinking about biologically inspired ( “ biomimetic ” ) technologies and also seeing and thinking about scientific and artistic experiments in bio - hybrid / robotic systems

Mark Coker reports from Startup School at Stanford university where 600 people from around the world listened to some of Silicon Valley 's top entrepeneurs give out their best advice .
By Mark Coker for Silicon Valley Watcher
Palo Alto - Launch fast , keep it simple , update frequently .
That was the message hammered home this Saturday to 600 wide - eyed entrepreneurs packed into Stanford University ’s Kresge Auditorium for Startup School 2006 .
Attendees at the invitation - only event , who came from as far away as Europe , South America and Asia , were there to learn startup business advice from over a dozen tech industry movers and shakers .
The crowd , mostly men in their early twenties , sat in rapt attention as they heard war stories of tech business success and failure from men and women not much older than themselves .
The event was co-sponsored by seed venture firm Y Combinator and Stanford ’s BASES organization , and featured presentations covering fundamental topics such as funding , hiring , marketing , operations , and legal planning .
Joe Kraus : I 'm a startup addict
Joe Kraus , the former co-founder of the Excite search engine that sold for $ 6.7 billion in 1999 , kicked off the conference by confessing to the audience that he was a startup addict .
The crowd laughed , probably wishing the same affliction upon themselves .
Kraus proceeded to share stories about the early days of Excite and how his passion for startups led him in 2004 to do it again , this time with JotSpot , the wiki software collaboration company .
Throughout his speech , he called upon the aspiring entrepreneurs to remain persistent in the face of obstacles , hire only “ A ” players and accept minimal funding at first .
Kraus told the crowd that it was easier than ever to start a company because of low cost hardware and open source software .
He cautioned , however , that it ’s still difficult to build a successful company because lower financial barriers to entry mean more competition .
Mark Flecher : Creating the infrastructure
Kraus was followed by Mark Fletcher , another serial Internet entrepreneur , who doled out advice about how to create the Internet infrastructure necessary to support high traffic sites .
His first two startups , ONElist and Bloglines , both had fairy tale endings in the form of acquisitions from Yahoo and Ask Jeeves , respectively .
Ann Winblad : Software industry breakout
Next up was Ann Winblad , whose venture firm , Hummer Winblad has been a Silicon Valley institution since 1989 .
To this day , they continue to invest exclusively in software firms .
Winblad declared that the software industry was on the verge of a strong four year cycle of wealth creation , driven by exciting new software delivery models such as on - demand .
Tim O'Reilly : Watch the alpha geeks
Tim O’Reilly , founder and CEO of O’Reilly Media , encouraged entrepreneurs to keep their eyes on the “ alpha geeks , ” the early adopters whose interests in emerging operating systems , programming languages and scripting languages often presage seismic shifts in the industry .
The Perl language , he said , became hugely popular among alpha geeks in the mid-‘90s before the mainstream computer trade press had taken notice , even though it was being used to create a new generation of web applications which would later spawn what is know today as web services .
O’Reilly told attendees to focus their businesses in markets where there ’s the possibility for “ asymmetric competition . ”
He cited the Internet classifieds site Craigslist as an example , noting that in 1995 Craigslist had only 18 employees compared to other big media companies such as TimeWarner and Disney that had tens of thousands .
" Figure out which industry is ripe for disruption and take the costs out of that business , " he stated .
Paul Graham : Expose your ideas early
Creative destruction was a common theme of the event , where entrepreneurs were told to constantly revise the expectations of what their businesses should be , not to confuse products with business models , and let their users be their guides .
Paul Graham , a partner at Y Combinator , urged attendees to launch their Internet businesses early , even before all the development is complete .
“ If your idea is stupid , ” said Graham , “ it will be exposed early . ”
He also urged entrepreneurs to continually pump out new features designed to improve user experience .
Graham , known for his lyrical metaphors , declared , “ Users are a fickle wind .
If users pick you up , there ’s no competitor that can knock you down . ”
He also told the audience that in order to succeed with an Internet business , you must “ sing for your supper or die . ”
Caterina Fake : Less funding is good
Graham was followed by Caterina Fake , co-founder of , the photo sharing site acquired by Yahoo earlier this year .
Fake , building upon Graham ’s comments about quick deployments , said that it ’s important to make your mistakes quickly and learn from them .
Fake recommended testing usability by listening to users , but more importantly , observing how they interact with your site .
When asked if Yahoo was going to add videos to Flikr , Fake smiled and said , “ I would n’t exclude the possibility of there being video on Flikr some day . ”
Fake spoke about the early days of Flikr and how the company had no money for marketing or PR .
Yet she said that in retrospect , being under funded was a good thing because it forced them to build a product that was viral in nature , which in turn improved the overall user experience by encouraging stronger community .
In the early days of Flikr , the company generated 80 % of their new users from blogs .
Several speakers spoke of the need for software developers to strip out all but the most essential features when launching their businesses , and to do more by doing less and keeping it simple .
Om Malik : Do n't over - engineer products
Om Malik , a Business2.0 reporter and publisher of the popular GigaOm technology blog , entered the stage waving a stack of index cards in his hand .
Scribbled on the cards were his speaking notes .
He announced to applause that he would n’t be using PowerPoint and then challenged the attendees to create an application better than index cards , because index cards were portable , cheap and easy to use .
The primary theme of his presentation was that great businesses , products and applications force a positive behavior change among customers , often by making something much easier to use .
Many products today are severely over - engineered , he said .
Counseling entrepreneurs on their communications with the outside world , Malik urged them to keep their messages simple when trying to connect with users and the media .
He chastised the recent batch of Web2.0 startups because it ’s too difficult to discern what they do , and their appeal is not mainstream .
“ Silicon Valley is very insular , ” he said .
“ Many startups are looking to serve just geeks but what ’s cool is rarely profitable . ”
Chris Sacca :
Too many stale pitchess
Chris Sacca , Head of Special Initiatives at Google , lamented that most Internet business pitches he receives from among his 1,500 emails a day have gone stale .
“ Many Internet companies are starting to look the same , ” he said , scrolling down a list of hundreds of Web 2.0 sites as the image of a homely sheep ’s head emerged in the background his presentation .
He called upon developers to add “ interestingness ” to their applications , citing photo sharing site Flikr as and example of how to do it right .
Lawyers : Invest in legal infrastructure
Several of the startup veterans , as well as lawyers Page Mailliard and George Willman of Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati , urged entrepreneurs to invest the money necessary when they form their ventures to file the proper legal paperwork , such as “ C - Corp . ” articles of incorporation in Delaware , founders agreements and stock option agreements .
In answer to a question from the audience about the cost of legal representation , Mailliard responded that her firm often agrees to provide up to $ 20,000 in legal fees on spec until a startup secures its first round of funding .
Joshua Schachter : Be lazy
In a form consistent with his pioneering role of popularizing Internet tagging , Joshua Schachter , founder of community bookmarking site del.icio.us delivered the sparsest PowerPoint presentation of the day .
Each slide contained a single word , such as “ market , ” “ listen , ” “ design , ” and “ scale . ”
The final slide was labeled , “ lazy , ” for which he made the point that entrepreneurs should be lazy by avoiding low value transactions that consume your limited time , and focusing on what really matters for your business and ignoring what does n’t .
Smart mobs :
The audience reaction
During the breaks and lunch hour , attendees networked with a fervor , comparing notes of who had met whom , eager to find others willing to listen their project pitches , and mobbing Kraus , Fake , Graham , O’Reilly and Malik .
Bryan Wood , 20 , who had flown all the way from Dallas , Texas , stood outside the auditorium during breaks , passing out printed flyers advertising two of his four Internet properties .
One , which just launched , is LendMonkey.com , a peer - to - peer trading exchange for movies , games , music and books .
He asserts his service is far superior to better buzzed sites such at Lala.com and Peerflix , and he ’s looking for capital to expand his marketing to compete .
To support his fledgling businesses , he does contract programming on the side although his real dream is to devote full time to the businesses .
Earlier during the presentations , when Ann Winblad outlined the elements for a business plan , Wood murmured excitedly , “ This is the type of information I came to learn . ”
When Caterina
Fake recommended that it was important for news users of community sites to be greeted by an online host , Wood smiled again and said , “ I ’m going back to my hotel room tonight to build that - I ’m going to greet my users too . ”
Wood was not alone among Startup School 2006 attendees in his giddy exuberance , because for many attendees the emotions rivaled that of a religious revival .
These programmers , many of whom must pursue their entrepreneurial dreams at night while they hold down day jobs , came here from around the world , hungry to unlock the secrets to tech business success .
During the lunch break , Eduardo Flores Verduzco , a soft spoken software systems integrator at FusionMX Software in Mexico City , joined a table of strangers .
Verduzco , like most Startup School 2006 attendees , mixed effortlessly with other attendees , all of whom enjoyed sharing ideas as if conference were participating in one virtual message board .
Eduardo said he traveled to the event to learn more about the business ecosystem in Silicon Valley that allows technology ventures to sprout like vegetables in fertile soil .
In Mexico City , he says , they have the technology and the skilled labor to build technology applications , but they lack Silicon Valley ’s infrastructure of law firms , PR firms and venture capital that are the catalysts of new business formation .
Furthermore , he says , Mexican software developers lack the knowledge to protect their intellectual property , or to market their products on a global scale .
When asked who he wanted to meet , Verduzco smiled and answered , “ Paul Graham of Y Combinator . ”
One of those at the table pointed to a man sitting six feet behind Verduzco and said , “ there he is . ”
Verduzco quickly reached into his bag and pulled out what at first glance appeared to be a think business plan , although a second look revealed it was a large coffee table book of Mexican art - a gift for Graham and an advance token of appreciation for what Verduzco hoped to learn from him .
Audio archives of the conference will be available early this week at http://startupschool.org/.

Any website design pros care to chime in ?
Good professional web site .
Using a photo where the Senator is smirking for the main image of the candidate strikes me as a bad idea since it re-enforces some negatives .
Fourth overall in seeming to encourage supporter action / participation .
A bit of a disorganized mess .

Best campaign web site by far .
What is with the flags at the top pointing in all different directions ?
Do n't know which way you are going ?
Also what is with that candidate photo ?
It makes Giuliani look like a villain out of a comic book .
This site looks like something from 8 years ago in terms of design and content .
For " participation " it appears to just ask for money and allow you to sign up for his email list .
Worst overall in seeming to encourage supporter action / participation .
Eeek !
What is with the funeral colors ?
They seem kind of creepy .
Might work as black and white if white was the dominant color .
The site is a bit of a bandwidth / browser pig .
Other than those two issues the cleanest site other than Obama's .

Good professional site .
Good choice of images .

Google today issued a brief apology for using part of a software application developed by rival Sohu.com in a recently released Chinese software tool of its own .
" We want to face this problem directly and thus apologize to our users and Sohu , " Google said in a post on its Chinese - language blog .
Google 's apology did not offer an explanation for how part of Sohu 's software ended up inside the Google Pinyin Input Method Editor ( IME ) , except to say it was used to develop the program .
An earlier statement issued on Sunday acknowledged that " non-Google database resources " were used to develop the Pinyin IME but did not say how it obtained the database .
A Sohu representative could not immediately be reached for comment .
Competitors Raise Flag
Google 's problems began on April 4 when the company released its Pinyin IME , which lets users type Chinese by entering the Pinyin romanization equivalents for characters and words .
Shortly after the product 's release , Chinese Internet users and Sohu engineers noted striking similarities with Google 's tool and Sohu 's Sogou Pinyin IME .
Pinyin IMEs rely on a dictionary of Chinese words and names , matched with their Pinyin equivalents , to predict which characters a user needs .
In the case of Google 's IME , the first version of the software contained the names of Sohu engineers , who had put their names in the Sohu dictionary for personal convenience , prompting questions over how the names ended up in Google 's software .
Faced with these questions , Google released an updated version of the software on April 6 .
That update removed the engineers ' names , but did not remove errors inherited from the Sohu software .
In one such error , users had to type the wrong Pinyin to get the name of Feng Gong , a Chinese celebrity .
Legal Action Threatened
Sohu responded Friday with a demand that Google stop distributing the Pinyin IME based on its dictionary and asked for an apology from the U.S. Internet company .
Sohu also requested that Google discuss compensation for violating its copyright on the dictionary , and gave the company three days -- until today -- to reply , reserving the right to pursue legal action against Google .
At least two of those conditions have now been met , likely heading off the prospect of legal action .
In addition to the apology , Google issued a further update of its Pinyin IME on Sunday that uses a new dictionary .
Sohu confirmed the change on Monday , noting that the similarity between Google 's dictionary and its own dictionary had fallen from 96 percent to 79 percent .
" Kids can get past firewalls if they are really keen and the solution to get around the ban will be sent around very quickly on mobile phones or the internet , " she said .
Ms Treyvaud , a consultant to the Centre for Strategic Education , said cyber bullying was an increasing problem and " not just a teenage thing " , as , by grade three , most had a mobile phone , hotmail address or blog .
Secondary Schools Principals Association president Brian Burgess welcomed the move , but said reducing cyber bullying was not just a matter for schools ; parents had to work with schools to tackle the practice .
" If we thought that cyber bullying was going to stop just simply by banning YouTube , then we are living in fantasy land , " he said .
" If this was the only thing that was done then it would be a token gesture and it would be a waste of time . "
Experts suggest cyber bullying , which has taken over from playground bullying , accounts for almost 90 per cent of school abuse .
A Mission Australia National
Youth survey released last year revealed 30 per cent of respondents worried about bullying or emotional abuse .
Last year , a DVD of a 17 - year - old girl being bullied , assaulted and humiliated by a gang of 12 youths was widely viewed in segments on YouTube .
It showed youths urinating on the girl and setting her hair alight .
Ms Allan said schools had been told to update anti-bullying policies by year 's end .
She said schools had been blocking access to selected websites identified by the Education Department since October 2006 .
Filters tracked words and sequences .
McKinnon Secondary College blocked access to video - sharing websites last year .
Assistant principal Andrew Newton said , while he was not aware of cyber - bullying incidents at the school , the move was pre-emptive .
He said the school banned video - sharing sites such as MySpace and YouTube and live chat rooms .
" The kids were told at assembly , and there were a few groans but they do n't seem to mind too much now . "
At Melbourne Grammar School , headmaster Paul Sheahan said students had unrestricted access to websites , with the school advocating free speech .
" There is some good resource material on ( YouTube and MySpace ) and if we block access , the boarders can't get it , while day students can access it at home , so there is an issue of fairness , " Mr Sheahan said .
He said the school knew of the negative clips on some sites and tell parents in its newsletter .
" It wo n't be a heavy - handed ' do n't ' use the sites , " but parents would be reminded " not to assume that all is sweetness and light " .
One student asked about the ban said it would be useless —
" It will make it more popular .
If there 's a will , there 's a way . "
The student , who did n't want to be identified , said it was easy to access banned sites , with firewall tips available online .
Summary : Using a linear diagram to plot data from website traffic logs can lead you to overlook important conclusions .
Sometimes advanced visualizations are worth the effort .
Whenever I show double - logarithmic charts in my usability seminars , I see the audience members ' eyes glaze over .
People do n't like anything but the simplest data visualizations , and I 've certainly learned my lessons from the feedback sheets and scaled back on the amount of statistics I present .
Still , I can't help myself : there 's data underlying the usability guidelines , and I have to show some of it .
To understand traffic patterns found by Web analytics , for example , some of those hated advanced - visualization plots are sadly necessary .
Without them , you simply can't tell what 's going on .
As an example , consider the following linear graph of my log file analysis of how many visitors each page gets on a given website :
This linear graph shows what looks like the classic " long tail " distribution ( which is really Zipf 's Law ) .
And indeed , it almost is .
The difference between theory and practice becomes clear , however , when we plot the same data on logarithmic scales :
It 's now clear that we have a drooping tail : the site simply does n't have enough content to supply the predicted demand at the low end .
Without this fancy log - log plot , we would have never seen the site 's potential for increasing traffic by adding large amounts of low - volume content .
I 'm amazed at how often articles analyzing Web traffic or " long tail " - type businesses use linear plots that fail to show what 's really going on .
To compare high - volume and low - volume events in the same diagram , it 's typically best to use a logarithmic plot .
( If you 're using Excel to plot your charts , you can get logarithmic scales by simply double - clicking each axis , choosing the Scale tab in the resulting Format Axis dialog box , and checking the box for Logarithmic scale . )
In addition to the drooping tail , my original analysis also found a hump on the traffic plot for search queries -- a different phenomenon that also only shows up on a log - log chart .
Wag the Drooping Tail
So , what would happen if our sample site could wag its traffic tail up to the straight line representing the traffic potential the theory predicts ?
In my analysis , current traffic with 1,000 pages was 2.6 M pageviews over an 8 - week period .
With 260,000 pages , the site could expect traffic to increase to 4.8 M pageviews over the same period .
That is , the 259,000 new low - traffic pages would get 2.2 M pageviews , for an average of 9 views per page .
Now , if we extend the 8 - week period to a full year , the total traffic would almost double -- from 16.9 M to 32.2 M pageviews -- giving each new page an average of 58 views .
What 's the value of 58 pageviews ?
Over the last several years , Yahoo ! has made between 0.2 and 0.4 cents per non-search pageview .
However , I believe that Internet advertising is over - hyped and that advertisers are deluding themselves into overpaying .
In the long term , non-search advertising 's value will drop to 0.1 cents or less per page .
So , at the expected long - term value of 0.1 cents per view , 58 pageviews have a value of about 6 cents .
If we assume the new pages can attract traffic for five years , and then discount future cash flow by 10 % per year , the present value of each new page is 24 cents .
Not much .
But we 're expecting to add 259,000 pages , so the total value would be $ 62,000 .
It sounds like a nice sum -- but could the site create 259,000 new pages for $ 62 K ?
Obviously not , assuming the employees creating the pages earned salaries higher than that of the average ant .
The only feasible approach is that chosen by many sites these days : to con users into contributing content for free .
However , doing so requires that sites develop a system for user contributions , which ( if done correctly ) requires user testing and other quality assurance before being fielded .
Given that the system 's features are n't particularly advanced , our sample site could probably develop it for less than $ 62 K .
But it would n't be free .
( Update : Chris Anderson found a drooping tail for the popularity of movies .
The drooping tail shape may be more common than previously expected .
Maybe now people will go back and reanalyze their long tail statistics with the correct diagrams :-)
Analysis Outcome ?
It probably would n't pay for our sample site to take advantage of the opportunity that log analysis revealed .
The long tail 's end pays for aggregators who get their products from others , but companies who must develop their own are usually better served by staying away from the full tail .
That said , pursuing the tail 's end might be valuable if a site meets one of two conditions : it has a better way than low - value ads to monetize traffic , or it has so many users that the total income would be substantially more than the cost of developing the new functionality .
In any case , you should certainly run through such exploratory ROI scenarios for your own site .
To do so , you need correct data analysis and this typically requires more advanced visualizations than you see in most places .
It 's here that logarithmic plots deserve a chance -- despite their intimidating name .
( To avoid misunderstandings : you obviously should n't show log charts in websites targeted at a broad consumer audience .
They 're for internal use only -- or for websites like mine that target an intellectual audience . )
Karl Rove Associate and GOP Operative Tim Griffin's Appointment in Arkansas --- and Others Like it --- Are Worth Noting as the Scandal Continues to Unravel ...
Arlen Parsa Byon 3/26/2007 , 10:35 am PT
Guest Blogged by Arlen Parsa
Details continue to drip out from the U.S. Attorney Purge scandal which seem to suggest that electoral politics --- and perhaps the 2008 election in particular --- may well have been at the heart of the White House / Dept. of Justice scheme to strategically place partisan operatives where they might be most useful prior to the next Presidential Election .
One such detail revealed itself on Tuesday March 20th when Senator Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) appeared on MSNBC's Hardball to discuss the recent purge of several US Attorneys by the Bush Administration .
Host Chris Matthews opened the segment by asking Pryor how much he knew about the White House 's decision to replace the US Attorney in his state , Bud Cummins , with one of Karl Rove 's associates , a partisan operative named Tim Griffin .
Pryor criticized the Attorney General for firing Cummins and replacing him with Griffin , who had very little professional experience in Arkansas and had only recently moved there when Cummins was fired in December of 2006 .
Cummins , on the other hand , whom George W. Bush himself had appointed in 2001 , had been well respected , competent , and non-partisan ( despite personally being a Republican ) .
But the real bombshell came near the end of the interview ....
Cummins told Matthews before going on the air that he had heard a " conspiracy theory " about why the Administration had chosen to replace Cummins with Griffin , and Matthews asked him about it a short time later when they were live .
" Well , " Pryor said , slightly uncomfortable .
" There ’s kind of a conspiracy theory about that . "
" Some people have pointed to that , said is n’t that strange , here [ the Administration is ] putting in a maybe highly - political US Attorney in Hillary Clinton ’s backyard ...
Is n’t that odd right before the Presidential race ? "
Pryor explained .
The implication was that if Republicans had a partisan prosecutor in Arkansas where the Clintons lived while Bill had served as governor during the 1980s , he would be able to drudge up old political dirt on the couple in time for the 2008 elections .
Pryor was quick to add that he did n't personally subscribe to the theory , but that it was just speculation he had been hearing among political insiders .
But Griffin 's nomination was n't the only one with political and electoral undertones that might not bode well for Democrats in 2008 .
In fact , a report from the McClatchy Newspaper syndicate last Friday indicated that the Bush Administration has replaced US Attorneys in several key states , just in time for the 2008 Presidential election .
In April 2006 , Karl Rove gave a keynote address to the National Lawyers Association , a partisan legal group .
" He ticked off 11 states that he said could be pivotal in 2008 , " McClatchy recalled in their report .
" Bush has appointed new U.S. attorneys in nine of them since 2005 . "
Incidentally , during the same speech , Rove also acknowledged his friend , Thor Hearne , who had been both General Counsel to the Bush - Cheney 2004 election campaign and also Executive Director of the GOP front group " American Center for Voting Rights " or ACVR , which has engaged in voter suppression efforts via phony propagandistic reports on America 's non-existent " voter fraud " epidemic since 2004 .
( BRAD BLOG 's extensive coverage of ACVR can be found here .
The group 's website has suddenly disappeared since the U.S. Attorney Purge scandal has come to light . )
" I ran into Thor Hearne as I was coming in , " Rove told the audience .
" He was leaving ; he was smart , and he was leaving to go out and enjoy the day . "
" I want to thank you for your work on clean elections , " he continued .
" I know a lot of you spent time in the 2004 election , the 2002 election , the 2000 election in your communities or in strange counties in Florida , helping make it certain that we had the fair and legitimate outcome of the election , " Rove told the Republican attorneys .
He also compared elections in " some parts of the country " to those that take place in third - world dictatorships where the " guys in charge are , you know , colonels in mirrored sunglasses . "
Whether he was aware of the irony of his comments is still unknown .
In any event , three of the US Attorneys Bush has nominated since the 2004 election were , remarkably enough , from the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division , which has been criticized for implementing policies which unfairly disadvantage poor , often minority voters whose political tendencies historically favor Democrats .
And Griffin himself had allegedly been involved with voter suppression .
Griffin , as investigative journalist Greg Palast discovered in 2004 , was one of the RNC operatives that had thought up a complicated scheme to disenfranchise Americans who did not respond to letters sent to their home addresses .
Victims of the scheme whose votes were thrown away , Palast reported , included homeless people , and black soldiers serving overseas who obviously could not respond to mail , marked with " do not forward " instructions , delivered to their home addresses .
The scheme Griffin played a role in also reportedly targeted predominately African American areas in swing states such as Florida .
Griffin recently dismissed Palast 's reporting in a radio interview .
" I 'm intimately familiar with [ Palast 's ] allegations .
That is a web article on the Internet .
It 's patently false , " he pointed out , as if a " web article , " and " on the Internet " no less , might marginalize the facts of the report .
Yet Griffin may not have been so intimately familiar with the allegations from that " web article on the Internet " after all :
They were aired during a report by Palast , as filed on the television program " Newsnight " for the BBC .
( A video of the original report can be found on YouTube ) .
When Justice Department and White House officials first tried to explain the US Attorney firings , they claimed that several of the prosecutors who had been forced to resign had refused to follow up on allegations of " voter fraud . "
Some immediately recognized that " voter fraud " allegations have been the weapon of choice , of late , by Republicans attempting to make it more difficult for certain groups of Americans --- particularly those in minority areas whose voters do not typically lean GOP --- to vote , by pushing new regulations and disenfranchising Photo ID legislation as a " protective measure . "
The DoJ claims that the firings were " voter fraud " related raised some skepticism at BRAD BLOG and elsewhere , and even led to the New York Times editorial page to sharply criticize the supposed rationale for the firings .
It is perhaps ironic that the public explanation the Administration has given for firing the prosecutors --- specifically related to elections --- may ultimately draw more attention to what some suspect is a deeper scheme to set up a system of disenfranchisement just in time for the 2008 elections .
At least one Arkansas newspaper has called for Griffin 's resignation since the US Attorney scandal began , and he has said that he would only stay until the Administration found a suitable replacement .
The White House has privately worried that Griffin would not be able to pass muster in Senate confirmation hearings , which he would be required to undergo if he wanted to keep his current job .
The loophole in the PATRIOT Act which allowed Griffin and others to bypass the normal confirmation process was recently closed by the Senate in a vote of 94 - 2 .
The House is expected to pick up the matter soon .

As I have had way too much experience with working with horribly ugly and outdated database schemas , I find myself wanting to add new interfaces , but ca n’t just drop their old schema as other applications rely upon it .
Let ’s say that you have an old table that looks like this :
mysql > DESCRIBE client_comment ; +---------------------+--------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ |
Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+---------------------+--------+------+-----+---------+----------------+ | client_comment_id | int (8 ) | | PRI | NULL | auto_increment | | client_comment_body | text | YES | | NULL | | +---------------------+--------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
2 rows in set ( 0.00 sec )
In this example , I took the privilege of making the example only two fields , now imagine that this table has over 20 - 30 fields and they all have client_comment_ in front of the actual string that is of important .
Who wants to type all that out over and over ?
Also , we all refer to this table as the table that holds customer notes , which does n’t really match what they originally named it .
No , we ca n’t just renmae the table , stuff relies on this structure .
But for a new Rails interface , we ’re going to tweak our model quickly to interact with the same outdated table in a cleaner fashion .
The first obvious thing is that we need to create a model called customer_note.rb .
class CustomerNote < ActiveRecord :: Base end
id
class CustomerNote < ActiveRecord :: Base set_primary_key " client_comment_id " def self.table_name ( ) " client_comment " end end
customer_notes
$ ./script / console Loading development environment . >> CustomerNote.create(:client_comment_body => " hello world " ) =>
#< CustomerNote:0xb7a02cfc @new_record=false , @attributes={" client_comment_body " =>" hello world " , " client_comment_id " =>39} , @errors= #< ActiveRecord : : Errors:0xb79a4508 @base=#<CustomerNote:0xb7a02cfc ...> , @errors={} >>
Next , we ’ll tell the model that it ’s table name is client_comment , rather than customer_notes like it is going to expect it to be .
While we are at it , let ’s take a quick moment to define the primary key for this table , becauseis not what they picked when they first made the table .
With this , we can already start interacting with our table as if it were called
Okay , now we want to interact with the field client_comment_body as just body .
We want to be able to get and set this value , so we ’ll add the following methods to our model .
def body read_attribute " client_comment_body " end def body =( value ) write_attribute " client_comment_body " , value end
The first method allows you to access ( get ) the value of client_comment_body with CustomerNote. find ( 1 ) .body .
The second method handles when you ( set ) the value for body , it then provides the client_comment_body attribute with the value .
Technoweenie on IRC helped me get this trimmed down from my original version .
In the end , you have this :
class CustomerNote < ActiveRecord :: Base set_primary_key " client_comment_id " def self.table_name ( ) " client_comment " end def body read_attribute " client_comment_body " end def body =( value ) write_attribute " client_comment_body " , value end end
Then , you can do save yourself some typing by accessing the field with the alias that you provided . :-)
$ ./script / console Loading development environment . >> a = CustomerNote.new ( : body => " Hello World ! " ) =>
#< CustomerNote:0xb78c6ffc @new_record=true , @attributes={" client_comment_body " =>" Hello World ! " } > >> a.save => true >> a => #< CustomerNote:0xb78c6ffc @new_record=false , @attributes={" client_comment_body " =>" Hello World ! " , " client_comment_id " => 40} , @errors= #< ActiveRecord : : Errors:0xb7890d6 c @base=#<CustomerNote:0xb78c6ffc ...> , @errors={} >> >> b = CustomerNote.find ( 40 ) =>
#< CustomerNote:0xb788ccd0 @attributes={" client_comment_body " =>" Hello World ! " , " client_comment_id " = >" 40 " } > >> b.body = " Goodbye... cruel ... world . " =>
" Goodbye... cruel ... world . " >> b.save => true >> CustomerNote.find ( 40 ) =>
#< CustomerNote:0xb7886330 @attributes={" client_comment_body " =>" Goodbye... cruel ... world . " , " client_comment_id " = >" 40 " } > >> CustomerNote.find(40 ) .body => " Goodbye... cruel ... world . " >>
Feel free to send me tips if there is an even better way of doing this . :-)
Cheers … and enjoy !
WASHINGTON , Jan. 4 , 2007  -- North Korea appears to have made preparations for another nuclear test , according to U.S. defense officials .
" We think they 've put everything in place to conduct a test without any notice or warning , " a senior U.S. defense official told ABC News .
The official cautions that the intelligence is inconclusive as to whether North Korea will actually go ahead with another test but said the preparations are similar to the steps taken by Pyongyang before it shocked the world by conducting its first nuclear test last Oct.
9 .
Two other senior defense officials confirmed that recent intelligence suggested that the North Koreans appear to be ready to test a nuclear weapon again , but the intelligence community divides over whether another test is likely .
" That would surprise me , " a senior intelligence official said when asked if North Korea is likely to soon conduct another test .
Another official had a different view , predicting North Korea would conduct a test sometime over the next two or three months .
In the weeks before the Oct. 9 test , U.S. spy satellites witnessed the unloading of large cables at a suspected test site in P'onggye , in northeastern North Korea .
The more recent activity has been observed in the same area as the Oct. 9 test .
In October , the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that imposed harsh sanctions against North Korea just six days after Kim Jong Il 's regime declared that it conducted an underground nuclear test .
The sanctions were designed to coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear program .
Resolution 1718 specifically called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons completely and irreversibly , as well as to put an end to its biological and chemical weapons , weapons of mass destruction , and ballistic missile programs .
The United States and Japan had pushed for stronger sanctions but eventually watered down the resolution to appease China and Russia , which feared that tougher sanctions might only make the situation worse .
The U.N. sanctions further mandated an embargo on major military hardware such as tanks , warships , combat aircraft and missiles to North Korea .
To appease the Russian and Chinese delegations , however , the United States dropped its opposition to an all - out ban on conventional weapons .
The resolution also ruled out the possibility of military intervention -- a point critical to Russia and China , whose opposition to the initial drafts delayed the vote .
China , in particular , objected to a provision that would have allowed for the search of all cargo ships headed out of North Korea .
The Chinese delegation maintained that intrusive searches could provoke further conflict in the region .
In response to these sanctions , North Korean Premier Yon Hyong Muk told the Security Council that the country needed nuclear weapons to protect itself from the danger of war with the United States , and that the Bush administration has responded to North Korea 's " patient and sincere " efforts with sanctions and blockades .
He said North Korea saw continued pressure from the United States as a declaration of war .
North Korean Gen. Ri Chan Bok told ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer that " the U.S. wants us to kneel down before them .
We can not agree with them .
If this tension continues war can not be avoided . "
In response , White House press secretary Tony Snow made it clear that it is not uncommon for the North Koreans to use strong rhetoric .
" On the other hand , let me make clear to the people of North Korea and the entire world , not only do we not want North Korea to ' kneel down , ' what we 're trying to do is offer them a better deal -- better economy , more security , better relations with their neighbors , integration into the global community as opposed to isolation , " Snow said .
They better check that thermostat down in hell , because , believe it or not , AmigaOS4 has found a computer to run on – a computer which we will actually be able to buy .
I kid you not .
“ After months of designs and negotiations Amiga , Inc. and ACK Software Controls , Inc. are pleased to announce that new hardware is on its way for Amiga users .
Initially , two systems will be produced that address two different market needs .
The first is a consumer entry design that will offer a complete product with a target price point of USD 500 , while the second will be of a power design that would have a target price point of USD 1500 .
The PowerPC architecture will continue to be the architecture of choice for these new systems .
Manufacturing and final price information along with product launch schedules will be following in the next week . ”
Sure they can fly .
A full superconducting experimental Tokamak fusion device , which aims to generate infinite , clean nuclear - fusion - based energy , will be built in March or April in Hefei , capital city of east China 's Anhui Province .
Experiments with the advanced new device will start in July or August .
If the experiments prove successful , China will become the first country in the world to build a full superconducting experimental Tokamak fusion device , nicknamed " artificial sun " , experts here said .
The project , dubbed EAST ( experimental advanced superconducting Tokamak ) , is being undertaken by the Hefei - based Institute of Plasma Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
It will require a total investment of nearly 300 million yuan ( 37 million U.S. dollars ) , only one fifteenth to one twentieth the cost of similar devices being developed in the other parts of the world .
The new device will be an upgrade of China 's first superconducting Tokamak device , dubbed HT - 7 , which was also built by the plasma physics institute , in partnership with Russia , in the early 1990s .
HT - 7 made China the fourth country in the world , after Russia , France and Japan , to have such a device .
" The EAST project research results will be significant for the International Thermonuclear Experiment Reactor , or ITER , in terms of basic research both in engineering technology and physics , " said Wan Yuanxi , who is in charge of the project .
Wan said ITER will also be a full superconducting experimental Tokamak fusion device with an advanced configuration , but much larger than EAST .
The program , still in its initial stages , involves Russia , Japan , the United States , the European Union , China and the Republic of Korea .
Controlled nuclear fusion is seen as an efficient way for people to generate infinite , clean energy to offset the dearth of fossil fuels such as oil and coal .
Scientists believe that deuterium can be extracted from the sea and an enormous amount of energy can be obtained from a deuterium - tritium fusion reaction under huge temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius .
After nuclear fusion , the deuterium extracted from one liter of sea water will produce energy equivalent to 300 liters of gasoline .
If a device is developed that can withstand temperatures as high as 100 million Celsius degrees and control a deuterium - tritium reaction , it will be as though an " artificial sun " had been created able to supply infinite , clean energy for human beings .

One - on - one with Angelina Jolie When Angelina Jolie came into the room , just four days after returning from Namibia , she was alone .
No handlers , no entourage .
True , elaborate precautions had been made to make sure no photographers followed her to the hotel where we met , but there she was , by herself , walking into the hotel suite , smiling , ready to talk .
There are a lot of ridiculous stories circling on the Internet , spread by alleged " insiders " who claim that CNN or its parent company Time Warner somehow paid for the chance to talk to Angelina .
These anonymous " sources " claim that People Magazine and CNN had some kind of joint deal to secure rights to photos and the interview .
I have no idea what People Magazine did or did not pay for those photos of the Jolie - Pitt family .
It 's been reported they paid as much as $ 4 million , which was donated to a variety of charities in Africa , but I have no way of knowing if that is true or not .
What I do know is that CNN did not pay anything -- directly or indirectly -- to get Angelina Jolie to sit down for an interview .
So why did she do it ?
And why talk to me ?
Both are valid questions .
I 'm sure there were plenty of news programs requesting interviews with Angelina Jolie .
The truth is , mine was n't one of them .
They called us .
I was told that they were aware of my interest in Africa and knew that as a broadcast we have devoted a lot of time to reporting stories from the continent .
Tuesday is World Refugee Day .
Angelina Jolie was interested in discussing the plight of refugees , so we sat down to talk about what she has seen and learned in refugee camps around the world .
She had no movie to promote , no product she was pitching .
In fact , I have no idea what her next movie is and we did not discuss any upcoming films .
There were no ground rules .
I was free to ask whatever I wanted .
A lot of celebrities have causes and show up to talk about them when cameras are around , but the truth is that Angelina Jolie knows what she is talking about when the subject is refugees .
To use a cliche , she does n't just talk the talk , she walks the walk .
She has traveled to some 20 countries over the years as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , and she says she donates one - third of her income to charitable causes .
I 'm not sure what I expected before I met her , but to say I was impressed would be an understatement .
She is smart , funny , self - deprecating , and intensely passionate about her children and her work on behalf of refugees .
Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET , you will hear Angelina Jolie talk about some of the experiences in refugee camps that have changed her life .
Yes , you will also learn about Angelina 's family -- Maddox and Zahara as well as Shiloh Nouvel -- but the focus of the interview is the plight of refugees .
During the two - hour program , we will take you to the frontlines of some of the worst humanitarian crises in the world .
It 's going to be an interesting broadcast , and I hope you watch .

When the Yankees fly , the pilots are not only in the cockpit .
There is another pilot in the main cabin , where the players sit .
He is probably studying his hand - held Global Positioning System receiver , tracking the weather and noting the plane ’s precise speed and altitude .
He is Cory Lidle , who has been a major league pitcher for nine years and a pilot for seven months .
He earned his pilot ’s license last off - season and bought a four - seat airplane for $ 187,000 .
It is a Cirrus SR20 , built in 2002 , with fewer than 400 hours in the air .
A player - pilot is still a sensitive topic for the Yankees , whose captain , Thurman Munson , was killed in the crash of a plane he was flying in 1979 .
Lidle , acquired from the Philadelphia Phillies on July 30 , said his plane was safe .
“ The whole plane has a parachute on it , ” Lidle said .
“ Ninety - nine percent of pilots that go up never have engine failure , and the 1 percent that do usually land it .
But if you ’re up in the air and something goes wrong , you pull that parachute , and the whole plane goes down slowly . ”
The other day I was standing in line at Starbucks , and the girl in front of me was on top of her shit .
She had the shoes I 've been wanting , the purse I 've been wanting , and a phone that I coveted .
Her hair had been perfectly ironed that morning and her leggings / tunic combo had been artfully selected to reflect the current trend du jour .
She ordered her latte in a bored tone that made it clear she 'd ordered that drink a million times before .
And then she turned to her mom for some money to pay .
Because she was 12 .
This is surely not the first you 've heard of this phenomenon ; anecdotal evidence abounds , and it was in the spotlight even more than usual today due to the Monday release of the American Psychological Association 's Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls and the subsequent trend pieces in the major papers .
Reading the Washington Post 's take , " Goodbye to Girlhood , " cemented two thoughts that I 've been mulling over for the past few months .
1 . Thank GOD for grunge .
If I had gone through middle school during anything like the current cultural moment , I would have had a nervous breakdown tryng to keep up with the level of sexuality involved in being a preteen right now .
Fortunately , though , it seems like mid-90s society was basically scientifically engineered to camoflage my awkwardness .
When I was in middle school ( 1995 - 1997 ) , the reigning trend in both music and fashion was grunge .
As a result of lyrics like " I 'm a loser baby , so why do n't you kill me , " our parents may have worried about our self - esteem , but they certainly did not worry about us getting pregnant .
Angst poetry and self - loathing do not exactly breed hypersexuality .
Middle School Lauren had a much better shot at fitting in than she ever could have had today .
First , there were the clothes .
My body type at 13 could best be described as " not applicable . "
Although I suppose the flatness of my chest would have made it much easier for people to read " Your boyfriend thinks I 'm hot " off of it , that would have only really served to expedite complete strangers ' ability to laugh at the irony of mywearing such a tee .
Fortunately for me , though , the formula for a great outfit in 1996 comprised some very forgiving elements ( see graphic ) .
Do I need to explain why baggy jeans do a lot more for the walking 180 - degree angle that serves as the body of most preteens than tight tank tops and low cut jeans ever will ?
Did n't think so .
The grunge mentality also saved me on the dance floor .
Whereas the partcular body movements that currently qualify as " dancing " require coordination , confidence , and large amounts of bumping and grinding , when I was in middle school dancing was simple : it amounted to standing in a crowd and jumping up and down .
I could handle that .
Bear in mind that I 'm not saying that I was able to master even the simple trends of the mid-90s ; no , I was still frightfully awkward .
But by God , at least I had a chance to try and keep up .
At least I could comprehend what it was that separated me from the cooler kids .
These days it would just be pointless .
2. Dear sweet Lord , do n't give me no daughters .
In my limited experience as an ' adult , ' I have found that the single most effective way to actually make me feel old is to present me with a preteen or teenaged child .
Seeing how much more advanced these young women are than I was at their age is intimidating , depressing , and confusing .
But here 's the thing : it 's only been a decade .
By the time I have kids , things will probably have progressed to the point where female babies are just taken from the delivery room straight onto the set of a rap video to be raised there .
Or something .
My limited , un -hip mind is incapable of even envisioning it .
I 'm just hoping for boys .
One of the reasons why I love Dilbert so much is because Scott Adams really feels the pulse of the typical IT organization .
How many times have you seen the above situation ?
In one project , the whole world ( including me , and I was not even a part of the project ) knew that the project was burning , except the people who really needed to know — the managers and stakeholders — had no clue as to the real state of the project .
Why does this happen ?
Most manager - developer problems in a software company are caused by one thing : trust , or rather , a lack of trust .
Managers do not trust the developers to do any work .
They believe that the developers have to be pushed , otherwise nothing will get done .
Developers in turn do not trust the management to cover their back .
They believe that the managers will screw them when things go wrong .
As a result , instead of working together as one team , they become two teams , each defending their turf from outside attack .
Once that happens the project is as good as dead .
Communication across the border will virtually stop .
Back to the above cartoon : Dilbert is comfortable telling Wally the real situation of the project because he knows
Wally will support him .
After all they are in the same ' team ' .
When he tells the PHB that the project is fine , he does n't really mean that its fine .
He knows if he brings up any issue , the PHB will blame the team .
What he is really communicating is " I do n't want to talk to you .
I 'll say fine so that you go away quickly .
"
If you are a manager , be sure that you cultivate trust with the development team .
What better way to do that then to show that you are on their side .
When the team asks for more RAM for their computers , do you get it or do you say that its out of budget ?
When the team says that the schedule is too short , do you tell that to the customer and try to find a solution or do you ask the team to work weekends ?
This is one reason why I like agile processes and the Scrummaster role in particular .
Scrum tries hard to make the Scrummaster fit in with the team , to support the team , to enable the team to perform .
In exchange , when things go wrong , the team is often more open in bringing up issues because they are all one team , working together in the same direction .
They know that the Scrummaster will help in solving the problem rather than blaming the team .

Police said Hasib Hussain was shown carrying a rucksack
Scotland Yard urged anyone who had seen Hasib Hussain last Thursday to call the anti-terrorist hotline on 0800 789 321 .
Hussain , 18 , and from Leeds , was seen on CCTV in Luton , carrying a rucksack , before he boarded a train to London .
Detectives urged the public to help them trace his movements before the bomb went off in Tavistock Square .
Police said on Thursday that a man injured in that blast , which happened at 0947 BST , had now died in hospital , taking the death toll from all four bombings to 54 .
Police say three of the four bombers thought to have died in the attacks are included in this figure .
A two - minute silence was earlier held in tribute to all those killed and injured in the blasts at 1200 BST .
An evening vigil was also been held in Trafalgar Square , central London .
Police have been searching properties in Aylesbury , Bucks , and Leeds .
A controlled explosion has been carried out and residents moved in the Beeston area of Leeds , where one of the bombers used to live .
This will take many months of intensive , detailed investigation
Peter Clarke
Anti-terrorist branch
Police briefing
Head of the anti-terrorist Branch Peter Clarke said : " We need to establish [ Hussain 's ] movements up until 0947 BST , when the explosion occurred in Tavistock Square , " he said .
" The question I am asking the public is : ' Did you see this man at King 's Cross , was he alone or with others ?
" Do you know the route he took from the station , did you see him get onto a number 30 bus , and if you did - when and where was that ? "
Police think there were about 80 people on the bus when the explosion happened and Mr Clarke called for any passengers who had not contacted the police to do so .
He told a police conference in London the police investigation had uncovered a " vast amount of information " , with new leads emerging " literally by the hour " .
He said detectives had taken 500 witness statements and had seized - and were analysing - more than 5,000 CCTV tapes .
" We need to establish a number of things :
Who actually committed the act , who supported them , who financed them , who trained them , who encouraged them ?
" This will take many months of intensive , detailed investigation . "
He said forensic investigations at the scenes of the attacks were continuing , while properties were being searched in West Yorkshire and in Aylesbury .

Bomb suspects : Key facts
Security sources have told the BBC that the Aylesbury search is connected with trying to identify the bombers .
In particular , detectives are trying to establish if the fourth bomber had either lived or stayed there .
Police sources have indicated he was Jamaican - born Germaine Lindsay , who lived in Buckinghamshire .
Aylesbury is 20 miles from Luton , where the four bombers boarded a train which took them to London .
Police are also trying to find the source of explosives found on Tuesday in a raid on a property in Leeds and in a car parked at Luton Central railway station .
A second car found at Luton is also being examined .
Mr Clarke also confirmed the identity of the second bomber , Shehzad Tanweer , 22 , who died in the explosion at Aldgate .
He said property belonging to the third man who travelled from West Yorkshire was found at the scenes of the Aldgate and Edgware Road attacks .
But he said there was not yet forensic evidence that he died in the blasts .
The man has been named as Mohammad Sidique Khan , 30 , from Beeston in Leeds .
However , Mr Clarke said forensic evidence did indicate that the fourth bomber , Germaine Lindsay , had died in the Russell Square blast .
Police are also hunting a fifth man who they believe masterminded the attacks .
It is believed he left Britain shortly before the bombings .
A sixth man , an Egyptian chemistry student who has disappeared from his house in Leeds , is also being sought .

Tax Facts
Just in time for tax - filing season , the Tax Foundation and Congress ' Joint Committee on Taxation have compiled some useful facts about the federal tax system .
Following are a few worth thinking about as taxpayers write their annual checks to Uncle Sam .
-- In 2005 , the federal government took $ 2.4 trillion out of the pockets of the American people .
To put this number into context , it is about the same as the size of the entire U.S. economy in 1959 in inflation - adjusted terms .
Only two other countries on earth have economies as large as our federal government : Germany and Japan -- and Germany just barely makes the cut , with a gross domestic product of $ 2.7 trillion .
China , which everyone is so alarmed about , has an economy significantly smaller than the federal government , with a GDP of $ 1.9 trillion -- about equal to what the United States raises just from taxes on individuals .
-- Contrary to popular belief , the vast bulk of federal taxes are paid by the wealthy .
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation , in 2006 , 53.7 percent of all federal income taxes were paid by those with incomes over $ 200,000 .
Those with incomes between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 paid 28.3 percent of all individual income taxes .
Thus those with incomes over $ 100,000 paid 82 percent of the total .
They also paid 44.4 percent of all payroll taxes .
-- Those with incomes below $ 40,000 paid no federal income taxes at all in the aggregate .
The positive liability for those who paid anything was more than offset by tax rebates from the Earned Income Tax Credit for many more who paid nothing .
In total , the EITC put $ 41 billion into the pockets of low - income workers in 2005 , 91 percent of it being paid to those with no income tax liability .
However , according to the Tax Foundation , three - fifths of Americans believe that it is wrong for anyone to pay no taxes at all , that everyone should pay something to finance the government .
-- So -called tax loopholes -- deductions and exclusions that reduce one 's tax liability -- are mainly used by the middle class , not the wealthy .
The largest tax expenditures are the exclusions for pension contributions and health benefits for workers .
Among the largest deductions are those for mortgage interest and state and local taxes .
In 2005 , taxpayers saved $ 62 billion in taxes due to the mortgage interest deduction , with 72 percent of that going to those with incomes below $ 200,000 .
The child credit saved taxpayers $ 46 billion -- almost all of it claimed by the middle class .
Just $ 8 million went to those with incomes over $ 200,000 .
-- Not surprisingly , three - fifths of taxpayers believe their taxes are too high .
Only 2 percent think they are too low .
About a third of taxpayers would support a reduction in government services in order to achieve further tax cuts .
Just 8 percent favor bigger government financed with higher taxes .
-- Support for fundamental tax reform is high .
Four - fifths of taxpayers believe that the tax system is too complex .
Just 3 percent believe the tax system is fine the way it is .
By better than a two - to - one margin , taxpayers would be willing to give up major tax deductions , such as that for mortgage interest or state and local taxes , in order to get lower income tax rates .
-- Almost all taxpayers think that the top federal income tax rate of 35 percent is too high .
More than 90 percent of taxpayers believe that the top rate should be no higher than 29 percent , with 70 percent saying that 19 percent should be the maximum .
-- The Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) is a rapidly growing federal tax .
Originally designed to tax only the rich , increasingly it is a tax on the middle class .
In 2005 , the AMT affected only 1.3 percent of those with incomes between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 .
Unless Congress acts , this will rise to 42.8 percent this year and over 50 percent next year .
This illustrates the problem with all soak - the - rich tax proposals -- eventually , they end up taxing the middle class , too .
For years , Republicans have largely ignored the problem of the AMT -- enacting temporary patches to the tax cut to keep the problem from getting worse , but not even attempting to offer a permanent fix .
The latest patch expired at the end of last year , which is why there is such a sharp rise projected in the percentage of taxpayers affected by the AMT .
Consequently , Democrats really have a gun to their heads -- they must do something on the AMT by the end of the year .
But because they have pledged to pay for all tax cuts , they must raise taxes somehow to pay for an AMT fix .
Republicans are n't likely to offer much help in that area , making tax policy in 2007 an interesting spectator sport .

Culture War Surrender
In the Republican race , former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , who recently made clear his intentions to seek the presidency , has expanded his lead over Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Giuliani holds a 2 to 1 advantage over McCain among Republicans , according to the poll , more than tripling his margin of a month ago .
The principal reason was a shift among white evangelical Protestants , who now clearly favor Giuliani over McCain .
“ It would be one thing if Giuliani could say , ‘ I ’m a strong social conservative in my private life ’ , but he ca n’t even say that , ” said Ramesh Ponnuru , a conservative commentator and author of The Party of Death , an attack on social liberalism .
“ It ’s not just the fact of his multiple marriages , it is the way the Hanover marriage melted down .
It was operatic . ”
When Giuliani met Hanover on a blind date in the early 1980s , his first marriage to Regina , his second cousin , was already over .
Hanover , who went on to appear in the television series Ally McBeal , was a glamorous soulmate who seemed to enjoy the spotlight as much as he did .
They had two children , Andrew , 21 , and Caroline , 17 , but in 1996 Hanover stopped calling herself by his last name and a year later Vanity Fair magazine said that he was having an “ intimate relationship ” with a senior member of his staff .
In 2000 , without telling Hanover first , Giuliani announced at a press conference that he was separating from her .
She retaliated by accusing him of being unfaithful with the employee , but he was already with Nathan .
Maggie Gallagher , a family values campaigner , was outraged by Giuliani ’s “ scummy ” performance , accusing him of making Bill Clinton “ look good as a husband and father ” .
New Yorkers learnt during the divorce case that their cancer - afflicted mayor was temporarily impotent and Hanover demanded a huge settlement , including £ 760 a month to care for Goalie , the family ’s golden retriever .
Felder struck back , accusing Hanover of being an “ uncaring mother ” who was “ howling like a stuck pig ” .
In the end Giuliani , who was beginning to earn big consultancy fees after September 11 , agreed to a settlement of $ 6.8 m to avoid the full horror of a court case .
Hanover has married Ed Oster , her university sweetheart , and written a book , My Boyfriend ’s Back , about rekindling an old romance .
Even if she stays mum , there is enough in the public domain to rattle conservatives .
Yet however vicious the personal attacks on Giuliani , they are unlikely to dent his reputation for competence .
He did , after all , handle the September 11 attacks while bunking with gay friends in the midst of an affair and a divorce battle .
The brain 's reward for getting a concept is a shot of natural opiates
Neuroscientists have proposed a simple explanation for the pleasure of grasping a new concept :
The brain is getting its fix .
The " click " of comprehension triggers a biochemical cascade that rewards the brain with a shot of natural opium - like substances , said Irving Biederman of the University of Southern California .
He presents his theory in an invited article in the latest issue of American Scientist .
" While you 're trying to understand a difficult theorem , it 's not fun , " said Biederman , professor of neuroscience in the USC College of Letters , Arts and Sciences .
" But once you get it , you just feel fabulous . "
The brain 's craving for a fix motivates humans to maximize the rate at which they absorb knowledge , he said .
" I think we 're exquisitely tuned to this as if we 're junkies , second by second . "
Biederman hypothesized that knowledge addiction has strong evolutionary value because mate selection correlates closely with perceived intelligence .
Only more pressing material needs , such as hunger , can suspend the quest for knowledge , he added .
The same mechanism is involved in the aesthetic experience , Biederman said , providing a neurological explanation for the pleasure we derive from art .
" This account may provide a plausible and very simple mechanism for aesthetic and perceptual and cognitive curiosity . "
Biederman 's theory was inspired by a widely ignored 25 - year - old finding that mu-opioid receptors - binding sites for natural opiates - increase in density along the ventral visual pathway , a part of the brain involved in image recognition and processing .
The receptors are tightly packed in the areas of the pathway linked to comprehension and interpretation of images , but sparse in areas where visual stimuli first hit the cortex .
Biederman 's theory holds that the greater the neural activity in the areas rich in opioid receptors , the greater the pleasure .
In a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging trials with human volunteers exposed to a wide variety of images , Biederman 's research group found that strongly preferred images prompted the greatest fMRI activity in more complex areas of the ventral visual pathway .
( The data from the studies are being submitted for publication . )
Biederman also found that repeated viewing of an attractive image lessened both the rating of pleasure and the activity in the opioid - rich areas .
In his article , he explains this familiar experience with a neural - network model termed " competitive learning . "
In competitive learning ( also known as " Neural Darwinism " ) , the first presentation of an image activates many neurons , some strongly and a greater number only weakly .
With repetition of the image , the connections to the strongly activated neurons grow in strength .
But the strongly activated neurons inhibit their weakly activated neighbors , causing a net reduction in activity .
This reduction in activity , Biederman 's research shows , parallels the decline in the pleasure felt during repeated viewing .
" One advantage of competitive learning is that the inhibited neurons are now free to code for other stimulus patterns , " Biederman writes .
This preference for novel concepts also has evolutionary value , he added .
" The system is essentially designed to maximize the rate at which you acquire new but interpretable [ understandable ] information .
Once you have acquired the information , you best spend your time learning something else .
" There 's this incredible selectivity that we show in real time .
Without thinking about it , we pick out experiences that are richly interpretable but novel . "
The theory , while currently tested only in the visual system , likely applies to other senses , Biederman said .

The picture was very nearly deleted from the camera
Enlarge Image
Goran Ehlme 's shot of a walrus feeding on clams on the sea floor is a whirl of grey ; the animal 's face is seen poking through a cloud of disturbed sediment .
He caught the magic moment on a digital camera and deleted many unwanted shots .
" My finger was poised to delete this one too , and then I noticed something special , " he told the BBC News website .
The competition has become one of the most prestigious in world photography .
It is organised by BBC Wildlife Magazine and London 's Natural History Museum .
This year brought more than 18,000 entries from 55 countries .
BEAST IN THE SEDIMENT
Goran is a highly experienced natural history filmmaker .
His work has featured in the BBC's Blue Planet and Planet Earth series , and on National Geographic TV .
The Swede has spent almost a decade getting to know the behaviour of the walrus and how to get close to the mammal without being attacked .
You get a real sense that you 're seeing something you 've never seen before .
Epic
Andy Mclane , competition judge
" It was while the walrus had gone to the surface for air .
Underwater , with a mask on , with a housing around the camera , it was really hard to see the little screen ; but I suddenly thought ' wow ! , there 's his head in the cloud ' .
" It looked really great . "
The judges certainly thought the image was very powerful .
" It 's got everything , the feel of the picture is interesting , your attention goes straight to the eye .
A very simple graphic image showing interesting behaviour , " said chairman of the judges , Mark Carwardine .
Judge Andy Mclane added : " You get a real sense that you 're seeing something you 've never seen before .
Epic .
You could spend years trying to get this shot . "
THE DILEMMA
This year 's prize for Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year has been won by 17 - year - old Rick Stanley from the US .
On this occasion , the frog did not become a meal
Enlarge Image
" I photographed the drama as the frog dangled in front of me , but [ my friend ]
Rubio was unable to resist helping the victim and gently touched the snake , which promptly dropped its meal and slithered away along the branches . "
The frog , seemingly unaffected by the snake 's mild venom , hopped off .
Rick has called the picture The Dilemma because the incident left him wondering whether it would have been morally better to let the snake have its meal - and if it would have succeeded in swallowing such a large frog had it been left to try .
FLAMINGO DANCE
A picture that is sure to grab a lot of attention this year is Todd Gustafson 's photo of flamingos at Lake Nakuru , Kenya .
It can be seen on publicity posters for the competition 's exhibition at London 's Natural History Museum .
Pink and puffed up
Enlarge Image
This " stand " of male birds is pictured at the edge of the courtship dance floor , their puffed up postures ready to impress the females .
" It totally captures that moment , and totally captures what those birds are all about , " Todd told the BBC .
" These guys are just amazing .
The best thing for me is the angle of view .
I 'm not looking down on them ; I 'm lying on the lake bed , looking straight at them ; so behind them is all pink . "
Todd 's image was a runner - up in the Animal Behaviour : Birds section .
STILL LIFE AND BEAR
Igor Shpilenok 's shot of a bear peeking through a window wins the Urban and Garden Wildlife section .
The picture was taken at Igor 's cabin on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East .
Receiving no response , he got up and pushed the door open with his foot .
When the door bumped against something , Igor stuck his head through to apologise .
It was n't a person but a bear , which had prised open the outside door and was having a good nose around .
" It looked up at me in a seemingly friendly manner , but nevertheless , I quickly closed the door , " said Igor .
He grabbed his camera to take this one and only picture .
A lemon left to ripen on the sill adds a nice twist to this still life .
COCONUT CRAB GOING UP
You have to have the right tools to crack open a coconut , and this fella certainly has them .
The frame is everything
Enlarge Image
It also has extremely strong pincers .
Jan Vermeer 's picture was taken on Aldabra , in the Indian Ocean .
" The composition works well in this picture , " Jan said .
" As the crab walked up , I saw the other trees on both sides .
I put the animal in the middle , and that way you put him in his behaviour ; you are able to tell a story . "
The image was the winner in the Animals in Their Environment section .
An exhibition of the best images from this year 's competition opens to visitors of the Natural History Museum on Saturday 21 October 2006 and runs until 29 April 2007 .
It will then tour across the UK and five continents after its London debut .

Ladies and gentlemen , I really have to ask you to seriously consider what you 've heard , and now this is the end of the evening so to speak .
I heard a prize fight manager say to his fellow who was losing badly , “ David , listen to me .
It 's not what 's he 's doing to you .
It 's what you 're not doing .
( laughter ) .
Ladies and gentlemen , these people set , they opened the doors , they gave us the right , and today , ladies and gentlemen , in our cities and public schools we have fifty percent drop out .
In our own neighborhood , we have men in prison .
No longer is a person embarrassed because they 're pregnant without a husband .
( clapping )
No longer is a boy considered an embarrassment if he tries to run away from being the father of the unmarried child ( clapping ) .
Ladies and gentlemen , the lower economic and lower middle economic people are [ not * ] holding their end in this deal .
In the neighborhood that most of us grew up in , parenting is not going on .
( clapping )
In the old days , you could n't hooky school because every drawn shade was an eye ( laughing ) .
And before your mother got off the bus and to the house , she knew exactly where you had gone , who had gone into the house , and where you got on whatever you had one and where you got it from .
Parents do n't know that today .
I 'm talking about these people who cry when their son is standing there in an orange suit .
Where were you when he was two ?
( clapping )
Where were you when he was twelve ?
( clapping )
Where were you when he was eighteen , and how come you do n't know he had a pistol ?
( clapping )
And where is his father , and why do n't you know where he is ?
And why does n't the father show up to talk to this boy ?
The church is only open on Sunday .
And you can't keep asking Jesus to ask doing things for you ( clapping ) .
You can't keep asking that God will find a way .
God is tired of you ( clapping and laughing ) .
God was there when they won all those cases .
50 in a row .
That 's where God was because these people were doing something .
And God said , “ I 'm going to find a way . ” I was n't there when God said it ...
I 'm making this up ( laughter ) .
But it sounds like what God would do ( laughter ) .
We can not blame white people .
White people ( clapping ) .. white people do n't live over there .
They close up the shop early .
The Korean ones still do n't know us as well ... they stay open 24 hours ( laughter ) .
I 'm looking and I see a man named Kenneth Clark .
He and his wife Mamie ... Kenneth 's still alive .
I have to apologize to him for these people because Kenneth said it straight .
He said you have to strengthen yourselves ... and we 've got to have that black doll .
And everybody said it .
Julian Bond said it .
Dick Gregory said it .
All these lawyers said it .
And you would n't know that anybody had done a damned thing .
50 percent drop out rate , I 'm telling you , and people in jail , and women having children by five , six different men .
Under what excuse , I want somebody to love me , and as soon as you have it , you forget to parent .
Grandmother , mother , and great grandmother in the same room , raising children , and the child knows nothing about love or respect of any one of the three of them ( clapping ) .
All this child knows is “ gimme , gimme , gimme . ”
These people want to buy the friendship of a child .... and the child could n't care less .
Those of us sitting out here who have gone on to some college or whatever we 've done , we still fear our parents ( clapping and laughter ) .
And these people are not parenting .
They 're buying things for the kid .
$ 500 sneakers , for what ?
They wo n't buy or spend $ 250 on Hooked on Phonics .
( clapping ) A\Kenneth Clark , somewhere in his home in upstate New York ... just looking ahead .
Thank God , he does n't know what 's going on , thank God .
But these people , the ones up here in the balcony fought so hard .
Looking at the incarcerated , these are not political criminals .
These are people going around stealing Coca Cola .
People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake !
Then we all run out and are outraged , “ The cops should n't have shot him ”
What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand ?
( laughter and clapping ) .
I wanted a piece of pound cake just as bad as anybody else ( laughter )
And I looked at it and I had no money .
And something called parenting said if get caught with it you 're going to embarrass your mother .
Not you 're going to get your butt kicked .
No .
You 're going to embarrass your mother .
You 're going to embarrass your family .
If knock that girl up , you 're going to have to run away because it 's going to be too embarrassing for your family .
In the old days , a girl getting pregnant had to go down South , and then her mother would go down to get her .
But the mother had the baby .
I said the mother had the baby .
The girl did n't have a baby .
The mother had the baby in two weeks .
( laughter )
We are not parenting .
Ladies and gentlemen , listen to these people , they are showing you what 's wrong .
People putting their clothes on backwards .
â is n't that a sign of something going on wrong ?
( laughter )
Are you not paying attention , people with their hat on backwards , pants down around the crack .
Is n't that a sign of something , or are you waiting for Jesus to pull his pants up ( laughter and clapping ) .
Is n't it a sign of something when she 's got her dress all the way up to the crack ... and got all kinds of needles and things going through her body .
What part of Africa did this come from ?
( laughter ) .
We are not Africans .
Those people are not Africans , they do n't know a damned thing about Africa .
With names like Shaniqua , Shaligua , Mohammed and all that crap and all of them are in jail .
( When we give these kinds names to our children , we give them the strength and inspiration in the meaning of those names .
What 's the point of giving them strong names if there is not parenting and values backing it up ) .
Brown Versus the Board of Education is no longer the white person 's problem .
We 've got to take the neighborhood back ( clapping ) .
We 've got to go in there .
Just forget telling your child to go to the Peace Corps .
It 's right around the corner .
( laughter )
It 's standing on the corner .
It ca n't speak English .
It does n't want to speak English .
I can't even talk the way these people talk .
“ Why you ain't where you is go , ra , ” I do n't know who these people are .
And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk ( laughter ) .
Then I heard the father talk .
This is all in the house .
You used to talk a certain way on the corner and you got into the house and switched to English .
Everybody knows it 's important to speak English except these knuckleheads .
You can't land a plane with “ why you ai n 't ... ”
You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth .
There is no Bible that has that kind of language .
Where did these people get the idea that they 're moving ahead on this .
Well , they know they 're not , they 're just hanging out in the same place , five or six generations sitting in the projects when you 're just supposed to stay there long enough to get a job and move out .
Now look , I 'm telling you .
It 's not what they 're doing to us .
It 's what we 're not doing .
50 percent drop out .
Look , we 're raising our own ingrown immigrants .
These people are fighting hard to be ignorant .
There 's no English being spoken , and they 're walking and they 're angry .
Oh God , they 're angry and they have pistols and they shoot and they do stupid things .
And after they kill somebody , they do n't have a plan .
Just murder somebody .
Boom .
Over what ?
A pizza ?
And then run to the poor cousin 's house .
They sit there and the cousin says “ what are you doing here ? ” “ I just killed somebody , man . ” “ What ? ” “ I just killed somebody , I 've got to stay here . ”
“ No , you do n't . ” “ Well , give me some money , I 'll go ... ” “ Where are you going ? ” “ North Carolina . ” Everybody wanted to go to North Carolina .
But the police know where you 're going because your cousin has a record .
Five or six different children , same woman , eight , ten different husbands or whatever , pretty soon you 're going to have to have DNA cards so you can tell who you 're making love to .
You do n't who this is .
It might be your grandmother .
( laughter ) I 'm telling you , they 're young enough .
Hey , you have a baby when you 're twelve .
Your baby turns thirteen and has a baby , how old are you ?
Huh ?
Grandmother .
By the time you 're twelve , you could have sex with your grandmother , you keep those numbers coming .
I 'm just predicting .
I 'm saying Brown Vs. Board of Education .
We 've got to hit the streets , ladies and gentlemen .
I 'm winding up , now , no more applause .
I 'm saying , look at the Black Muslims .
There are Black Muslims standing on the street corners and they say so forth and so on , and we 'rere laughing at them because they have bean pies and all that , but you do n't read “ Black Muslim gunned down while chastising drug dealer . ”
You do n't read that .
They do n't shoot down Black Muslims .
You understand me .
Muslims tell you to get out of the neighborhood .
When you want to clear your neighborhood out , first thing you do is go get the Black Muslims , bean pies and all ( laughter ) .
And your neighborhood is then clear .
The police can't do it .
I 'm telling you Christians , what 's wrong with you ?
Why can't you hit the streets ?
Why can't you clean it out yourselves ?
It 's our time now , ladies and gentlemen .
It is our time ( clapping ) .
And I 've got good news for you .
It 's not about money .
It 's about you doing something ordinarily that we doâ get in somebody else 's business .
It 's time for you to not accept the language that these people are speaking , which will take them nowhere .
What the hell good is Brown V. Board of Education if nobody wants it ?
What is it with young girls getting after some girl who wants to still remain a virgin .
Who are these sick black people and where did they come from and why have n't they been parented to shut up ?
To go up to girls and try to get a club where “ you are nobody .. , ” this is a sickness ladies and gentlemen and we are not paying attention to these children .
These are children .
They do n't know anything .
They do n't have anything .
They 're homeless people .
All they know how to do is beg .
And you give it to them , trying to win their friendship .
And what are they good for ?
And then they stand there in an orange suit and you drop to your knees , “ ( crying sound )
He did n't do anything , he did n't do anything . ”
Yes , he did do it .
And you need to have an orange suit on too ( laughter , clapping ) .
So , ladies and gentlemen , I want to thank you for the award ( big laughter ) and giving me an opportunity to speak because , I mean , this is the future , and all of these people who lined up and done .. they 've got to be wondering what the hell happened .
Brown V. Board of Education , these people who marched and were hit in the face with rocks and punched in the face to get an education and we got these knuckleheads walking around who do n't want to learn English ( clapping ) I know that you all know it .
I just want to get you as angry that you ought to be .
When you walk around the neighborhood and you see this stuff , that stuff 's not funny .
These people are not funny anymore .
And that 's not brother .
And that 's not my sister .
They 're faking and they 're dragging me way down because the state , the city and all these people have to pick up the tab on them because they do n't want to accept that they have to study to get an education .
We have to begin to build in the neighborhood , have restaurants , have cleaners , have pharmacies , have real estate , have medical buildings instead of trying to rob them all .
And so , ladies and gentlemen , please , Dorothy Height , where ever she 's sitting , she did n't do all that stuff so that she could hear somebody say “ I can't stand algebra , I can't stand ... and “ what you is . ”
It 's horrible .
Basketball players , multimillionaires can't write a paragraph .
Football players , multimillionaires , can't read .
Yes .
Multimillionaires .
Well , Brown V Board of Education , where are we today ?
It 's there .
They paved the way .
What did we do with it .
The white man , he 's laughing , got to be laughing .
50 percent drop out , rest of them in prison .
You got to tell me that if there was parenting , help me , if there was parenting , he would n't have picked up the Coca Cola bottle and walked out with it to get shot in the back of the head .
He would n't have .
Not if he loved his parents .
And not if they were parenting !
Not if the father would come home .
Not if the boy had n't dropped the sperm cell inside of the girl and the girl had said , “ No , you have to come back here and be the father of this child . ”
Not ..
“ I do n't have to . ”
Therefore , you have the pile up of these sweet beautiful things born by nature raised by no one .
Give them presents .
You 're raising pimps .
That 's what a pimp is .
A pimp will act nasty to you so you have to go out and get them something .
And then you bring it back and maybe he or she hugs you .
And that 's why pimp is so famous .
They 've got a drink called the “ Pimp - something . ”
You all wonder what that 's about , do n't you ?
Well , you 're probably going to let Jesus figure it out for you ( laughter ) .
Well , I 've got something to tell you about Jesus .
When you go to the church , look at the stained glass things of Jesus .
Look at them .
Is Jesus smiling ?
Not in one picture .
So , tell your friends .
Let 's try to do something .
Let 's try to make Jesus smile .
Let 's start parenting .
Thank you , thank you ( clapping , cheers )

As I wrote last week , malfunctioning voting machines are one of the two plausible theories that could explain the mysterious undervotes in Sarasota ’s congressional race .
To get a better idea of whether malfunctions could be the culprit , we would have to investigate – to inspect the machines and their software for any relevant errors in design or operation .
A well - functioning electoral system ought to be able to do such investigations in an open and thorough manner .
Two attempts have been made to investigate .
The first was by representatives of Christine Jennings ( the officially losing candidate ) and a group of voters , who filed lawsuits challenging the election results and asked , as part of the suits ’ discovery process , for access by their experts to the machines and their code .
The judge denied their request , in a curious order that seemed to imply that they would first have to prove that there was probably a malfunction before they could be granted access to the evidence needed to tell whether there was a malfunction .
The second attempt was by the Department of State ( DOS ) of the state of Florida , who commissioned a study by outside experts .
Oddly , I am listed in the official Statement of Work ( SOW ) as a principal investigator on the study team , even though I am not a member of the team .
Many people have asked how this happened .
The short answer is that I discussed with representatives of DOS the possibility of participating , but eventually it became clear that the study they wanted to commission was far from the complete , independent study I had initially thought they wanted .
The biggest limitation on the study is that DOS is withholding information and resources needed for a complete study .
Most notably , they are not providing access to voting machines .
You do n’t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that if you want to understand the behavior of voting machines , it helps to have a voting machine to examine .
DOS could have provided or facilitated access to a machine , but it apparently chose not to do so .
[ Correction ( Feb. 28 ) :
The team ’s final report revealed that DOS had changed its mind and given the team access to voting machines . ]
The Statement of Work is clear that the study is to be “ a … static software analysis on the iVotronics version 8.0.1.2 firmware source code ” .
( In computer science , “ static ” analysis of software refers to methods that examine the text of the software ; “ dynamic ” methods observe and measure the software while it is running . )
The good news is that the team doing the study is very strong technically , so there is some hope of a useful result despite the limited scope of the inquiry .
There have been some accusations of political bias against team members , but knowing several members of the team I am confident that these charges are misguided and the team wo n’t be swayed by partisan politics .
The limits on the study are n’t coming from the team itself .
The results of the DOS - sponsored study should be published sometime in the next few months .
What we have not seen , and probably wo n’t , is a full , independent study of the iVotronic machines .
The voters of Sarasota County – and everyone who votes on paperless machines – are entitled to a comprehensive study of what happened .
Sadly , it looks like lawyers and politics will stop that from happening .
Poor old Mark .

Infinite lists in Perl
© Copyright 1997 The Perl Journal .
Reprinted with permission .
Many of the objects we deal with in programming are at least conceptually infinite --- the input from the Associated Press newswire , for example , or the log output from a web server , or the digits of pi .
There 's a general principle in programming that you should model things as simply and as straightforwardly as possible , so that if an object is infinite , you should model it as being infinite , with an infinite data structure .
Of course , you can't have an infinite data structure , can you ?
After all , the computer only has a finite amount of memory .
But that does n't matter .
We 're all mortal , and so we , and our programs , would n't really know an infinite data structure if we saw one .
All that 's really necessary is to have a data structure that behaves as if it were infinite .
A Unix pipe is a great example of such an object --- think of a pipe that happens to be connected to the standard output of the yes program .
From the man page :
yes prints the command line arguments , separated by spaces and followed by a newline , forever until it is killed .
The output of yes might not be infinite , but it 's a credible imitation .
So is the output of tail -f / var / log / syslog .
In this article I 'll demonstrate a Perl data structure , the Stream , that behaves as if it were infinite .
You can keep pulling data out of this data structure , and it might never run out .
Streams can be filtered , just like Unix data streams can be filtered with grep , and they can be transformed and merged , just like Unix streams .
Programming with streams is a lot like programming with pipelines in the shell --- you can construct a simple stream , then transform and filter it to get the stream you really want .
This means that if you 're used to programming with pipelines , programming with streams can feel very familiar .
As an example of a problem that 's easy to solve with streams , we 'll look at :
Hamming wants an efficient algorithm that generates the list , in ascending order , of all numbers of the form 2i3 j5 k for i , j , k at least 0 .
This list is called the Hamming sequence .
The list begins like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 ...
Just for concreteness , let 's say we want the first three thousand of these .
This problem was popularized by Edsger Dijkstra .
There 's an obvious brute force technique :
Take the first number you have n't checked yet , divide it by 2's , 3's and 5's until you can't do that any more , and if you 're left with 1 , then the number should go on the list ; otherwise throw it away and try the next number .
So :
Is 19 on the list ?
No , because it 's not divisible by 2 , 3 , or 5 .
Is 20 on the list ?
Yes , because after we divide it by 2 , 2 , and 5 , we 're left with 1 .
Is 21 on the list ?
No , because after we divide it by 3 , we 're left with 7 , which is n't divisible by 2 , 3 , or 5 .
This obvious technique has one problem : it 's unbelievably slow .
The problem is that most numbers are n't on the list , and you waste an immense amount of time discovering that .
Although the numbers at the beginning of the list are pretty close together , the 2,999th number in the list is 278,628,139,008 .
Even if you had enough time to wait for the brute - force algorithm to check all the numbers up to 278,628,139,008 , think how much longer you 'd have to wait for it to finally find the 3,000 number in the sequence , which is 278,942,752,080 .
It can be surprisingly difficult to solve this problem efficiently with conventional programming techniques .
But it turns out to be easy with the techniques in this article .
A stream is like the stream that comes out of a garden hose , except that instead of water coming out , data items come out , one after the other .
The stream is like a source for data .
Whenever you need another data item , you can pull one out of the stream , which will keep producing data on demand forever , or until it runs out .
The key point is that unlike an array , which has all the data items stored away somewhere , the stream computes the data just as they 're needed , at the moment your program asks for them , so that it never takes any more space or time than necessary .
You can't have an array of all the odd integers , because it would have to be infinitely long and consume an infinite amount of memory .
But you can have a stream of all the odd integers , and pull as many odd integers out of it as you need , because it only computes the odd numbers one at a time as you ask for them .
We 'll return to Hamming 's problem a little later , when we 've seen streams in more detail .
Now , unlike a Perl list , a stream is more like a linked list , which means that it is made of nodes .
Each node has two parts :
The head , which contains a data item at the front of the stream , and the tail , which points to the next node in the stream .
In Perl , we 'll implement this as a hash with two members .
If $ node is such a hash , then $ node{h} will be the head , and $ node{t} will be the tail .
The tail will usually be a reference to another such node .
A stream will be a long linked list of these nodes , like this :
The stream ( ' foo ' , 3 , ' bar ' , ... ) .
Now we still have the problem of how to have an infinite stream , because clearly we can't construct an infinite number of these nodes .
But here 's the secret : a stream node might not have a tail --- the tail might not have been computed yet .
If a stream does n't have a tail , it has a promise instead .
The promise is a promise from the program to you .
The program promises to compute the next node if you ever need the data item that would be in the head of the next node :
How can we program a promise ?
Perl does n't have promises , right ?
But it has something like them .
Here 's how to make a promise to compute an expression :
$ promise = sub { EXPRESSION } ;
Perl does n't compute the value of the expression right away ; instead it constructs an anonymous function which will compute the expression and return the value when we call the function :
$ value = &$promise ; # Evaluate EXPRESSION
That 's just what we want .
When we want to promise to compute something without computing it , we 'll just wrap it up in an anonymous function , and then when we want to collect on the promise , we 'll call the function .
How can we tell when a value is a promise ?
In our simple examples , we 'll just look to see if it's a reference to a function :
if ( ref $ something eq CODE ) { #
It 's a promise ... }
In a real project , we might do something a little more elaborate , like inventing a Promise package with Promise objects , but in this article , we 'll just stick with plain vanilla CODE refs .
Here 's a simple function to construct a stream node .
It expects two arguments , a head and a tail .
The tail argument should either be another stream , or it should be a promise to compute one .
It then takes the head and the tail , puts them into an anonymous hash with h and t members , and blesses the hash into the Stream package :
package Stream ; sub new { my ( $ package , $ head , $ tail ) = @_ ; bless { h => $ head , t => $ tail } => $ package ; }
The head method to return the head of a stream is easy to implement now .
We just return the h member from the hash :
sub head { $ _ [ 0 ] {h} }
The tail method for returning the tail of a stream is a little more complicated because it has to deal with two possibilities :
If the tail of the stream is another stream , tail can return it right away .
But if the tail is a promise , then the tail function must collect on the promise and compute the real tail before it can return it .
sub tail { my $ tail = $ _ [ 0 ] {t} ; if ( ref $ tail eq CODE ) { #
It 's a promise $ _[ 0 ] {t} = &$tail ( ) ; # Collect on the promise } $ _ [ 0 ] {t} ; }
We should also have a notation for an empty stream , or for a stream that has run out of data , just in case we want finite streams as well as infinite ones .
If a stream is empty , we 'll represent it with a node that is missing the usual h and t members , and which instead has an e member , to show that it 's empty .
Here 's a function to construct an empty stream :
sub empty { my $ pack = ref( shift ( ) ) || Stream ; bless {e => ' I am empty .'} => $ pack ; }
And here 's a function that tells you whether a stream is empty or not :
sub is_empty { exists $ _ [ 0 ] {e} }
These functions , and all the other functions in this article , are available in http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/Stream/Stream.pm.
Let 's see an example of how to use this .
Here is a function that constructs an interesting stream :
You give it a reference to a function , $f , and a number , $n , and it constructs the stream of all numbers of the form f( n ) , f( n+1 ) , f( n+2 ) , ...
sub tabulate { my $f = shift ; my $n = shift ; Stream -> new ( &$ f ( $n ) , sub { &tabulate ( $f , $ n+1 ) } ) }
How does it work ?
The first element of the stream is just f( n ) , which in Perl notation is & $f ( $n ) .
Rather than computing all the rest of the elements of the table ( there are an infinite number of them , after all ) this function promises to compute more if we want them .
The promise is the
sub { &tabulate ( $f , $ n+1 ) }
part ; it 's a function , which , if invoked , will call tabulate again , to compute all the values from $ n+1 on up .
Of course , it wo n't really compute all the values from $ n+1 on up ; it 'll just compute f( n+1 ) , and give back a promise to compute f( n+2 ) and the rest if they 're needed .
Now we can do an example :
sub square { $ _ [ 0 ] * $ [ 0 ] } $ squares = & tabulate ( \&square , 1 ) ;
The show utility , supplied in Stream.pm , prints out the first few elements of a stream --- the first ten , if you do n't say otherwise :
$ squares -> show ; 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100
Let 's add a little debugging to tabulate so we can see better what 's going on .
This version of tabulate is the same as the one above , except that it prints an extra line of output just before it calls the function f :
sub tabulate { my $f = shift ; my $n = shift ; print STDERR " -- Computing f( $n )
" ; # For debugging Stream -> new ( &$ f ( $n ) , sub { &tabulate ( $f , $ n+1 ) } ) } $ squares = &tabulate ( \&square , 1 ) ; -- Computing f( 1 ) $ squares -> show ( 5 ) ; 1 -- Computing f( 2 ) 4 -- Computing f(3 ) 9 -- Computing f(4 ) 16 -- Computing f(5 ) 25 -- Computing f( 6 ) $ squares -> show ( 6 ) ; 1 4 9 16 25 36 -- Computing f( 7 ) $ squares -> show ( 5 ) ; 1 4 9 16 25
Something interesting happened when we did show ( 6 ) up there --- the stream object only called the tabulate function once , to compute the square of 7 .
The other 6 elements had already been computed and saved , so it did n't need to compute them again .
Similarly , the second time we did show ( 5 ) , the program did n't need to call tabulate at all ; it had already computed and saved the first five squares and it just printed them out .
Saving computed function values in this way is called memoization .
Someday , we could come along and do
$ squares -> show ( 1_000_000_000 ) ;
and the stream would compute 999,999,993 squares for us , but until we ask for them , it wo n't , and that saves space and time .
That 's called lazy evaluation .
To solve Hamming 's problem , we need only one more tool , called merge .
merge is a function which takes two streams of numbers in ascending order and merges them together into one stream of numbers in ascending order , eliminating duplicates .
For example , merging
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 ...
1 4 9 16 25 36 ...
1 3 4 5 7 9 11 13 15 16 17 19 ...
sub merge { my $ s1 = shift ; my $ s2 = shift ; return $ s2 if $ s1 -> is_empty ; return $ s1 if $ s2 -> is_empty ; my $ h1 = $ s1 - > head ; my $ h2 = $ s2 -> head ; if ( $ h1 > $ h2 ) { Stream -> new ( $ h2 , sub { & merge ( $ s1 , $ s2 - > tail ) } ) ; } elsif ( $h1 < $ h2 ) { Stream -> new ( $ h1 , sub { & merge ( $ s1 - > tail , $ s2 ) } ) ; } else { # heads are equal Stream - > new ( $ h1 , sub { & merge ( $ s1 - > tail , $ s2 - > tail ) } ) ; } }
Now we have enough tools to solve Hamming 's problem !
Here 's how we 'll do it .
We 're going to construct a stream which has the numbers we want in it .
How can we do that ?
We know that the first element of the Hamming sequence is 1 .
That 's easy .
The rest of the sequence is made up of multiples of 2 , multiples of 3 , and multiples of 5 .
Let 's think about the multiples of 2 for a minute .
Here 's the Hamming sequence , with multiples of 2 in red :
1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 ...
Now here 's the Hamming sequence again , with every element multiplied by 2 :
2 4 6 8 10 12 16 18 20 24 30 32 36 ...
Notice how the second row of numbers contains all of the red numbers from the first row --- If a number is even , and it 's a Hamming number , then it's two times some other Hamming number .
That means that if we had the Hamming sequence hanging around , we could multiply every number in it by 2 , and that would give us all the even Hamming numbers .
We could do the same thing with 3 and 5 instead of 2 .
By multiplying the Hamming sequence by 2 , by 3 , and by 5 , and merging those three sequences together , we'd get a sequence that contained all the Hamming numbers that were multiples of 2 , 3 , and 5 .
That 's all of them , except for 1 , which we could just tack on the front .
This is how we 'll solve our problem .
Let 's build a function that takes a stream and multiplies every element in it by a constant :
# Multiply every number in a stream `$ self ' by a constant factor ` $n ' sub scale { my $ self = shift ; my $n = shift ; return &empty if $ self -> is_empty ; Stream -> new ( $ self - > head * $n , sub { $ self -> tail -> scale ( $n ) } ) ; }
Here 's the solution to the Hamming sequence problem :
We use scale to scale the Hamming sequence by 2 , by 3 , and by 5 , we merge those three streams together , and we tack a 1 on the front , and the result is the Hamming sequence :
# Construct the stream of Hamming 's numbers .
sub hamming { 1 my $ href = \ 1 ; # Dummy reference 2 my $ hamming = Stream -> new ( 3 1 , 4 sub { & merge ( $ $ href - > scale ( 2 ) , 5 &merge ( $ $ href - > scale ( 3 ) , 6 $ $ href - > scale ( 5 ) ) ) } ) ; 7 $ href = \$hamming ; # Reference is no longer a dummy 8 $ hamming ; }
Line 1 creates a reference to the scalar 1 .
We 're not interested in this 1 , but we need a reference variable around to use to refer to $ hamming so that we can include it in the calls to merge .
After we 've defined the anonymous subroutine ( lines 4 - - 6 ) which uses $ href , we pull a switcheroo and make $ href refer to $ hamming ( line 7 ) instead of to the irrelevant 1 value .
This function works , and it's efficient :
&hamming ( )-> show ( 20 ) ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 15 16 18 20 24 25 30 32 36 40
It only takes a few minutes to compute three thousand Hamming numbers , even on my dinky P75 computer .
We could make this more efficient by fixing up merge to merge three streams instead of two , but that 's left as an exercise for Our Most Assiduous Reader .
The great thing about streams is that you can treat them as sources of data , and you can compute with these sources by merging and filtering data streams ; these is called a data flow paradigm .
If you 're a Unix programmer , you 're probably already familiar with the data flow paradigm , because programming with pipelines in the shell is the same thing .
Here 's an example of a function , filter , that accepts one stream as an argument , filters out all the elements from it that we do n't want , and returns a stream of the elements we do want --- it does for streams what the Unix grep program does for pipes , or what the Perl grep function does for lists .
filter s second argument is a predicate function that returns true or false depending on whether it 's applied to an argument we do or do n't want :
# Return a stream on only the interesting elements of $arg .
sub filter { my $ stream = shift ; # Second argument is a predicate function that returns true # only when passed an interesting element of $ stream .
my $ predicate = shift ; # Look for next interesting element while (!
$ stream -> is_empty && ! &$ predicate ( $ stream -> head ) ) { $ stream = $ stream -> tail ; } # If we ran out of stream , return the empty stream .
return &empty if $ stream -> is_empty ; # Construct new stream with the interesting element at its head # and the rest of the stream , appropriately filtered , # at its tail .
Stream -> new ( $ stream -> head , sub { $ stream -> tail -> filter ( $ predicate ) } ) ; }
Let 's find perfect squares that are multiples of 5 :
sub is_multiple_of_5 { $ _ [ 0 ] % 5 == 0 } $ squares ->filter (\&is_multiple_of_5 ) -> show ( 6 ) ; 25 100 225 400 625 900
You could do all sorts of clever things with this :
If $ input were a stream whose elements were the lines of input to your program , you could construct $ input -> filter ( sub { $ _ [ 0 ] =~ / PATTERN/} ) , the stream of input lines that matched a certain pattern .
were a stream whose elements were the lines of input to your program , you could construct the stream of input lines that matched a certain pattern .
If $queens were a stream that produced arrangements of eight queens on a chessboard , you could build a filter that checked each arrangement to see if any queens attacked one another , and then you 'd have a stream of solutions to the famous eight - queens problem .
If you wanted only one solution , you could ask for -> show ( 1 ) , and your program would stop as soon as it had found a single solution ; if you wanted all the solutions , you could ask for -> show ( ALL ) .
Here 's a particularly clever application :
We can use filtering to compute a stream of prime numbers :
sub prime_filter { my $s = shift ; my $h = $s -> head ; Stream -> new ( $h , sub { $s -> tail -> filter ( sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % $ h } ) -> prime_filter ( ) } ) ; }
To use this , you apply it to the stream of integers starting at 2 :
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
The first thing it does is to pull the 2 off the front and returns that , but it also filters the tail of the stream and throws away all the elements that are divisible by 2 .
Then , it gets the next available element , that 's 3 , and returns that , and filters the rest of the stream ( which was already missing the even numbers ) to throw away the elements that are divisible by 3 .
Then it pulls the next element off the front , that 's 5 ... and so on .
If we 're going to have fun with this , we need to start it off with that stream of numbers that begins at 2 :
$ iota2 = &tabulate ( sub { $ _ [ 0]} , 2 ) ; $ iota2 -> show ; 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 $ primes = $ iota2-> prime_filter $ primes -> show ; 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29
This is n't the best algorithm for computing primes , but it is the oldest --- it 's called the Sieve of Eratosthenes and it was invented about 2,300 years ago .
Exercise for mathematically inclined readers :
What 's interesting about this stream :
&tabulate ( sub { $ _ [ 0 ]
* 3 + 1} , 1 ) -> prime_filter
There are a very few basic tools that we need to make good use of streams .
filter was one ; it filters uninteresting elements out of a stream .
Similarly , transform takes one stream and turns it into another .
If you think of filter as a stream version of Perl 's grep function , you should think of transform as the stream version of Perl 's map function :
sub transform { my $ self = shift ; return &empty if $ self -> is_empty ; my $ map_function = shift ; Stream -> new ( &$ map_function ( $ self - > head ) , sub { $ self -> tail -> transform ( $ map_function ) } ) ; }
If we 'd known about transform when we wrote hamming above , we would never have built a separate scale function ; instead of $s -> scale ( 2 ) we might have written $s -> transform ( sub { $ _ [ 0 ] * 2 } ) .
$ squares -> transform ( sub { $ _ [ 0 ] * 2 } )-> show (5 ) 2 8 18 32 50
We 'll see a more useful use of this a little further down .
Here are a couple of very Perlish streams , presented without discussion :
# Stream of key - value pairs in a hash sub eachpair { my $hr = shift ; my @pair = each % $hr ; if ( @pair ) { Stream -> new ( [ @pair ] , sub { &eachpair ( $hr ) } ) ; } else { #
There are n't any more ∅ } } # Stream of input lines from a filehandle sub input { my $ fh = shift ; my $ line = < $ fh > ; if ( $ line eq ' ' ) { ∅ } else { Stream -> new ( $ line , sub {&input ( $ fh ) } ) ; } } # Get first 3 lines of standard input that contain `hello ' @hellos = &input ( STDIN ) -> filter (sub { $ _ [ 0 ] =~ /hello/i} ) -> take ( 3 ) ;
iterate takes a function and applies it to an argument , then applies the function to the result , then the the new result , and so on :
# compute n , f ( n ) , f( f ( n ) ) , f( f( f ( n ) ) ) , ... sub iterate { my $f = shift ; my $n = shift ; Stream -> new ( $n , sub { &iterate ( $f , & $f ( $n ) ) } ) ; }
One use for iterate is to build a stream of pseudo - random numbers :
# This is the RNG from the ANSI C standard sub next_rand { int ( ( $ _ [ 0 ]
* 1103515245 + 12345 ) / 65536 ) % 32768 } sub rand { my $ seed = shift ; &iterate ( \&next_rand , &next_rand ( $seed ) ) ; } &rand(1 ) -> show ; 16838 14666 10953 11665 7451 26316 27974 27550 31532 5572 &rand(1 ) -> show ; 16838 14666 10953 11665 7451 26316 27974 27550 31532 5572 &rand ( time ) -> show 28034 22040 18672 28664 13341 15205 10064 17387 18320 32588 &rand ( time ) -> show 13922 629 7230 7835 4162 23047 1022 5549 14194 25896
Some people in comp.lang.perl.misc pointed out that Perl 's built - in random number generator does n't have a good interface , because it should be seeded once , but there 's no way for two modules written by different authors to agree on which one should provide the seed .
Also , two or more independent modules drawing random numbers from the same source may reduce the randomness of the numbers that each of them gets .
But with random numbers from streams , you can manufacture as many independent random number generators as you want , and each part of your program can have its own , and use it without interfering with the random numbers generated by other parts of your program .
Suppose you want random numbers between 1 and 10 only ?
Just use transform :
$ rand = &rand ( time ) -> transform ( sub { $ _ [ 0 ] % 10 + 1} ) ; $ rand -> show ( 20 ) ; 1 5 8 2 8 10 4 7 3 10 3 6 3 8 8 9 7 7 8 8
Of course , if we do $ rand -> show ( 20 ) again , we 'll get exactly the same numbers .
There are an infinite number of random numbers in $ rand , but the first 20 are always the same .
We can get to some fresh elements with drop :
$ rand = $ rand ->drop ( 10 ) ;
This is such a common operation , that we have a shorthand for it :
$ rand -> discard ( 10 ) ;
We can also use iterate to investigate the hailstone numbers , which star in a famous unsolved mathematical problem , the Collatz conjecture .
The hailstone question is this : Start with any number , say n .
If n is odd , multiply it by 3 and add 1 ; if it 's even , divide it by 2 .
Repeat forever .
Depending on where you start , one of three things will happen :
You will eventually fall into the loop 4 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 2 , 1 , ...
You will eventually fall into some other loop .
The numbers will never loop ; they will increase without bound forever .
The unsolved question is :
Are there any numbers that do n't fall into the 4 - 2 - 1 loop ?
# Next number in hailstone sequence sub next_hail { my $n = shift ; ( $n % 2 == 0 ) ?
$ n/2 : 3*$n + 1 ; } # Hailstone sequence starting with $n sub hailstones { my $n = shift ; &iterate ( \&next_hail , $ n ) ; } &hailstones ( 15 ) -> show ( 23 ) ; 15 46 23 70 35 106 53 160 80 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 4 2 1 4 2
iterate_chop takes the infinite stream produced by iterate , and chops off the tail before the sequence starts to repeat itself .
&hailstones ( 15 ) ->iterate_chop->show ( ALL ) ; 15 46 23 70 35 106 53 160 80 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2
By counting the length of the resulting stream , we can see how long it took the hailstone sequence to start repeating :
print &hailstones ( 15 ) ->iterate_chop->length ; 17
Of course , you need to be careful not to ask for the length of an infinite stream !
Clearly , you could solve these same problems without streams , but oftentimes it 's simpler to express your problem in terms of filtering and merging of data streams , as it was with Hamming 's problem .
With streams , you get a convenient notation for powerful data flow ideas , and you can apply your experience in programming Unix shell pipelines .
The implementation of streams in Stream.pm is wasteful of space and time , because it uses an entire two - element hash to store each element of the stream , and because finding the n'th element of a stream requires following a chain of n references .
A better implementation would cache all the memoized stream elements in a single array where they could be accessed conveniently .
Our Most assiduous Reader might like to construct such an implementation .
A better programming interface for streams would be to tie the Stream package to a list with the tie function , so that the stream could be treated like a regular Perl array .
Unfortunately , as the man page says :

VIRGINIA TRIOLI : NATO has expressed grave concern about Russia 's decision to suspend its membership of a treaty that regulates the deployment of conventional weapons in Europe .
Russia 's decision is in response to US plans to station anti-missile bases in Eastern Europe .
The Kremlin says the US is upsetting Europe 's security balance .
Michael Edwards has this report .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Russia reverted to Cold War rhetoric .
SERGEI LAVROV , RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ( Translation ) :
We are concerned by the fact that NATO military infrastructure is creeping up to our border .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Moscow claims that Washington 's proposed anti-missile network , part of which will be based in Eastern Europe , is squarely aimed at Russia 's nuclear arsenal .
In protest , the Kremlin used a meeting of NATO foreign ministers to announce it had suspended its involvement with the Conventional Forces Treaty in Europe .
SERGEI LAVROV ( Translation ) : Today , after analysis of the military treaty and considering Russia has been keeping its commitments , our president in his speech to Parliament , suggested how to change things further and so announced a moratorium on the treaty .
And if that does not lead to radical changes , we will withdraw from the treaty .
MICHAEL EDWARDS :
The treaty was signed shortly after the end of the Cold War .
It regulates the level of conventional weapons allowed in Europe .
Vladimir Putin had foreshadowed the move in his final state of the nation speech to the Russian Parliament before he steps down next year .
President Putin also used that speech to take a broad swipe at US foreign policy .
The US says the missile shield is directed towards a perceived threat from rogue states such as North Korea and Iran , and not Russia .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says Moscow should respect the treaty .
CONDOLEEZZA RICE , US SECRETARY OF STATE :
Of course these are treaty obligations and everyone is expected to live up to treaty obligations .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : NATO members expressed dismay at the move , but its secretary - general remains optimistic a compromise can be found .
JAAP DE HOOP SCHEFFER , NATO SECRETARY - GENERAL : Sergei Lavrov confirmed President Putin's statement made this morning that Russia is suspending , he used the word moratorium , its adherence to the adopted CFE treaty .
I can tell you that that message was met by concern , grave concern , disappointment and regret .
MICHAEL EDWARDS : Both sides are wary of an unnecessary return to the corrosive suspicions of the Cold War .
Michael Edwards , Lateline .
The mouse looks the same but has an ancient gene
By engineering its genetic blueprint , they have rebuilt a gene that was present in primitive animals .
The ancient gene later mutated and split , giving rise to a pair of genes that play a key role in brain development in modern mammals .
The scientists say the experiments shed light on how evolution works and could lead to new gene therapy techniques .
" We are first to reconstruct an ancient gene , " said co-researcher Petr Tvrdik of the University of Utah .
" We have proven that from two specialised modern genes , we can reconstruct the ancient gene they split off from .
" It illuminates the mechanisms and processes that evolution uses , and tells us more about how Mother Nature engineers life . "
Brain development
The study , published in the academic journal Developmental Cell , involved a suite of genes involved in embryonic development .
It gives a real example of how evolution works because we can reverse it
Prof Mario Capecchi
Until about 500 million years ago , early animals had 13 such Hox genes .
Then each gene split into four , making 52 genes .
Over the course of evolution , further mutations occurred , and some genes became redundant and disappeared , leading to today 's tally in mammals of 39 Hox genes .
The Utah team looked at two of these genes ; Hoxa1 , which controls embryonic brain development , and Hoxb1 , which plays a key role in the development of nerve cells that control facial expressions in animals .
Hybrid gene
The Utah pair combined critical sections of each gene , reconstructing a gene similar to its equivalent some 530 million years ago .
The hybrid gene is not completely identical to the ancient one , but the scientists say it performs essentially the same functions .
" What we have done is essentially go back in time to when Hox1 did what Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 do today , " said Mario Capecchi , professor of human genetics at the University of Utah School of Medicine .
" It gives a real example of how evolution works because we can reverse it . "
This is hilarious .
" Barry " Obama .
Nice ' do.
( Really . )
And where can we get similar pictures of the rest of the presidential crowd ?
Update : Damn .
We killed that poor site .
Let me see if I can get permission to post that image myself .
I pulled the link .
Update II : Here 's the image so I do n't kill more sites or cost people too much extra bandwidth money .

When the FBI announced two years ago that it no was longer using its controversial Carnivore Internet surveillance software -- in fact , had n't used it since 2003 -- it seemed like an important victory for privacy advocates .
The FBI was instead relying on Internet service providers to provide agents with information on targeted individuals , including e-mail exchanges and Web - browsing activity .
To privacy groups , this was a small step up from Carnivore , since Carnivore could , in practice if not in legal right , capture any electronic communication it wanted .
The idea was that at least the ISP could stand as a wall between the FBI and the people who used the Internet for purposes other than terrorist activity .
It could , in theory , filter out everything except what was explicitly called for in the FBI 's court order .
( When the ISP refuses to provide the information the FBI wanted , the FBI simply resorts to commercially available surveillance software that is actually much more technically advanced than Carnivore .
But still . )
What has come out only recently via CNET is that the information - gathering techniques employed in the ISP - based surveillance approach may actually be more invasive and far - reaching than Carnivore ever was .
According to CNET reporter Declan McCullagh , the FBI is now using a " vacuum cleaner " method of surveillance .
This means that if you happen to share an ISP with a suspected terrorist , your personal e-mails and your browsing history might be sitting in an FBI database alongside the suspected terrorist's .

What we 're talking about here is " full - pipe recording . "
In this method of surveillance , the information the FBI collects goes far beyond the targets listed in the court order it obtained .
­ When the FBI supplies one or more ISPs with all the information it has on a targeted individual , ideally the ISP then gives the FBI all of the information that individual is uploading or downloading via the ISP 's network .
The ISP programs its networks to flag , for instance , an e-mail message travelling to the IP address associated with the surveillance target .
The network then knows to grab this message when it reaches one of the ISP 's network hubs .
All of these snagged e-mails are then turned over to the FBI .
This is all perfectly legal according to digital wiretapping laws .
The problem that has come to light may have already occurred to you if you 've been using the Internet for more than five minutes : IP addresses can be disguised , and apparently no one uses his real name ( or even his criminal alias ) online .
Just ask MySpace .
Or ask the programmers who build spam - filtering software that catches maybe 1 percent of the spam attempting to slam our inboxes every day .
So what 's the FBI to do when the ISPs can't identify the IP address associated with a particular suspect ?
According to CNET and its sources , which include current and former FBI agents and at least one former employee of the Justice Department 's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section , the agency just takes everything and sorts it out back at home .
In this funneling approach , if the FBI requests everything an ISP has on a surveillance target , and the ISP is unable to identify the IP address associated with that target , the FBI takes entire chunks of data from the ISP 's network database and looks through it for the information it needs .
This data could include communications and Web - surfing histories on people not named in the court order and not suspected of any crime .
As posted on reporter Declan McCullagh 's CNET blog , the Justice Department has responded to CNET 's report with a denial that the FBI is collecting information on individuals not listed on a court order .
The agency claims that the FBI is adhering to electronic surveillance laws and makes every effort at " minimization , " an edict requiring law - enforcement bodies to take the least amount of information possible and get rid of any non-relevant communications immediately when conducting surveillance of a targeted individual .
Responding to the " vacuum cleaner " characterization of its surveillance technique , Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd explained that when an ISP cannot identify a targeted individual , the FBI performs automated " real - time filtering " on mass amounts of information in order to weed out irrelevant information .
And since it 's automated , no actual person is reading your filtered - out e-mail messages .
Once a computer program deems them unrelated to the surveillance target , Boyd says , they are instantly deleted from the FBI 's system .

It 's been six months since George Bush called off the search for a kidnapped American soldier in Iraq .
You remember the story .
Bush did n't want to offend our Iraqi " friends , " so Bush and the generals called off the search and left an American service member for dead , even though they had a decent idea where he was .
CNN 's Jack Cafferty summed up the story last November , right after our soldier was kidnapped by them and abandoned by us :
Iraqi Shiites celebrated in the streets yesterday when American soldiers lifted those checkpoints around Sadr City in Baghdad .
That area had been blockaded , while U.S. and Iraqi troops looked for a kidnapped American soldier .
But Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki demanded the American checkpoints come down .
And they did .
And who controls Sadr City ?
Muqtada al - Sadr , the commander of Iraq 's most feared militia .
Al - Sadr made it clear this week , if those checkpoints were not removed , his forces might retaliate .
And the prime minister knows that he needs the support of al - Sadr and his militia , if he wants to successfully govern Iraq .
The American Embassy in Baghdad insists the decision to remove those checkpoints was made after a meeting between al - Maliki and top U.S. officials .
And a military spokesman was adamant that U.S. soldiers removed the checkpoints on their commanders ' orders .
But it does n't really matter , does it ?
By removing the checkpoints , the United States is , in effect , handing over the fate of the kidnapped American soldier to the Shiite militia .
This country has a long and proud tradition of never abandoning its soldiers on the battlefield .
And we ought to be ashamed of ourselves for this little stunt they pulled .
The question is this .
Who 's calling the shots in Iraq , the United States , the Iraqi government , or the militias ?
It 's a disgrace .
[ F ] or [ Johnson ] , the Iraq debate is like a flashback .
By the time Congress cut off funds for Vietnam , the war was largely over , but Johnson still languished in prison , fearing that his nation had abandoned him .
" I know what it 's like to be on front lines for country when fellow countrymen do n't support you , " he said , vowing it will never happen again .
“ The pain inflicted by your country ’s indifference is tenfold that inflicted by your ruthless captors . "
You do n't hear about that American soldier at all anymore , because he's an example of everything that is wrong with this war and its leadership in the Pentagon , the White House , and the then - Republican Congress .
George Bush and the Republicans , and their generals at the Pentagon , do n't care about the troops unless they 're props at a White House photo opp .
If they 're real American soldiers in the war zone , wounded American troops back in the states , or American heroes slain in battle , George Bush and the Republicans in Congress do n't care about them much at all .
Take the much vaunted Republican Rep. Sam Johnson .
You remember him .
He 's the guy who got a standing ovation from Republicans a while back when he gave a speech in the US House excoriating Democrats while saying that the only reason we lost in Vietnam is that the Congress did n't spend more money and send more troops .
Yes .
We would have won in Vietnam had we just stayed longer and sent even more troops .
This kind of crazy talk gets a standing ovation in today 's Republican party and you wonder why we 're losing in Iraq ?
Well , I was reading a short clip about Johnson in today 's Washington Post .
Here 's what it said is motivating him He 's afraid that Democrats want to leave our troops behind .
Okay .
Well , I just did a Google on Sam Johnson and the kidnapped US soldier , Ahmed Qusai al - Taei , and here are the results :
A bit fat zero ( well , a link to an old story that 's now gone ) .
Yes , how many times do we find our American patriot Sam Johnson speaking out in an effort to help this poor US soldier kidnapped and left for dead in Iraq ?
Zero.
But Sam Johnson is an honorable man .
So are they all - George Bush , Dick Cheney , the generals at the Pentagon who all too quickly caved when Bush told them to leave one of their own for dead , and the Republicans in Congress who continue to rubber stamp this disaster of a war - all honorable men .
I 'll close with a quote from Johnson 's standing - ovation floor speech :
You 're right , Mr. Johnson .
So where is our soldier ?
And why do n't you seem to care ?
