Syntax extension for Monads in Ocaml
Jacques Carette , Lydia E. van Dijk and Oleg Kiselyov
Summary
This Camlp4 extension provides some syntactic sugar to beautify monadic expressions .
Example : A simple but realistic example of the use of a list monad looks like this
bind [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] ( fun a -> bind [ 3 ; 4 ; 5 ] ( fun b -> return ( a + b ) ) )
where we assume the appropriate definitions of the functions " bind " and " return " .
With the help of " pa_monad " this can be written as
perform a <-- [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] ; b <-- [ 3 ; 4 ; 5 ] ; return ( a + b )
which is much clearer and thus easier to understand and maintain .
By the way , the expression evaluates to
[ 4 ; 5 ; 6 ; 5 ; 6 ; 7 ; 6 ; 7 ; 8 ]
the sum of each pair of values of the input lists .
For more examples have a look at the examples exception .
ml or pythagorean_triples.ml .
A complete package ( as a .tar.gz file ) containing the extension itself , a Makefile , examples and several tests is available .
See the README for more details .

The relationship to supermodel Gisèle Bündchen has been on and off , so started the relationship with the Israeli model Bar Rafaeli as rumors spread that the relationship between Leonardo and Bar Rafaeli would not last .
However , it seems that Leonardo wants even more ; Leonardo DiCaprio wants to marry Bar Rafaeli this year .
They just recently flew to Israel to celebrate the Birthday of Bars ’ brother .
After Leonardo proposed to her on the same day , they flew to Tel Aviv in order to announce the news to the family and plan for the wedding .
But not yet .
Marine infantry units have traditionally been nonpolitical , to the point of stubbornly embracing a peculiar detachment from policy currents at home .
It is a pillar of the corps ’ martial culture : those with the most at stake are among the least involved in the decisions that send them where they go .

Mr. Rumsfeld may have become one of the war ’s most polarizing figures at home .
But among these young marines slogging through the war in Anbar Province , he appeared to mean almost nothing .
If he was another casualty , they had seen worse .
“ Rumsfeld is the secretary of defense , ” Sergeant McKinnon said , answering Lance Corporal Davis ’s question .
Lance Corporal Davis simply cursed .
It did not sound like anger or disgust .
It seemed instead to be an exclamation about the irrelevance of the news .
The sergeant might as well have told the squad of yesterday ’s weather .
Another marine , Lance Cpl. Patrick S. Maguire , said the decisions that mattered here , inside Company F , Second Battalion , Eighth Marines , were much more important to them than those made in the Pentagon back home .
There are daily , dangerous questions :
When to go on patrol , when to come back , which route to take down a road , which weapon to carry , and , at this moment , which watch each marine would stand , crouched up on the roof , in the cold wind , exposed to sniper fire .
His grandfather fought at Iwo Jima , he said , and his father was a marine in Vietnam .
This was his second tour in Iraq .
“ Here ’s the deal , ” he said .
“ Someone points a finger at you , and you go . ”
Aug. 10 , 2005  --
The reason our friends seem a bit kooky , and our mates may seem strange compared to ourselves , is that opposites attract .
Right ?
Nope .
A large body of research suggests that we pick our friends , as well as our mates , because underneath it all they are very much like us .
So if our friends are kooky , and our mates a bit strange , chances are we are too .
And the latest study in this ongoing research takes it a little further .
We can blame it at least partly on our genes .
People tend to like others who have the same inheritable traits , so we often choose friends and mates who are genetically similar to ourselves .
" People prefer their own kind , " says J. Philippe Rushton , a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario .
" Extroverts favor extroverts ; traditionalists , traditionalists . "
That may not jibe with your own experience , but Rushton notes that genes are not the only players .
We 're not a bunch of robots that are being led around by genes that even pick our friends .
Other factors , according to the researchers , play a significant role .
Rushton says our friends and our mates may also be a product of the " unique environmental effects such as being in the right place at the right time . "
You can't link up with an ideal mate if the two of you never meet .
Our genes , Rushton says , probably account for about a third of the reason why we pick someone else as a friend or a mate .
" But that 's still pretty strong , " he says .
" Let 's say it 's a strong whisper from the genes . "
This is a very different line of research from work by Rushton that has been very controversial .
He claims that his research shows distinct differences between the races in intelligence ( based on brain size ) , fertility , personality , and dozens of other variables .
According to Rushton , Asians rank at the top in intelligence , with Caucasians in the middle and Africans at the bottom .
Many other researchers strongly disagree .
Genes Influence Choices
Rushton , who has been researching the subject of friendship for 20 years , says clear patterns emerged from a study of hundreds of identical and fraternal twins , as well as their spouses and friends .
It 's no surprise that identical twins , who share 100 percent of the same genes , picked friends and mates who were very similar to those picked by their twins .
But here 's the twist .
Fraternal twins , who share only 50 percent of their genes , picked friends and spouses who are so much like themselves they could be their brothers and sisters .
And , Rushton says , so do the rest of us .
" It 's almost as similar as siblings , " he says .
" Not quite , but almost . "
That " was not previously recognized , " Rushton and a colleague , Trudy Ann Bons , report in the July issue of Psychological Science .
The researchers looked at a wide range of variables , including characteristics that are mostly inheritable , and those that are less so , to determine the role genes play in our social behavior .
They found that " people are genetically inclined to choose as social partners those who resemble themselves on a genetic level . "
In this and previous studies , Rushton found that we tend to select spouses on the basis of inheritable characteristics , even if we do n't know those features are inheritable .
For example , he says , the middle - finger length is primarily inheritable , whereas the upper-arm circumference is less so .
And spouses who have participated in his studies tended to marry someone with a similarity in the length of the middle finger , but not in the upper-arm circumference .
The role of genetics is not limited to physical characteristics .
To a lesser extent , genes also play a role in the formation of personality , and even personal likes and dislikes .
The enjoyment of reading , for example , is believed to be more inheritable than having many hobbies .
Swimming In the Same Gene Pool
But why would we prefer someone who is more genetically similar , especially if we do n't even know the genetic nature of some of our peculiarities ?
Most likely , the researchers say , it 's because of a subconscious desire to perpetuate our own genes .
" If you like , become friends with , come to the aid of , and mate with those people who are genetically most similar to yourself , you are simply trying to ensure that your own segment of the gene pool will be safely maintained and eventually transmitted to future generations , " they write .
In the end , by the way , that strategy seems to pay good dividends .
Some studies show that spouses who share inheritable traits seem to be the most satisfied with their marriage .
But this research is full of twists and turns .
Apparently we do n't really want to marry ourselves .
One study looked at personal odors and olfactory preferences , which are inherited from the father .
Women , according to that study , prefer the scents of men with genes somewhat similar to their own , but not those who are nearly identical or those who are very different .
" The optimal amount of similarity is not 100 percent , " the researchers say .
Several other studies show that we 're probably going to like someone better if he or she looks like us .
In one study , men and women were shown pictures of themselves morphed into an image of someone of the opposite sex .
They overwhelmingly preferred the faces of themselves over others .
And that 's not just because of familiarity , the researchers say .
It did n't work if the morphed image was of a movie star or some other celebrity .
The participants liked those who looked like themselves more than they liked the luminaries .
In their latest study , Rushton and Bons sent questionnaires to 1,529 participants , including identical and fraternal twins , spouses and friends .
Ages ranged from 18 to 75 years , with a mean of 32 years .
The questionnaires assessed physical characteristics , demographic background , such as educational level , social attitudes , and personality types .
Measures were taken to keep the participants from collaborating on the answers .
Each questionnaire was returned in a separate , self - addressed envelope .
Opposites Attract ?
The results , according to the researchers , show that genes do indeed play a significant role in who we pick to be our friends and mates , but not the dominant role .
Our " unique environment , " as they put it , may be the most important factor .
" Similarity , of course , is only one of many criteria people use in choosing social partners , " the researchers conclude .
" Physical appearance , status , control of resources , reciprocity , location and family situation all provide constraints and exert influence as well . "
But that old claim that opposites attract still persists , despite decades of research showing that " it just ai n't so , " Rushton says .
" Research has been clear , over and over again , that you can be opposite on one or two dimensions , but overall it 's similarity that rules , " he says .
The husband may love steak , and the wife may hate it .
But too much of that can kill a relationship .
" Just think if you were married to somebody and you had the exact opposite political attitude , " he says .
" You would n't be able to greet each other over the breakfast table .
It would just be awful . "

Would you hire a babysitter who hates children and thinks they should be eliminated ?
Or who declares for years in your hearing that children are irritants who should be starved to be small , unseen and mute ?
Would you hire cops who think laws are stupid and useless and should be abolished ?
Would you hire a conductor for your orchestra who believes music itself an abomination ?
Then why would you hire - and you did hire them , America ; they are your employees , after all , not your rulers , despite their grandiose pretensions - members of a political party who think government is useless , ineffective , bloated and untrustworthy ?
You 've hired for your kitchen the chef who spits in your food because he despises preparing meals .
You 've hired for your yardwork the gardener who sets out to kill your roses to demonstrate his assertion that they will die in your climate .
You 've hired for your office the accountant who 's staked his career on proving no accurate books can be kept .
In electing Republicans , America , you put people in charge of institutions they overtly , caustically loathe and proudly proclaim should not exist .
Good thinking , USA , and stellar results : Katrina , Iraq , Medicare D , trade and budget deficits , mine disasters and on and on and on and ...
Conservatives have declared officially for decades that they hate public programs and love private business .
Why then , do Americans profess shock when these same people run the public credit card up to bunker - busting levels to line the pockets of friendly corporations , leaving taxpayers - current and the as - yet unborn - the bill ?
It 's the dine and ditch mentality writ large , and American citizens are the unfortunate waiters having their lowly pay docked to cover the deadbeat loss - and their future grandchildren 's pay docked as well .
We are witnessing an orchestrated , unprecedented transfer of public wealth to private pockets , a national one - party feeding frenzy that 's making beggars and beseechers of us all , and yet many Americans stand around muttering in a daze of semi-apathetic befuddlement about gosh darn how did all this come to be and how sure as shit , uh - huh , those Republicans shore were right , government does n't do a the little guy a damn bit of good , no sirree bob .
Better drown it some more .
Cut them taxes , privatize something , anything , pronto !
Kee -rist on a pogo stick .
If you put people in charge of running a project they are ideologically committed to proving a failure , it will fail .
Seems pretty straightforward to me .
But hey , I 'm a Democrat .
You know , one of those people who think universal quality public education is a massive good to society , that maintaining our highways and levees and bridges and dams is part of what makes this country great , that paying first - responders and nurses what they 're worth helps guarantee our public health and safety , that providing for fellow citizens who fall on hard times is not only the ethical thing to do , but the pragmatic one , ensuring that this country does not incubate a permanently inflamed and disgruntled underclass ready to drop a match on a pool of social gasoline .
Here 's a thought - just a thought , mind you , beloved America : Perhaps it 's time to return to government the party that has an ideological stake in making it ... you know ... succeed .
Maybe , just maybe , it 's time to raise our sights a wee bit and elect people who think public service is more than an opportunity for the " Biggest !
Fire Sale ! Ever ! " for their friends and loved ones .
Perhaps it 's time to insist on greater - if not great - expectations from the employees we decide to hire or fire every two years to carry out our will under the constitution .
As one - party Republican rule has clearly shown , when you expect incompetence , corruption and deceit from your government , you get exactly what you vote for .
In spades .
When President George W. Bush presented his budget proposals recently for the fiscal year 2008 , he emphasized that the nations security is his highest priority , and he backed up that declaration by proposing that the Pentagons outlays be increased by more than 6 percent beyond its estimated outlays for fiscal 2007 , to a total of more than $ 583 billion .
Although many Americans regard this enormous sum as excessive , hardly anyone appreciates that the total amount of all defense - related spending greatly exceeds the amount budgeted for the Department of Defense .
Indeed , it is roughly almost twice as large .
In the fiscal year 2006 , which ended last September , the Pentagon spent $ 499.4 billion .
Lodged elsewhere in the budget , however , other lines identify funding that serves defense purposes just as surely as sometimes even more surely than the money allocated to the Department of Defense .
On occasion , commentators take note of some of these additional defense - related budget items , such as the Department of Energys nuclear - weapons programs , but many such items , including some extremely large ones , remain generally unrecognized .
Since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security , many observers probably would agree that its budget ought to be included in any complete accounting of defense costs .
After all , the homeland is what most of us want the government to defend in the first place .
Other agencies also spend money in pursuit of homeland security .
The Justice Department , for example , includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation , which devotes substantial resources to an anti-terrorist program .
The Department of the Treasury informs us that it has worked closely with the Departments of State and Justice and the intelligence community to disrupt targets related to al Qaeda , Hizballah , Jemaah Islamiyah , as well as to disrupt state sponsorship of terror . 
Much , if not all , of the budget for the Department of State and for international assistance programs ought to be classified as defense - related , too .
In this case , the money serves to buy off potential enemies and to reward friendly governments who assist U.S. efforts to abate perceived threats .
About $ 4.5 billion of annual U.S. foreign aid currently takes the form of  foreign military financing ,  and even funds placed under the rubric of economic development may serve defense - related purposes indirectly .
Money is fungible , and the receipt of foreign assistance for economic - development projects allows allied governments to divert other funds to police , intelligence , and military purposes .
Two big budget items represent the current cost of defense goods and services obtained in the past .
The Department of Veterans Affairs , which is authorized to spend more than $ 72 billion in the current fiscal year , falls in this category .
Likewise , a great deal of the governments interest expense on publicly held debt represents the current cost of defense outlays financed in the past by borrowing from the public .
To estimate the size of the entire de facto defense budget , I gathered data for fiscal 2006 , the most recently completed fiscal year , for which data on actual outlays are now available .
In that year , the Department of Defense itself spent $ 499.4 billion .
Defense - related parts of the Department of Energy budget added $ 16.6 billion .
The Department of Homeland Security spent $ 69.1 billion .
The Department of State and international assistance programs laid out $ 25.3 billion for activities arguably related to defense purposes either directly or indirectly .
The Department of Veterans Affairs had outlays of $ 69.8 billion .
The Department of the Treasury , which funds the lions share of military retirement costs through its support of the little - known Military Retirement Fund , added $ 38.5 billion .
A large part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations outlays ought to be regarded as defense - related , if only indirectly so .
When all of these other parts of the budget are added to the budget for the Pentagon itself , they increase the fiscal 2006 total by nearly half again , to $ 728.2 billion .
To find out how much of the governments net interest payments on publicly held national debt ought to be attributed to past debt - funded defense spending requires a considerable amount of calculation .
I added up all past deficits ( minus surpluses ) since 1916 ( when the debt was nearly zero ) , prorated according to each years ratio of narrowly defined national security spending military , veterans , and international affairs to total federal spending , expressing everything in dollars of constant purchasing power .
This sum is equal to 91.2 percent of the value of the national debt held by the public at the end of 2006 .
Therefore , I attribute that same percentage of the governments net interest outlays in that year to past debt - financed defense spending .
The total amount so attributed comes to $ 206.7 billion .
Adding this interest component to the previous all - agency total , the grand total comes to $ 934.9 billion , which is more than 87 percent greater than the Pentagons outlays alone .
If the additional elements of defense spending continue to maintain the same ratio to the Pentagons amount and we have every reason to suppose they will then in fiscal year 2007 , through which we are now passing , the grand total spent for defense will be $ 1.028 trillion .
I confirmed the rough accuracy of this forecast by adding up the governments own estimates of fiscal 2007 outlays for the various additional defense - related items , obtaining a total of $ 987 billion an amount only 4 percent less than my ratio - based estimate .
Future defense - related supplemental appropriations for fiscal 2007 , which would hardly be surprising , might easily bring the lower estimate up the higher one .
Although I have arrived at my conclusions honestly and carefully , I may have left out items that should have been included the federal budget is a gargantuan , complex , and confusing collection of documents .
If I have done so , however , the left - out items are not likely to be relatively large ones .
( I have deliberately ignored some minor items , such as the outlays of the Selective Service System and the National Defense Stockpile and the Treasurys program to block financial flows to terrorists . )
Therefore , I propose that in considering future defense budgetary costs , a well - founded rule of thumb is to take the Pentagons ( always well publicized ) basic budget total and double it .
We may overstate the truth , but if so , well not do so by much .
For now , however , the conclusion seems inescapable : the government is currently spending at the rate of approximately $ 1 trillion per year for all defense - related purposes .
Moreover , even if I have erred in my calculations and overstated the correct amount somewhat , the total will certainly reach this astonishing sum very soon , given all the plans and programs already set in motion .

From the NYT story , " White House Pushes Hard on Iraq Plan " :
BBC Radio 4 recently broadcast a documentary on the long - term effects of ecstasy ( MDMA ) now that the ‘ E Generation ’ are in their 40s .
The documentary looks at the evidence for long - term effects of ecstasy and dispels some of the myths that were promoted in anti-ecstasy campaigns of the early 90s ( for example , the famously flawed brain scans presented to suggest that ecstasy leaves functional ‘ holes ’ in the brain ) .
It is clear that such scare stories about the drug ’s damaging effects were greatly exaggerated .
The evidence does suggest , however , that heavy and / or long - term ecstasy use does lead to mild to moderate cognitive impairment in some people ( memory seems particularly sensitive to change ) .
There is still a need for much more systematic research in this area , particularly as the evidence on whether these long - term impairments get better is quite mixed .
The programme is presented by Dr John Marsden who has researched the impact and neuroscience of ecstasy and talks to a number of people who were heavy ecstasy users in the past .

X short form for NoMachine 's X protocol is a compression technology developed by NoMachine which allows one to run complete remote desktop sessions ( be it Linux or Windows ) even at dial up internet connection speeds .
One of the advantages of using NX technology over VNC is that NX uses SSH on port 22 for connection between the client and the server .
Which means all the communication takes place encrypted through industry standard SSL public key cryptography .
FreeNX is the GPL implementation of NoMachine 's NX server .
To have access to a remote desktop , you need to have two software .
The ( Free ) NX server installed and running on the remote machine and The ( Free ) NX client installed on the local machine from which you want to have access to the remote machine .
I tried this technology by connecting via dialup to a demo remote server run by NoMachine and I was really impressed by the speed with which I recieved the remote KDE desktop .
Infact , the NoMachine demo server called TestDrive provides three choices of Gnome , KDE and a Windows desktop ( through RDP / terminal server ) .
NX clients are available for Debian / Ubuntu in deb format , RPM for Red Hat based distros and gzipped tar file for all other Linux flavours .
Why just for Linux , NX clients are available for Windows , Solaris , Mac OSX and even Sharp Zaurus and HP / Compaq iPaq ( PDAs ) .
So it is possible to access the remote Linux / Solaris desktop from all these machines .
The primary difference between NX technology and VNC is that , VNC works by grabing screenshots of the remote desktop which means the network traffic is rather heavy .
Where as NX uses its in - house developed X compression technology to display the remote desktop on the local machine .
Security wise too , NX scores over VNC .
Reese and Ryan fight at the Ivy Remember all the rumors last year that Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon were on the verge of divorce ?
The pair were rarely seen in public together , which made many suspected there were problems at home .
Of course , as Oscar season approached , Reese and Ryan put on their best happy faces and made it look as if their marriage was as solid as ever .
Now that Witherspoon has her statuette , though , it seems the union has hit another rough spot .
Sources for Perez Hilton claim that R&R showed their true colors last night while dining at the Ivy in Los Angeles .
" Ryan and Reese got into a huge fight , " one source said .
Another witness explained , " We were all shocked .
Ryan and Reese were screaming at each other as they left .
There were paparazzi there , and yet they were still screaming at each other ! "
Another onlooker gave more details : " Ryan stormed out of The Ivy at around 9:30 PM and Reese went running after him .
She kept calling his name and he kept walking .
He turned around once and said " STOP ! "
It was so sad … Reese was wearing her sunglasses [ at night ] and it was hard to tell from far way , but it seemed like tears were streaming down her face . "
A possible configuration of the proposed H2CAR process .
Image credit : Rakesh Agrawal , et al .
In a recent study , scientists have demonstrated that a hybrid system of hydrogen and carbon can produce a sufficient amount of liquid hydrocarbon fuels to power the entire U.S. transportation sector .
Using biomass to produce the carbon , and solar energy to produce hydrogen , the process requires only a fraction of the land area needed by other proposed methods .
According to Purdue University scientists Rakesh Agrawal , Navneet Singh , Fabio Ribeiro , and Nicholas Delgass , this appealing scenario is well within reach of current or near - future technology .
“ Enough technology exists to build the main concept of this process today , ” Agrawal told PhysOrg.com .
“ H 2 CAR could also endure sustainably for thousands of years .
[ We hope that ] this process will lead to the birth of a new economy , a ‘ hybrid hydrogen - carbon economy . ’ ”
The hybrid hydrogen - carbon ( H 2 CAR ) process takes advantage of the energy density of liquid hydrocarbons ( currently provided from oil ) , but it uses a sustainable and environmentally - friendly method .
Because the fuel is essentially the same , though , the H 2 CAR process could conveniently merge into the existing infrastructure and bypass delivery problems associated with other alternative energy carriers .
In their paper published in PNAS , Agrawal et al. analyzed and compared different variations of the H 2 CAR process .
They found that an optimal method would use biomass ( such as switchgrass or corn ) to provide the carbon .
The main source of energy driving the process would come from hydrogen .
The hydrogen could be generated from solar energy or another carbon - free energy source , such as nuclear or wind power .
“ Conventional processes treat biomass as a source of carbon atoms as well as a source of energy , ” Agrawal explained .
“ This leads to the formation of a large amount of CO 2 during the conversion process .
The significance of the H 2 CAR process , on the other hand , lies in the fact that we are treating carbon in biomass or coal as primarily a source of carbon atoms and not a source of energy .
This preserves all the carbon in the biomass and converts it to liquid fuel . ”
The scientists explain how the gasification and liquid conversion processes work :
In a conventional process biomass , O 2 and steam are fed together to a gasifier , where they are transformed to gaseous products — primarily CO , CO 2 and H 2 — through a gasification and combustion process .
In this gasification gives CO plus H 2 and a huge amount of CO 2 .
The next step is to transform the gas to a liquid fuel in a Fischer - Tropsch process , where an additional quantity of CO 2 is produced .
Usually , this large quantity of CO 2 formed is released in the atmosphere and requires large amounts of land for the biomass - to - liquid process .
“ The H2CAR method has a solution to these problems , ” Agrawal explained .
“ H2 from a carbon - free energy source , along with CO 2 from the gas to liquid conversion step , is co-fed to the gasifier .
The presence of excess H 2 in the gasifier not only suppresses formation of CO 2 but also reacts with some of the recycled CO2 .
The same happens with CO and H 2 , which are unreacted in a ‘ gas to liquid fuel process ’ and also recycled .
As a result , we do n't lose any carbon atoms as CO 2 , a greenhouse gas , from the H 2 CAR . ”
One concern about the use of biomass to produce fuel is the estimated amount of land area : in conventional methods , biomass would require 25 - 58 % of the total U.S. land area to provide fuel for the country .
Based on the current scenario of growth rates and gasifier efficiencies , the scientists estimate the H2CAR process to require about 15 % of the land — and with reasonable future projections , just 6 % .
Significantly , this scenario would avoid the land competition with food growth .
This study comes nearly on the heels of the 2005 “ Billion Ton Biomass Study , ” which estimated that the current amount of recoverable biomass could meet just 30 % of the U.S. transportation needs .
But because the H 2 CAR process supplements biomass with hydrogen , the same amount of biomass could provide liquid fuels for nearly 100 % of U.S. transportation needs , according to Agrawal et al . ’s estimates .
“ The reason for significant decrease in land area requirement for the H2CAR process as compared to conventional processes is that hydrogen production from solar energy is an order of magnitude more efficient than biomass growth , which typically grows with an average energy efficiency of less than 1 % , ” Agrawal explained .
“ This decreases the land area required to produce same quantity of liquid fuel by a factor of nearly one - third . ”
As the scientists conclude , H 2 CAR solves many problems simultaneously .
“ One is that it eliminates the need for CO 2 sequestration from the chemical processing system , ” Agrawal said .
“ The second is that it solves the grand challenge associated with hydrogen storage problem by storing the carbon - free hydrogen at a much higher storage density than currently known methods available .
The third advantage is it needs nearly one - third biomass and , hence , land area to produce the same quantity of liquid fuel . ”
As amazing as that sounds , the scientists also suggest that , when combined with other technologies such as plug - in hybrid electric vehicles — which can run short distances on electricity and solar cells — the H 2 CAR process would provide the greatest value .
Liquid fuels would only need to provide for less than half of the total driving distance in the U.S. , bringing up the possibility that excess biomass could be used for residential and commercial power .
The scientists also point out that , in this scenario , the U.S. could even become an exporter of oil .
“ The question that remains is of economics and not feasibility , ” said Agrawal .
“ We are currently looking into the economics of the process .
Major obstacles are attracting funding for research because gasification routes are generally capital intensive .
Other obstacles include decreasing the price of hydrogen available from renewable sources such as solar , etc . ” Another of Agrawal ’s research areas is on making cost - effective solar cells .

FORTY YEARS AGO , A BRITISH COMPANY called ICI Pharmaceuticals developed a potent high blood pressure medication called propranolol .
It was the first beta blocker , a class of drugs that inhibits fight - or - flight hormones like adrenaline .
But it was expensive .
So Yusuf Hamied , a 34 - year - old chemist at an Indian drugmaker , got his company to start manufacturing a cheaper version .
ICI protested to the Indian government , and Hamied found himself face to face with prime minister Indira Gandhi .
" Should millions of Indians be denied the use of a lifesaving drug just because the originator does n't like the color of our skin ? " he asked her .
It was a specious argument – ICI was worried about profits , not skin color – but Gandhi was persuaded .
She urged parliament to change the laws governing drug patents , making them apply not to the chemical compounds themselves but to the processes used to manufacture them .
If a company like Hamied 's could come up with a different way to make the same beta blocker ( or whatever ) , it could sell its own version in India free and clear .
That one law transformed India 's pharmaceutical industry .
Today , Hamied 's company , Cipla , is the third - largest in India , with sales of $ 651 million in 2005 .
That 's not much compared to multibillion - dollar concerns like GlaxoSmithKline , but Cipla is still the medicine cabinet to the developing world .
As much as 40 percent of the AIDS patients in poor countries who take medications take Cipla drugs .
What Hamied does is legal in India and the countries where Cipla sells drugs .
But the company is still making copies largely without permission of the people who hold the patents on the compounds .
So to most of the international pharmaceutical industry , Hamied is a pirate .
He is 70 , portly , with white hair and wire - frame glasses .
But his rhetoric is still inflammatory .
Pacing around the Cipla boardroom , he tells the story behind every drug the company makes , punctuating each anecdote by pulling a box of samples from the floor - to - ceiling cabinets and throwing it on the table .
These are the copied drugs that earned Cipla its outlaw reputation : anti-cholesterol pills , antibiotics , AIDS treatments .
He tosses in an asthma inhaler and a box of ciprofloxacin , the powerful antibiotic popular with bioweapon - fearing Americans .
Hamied made the greatest waves last year , when global fears of a bird flu pandemic inflated demand for oseltamivir , the only drug thought to be effective against the disease .
Its maker , Switzerland - based Roche Pharmaceuticals , said it could n't produce enough .
Hamied stepped in , without a license from Roche , and started manufacturing the drug with the intention of selling it in countries where Roche did n't hold the patent – and , though he wo n't acknowledge it overtly , anywhere else .
As is his style , Hamied made a lot of noise about his planned defiance .
He has built his business on challenging the companies and patent structures that dominate the global drug market , because it 's a worthy cause and because it 's good for his bottom line .
Now the Indian laws that let Hamied get away with all that are changing .
In 2005 , the Indian government brought its patent laws in line with those of the developed world .
Indian companies can keep making certain knockoffs , but they can't copy drugs patented after 1995 without a license .
So Cipla needs a new business model :
It 's going to sell legal generics to rich Americans .
BIRDS , LIKE PEOPLE , GET VIRUSES .
They get sick , and usually they recover .
They go back to waddling or flying or chirping .
But one avian flu virus breaks the rules .
This strain , called H5N1 , is a killer – of birds , certainly , but also of people .
Since 2003 , more than 250 humans who work or live with sick birds have caught it , and more than 150 of them have died .
Not a big number , but nearly three out of five , making H5N1 one of the most efficient viral assassins in the world .
Global public health agencies worry that if it started moving from human to human , it could lead to a pandemic .
This is n't paranoia .
The three flu pandemics of the 20th century claimed at least 43 million lives – 1918 started as a bird flu , and both 1957 and 1968 had genetic material from both bird and human viruses .
H5N1 has hopscotched around the globe , from Asia to Europe , the Middle East , and Africa .
But recent research has bred optimism .
Turns out , H5N1 infections settle deeper in the lungs than other kinds of influenza .
The usual coughing does n't aerosolize virus particles , making it harder for people to give it to one another .
And the virus does n't seem to pick up new genetic traits as readily as some bugs , which is good news if you 're worried about killer mutants .
Nevertheless , the World Health Organization has recommended that nations stockpile drugs thought to work against avian flu .
There are n't a lot of choices .
Oseltamivir , an antiviral manufactured by Roche under the trade name Tamiflu , is the best bet .
But at the time of the 2005 southeast Asian outbreak it cost $ 60 for a five - day course of treatment , far too pricey for developing countries like Vietnam , where bird flu hit hardest .
Wealthy nations could n't get their hands on the drug either :
Even though it quadrupled production during the outbreak , Roche had a backlog of orders at least a year long .
Company spokespeople said they were at maximum output , due in part to a worldwide shortage of star anise , a key ingredient of oseltamivir .
Furthermore , Roche would n't license the drug to other companies .
The company claimed other drugmakers would have a hard time starting their own pipelines because synthesis of the drug was complicated and dangerous , requiring the use of an explosive chemical .
Another firm would take two or three years just to figure out how to do it .
Nonsense , thought Hamied .
One of his competitors in India , a company called Hetero , was already quietly making its own unlicensed oseltamivir knockoff , and Cipla was producing drugs with the explosive intermediate chemical Roche was so worried about .
Hamied went shopping for star anise , and found that while it was n't cheap , it was available .
He bought a few tons and set his chemists to work reverse - engineering the drug .
" Right or wrong , we 're going to commercialize and make oseltamivir , " Hamied told The New York Times in October 2005 .
When bird flu hit India four months later , Hetero had 700,000 doses ready .
And Cipla , Hamied said , had 10,000 and was geared up to crank out 100,000 a week .
" It was n't all that difficult , " Hamied says .
" I think Roche had been dishonest . "
Roche , for its part , denies that it had a problem with the Tamiflu supply .
Spokesperson Terry Hurley insists that the company did n't have a backlog but instead " implemented a proactive inventory management plan . "
And it was n't trying to block other manufacturers or hoard its intellectual property , either .
" Roche has involved contract manufacturers into its supply chain to increase global Tamiflu production capacity , " Hurley says .
" This demonstrates that it 's possible to collaborate with third parties and respect IP rights at the same time . "
In the past decade , Cipla has been at the center of nearly every international health panic involving a patented medicine .
Five years ago , Hamied defied patents and international law regarding antiretroviral medications , the drugs used to fight AIDS .
When pharma firms refused to cut prices , he announced he'd make the " AIDS cocktail " for a dollar a day .
Hamied also combined three medicines , each made by a separate company , into a single pill , making it easier for patients to stay on their treatments .
Big Pharma fights pretty hard to get countries to outlaw Cipla - like behavior , but the industry also knows that governments can change all the rules in times of crisis .
" Compulsory licenses " allow companies to make drugs even if they do n't own the patents , or compel the originating firm to ramp up production .
Often all it takes is the threat of a compulsory license to get the actual patentholder to increase output .
And in general , when small - timers like Cipla stay in their own ( poor ) backyard , the big manufacturers pay little attention .
Oseltamivir was different .
Even though European and North American countries could afford the drug , there was none available .
Hamied could n't legally sell it to them .
Yet he talked to The New York Times to ensure everyone knew he had it .
Hamied 's $ 20 million oseltamivir project was n't a charity mission .
It was a calculated gamble that a flu pandemic would hit before Roche could fill its orders .
" If there was a pandemic , and the Americans fell short of the drug , would they come to me to buy ? " he asks .
Bird flu did n't turn into a pandemic last year , but governments tasted panic – and Hamied figured they'd be ready to buy from him or anyone else who had it to sell .
Roche denies that the prospect of competition had any impact ; the company was granting manufacturing licenses to Vietnam and China before Hamied 's announcement .
Soon after , it granted one to Hetero in India .
Nevertheless , Hamied says that getting involved in the fight against bird flu " had much more impact than what we did five years ago on HIV / AIDS , because at that time HIV / AIDS was regarded as the black man 's disease .
But now I was talking about a white man 's disease . "
HAMIED'S FATHER , A CHEMIST and an Indian nationalist , founded Cipla in 1935 , when there was n't a single pharmaceutical company in the country .
It was a nation - building project ; Hamied the elder wanted to do everything he could to make India self - sufficient .
His timing was perfect .
Embroiled in World War II , Great Britain asked its colonies for help , and Cipla gladly began churning out medicines for the war effort .
Hamied says his father never pushed him to carry on the legacy .
He went to Cambridge to study chemistry anyway .
At graduation , he was offered a fellowship .
" There were many chemists much , much better than me , and I could not compete intellectually , " Hamied says .
" There was no point in following an academic career . "
He flew back to India and took a research job at Cipla .
As Hamied grew older , he developed a more complicated relationship with his homeland .
His father , devout in his patriotism , linked Cipla 's fortunes to India's .
But Hamied is often perplexed and saddened by India today – by the sectarian violence , for example , that periodically engulfs Mumbai .
In fact , he and his wife have what 's called nonresident Indian status , which requires them to live outside of the country for six months a year .
( They spend the time in Europe and Mauritius . )
It also happens to give them a nice tax break .
It 's exactly that fiscal pragmatism that brought Bill Clinton to Hamied .
When the Clinton Foundation was looking for a pharmaceutical partner in its attempts to bring AIDS drugs to Africa , Cipla was an obvious choice .
" I say this with complete respect , " says Anil Soni , who works on the Clinton Foundation 's HIV / AIDS initiative .
" Hamied is not an AIDS activist .
He 's a businessman .
He has a deep personal commitment to providing antiretroviral drugs at a price that is sustainable for him and his company , but that is a part of his business . "
And it's as a businessman that Hamied feels the lopsidedness of the way drug patents work around the world .
In the US and many other countries , new drugs are patent - protected for 20 years .
When a company wants intellectual property protection in a new country , it needs a patent there , too .
After 20 years , any company can start making its own version , called a generic .
In practice , makers like Cipla often manufacture and sell drugs owned by other companies in countries where the patents are n't enforced .
Pharmaceutical giants like Roche or GlaxoSmithKline see that as pirate behavior , arguing that if you start messing around with the patent system , you take away their profit incentive to invent new medicines .
According to a 2003 study in the Journal of Health Economics , it can take 12 years and $ 800 million to discover one novel drug .
But the truth is that Big Pharma hardly innovates at all these days .
It uses the profits from its patents to market existing drugs and buy new ideas from academic researchers or smaller firms .
According to the consultancy Strategic Decisions Group , " 40 to 50 percent of products in development by global pharmaceutical firms are externally sourced . "
Oseltamivir , for example , was invented not at Roche but at a small biotech company called Gilead .
Roche then bought the rights to make ( and market ) it .
In 2004 , just 36 new drugs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration – down from a peak of 53 in 1996 .
So drugmakers have devised an arsenal of tactics for extending the life of their patents :
Altered dosages , different combinations of meds , and novel uses for existing drugs all keep aging medications under patent – and profitable – by qualifying as new versions of old meds .
That staves off competition from generics .
Hamied does n't consider himself a pirate .
" Cipla never breaks the law , " he says .
" It lives by the law of the land it is working with . "
But he does n't deny that he feels the system favors the rich and the Western .
" The third world cannot afford the prices of medications that are prevailing in the first world , " Hamied says .
" So do n't talk about patents in isolation .
Talk about access to medicine at affordable prices . "
That 's what happened after Cipla 's flirtation with oseltamivir .
Rich nations – the ones responsible for propping up the current patent system – came to see the risks of the legal monopolies .
In May , the member states of the World Health Organization passed a resolution expressing concern about the " impact of high prices of medicines on access to treatment . "
The resolution also declared that patents are n't helping poor patients get new medicines .
It sounds like a bureaucratic victory at best .
Cipla did n't come out a winner .
( " We have large stocks of oseltamivir , but no customers , " Hamied says .
" It was a good humanitarian gesture , but in retrospect , it was a big mistake . " )
But for public health advocates and patent activists it was huge .
Developed countries had previously blocked any attempt to get the WHO to take a stand on patents .
But the May resolution passed because Big Pharma 's traditional supporters like the US backed it – even they are starting to question patent laws .
" People are beginning to see that this is not a problem of very poor countries not being able to afford medicines , " says Ellen 't Hoen , policy director of the Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines at Doctors Without Borders .
" It 's a question of who controls what and who has access to what , and that goes beyond developing countries . "
ONE OF CIPLA'S MANUFACTURING facilities is in Pune , 100 miles east of Mumbai .
It 's a clean , manicured oasis amid blasted red - dirt scrubland , the air scented sweet and toxic by a nearby petrochemical plant .
In the main building , a vast , sparkling room houses seven massive stainless steel vessels , looking like submarines that have dived halfway into the floor .
A tangle of color - coded pipes and hoses is connected to each .
The entire room hums and groans with the sounds of industrial motors and pumps .
Inside one of the vessels , thousands of gallons of clear liquid froth and swirl .
This is pure sertraline – an antidepressant sold in the US under the brand name Zoloft .
Hamied 's is a generic that will eventually be dried , shipped to the US , pressed into pills , and legally sold to sad Americans .
Next door , massive sifters are processing thousands of pounds of sildenafil citrate .
Hamied markets it as Erecto ; you probably know it as Viagra .
Nobody has a patent on it in India yet , so it 's legal for him to make – he just can't sell it in , say , the US .
In the packaging department downstairs , a dozen women are assembling white cardboard boxes like the ones Hamied threw around his conference room , filling them with pills to treat yeast infections .
They 're generics , too – legal , and destined for US pharmacies .
These are not exactly the drugs that are going to save humanity .
But they might save Cipla .
This year , 50 percent of its sales came from exports – up 44 percent from the year before .
And Hamied predicts that exports will keep growing .
Brand - name drugs cost too much for even patients in the US .
" What is the frightening scenario for America , and also a very interesting scenario for America , is the fact that if more and more companies enter the American generic market , the local generic industry will die , " Hamied says .
" And the people in Medicare and the old - age pensioners will benefit . "
Forget copycatting ; the real action is in legitimate generics sold back to a drug - hungry West .
That 's convenient , because just as Hamied is winning abroad , he is losing at home , now that India has closed the loophole that Indira Gandhi had opened .
The government wants the country to join the World Trade Organization , and current members – under pressure from pharmaceutical companies – made the change a precondition .
It 's illegal to copy newly patented drugs in India .
International do - gooder organizations protested the change , concerned that the new law would mean the end of affordable drugs for India and other poor nations .
" This is a disaster for the common man , " Hamied says .
And for Cipla , unless it can start making big - ticket generics for sale abroad .
Hamied 's competitors in India have vowed to expand their R&D to compete with Big Pharma .
But Hamied does n't think it 'll work .
Western drug companies feed off massive federal research grants that the Indian government could n't possibly match .
The future , Hamied says , is legal , licensed drugs .
Well , mostly legal .
At Hamied 's factory , a full ton of powdered oseltamivir is stashed in plastic drums .
A Cipla manager proudly brandishes the tangible proof behind his boss 's bluster : a plastic baggie heavy with the stuff .
He says he watches the news daily for updates .
If a pandemic hits , what does he think the Americans will do ?
" We are waiting , " the manager says with a smile .

Only a few days left to Double your gift
What work do you do ?
I ’m a 62 - year - old retired French teacher and tennis coach who has been spending six to eight hours a day for the last 20 months trying to get 34 million Americans to donate at least one dollar to the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) .
I do this because the Bush administration refused to release the $ 34 million Congress had approved .
The organization is 34 Million Friends of UNFPA and my job title might be “ Totally Dedicated Grassroot . ”
What would constitute “ mission accomplished ” for your organization ?
The short - term goal would be a list of 34 million Americans on the website who have reached out to the world ’s women with a small gift .
The long - term goal would be for me to play a part in encouraging a worldwide constituency of people who , by small gifts to UNFPA every year , announce to their governments and to the world that equality for women and girls , reproductive health in its myriad connotations , and choices about family size should be the world ’s very first priority .
Nothing else will save more human beings and help sustain the planet .
What is UNFPA ?
It is an agency of the United Nations that receives allocations from member countries to assure safe childbirth and family planning to the poorest , most vulnerable women in the world — and their families .
It does its work in more than 144 countries .
It is part of UNAIDS and educates people against early marriage and female genital mutilation .
It emphasizes the needs of the 1.2 billion adolescents on the planet for informed choices .
You should read about its Fistula Initiative .
What do you really do , on a day - to - day basis ?
I try to communicate with as many groups , individuals , and organizations as possible .
I am currently traveling extensively around the country talking about 34 Million Friends .
I write op - eds and letters to editors .
I have written a poem about 34 Million Friends which has been turned into a song and recorded by Odetta .
It will be out soon and I think it will sweep the world .
What organizations do you belong to ?
More than I did 20 months ago , that ’s for sure !
In order to ask , it ’s better to be a member .
So , I ’m a member of the Sierra Club , the National Audubon Society , the National Wildlife Federation , Planned Parenthood , the Feminist Majority , NOW , League of Women Voters , American Association of University Women , Population Connection , Population Institute , Population Coalition , and on and on .
I ’ve belonged for years to several , but a few are fairly new .
What long and winding road led you to your current position ?
My life , like many other women ’s lives , has been one of a time for this and a time for that .
I was a ranked junior tennis player when young , an M.A. in French at 23 , and married at 24 .
I taught French and played tennis until adopting a boy at age 33 and experiencing a “ surprise ” pregnancy at age 35 , resulting in a baby girl .
I did lots of part - time work until my kids were in high school , and then I taught and coached in high school from 1990 to 1998 .
Population , international reproductive health , and family planning were the areas I wanted to devote myself to in retirement .
I never dreamed this would happen , though .
How many emails are currently in your inbox ?
I probably get close to 25 emails a day , excluding spam .
This effort would be impossible without the Internet .
The most interesting are PlanetWire clips ( about five per day ) , articles in newspapers and transcripts of TV and radio news programs concerning population , reproductive health , and reproductive health politics .
34 Million Friends is a fairly frequent subject of these clips .
Based on these clips I write letters to editors .
I also have a daily exchange of emails with the two people in Boulder , Colo. , who work for the U.N. Foundation and the U.S. Committee for UNFPA , coordinating this idealistic effort .
It got way too big for Lois Abraham and me to do it all .
Lois Abraham , by the way , is the “ other woman ” who had this same “ brilliant ” idea .
We are partners in this all the way .
What have been the highlights of your campaign ?
That ’s easy .
One was my trip to Senegal and Mali in February 2003 to see UNFPA work on site .
How would you like to give birth with nothing but a sterile plastic sheet , a bar of soap , a razor blade to cut the umbilical cord , and string to tie it off ?
Well , this is the “ Safe Birth Kit ” that UNFPA distributes in remote areas of poor countries .
It saves lives by the ton every year .
Another highlight of this trip was finding a children ’s writing booklet at an elementary school funded by the Ministry of Education of Senegal and the UNFPA .
It says on the front , “ Little girls deserve as much food , education , and health care as little boys . ”
Another highlight was our trip to Brussels in May of 2003 to launch 34 Million Friends in the E.U .
Every week I write about 10 thank - you notes to grassroots people who send their dollar — last week to a grandfather who sends $ 5 a month for his five grandchildren , and to a 16 - year - old girl who sent a dollar after reading about 34 Million Friends in Glamour magazine .
Two women organized a Bark for Women Dog Walk in Central Park , too .
What fun !
Who are your environmental heroes ?
People who would understand the link between population , the environment , consumption , peace and stability , and women ’s health and choices .
They are all inextricably linked .
Who is your environmental nightmare ?
Ralph ( Ego - Trip ) Nader .
How do you get around ?
A ’95 Eagle Vision ( similar to a Dodge Intrepid ) , which has gone 148,000 miles but runs well .
Our next car will be a hybrid — next year perhaps .
Who ’s the biggest pain in your tookus ?
Our president .
With his “ pro-life ” policies , which deprive women of contraception and reproductive health services , he has caused enormous misery , countless abortions , and maternal and infant deaths .
What are you reading right now ?
Middlesex , by Jeffrey Eugenides .
A great book .
Where were you born ?
Where do you live now ?
I was born in San Diego , Calif. , in 1941 and since 1964 have lived in Redlands , Calif. , with about four years spent in France at various times .
If you could have every InterActivist reader do one thing , what would it be ?
That ’s easy too .
Send your dollar and spread the word .
This can only work if you all use your imagination and intelligence to get the word out .
It is a marvelous message to send to the world from the American people .
Contribute on the web or send a tax - deductible dollar to : U.S. Committee for UNFPA , 3800 Arapahoe Ave. , Suite 210 , Boulder , CO 80303 .
Thanks to outside support for administrative costs , the money does go directly to UNFPA ’s humanitarian programs .
Let ’s make 34 Million Friends a national undertaking .
It is definitely doable !
We hope to hear from you !
" What do you mean , my computer can't handle Windows Vista ?
It was top of the line when I bought it 8 years ago !
I bet you 're deceiving me ! "

Frank Zappa on Crossfire 1986
Zappa debated against the censorship of words in song lyrics stating everyone has a right to expression , and everyone has the right to choose what they buy and listen to .
The real shocker was when he said something like - we 're moving towards a fascist government theocracy , ever since the Regan era .
Robert Novak , the guy who exposed Valerie Plame as part of a smear campaign to prevent people from speaking out against the war in Iraq jumped in saying that 's ridiculous .
It 's pretty true today with neoconservatives backed by powerful christian lobbyist attacking islamic nations and associating words like " axis of evil " and " war against terror " to their efforts .
No , I 'm not muslim , and no I do n't sympathize with radical islam .
It 's as bad as KKK christians .
The military occupation of palestine , that 's heavily supported by the US military equipment and contracts is just another example of fascist theocracy and the military industrial complex .
The supreme court even let allowed nazis to march through a jewish town that had holocaust survivors in it , because freedom of expression applied .
I get angry listening to disgusting John Lofton self - righteously trying to interpret the constitution and take away everyone 's liberty for his own ideals .

Trusted
It started with a forum thread and the following front - page blurb at OSx86 , a site produced by people attempting to crack the Intel version of Mac OS X to get it to run on non-Apple computers :
We ’ve discovered that Rosetta uses TCPA / TPM DRM .
Some parts of the GUI like ATSServer are still not native to x86 — meaning that Rosetta is required by the GUI , which in turn requires TPM .
See the forum topic here .
“ TPM ” stands for Trusted Platform Module , an industry standard hardware chip that provides for “ trusted computing ” .
There ’s an industry consortium , the Trusted Computing Group , whose primary promoters are AMD , HP , IBM , Intel , Microsoft , Sony , and Sun .
The whole “ trusted computing ” thing is highly controversial .
The Wikipedia , as usual , has a fine overview , covering both what trusted computing is , and why it ’s controversial :
Trusted computing is a term coined by the TCPA referring to the goal of their family of open specifications to make computers more secure through the use of dedicated hardware .
Critics , including academics , security experts , and users of free and open source software , contend , however , that the overall effect ( and perhaps intent ) of trusted computing is to impose unreasonable restrictions on how people can use their computers .
The Wikipedia also has a short entry on TPM .
The gist of the situation , reportedly , is that at least some portions of the Intel Developer Transition Kit version of Mac OS X are strung up in such a way that depends upon the TPM module on the Transition Kit motherboard .
I say “ reportedly ” because I ca n’t say for certain there is in fact such a module on the motherboard , because I do n’t have a Developer Transition Kit , and even if I did , I ’d be under an NDA that would prevent me from discussing it .
But I think it ’s safe to assume these reports are true .
The effect of this , surprise surprise , is that the version of Mac OS X that ships with the Developer Kit hardware only runs on Apple ’s Developer Kit Hardware .
Which state of affairs is exactly what Apple stated , clearly and publicly , when they announced the transition at WWDC in June .
What Apple has n’t stated publicly is how , technically , they were going to keep Mac OS X compiled for x86 from running on non-Apple x86 computers .
The TPM chip is , apparently , at least part of the answer .
It ’s hard to see how this news is surprising to anyone .
Given ( a ) that Apple has stated , adamantly , that Mac OS X will only run on Apple hardware ; and ( b ) that despite a lot of effort and a lot of interest , no one has been able to get the Developer Kit Mac OS X release to run on non-Apple hardware ; it seems rather obvious that the Developer Kit boxes contain some sort of hardware that the software is tied to .
This affects no one other than those who hope to install bootleg copies of Mac OS X on their x86 PCs.
1
And so ends the reality - based portion of the saga .
Tin Foil Hat Country
On Monday , the story was picked up by Slashdot , with the following submission blurb :
Several people have discovered that the new Intel kernel Apple has included with the Developer Kit DVD uses TCPA / TPM DRM .
More specifically , it includes “ a TCPA / Palladium implementation that uses a Infineon 1.1 chip which will prevent certain parts of the OS from working unless authorized .
From here , we go to Cory Doctorow , who , after reading the “ news ” on Slashdot , penned a scathing diatribe on Boing Boing , titled , “ Apple to add Trusted Computing to the new kernel ? ” .
It starts :
People working with early versions of the forthcoming Intel - based MacOS X operating system have discovered that Apple ’s new kernel makes use of Intel ’s Trusted Computing hardware .
If this “ feature ” appears in a commercial , shipping version of Apple ’s OS , they ’ll lose me as a customer —
I ’ve used Apple computers since 1979 and have a Mac tattooed on my right bicep , but this is a deal - breaker .
First , it seems a bit euphemistic to describe people trying to crack Mac OS X to run on non-Apple x86 hardware as “ people working with early versions of the forthcoming Intel - based MacOS [ sic ] X operating system ” .
“ People working with ” creates the impression that these are legitimate developers , expressing legitimate concerns .
Doctorow continues :
I travel in the kinds of circles where many people use GNU / Linux on their computers — and not only use it , but actually call it GNU / Linux instead of just “ Linux , ” in the fashion called for by Richard Stallman .
Some of these people give me grief over the fact that I use Mac OS X instead of GNU / Linux on my Powerbook , because the MacOS is proprietary .
There is a word for these people .
That word is asshole .
No , wait , zealot .
OK , there are two words for these people .
When my free software companions give me grief over this , I tell them that I ’m using an OS built on a free flavor of Unix , and that most of the apps I use are likewise free — such as Firefox , my terminal app , etc .
Here ’s the important part though : when I use apps that are n’t free , like Apple ’s Mail.app , BBEdit , NetNewsWire , etc , I do so comfortable in the fact that they save their data - files in free formats , open file - formats that can be read by free or proprietary applications .
That means that I always retain the power to switch apps when I need to .
Here at least , Doctorow makes complete sense .
Indeed , open , interchangeable file formats are much more important than free software .
2
Best are apps that directly read and write to open formats ; good enough are apps that import from and export to open formats .
3
But then he enters tin foil hat country :
The point of Trusted Computing is to make it hard — impossible , if you believe the snake - oil salesmen from the Trusted Computing world — to open a document in a player other than the one that wrote it in the first place , unless the application vendor authorizes it .
It ’s like a blender that will only chop the food that Cuisinart says you ’re allowed to chop .
It ’s like a car that will only take the brand of gas that Ford will let you fill it with .
It ’s like a web - site that you can only load in the browser that the author intended it to be seen in .
Certainly such a scenario is a potential use of Trusted Computing DRM mechanisms — and such a scenario would indeed be dreadful — but it ’s a far stretch to call it the “ point of Trusted Computing ” .
In the actual case here , Apple ’s Developer Transition Kits — which , I ’ll remind you , may bear zero resemblance , internally or externally , to the actual Intel - powered computers Apple will eventually ship to real customers — are ( reportedly ) using TPM for one and only one purpose : to prevent the OS from being run on non-Apple hardware .
There is no indication , none , zero , not even a whiff , that Apple intends to enable , let alone encourage , developers to create software with the TPM file - access authorization - locking described by Doctorow above .
None .
This is not about third - party software developers limiting access to your data .
This is about Apple limiting access to their operating system .
Even if you ignore the fact that there is n’t any evidence , just think about it .
What motivation would Apple have for allowing or encouraging this sort of lock - in ?
Ever since the transition to Mac OS X , Apple has been moving in the direction of openness , releasing the entire low - level OS core as open source , bending over backwards for compatibility with Windows wherever possible — and but now they ’re going to allow for this ?
It boggles the mind .
Or consider iTunes , the most prominent software from Apple that makes use of DRM .
The DRM in iTunes does n’t add any restrictions to music you already own .
Apple went to bat for users ’ rights with the ITMS , getting better rights and lower pricing ( for hit singles at least ) than what the record labels wanted to offer .
And if you still do n’t like the ITMS DRM policies — which is a perfectly reasonable stance — you can simply not use the ITMS and still be a happy iTunes / iPod user .
Back to Doctorow :
What this means is that “ open formats ” is no longer meaningful .
An application can write documents in “ open formats ” but use Trusted Computing to prevent competing applications from reading them .
This is completely wrong .
The existence of a TPM chip on the motherboard does not mean that application developers will be able to create apps which can produce files which can only be opened in the app that created the file .
You ’d need operating system support for that , including a way to prevent files from being copied to other computers , and adding a feature like this to the OS would be suicidal .
In what way could such a capability possibly be construed as beneficial to users ?
And , I repeat , there is no evidence whatsoever that Apple plans to do this .
If a file is written to disk in an open format , no TPM chip can prevent you from opening it in another program .
And if your data is written to disk in an encrypted format , with the decryption keys tied TPM hardware outside your control — then your software is clearly not writing to an “ open format ” .
Apple may never implement this in their own apps ( though I ’ll be shocked silly if it is n’t used in iTunes and the DVD player ) , but Trusted Computing in the kernel is like a rifle on the mantelpiece : if it ’s present in act one , it ’ll go off by act three .
No one has ever claimed that copy - protected DVDs are an “ open format ” , nor has Apple ever claimed that DRM - protected music from ITMS is an “ open format ” .
The whole point of the DRM is that the formats are n’t open .
These restrictions are n’t from Apple , they ’re from the entertainment industry .
Even if they wanted to , Apple could n’t sell non-DRM protected major - record - label music from the ITMS , nor could they ship a version of DVD Player which allowed you to , say , export video from a commercial DVD to an unprotected QuickTime movie .
If you ’re not happy with these restrictions in iTunes and DVD Player , blame the entertainment industry .
Again , I see no reason to believe that Apple is interested in making these restrictions even more onerous than they already are .
So that means that if Apple carries on down this path , I ’m going to exercise my market power and switch away , and , for the first time since 1979 , I wo n’t use an Apple product as my main computer .
I may even have my tattoo removed .
Down what path , though ?
Down the path where individual Mac apps start using TPM - enabled DRM to prevent you from opening your files with other applications ?
Well , duh , if Apple does that , nearly every Mac user will be in line for a new brand of computer .
Or is the mere presence of a bogeyman TPM chip on the motherboard , which chip is used as nothing more than a dongle that ties Mac OS X to Apple - sanctioned hardware , enough to count as “ carr[ ying ] on down this path ” ?
If that ’s the case , Doctorow might as well start packing his bag .
It ’ll be interesting to see what platform Doctorow switches to .
Windows is seemingly out of the question , considering that Windows Vista is slated to contain numerous TPM - based security features .
But he can always switch to GNU / Linux , right ?
Actually , wrong — because the Linux kernel has driver support for TPM , too .
Go ahead and look at the source code of drivers / char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c , which starts :
/* * Description : * Device Driver for the Infineon Technologies * SLD 9630 TT Trusted Platform Module * Specifications at www.trustedcomputinggroup.org
I suppose he could compile his own version of the Linux kernel minus any support for TPM , but the wiser course would be to realize that TPM support , in and of itself , is no more or less evil than support for any other chips on a motherboard .
Decency
When I told a few friends this week that I planned to write about Doctorow ’s outburst , several indicated that I should n’t bother , more or less on the grounds that Doctorow deserves to be cut a bit of slack because his heart is in the right place .
The idea being , OK , sure , he ’s out of line in complaining about this , but at least he ’s just looking out for users ’ rights .
But the fact that his intentions are good does n’t make it right to let this pass .
Doctorow is clearly ascribing deviousness onto Apple , without a single shred of evidence to back it up .
But anyone who knows him as both an Apple aficionado and a champion of users ’s rights , and who trusts his opinions on such matters , is going to take away from this the idea that Apple is doing something malicious , and that bad things are likely to start happening with users ’ data on Intel - powered Mac systems .
The idea that Doctorow ’s critique , despite being unfounded , was good for the community simply because of its anti-DRM slant is like saying McCarthyism was good for the country simply because of its anti-Communist slant .
Yet here we are , with Tim O’Reilly calling Doctorow ’s post “ a great rant ” :
In his usual lucid way , Cory goes on to explain why open data is more important than free software , and how the proposed DRM cuts to the heart of the essential freedom to switch to another program , or another computer .
Well worth a read .
Except that the only “ proposed DRM ” that would get in the way of any “ freedom to switch ” exists only in completely fabricated scenarios from Doctorow himself .

During the hearing on his nomination as attorney general , Alberto Gonzales said he understood the difference between the job he held — President Bush ’s in - house lawyer — and the job he wanted , which was to represent all Americans as their chief law enforcement officer and a key defender of the Constitution .
Two years later , it is obvious Mr. Gonzales does not have a clue about the difference .
He has never stopped being consigliere to Mr. Bush ’s imperial presidency .
If anyone , outside Mr. Bush ’s rapidly shrinking circle of enablers , still had doubts about that , the events of last week should have erased them .
First , there was Mr. Gonzales ’s lame op - ed article in USA Today trying to defend the obviously politically motivated firing of eight United States attorneys , which he dismissed as an “ overblown personnel matter . ”
Then his inspector general exposed the way the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been abusing yet another unnecessary new power that Mr. Gonzales helped wring out of the Republican - dominated Congress in the name of fighting terrorism .
The F.B.I. has been using powers it obtained under the Patriot Act to get financial , business and telephone records of Americans by issuing tens of thousands of “ national security letters , ” a euphemism for warrants that are issued without any judicial review or avenue of appeal .
The administration said that , as with many powers it has arrogated since the 9/11 attacks , this radical change was essential to fast and nimble antiterrorism efforts , and it promised to police the use of the letters carefully .
Even though most people have a hard time explaining what Web 2.0 is , more people than ever are launching Web 2.0 companies daily .
If you ’re not cautious though , things may not turn out as you expect .
Here are a few things to keep in mind as you launch that company whose name we probably wo n’t be able to pronounce .
You need to have a viable business model .
A great concept does n’t mean much if it is n’t viable .
Do n’t just jump on the bandwagon .
We have enough me - too companies .
Know your audience and pay attention to marketing .
Free is good but not always the best option .
Make sure the people are ready for your service .
If it is too revolutionary , i.e. ahead of its time , it may not succeed .
Make sure the need you are addressing is sufficiently large .

With May 15th approaching , webcasters are worried about being driven out of business by the new rates recently reaffirmed by the Copyright Royalty Board that would go affect on that day .
A site called SaveNetRadio was launched to allow people to sign a petition ( lame ) and contact their representatives in Congress ( nice ) .
The latter approach may have worked .
Representatives Jay Inslee ( D - WA , pictured to the right ) and Donald Manzullo ( R - IL , pictured below the fold ) introduced a bill today called " The Internet Radio Equality Act , " which would reverse the CRB 's ruling .
According to SaveNetRadio , here 's how the bill would work :
" The Internet Radio Equality Act would vacate the CRB ’sdecision and set a 2006 - 2010 royalty rate at the same level currentlypaid by satellite radio services ( 7.5 % of revenue . )
The bill wouldalso change the royalty rate - setting standard used in royaltyarbitrations , so that the standards applying to webcasters would alignwith the standard that applies to satellite radio royaltyarbitrations ... "
" The bill would also re-set the royalty rules fornoncommercial radio such as NPR stations that offer Internet radio music . "
Jonathan Potter , executive director of DiMA sounded optimistic that the bill would go through before May 15th and save online radio from being destroyed by the CRB 's earlier decision :
" This bill may be Internet radio ’s last best hope .
The Internet Radio Equality
Act sets a new standard for setting royalty rates that will level the playing field for Internet radio , avoid unfair bankruptcies that eliminate royalties currently being paid to recording artists and record companies , and removes the unfair advantage enjoyed by our competitors in the satellite radio community ...
" We are hopeful that Congress will move forward quickly to enact this groundbreaking legislation – and offer a lifeline to the industry . "
I hope so too .
As much fun as it is to point fingers and accuse SoundExchange of trying to kill internet radio , nobody will be laughing about this on May 15th if the rates stand .

NYT : Frank Rich on ' Donald Rumsfeld 's dance with the Nazis ' RAW STORY
Published : Saturday September 2 , 2006 Print This Email This New York Times columnist Frank Rich slams " Donald Rumsfeld 's dance with the Nazis " in a recent speech as particularly " brazen " coming from a Defense Secretary who was once photographed shaking hands with Saddam Hussein .
" Last week the man who gave us ' stuff happens ' and ' you go to war with the Army you have ' outdid himself , " Rich writes .
" In an instantly infamous address to the American Legion , he likened critics of the Iraq debacle to those who ' ridiculed or ignored ' the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s and tried to appease Hitler . "
" Such Americans , he said , suffer from a ' moral or intellectual confusion ' and fail to recognize the ' new type of fascism ' represented by terrorists , " Rich continues .
" Presumably he was not only describing the usual array of ' Defeatocrats ' but also the first President Bush , who had already been implicitly tarred as an appeaser by Tony Snow last month for failing to knock out Saddam in 1991 . "
Excerpts from Rich 's column : # ... what made Rumsfeld 's performance special was the preview it offered of the ambitious propaganda campaign planned between now and Election Day .
An on - the - ropes White House plans to stop at nothing when rewriting its record of defeat ( not to be confused with defeatism ) in a war that has now lasted longer than America 's fight against the actual Nazis in World War II .
Here 's how brazen Rumsfeld was when he invoked Hitler 's appeasers to score his cheap points : Since Hitler was photographed warmly shaking Neville Chamberlain's hand at Munich in 1938 , the only image that comes close to matching it in epochal obsequiousness is the December 1983 photograph of Rumsfeld himself in Baghdad , warmly shaking the hand of Saddam Hussein in full fascist regalia .
Is the defense secretary so self - deluded that he thought no one would remember a picture so easily Googled on the Web ?
Or worse , is he just too shameless to care ?
... Well before Rumsfeld 's trip , Amnesty International had reported the dictator 's use of torture -- " beating , burning , sexual abuse and the infliction of electric shocks " -- on hundreds of political prisoners .
Dozens more had been summarily executed or had " disappeared . "
American intelligence agencies knew that Saddam had used chemical weapons to gas both Iraqi Kurds and Iranians .
According to declassified State Department memos detailing Rumsfeld 's Baghdad meetings , the American visitor never raised the subject of these crimes with his host ...

The purpose of government is to allow those who run it to plunder those who do n’t .
As the great H.L. Mencken sagely observed , " [ I ] f experience teaches us anything at all it teaches us this : that a good politician , under democracy , is quite as unthinkable as an honest burglar .
His very existence , indeed , is a standing subversion of the public good in every rational sense .
He is not one who serves the common weal ; he is simply one who preys upon the commonwealth " ( from " The Politician " in Prejudices : A Selection , edited by James T. Farrell ) .
Not that it ’s necessary to document this ancient truth , but the November issue of Washingtonian magazine provides spectacular proof of it in the form of a cover story entitled " Washington in the Money : How Washington Got Really Rich — and How It ’s Changing Us . "
" In today ’s Washington " making money , " and lots of it " is " a virtual certainty " for " some people , " says the company town ’s magazine .
Exhibit A is former Republican Congressman Billy Tauzin of Louisiana .
After serving as one of Newt Gingrich ’s lieutenants , Tauzin " cashed out " by using his know - how of who to bribe and how by becoming a pharmaceutical industry lobbyist at $ 2.3 million a year .
In a hilarious understatement , the Washingtonian soberly announces that " jobs with the federal government have paid relatively well " for a long , long time .
Yes , but " in recent years , big money wealth has become so commonplace " in Washington that " it ’s no longer special . "
There are more than 55,000 homes in the D.C. area , for example , that are worth more than $ 1 million , including Republican Party honcho Senator Bill Frist ’s $ 20 million mansion that is featured in the article .
It pays to be a " public servant . "
Average house prices in much of " sleepy " Howard County , Maryland , near D.C. , are in the $ 900,000 range .
All of this wealth is generated by what economists call " rent seeking . "
Plunder seeking is a better term .
Among the administrators / perpetrators of Washington ’s gargantuan wealth redistribution machine are 183,900 " everyday millionaires " whose net worth is between $ 2 million and $ 10 million ; 24,887 " Rich But Do n’t Know It " types who are worth between ten and fifty million ; 7,200 " really rich " who are worth between a hundred and five - hundred million annually ; and about 500 " tycoon rich " lobbyists , lawyers and rent seekers whose net worth is nearing a billion .
" How did Washington get so rich ? , the Washingtonian innocently asks .
Well , " federal spending continues to set new records , with Washington getting a greater share of the new dollars . "
Between 1980 and today , the government ’s spending in Washington has escalated from $ 4 billion to $ 52 billion .
" This gusher of government money is the chief catalyst for Washington ’s increasing prosperity . "
Aha !
Mystery solved !
The " good life " that is led by our rulers in Washington is quite pricey .
The average " A - list " Washingtonian rent seeker spends about $ 90,000 a year on mortgage payments ; over $ 24,000 on car payments ; $ 50,000 on private - school tuition ; $ 47,000 for a full - time , live - in nanny ; and about $ 32,000 on a week ’s vacation in Aspen and two weeks in the summer on Nantucket Island .
Many Washington area neighborhoods are described by the magazine as " streets of gold , " where " houses go for anywhere from $ 3 million for a simple McMansion to $ 13 million for a 20,000 square - foot estate .
" Senator - turned lobbyist " Don Nickles lives in one such estate , as does " former congressman " and now lobbyist Dave McCurdy .
Because there are so many more mega-millionaire lobbyists than there were say , thirty years ago , all of this wealth derived from plunder makes everything " more democratic , " says the Washingtonian .
Ah , there ’s that magic word .
If it ’s done it the name of our national religion , democracy , then it must be fine and good .
Not all plunderers live in the D.C. area , of course .
Economists Richard Vedder and Lowell Galloway once documented that there is a substantial ( 20 — 40 percent ) " income premium " in every state capitol compared to the average income in the rest of the state .
As Americans celebrated their democracy during the recent elections , which will not change how their government is run in any significant way , they proved once again that we have become a nation of chumps and suckers .

On February 17th and 18th , Impeach for Peace ( IfP ) co-sponsored the National Impeachment Summit in New York City .
I ( Jodin Morey ) joined prominent figures in the movement ( Laura Flanders , Ramsey Clark , Cindy Sheehan , etc. ) and representatives from various organizations ( World Ca n’t Wait , After Downing Street , Code Pink , PDA , the Green Party , National Lawyers Guild , 911 Truth , etc. ) to discuss impeachment .
There were many workshops offered during the summit , some simultaneously , so I was not able to attend all of them .
I have grouped them into three categories : reasons for impeachment , strategies for impeachment , and post - impeachment plans .
Since everyone reading this is well aware of the reasons for impeachment ( http://impeachforpeace.org/evidence), I wo n’t belabor that point .
The most valuable results from the summit came from the discussions on strategy .
The session covering the last category , post - impeachment , I found to be unproductive .
Here are some important strategies that were presented by representatives of the various organizations , including the 6 projects that the summit organizers agreed to pursue together .
WCW brought to the discussion the importance of mass public mobilization , which will pressure our media and congress people to consider impeachment ( video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDb9soswDCo).
Ramsey Clark , former U.S. Attorney General and long - time activist , brought to the summit a wealth of knowledge and a useful historical perspective ( video of Clark ’s speech : http://impeachforpeace.org/impeach_bush_blog/?p=251).
Yesterday we revealed Kate Moss is the cover girl for issue # 149 of Dazed and Confused , today the British magazine has followed up by putting several photos from the shoot online .
In this sneak peek into Kate ’s home , the style icon shows off the main staples of her collection for Topshop inspired by her eclectic wardrobe ; featuring in Dazed her skinny jeans , jersey vests , masculine tailoring and vintage inspired floral dresses .
Kate ’s skinny jeans are appropriately named ‘ Chrissie ’ after one of her rock idols Chrissie Hynde and feature an embroidered K on the pocket .
Some styles even introduce specifically placed embroidered swallows and hearts reflecting Kate ’s tattoos for the died hard fans out there .
Hopefully they ’ll also tell us where Kate bought the coolest Union Flag pillows we ’ve ever seen ;
Head over to Dazed Digital for more photos from the shoot .
SAN FRANCISCO –
It was perhaps inevitable that someone would compare President Bush 's extrajudicial wiretapping operations to Richard Nixon 's 1970s - era surveillance of journalists and political enemies .
Both were carried out by Republican presidents ; both bypassed the courts ; both relied on the cooperation of U.S. telecommunications companies .
But there 's some irony in the fact that it was AT&T to first make the comparison in a federal courtroom here , while defending itself from charges of complicity in Bush 's warrantless spying .
Company attorney Bradford Berenson cited the case of The New York Times reporter Hedrick Smith , who'd been illegally wiretapped by Nixon 's Plumbers as part of an investigation into White House leaks .
In 1979 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Smith could n't sue Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company – then part of AT&T 's Bell System – for installing the wiretaps at the Plumbers ' behest .
The Nixon Defense was one of several arguments offered Friday by AT&T and the Justice Department in their bid to win summary dismissal of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's class - action lawsuit .
The suit accuses the company of providing the National Security Agency with access to customer and non-customer internet traffic passing through AT&T 's systems , without a warrant .
( Disclosure : Wired News has filed a motion to intervene in the case asking the court to make public evidence filed under seal of AT&T 's alleged wiretapping activities . )
Without confirming the allegations , AT&T said if it is cooperating with the NSA , it can't be held responsible , because – as in the Nixon case – it's serving as a " passive instrument or passive agent of the government , " said Berenson .
" AT&T could refuse , could it not , to provide access to its facilities ? " countered U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker .
Berenson replied that AT&T would refuse any clearly illegal request , and a courtroom overflowing with EFF supporters broke into murmured , sardonic laughter .
In the back , late - coming observers unable to win a seat pressed their faces against the windows of the courtroom door .
The government 's surveillance activities of the 1970s were an ever - present ghost in the nearly three - hour - long hearing Friday , in a case that 's emerging as a crucial challenge of the law passed in response to Watergate - era abuses .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA , requires the government to obtain a court order before performing electronic surveillance in national security cases , except for surveillance targeting only foreign nationals or for emergency wiretaps lasting no longer than 72 hours .
A related law allows private parties to sue a telecommunications company for cooperating in government surveillance that does n't meet FISA 's requirements or the demands of criminal wiretap laws .
But that law grants companies immunity if the U.S. attorney general first presents them with a letter certifying that the surveillance is legal .
AT&T wo n't confirm or deny that it received such a letter .
But Walker , who 's privy to the government 's classified evidence in the case , spent some time posing questions about how a letter would affect the litigation 's outcome .
EFF attorney Kevin Bankston argued that AT&T has a duty to know the law , and would n't be protected by a written request to assist in an illegal surveillance operation .
" That piece of paper could not authorize the conduct that we allege here , " Bankston said .
The government argued that the existence or nonexistence of a letter from the attorney general addressed to AT&T is one of the many secrets that cannot be disclosed without causing grave damage to the United States .
The Justice Department asked that the entire case be dismissed on national security grounds under the rarely used " state - secrets privilege . "
Never passed by Congress , the state - secrets privilege has its roots in English common law and was cemented into American jurisprudence by a landmark 1953 Supreme Court case titled U.S. v. Reynolds .
In Reynolds , the widows of three men who died in a mysterious Air Force crash sued the government , and U.S. officials quashed the lawsuit by claiming that they could n't release any information about the accident without endangering national security .
The Supreme Court upheld the claim , establishing a legal precedent that today allows the executive branch to block the release of information in any civil suit – even if the government is n't the one being sued .
" It is an area of the law where the degree of deference from the court to the executive is at its highest , " said Justice Department attorney Peter Keisler , who argued Friday that the case must be dismissed because its basic allegations can't be addressed without harming national security .
Acknowledging or disavowing any cooperation between the NSA and a particular telecommunications company , for example , would help terrorists communicate securely .
" What the terrorist does when he decides to communicate ... is balance the risk that a particular communication will be intercepted against the operational inefficiencies " of finding another way to talk , said Keisler .
Identifying a company as cooperating with the government would take some of the guesswork out of that assessment , and could even subject the company to terrorist reprisals .
But Walker showed some signs that he was taking a more nuanced look at the state - secrets privilege , and might consider making some information – such as the existence or nonexistence of the attorney general 's letter – available for use in the case .
" The state - secret privilege is not unlimited , " Walker said .
Walker asked if the government would oppose the court retaining an expert to help sift through the classified evidence and evaluate its sensitivity ; Keisler argued that such an analysis would n't show proper deference to the executive branch , and suggested it might prove problematic to grant such an expert the necessary security clearance .
For its part , EFF argued that the case can go forward without access to any government documents or testimony , thanks to the written statement and papers provided by former AT&T technician Mark Klein , which purports to show AT&T establishing a secure room in its San Francisco switching center to transmit intercepted internet traffic to the NSA .
EFF technical consultant J. Scott Marcus , a former FCC technology adviser , performed an analysis of the documents .
Marcus concluded that AT&T 's taps suck down about 10 percent of all U.S. internet traffic .
The operation can pick up traffic transiting AT&T 's network on its way somewhere else , so even non-AT&T customers are intercepted , he wrote .
" AT&T has constructed an extensive – and expensive – collection of infrastructure that collectively has all the capability necessary to conduct large - scale covert gathering of ( internet protocol ) - based communications information , not only for communications to overseas locations , but for purely domestic communications as well , " Marcus wrote .
The government dismissed Klein's and Marcus ' statements as " hearsay and speculation " Friday .
" They do n't know as much as they think they know , " said Keisler .
AT&T agreed .
" Pieces of cable go into a room , " said company attorney Bruce Ericson .
" That 's as far as they take us . "
There were few clues to where the judge was leaning Friday , but as the hearing drew to a close , he asked both sides how they would want to proceed should he deny the government 's motion to dismiss – suggesting he 's considering allowing some portion of EFF 's case to proceed .
Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse , whistle - blower Klein said the evidence he provided was sufficient to make the case , without exposing any national security secrets .
AT&T , he said , helped with " massive interception , without warrant , of everyone 's information . "

Sometime tonight , voting among the engineers charged with developing the IEEE 's 802.11n
Wi -Fi standard will end , and smart money says the results -- to be announced within days -- will be a second draft of the superfast standard .
For those who do n't follow the ins and outs of wireless networking , the 802.11n standard promises theoretical maximum speeds of up to 300 megabits per second , compared to 54 mbps for its predecessor , 802.11g , and 11 mbps for the original 802.11 b standard .
Of course , real - world throughput is invariably a lot slower , especially if great distances and data encryption are involved .
In our tests last fall of the first Wi-Fi gear based on the initial draft of the 802.11n standard , though , we saw speeds approaching those of ethernet connections at close range .
If , as widely expected , the IEEE 802.11n committee does approve the latest version ( submitted as draft 1.10 ) as draft 2 , it will be good news for people who had either already invested in Wi-fi products based on the initial draft of 802.11n or have been holding off on buying draft -n products in anticipation of more stable and compatible products .
While final publication of the completed standard is still a long way off ( thank complicated IEEE procedures for that ) , vendors say the new draft finally settles issues that have made for iffy interoperability and significant performance differences between products based on the original draft -n chips from different vendors .
More importantly , major Wi -Fi chip vendors say the first draft - n products , which began shipping last spring , will be firmware - upgradable to compliance with draft 2 .
This means owners of existing Wi-Fi equipment should begin checking the vendor 's
Web site for free draft 2 firmware updates , which should begin appearing by early spring .
Last , but not least , agreement on draft 2 puts the Wi-Fi Alliance on track to start compatibility testing for products based on draft 2 in late spring or early summer .
The Alliance , the trade group that for years has performed similar testing for products based on various 802.11 specs ( including 802.11 b , g , and a ) , is working on a logo program to help Wi -Fi buyers identify which draft - 2 802.11n products have been certified interoperable with other draft - 2 products .
What 's New in Draft 2 ?
So what 's new with the latest draft , which follows a rocky start for products based on the initial draft ?
( In our October review of the first 802.11n gear , PC World recommended holding off on purchases because of uncertainty over the upgrade path and unstable performance . )
The ability to upgrade existing draft - n products to draft 2 is obviously huge for those who took a chance on these early routers and PC cards ( most vendors did not guarantee such firmware upgradability ) .
Compatibility improvements should also be significant : the new spec settles once and for all something called " Information Elements , " which allows devices based on draft - n chips from different vendors to recognize each other as birds of a feather .
In our initial tests , products from different vendors could only interoperate at 802.11g speeds for which they had been Wi -Fi Alliance certified .
Major chip vendors Atheros and Broadcom say they'd been working together on this problem and had achieved 802.11n - speed interoperability for their products subsequent to our testing last summer , but all products ( regardless of vendor ) that the Wi-Fi Alliance certifies for Draft 2 of 802.11n should work together at top speed .
Science can be a little scary .
Its potential to transform life itself has led to predictions that we might re-write our own genetic make - up or merge our minds with machines .
But 2007 will show that it is not these sci- fi possibilities that are of immediate concern .
Real possibilities of changing our human nature are creeping up from a less obvious direction .
More and more drugs developed to treat disease are turning out also to offer the potential to “ enhance ” the cognitive powers of healthy people , and to push human life expectancy much further , perhaps to 115 years and beyond .
The potential to alter our nature and lifespans elicits strong reactions .
The transhumanists — a loose coalition of scientists , technologists and thinkers who seek opportunities to enhance the human condition — see change as desirable .
Human nature , says Nick Bostrom , an Oxford University philosopher and advocate of transhumanism , is “ a work in progress , a half - baked beginning that we can learn to remould in desirable ways …we shall eventually manage to become posthuman , beings with vastly greater capacities than present human beings have . ”
Others argue that we will never have sufficient wisdom to make ourselves more than we are .
Francis Fukuyama of Johns Hopkins University describes transhumanism as one of “ the world 's most dangerous ideas ” .
But whatever you may think , the possibilities for changing your nature by direct biochemical intervention are arriving now .
There is no greater goal for transhumanism than the conquest of death .
Some of the most controversial advocates of technological improvements to humans , including Ray Kurzweil , an American inventor and author , and Aubrey de Grey , a gerontologist and chairman of the Methuselah Foundation , argue optimistically that immortality may become achievable for people who are alive today .
But even without the yet - to - be- invented technologies that they say will make this possible , there are good reasons why we can hope to live a lot longer .
Transhumanists question the conventional wisdom that the human lifespan is coming to a natural limit .
History shows that every limit announced by experts is quickly overturned .
Back in 1928 , an American demographer , Louis Dublin , calculated that the upper limit on average life expectancy would be 64.8 years , a daring figure at the time , with American life expectancy then just 57 years .
But now his figure looks timid , given that life expectancy for women in Okinawa , Japan , has passed 85.3 years , 20 years more than Dublin claimed possible .
Also looking timid are the scientists who later predicted that life expectancy would nowhere pass 78 years ( in 1952 ) , 79 years ( 1980 ) and 82.5 years ( 1984 ) .
Can this steady rise in life expectancy be replaced with a giant leap ?
Many transhumanists think so .
We already know that cutting back severely on calories in the diet can give life expectancy a remarkable boost — between 30 % and 50 % — in a range of animals .
Now evidence is emerging not only that this approach may work in humans but also that drugs may provide the benefits of calorie restriction without the pains of the diet .
Life - extension enthusiasts who have been eating just 1,800 calories a day for an average of six years ( a healthy Western diet averages 2,700 calories a day ) do indeed show signs that their bodily ageing is slowing .
Eating far fewer calories does not simply slow metabolism , nor do the advantages come just from being thin , as aggressive calorie - burning exercise does not confer the same benefits .
Rather , calorie restriction appears to trigger natural defences designed to boost the chances of survival during periods of food scarcity .
As many of those defensive responses are co-ordinated by a set of genes called sirtuins , there is a chance that drugs can be used to trigger their action directly , without the diet .
Chemicals that affect sirtuin activity have been found in plants and one , resveratrol , extends lifespan in test animals .
In one species of fish , maximum lifespan increased by almost 60 % .
Humans will be pleased to know that resveratrol occurs naturally in red wine
Efforts to develop sirtuin - targeting drugs and test them for clinical safety are under way , but the companies working on them stress a goal of activating “ health - promoting genes ” , rather than life - extension itself .
That is just too controversial .
The same is true of other drugs that may enhance human capabilities .
Modafinil provides an interesting example .
The drug was developed to treat narcolepsy and sleep problems but is a hit with healthy people who want to improve their concentration and skip sleep .
Modafinil users dramatically improve their ability to solve classic tests of planning ability , like the Tower of London task where sets of coloured discs on pegs have to be moved from one pattern to another in the fewest moves .
More than 40 other cognitive enhancement drugs are under study around the world .
Numerous drugs are also in development that may enhance or alter memory .
In the brain , memories are coded in patterns of links between nerve cells and are laid down in two stages : the first when the strength of signals between cells is temporarily enhanced and the second when memory is consolidated through the synthesis of new proteins .
Ampakine drugs target the first stage , boosting excitatory communication between nerve cells , as well as stimulating brain growth .
Results are encouraging , at least for middle - aged rats .
Recently scientists found that the drug turned back the clock for a key measure of decline in memory function .
Another drug , propranolol , has the quite different aim of weakening troubling memories .
Memories are etched with particular strength in stressful situations , including wars , car accidents and rapes .
Later these memories can return as a painful part of post - traumatic stress disorder .
Propranolol blocks the impact of stress hormones on memory formation and , if taken very soon after the trauma , turns down the intensity of recall .
More surprising is a new drug called ZIP ( Zeta Inhibitor Peptide ) that makes rats forget everything they learnt recently , without affecting their learning ability .
ZIP has not been tested in humans but has the potential to wipe out all new memories .
In one species of fish , maximum lifespan increased by almost 60 %
Transhumanists have been quick to debate where such drugs might lead : not only might they lessen stress disorders , but they could also remove the feeling of guilt by lessening memories of wrongdoing , or dull the pains of love lost .
Such possibilities highlight the problems of playing with human nature .
We may be more efficient , but without the feelings of others around us .
That leaves us with the great unresolved debate in transhumanism : whether , if we choose to “ enhance ” ourselves , we can say we are the same person afterwards , and whether that matters .
But one thing is certain : whatever ailment drugs may be developed to treat , if they can also be used to provide someone with a competitive advantage , or prolong life , people will take them .

Forth Versus C
2004 Apr 04
Some IAQs ( Infrequently Asked Questions ) about Forth and C .
Q. What is Forth ?
A. Forth is a computer programming language which has a return stack , an explicit parameter stack and a dictionary .
It features an incremental compiler , an interpreter and a very fast edit - compile - test cycle .
Forth is extensible .
Q. What is C ?
A. C is a computer language which has a single , implicit stack .
It features a “ tool set ” that includes a batch - mode pre-processor , compiler , linker and makefile program .
It also features a binary ( pre-compiled ) distribution system using libraries and header files .
C is not extensible .
Q. Why is Forth not as widely used as C ?
A. C is much better suited to most business environments .
Q. So why use Forth ?
A. Because it is possible to write better programs in Forth than in C .
Q. Could you define “ better ” in this context ?
A. Easier to read and maintain , fewer bugs , smaller , faster development .
Q . So why does n’t everyone use Forth ?
A. Because it is also possible to write worse programs in Forth than in C .
Q. Perhaps you should also define “ worse ” …
A. Impossible to read and maintain , more bugs , bigger , longer development .
Q. Why is this ?
A. Because Forth does not impose any restrictions on what you do or how you do it .
However large your C program gets the source for it will still be C. Since Forth is extensible , you can extend the language so that part of your program can be written in a superset of Forth , specifically tailored to the application .
Q. Does n’t this mean that you have to learn what is essentially a new language for every application ?
A. Yes .
Q . And this does n’t worry you ?
A . If the “ new language ” maps exactly onto the problem domain , what you are learning about is the problem , and then describing the solution becomes trivial .
Q. What about if the “ new language ” does not map to the problem domain ?
A . You are in big trouble !
The worst programs are those where an entirely new language is created independently of the problem , and then the problem is solved using this new language .
You then really do have to learn a new language and­ the problem domain .
This is actually much worse than programming in C , where at least you already know the language .
Q. How do you make sure that your Forth programs map to the problem domain ?
A. Feedback .
Ask the people who understand the problem domain if the program is right .
Non-programmers can spot deviations from reality better than programmers , who usually immerse themselves in too much detail .
Q . But how can a non-programmer even read a program , let alone tell whether it is right ?
A. Forth syntax can be learnt in an hour or two .
If the top level of the program cannot be read and understood by someone who understands the problem domain , it is wrong and you should change it .
Q . How much faster can you develop programs in Forth compared to C ?
A . This depends on the type of application and what is already available .
Almost all programs are not so much written as “ ported ” from similar programs .
It is very unusual to see the same application written in both Forth and C , so comparison of development times must be anecdotal .
For embedded , non-multitasking applications I would put the ratio of Forth : C development times at around 1:2 to 1:3 .
For embedded multitasking applications at between 1:4 to 1:6 , and for PC based Windows applications about 1:4 .
Others have suggested figures of 1:10 or even higher .
I think 1 : pi is about right .
Q . You are claiming that you can finish a program three times more quickly in Forth than C .
How can this be true ?
A . The difference is not only in the language syntax - you can convert Forth code into C and back relatively easily .
It is possible to develop code in a C - like way in Forth , but it is not possible to develop code in a Forth - like way using the C tool set .
Q . What is it about the C tool set that stops you programming in a Forth - like way ?
A1 . The C language and tool set operate in a batch mode .
The time taken to edit source , build and download is not usually less than a number of seconds .
Because Forth compiles incrementally and has an interpreter and explicit stack , changes can be tested immediately .
The turn - round speed is actually more important than most people realise .
A2 .
The lack of an interpreter in C means that code must be tested using “ printf ” , a source level ICE / debugger or a special test harness or Command Line Interpreter .
All of these techniques add to the complexity of the system .
Forth has an interpreter , and this combined with the explicit stack means that you can enter arguments and test any function at any time .
A3 . Forth is extensible , so you can create a superset of Forth which describes your problem domain exactly .
Q. I have seen versions of Forth written in C .
Does n’t this mean that you can get all of the advantages of Forth , but written in C ?
A. No .
The real power of Forth lies in the synergy of the entire system .
You can certainly gain an interpreter , but at the expense of a duplicate set of tools , two file formats , and two languages to learn before you even start on the application .
Q. Does Forth have any known weaknesses ?
A. Yes .
There is no support within the Forth language for version control .
C provides pre-compiled libraries and header files which allow vendors to supply their code in a form that cannot be modified by the customer .
This is a simple but effective version control system .
Many Forths are supplied with a similar binary module system but this is an extension to the language .
Q. Does Forth have any perceived weaknesses ?
A1 . Yes .
Because Forth is so simple , many people have written their own .
In fact it is almost mandatory that computer science students spend an afternoon writing a Forth , just to see how easy it is .
Not surprisingly , not all Forths are created equal .
The finely honed products available from Forth , Inc. , MPE Ltd and other commercial vendors are vastly better than most of the free Forths available on the WWW .
Specifically , with advances in native compiler technology , Forth is no longer slow .
A2 . Forth is sometimes accused of being cryptic or “ read only ” code .
This is because there is a lot of cryptic , “ read only ” code written in Forth .
If you are going to use Forth , you must control its use , and ensure that your code is easy to read .
This is a project management issue .
A3 . Forth uses “ Reverse Polish ” notation .
This is because the problem domain that the Forth system is addressing is “ how to tell the computer what to do ” .
The simplest way to solve this problem is to give the computer its instructions in the order that it needs them .
The code “ 1 2 + “ tells the computer to put a 1 on the stack , put a 2 on the stack and add them .
The fact that the rest of the world ( HP calculators excepted ) write “ 1 + 2 ” is because this shows the operator and its arguments in a graphical way , as written on a chalkboard .
It is easy to write a Forth parser that converts “ 1 + 2 ” into “ 1 2 + ” , but this would put a boundary onto the Forth system that would make further extensions to the language much more difficult .
Reverse Polish is seen as antiquated , and the fact that the computer has not even been taught to understand common usage is interpreted as a major weakness .
In fact , it is just that Forth is not attempting to solve an entirely different problem .
A4 . Forth is perceived as a “ dead ” language .
This is because it is not being championed by big companies , nor is it taught as the de facto standard in most computer science courses .
In fact Forth is alive and well in many low - profile niche markets , usually where resources are limited , software must be reliable or there is a need for an interpreted “ scripting language ” .
One limited resource is often money - short development times mean reduced costs .
Smart cards and space environments are examples of restricted hardware where Forth flourishes .
Q. Why has Forth been described as “ a polarising language ” ?
A1 . People either love Forth or hate it .
It is easy not to like Forth .
Programmers do n’t like Forth because it is not fashionable ( at the time of writing ) and does not look good on a CV .
Project managers do n’t like Forth because they ca n’t get Forth programmers easily , and the quality of code depends critically on the programmer .
University lecturers do n’t like it because there is not enough that can be taught about Forth that can be examined .
Software vendors do n’t like Forth because it removes the complexity they need to survive .
Users do n’t like Forth because they have never heard of it .
A2 . People either love Forth or hate it .
It is easy to like Forth .
Programmers like Forth because its fun – you remove the tedious 66 % of the job .
Project managers like Forth because they can get the project finished on time , with fewer , easier - to - find bugs .
University lecturers like Forth because they can teach their students about the art of programming and be involved in the cutting edge of computer science .
Software vendors like Forth because they get involved with their customers to help them solve their problems and refine their products at the same time .
Users like Forth because it makes programs that work .
Q. So you like Forth then ?
A. Yes .
Q. What about C ?
A. I have nothing against C – it is a language specifically tailored to the problem domain of “ writing C based operating systems ” .
Unix / Linux and DOS / Windows are written in C and are immensely successful .
“ If your only tool is a hammer , all problems become nails ” .
For those applications that are not operating systems , Forth is probably a better language to use than C .
Q. Is that it ?
A. Yes !

Until Alberto Gonzalez testifies next week , the main area of interest in the ongoing attorney general scandal is the White House ’s seemingly odd fixation with “ voter fraud . ”
At least two of the U.S. attorneys at the heart of the scandal were removed for failing , in the estimation of Bush officials , to adequately pursue and prosecute voter fraud .
The trouble is , there does n’t seem to be much fraud to prosecute .
Today ’s New York Times reports that despite a five - year - old crackdown , the Justice Department has turned up “ virtually no evidence ” that organized fraud exists .
The few people who have been convicted of voter fraud , the piece makes clear , are mostly confused felons and immigrants .
And yet the White House , again per the Times , was anxious enough about the issue that it obscured the conclusions of a federal panel that found little evidence of fraud — the panel report ’s conclusion was changed to allow for the ( apparently baseless ) possibility that rampant voter fraud is a real problem .
What gives ?
Allowing for the possibility that someone , somewhere in the White House genuinely believes voter fraud is a problem , I think a much likelier explanation is that administration officials — and one official in particular , Karl Rove — see the issue of voter fraud as a handy political weapon at election time .
Voicing concerns about fraud often paves the way for intimidation tactics like poll watching that depress turnout , especially among minorities and less educated voters who tend to vote Democratic .
NASA is funding a study to see if it might be possible touse asteroids traveling between the orbits of Earth and Mars to shelterspacecraft from radiation .
The study is the brainchild of Daniella Della - Giustina , engineering physics undergrad from the University of Arizona - and maybe science fiction writer Arthur C.Clarke .
Della -Giustina is one of five people to receive NASA 'sAdvanced Concepts Student Fellows Prize this year .
Her project is titled " The Martian Bus Schedule : An Innovative Technique for Protecting Humanson a Journey to Mars . "
She will investigate two possibilities .
The first involvesspacecraft actually hitching a ride on asteroids that cross the orbits of bothEarth and Mars ; astronauts could mine various resources from the asteroidduring their journey .
The second possibility is that the asteroid could be used asa " sunshade . "
Astronauts would travel in the shadow of the meteor foras long as possible ; astronauts could visit the asteroid on short space walks .

Which brings us to ArthurC.
Clarke .
His short story Summertime on Icarus was published in1960 ; it describes a method for getting a research ship closer to the sun thanever before using a comet :
Everything had been carefully planned , years in advance , aspart of the International Astrophysical Decade .
Here was a unique opportunityfor a research ship to get within a mere seventeen million miles of the sun , protected from it 's fury by a two - mile - thick shield of rock and iron .
In the shadowof Icarus , the ship could ride safely round the central fire which warmed allthe planets , and upon which the existence of all life depended .
This is not the first time NASA has investigated ideas forradiation shielding proposed by science fiction writers ; see NASA 'sNew Radiation Shielding First Proposed By John W. Campbell In 1936 .

Police officers raided a home in Lancashire on Monday night and uncovered a huge cache of chemicals used to make explosives .
Officers say it is the largest haul of such chemicals ever found in this country .
One man has already appeared in front of Burnley magistrates charged under the Explosives Substances Act 1883 .
Another man has also been charged after a raid on his house uncovered rocket launcher and a nuclear biological suit .
You'd have thought this would be national front page news , would n't you ?
After all the hype , at last we have solid evidence of terrorists attempting to perpetrate a murderous outrage on the population - prosecutors say the pair had " some kind of master plan " .
Except , of course , that the men charged are not Asian Islamists , but white fascists .
Robert Cottage , who has been charged for the explosives haul , stood for the BNP in Colne at the last elections .

No , size does not matter , not in media , not anymore .
I know that ’s counterintuitive and counter everything we ’ve assumed about mass media .
But today what matters is reaching the right people by the right means .
That has always been the case .
Only now , thanks to connected , collaborative media , it ’s finally possible .
I ’ll pull together a lot of links around this topic below .
But most of them are still trying to measure mass : the new pageview , the
new audience count , the new click .
I say the change we ’re facing is much bigger than just the obsolescence of the pageview , much more fundamental : Size does n’t matter .
Relevance , credibility , and attraction do .
Instead of measuring quantity , we have to measure quality .
And only when we do that will the true value of these new media be unlocked for everyone .
Some of the discussion that is boiling up out there :
* The end of the pageview : Steve Rubel has been doing a good job hammering on the anti-meme that the pageview is over : “ The page view does not offer a suitable way to measure the next generation of web sites .
These sites will be built with Ajax , Flash and other interactive technologies that allow the user to conduct affairs all within a single web page – like Gmail or the Google Reader .
This eliminates the need to click from one page to another . ”
See , for example , Yahoo grappling with the impact of the unpage .
This is not entirely new ; it was a problem I grappled with on refreshing chat pages a decade ago .
But the phenomenon is growing in both an Ajaxed web and a Flashed video world :
What ’s a page now ?
What ’s a view ?
What ’s a viewer ?
A decade ago , I spent months on a tortuous committee of the Audit Bureau of Circulations answering just those questions .
Now , it does n’t matter , or at least , it matters less and less .
* Targeting and verification matter more than size :
When I sat in those endless ABC committee meetings , our aim was to come up with the standards against which to audit the circulation or audience — old terms — of web sites .
But that effort was eventually abandoned because advertisers did n’t care about verifying the size of a site ; only publishers cared about those bragging rights and not enough to pay for auditing them .
As it turned out , advertisers cared only about auditing their own flights of ads : ‘ Did I get what I paid for ( whether that was people or views or clicks or actions or demos or branding ) ? ’
You see , circulation mattered only when you were stuck in the same pages as all the advertisers and you all got the same audience whether that audience gave a damn about you or not .
But online , you could find ever - better ways to reach just the people you wanted or who wanted you .
Travel advertisers did n’t need to care about the circulation of NewYorkTimes.com , only about who saw its ads in the travel section .
Oh , yes , advertisers are still buying the old way , but that ’s because it ’s more convenient — albeit far less efficient — to buy us in bulk .
But the mass is gone .
Size does n’t matter .
* The widgetization of the web : Niall Kennedy called it back in July : Pages are now made up of widgets that operate like multiple pages themselves .
But this is about more than adding cool stuff to your site .
See how MySpace is built with widgets from elsewhere and how Flickr is spread via widgets .
This is a new means of distribution .
* The people are your distributors :
One day this week , seven of the top 10 viral videos — determined by links and embeds , that is , by recommendations rather than just traffic — were performances by James Brown , following his death .
( By the way , I did n’t see these videos on the most - viewed lists on YouTube ; those are the old , mass lists people still look at but they ’re pretty much meaningless ) .
This tells me that the people will distribute your stuff if given a chance ; they jumped onto word of Brown ’s death and they served relevance .
Note well that you do n’t need everyone doing this ; even as Wikipedia ’s content is made by the fabled 1 percent of its users , so can the new networks of information be driven by 1 percent of their members .
* The distributed media economy is taking over :
This last week , Google was said to surpass Yahoo as the second most visited site on the internet after Microsoft ; this comes after MySpace surpassed Yahoo in pageviews .
But the truth is that Google surpassed them all long ago , for Google is not a site ; it is a platform .
Every piece of Google — like the ads on this page — counts as another pageview , if you ’re still counting them .
This is why I keep saying that Yahoo is the last old - media company , relying on controlling content and marketing to attract an audience to see ads , but Google is the first distributed platform , no longer making the people come to it but going to the people wherever they are .
And see James Brown :
The people will take you to the people , if you ’re good and if you ’re lucky and if you let them .
Add to this the notion that advertising can be content ( the viral ad ) and that ad creative gets tangled up again with media and distribution ( being on MySpace is itself the brand statement ) and you continue to unravel all the old assumptions about the media economy ; see Scott Karp arguing that the page view will be dethroned by innovation in advertising .
And mess things up even more when you start tearing apart the methodologies of measurement .
Fred Wilson , on the board of Comscore , begins to address this .
I argue that any paneled , sampled measurement scheme will simply not work in this new world .
Full stop .
The Nielsen method of putting together a sample of people who represented the rest of us cannot work in the mass of niches , for you cannot have a sample that is ever large enough to measure the tail .
You ca n’t measure quantity .
So pageviews are obsolete already , thanks to Ajax and other unpage technologies and to the widgetization of content , funtionality , and branding : Again , what ’s a ‘ page ’ ?
Audience measurements are obsolete , at last , thanks to the fact that the former consumer is now also the creator and distributor :
What ’s an ‘ audience ’ ?
Mass measurements are dead , thank God , because we are now joyfully fragmented into the mass of niches :
Who ’s a ‘ user ’ ?
The truth is that we , the former audience , have long paid only scant attention to the old , quantitative measurements :
Box office numbers and Nielsen ratings were curiosities .
We have always measured , instead , relevance , trust , usefulness , interest , attraction , action , value .
Those are the measurements that matter , always have been , only now media must catch up to us .
And when media and marketers do , they will give us greater value and get more in return .
This is about far more than the damned pageview .

Scientists have written a message into the DNA of a living organism , a breakthrough they believe could lead to a new era of organic computers capable of healing themselves if damaged .
The researchers encoded Einstein 's most famous equation and most prolific year into the genome of one the hardiest strains of bacteria in the world , Bacillus subtilis .
The characters " E=MC ^2 1905 ! " were then read from the bacterium at a later date by analysing its genetic sequence .
In the proof - of - principle experiment , the research team showed they could write a message into the bacterium 's DNA and retrieve it .
The process is slow , taking days to complete .
But because the organisms are so hardy and are able to pass on data to future generations , they may still find a role in storing large amounts of information that do not need to be accessed quickly .
Yoshiaki Ohashi , who led the study at Keio University in Tokyo , said that bacteria have the potential to store vast quantities of data and are more resistant to the kinds of damage that could wipe modern hard drives .
" Information storage using DNA is robust for more than one hundred million years , " he said .
The researchers wrote the message by first converting it into binary .
This code was then built into artificial strands of DNA , using letters such as AG to mean 1000 and TC to mean 0111 .
The strands were then injected into the bacterium .
A difficulty is that bacteria are promiscuous when it comes to swapping DNA with other microbes .
But the team believe the mutation rates are slow enough to ensure messages are still readable , especially when the bacteria form a tough spore .
Professor Ohashi said the process would work equally well in plants , fruit and insects .
" Cockroaches are very interesting , because they have an ability to tolerate [ extreme ] environments . "
While the researchers ' main goal is to create living memories for a new breed of DNA computers that perform calculations using strands of genetic material , the technique could also be used to tag organisms for life , by inserting identification markers into their genome .
The research is published in the journal of the American Chemical Society .
In 2004 Israeli scientists used DNA to power the world 's smallest computer , a molecular computer designed to identify traces of prostate and lung cancer in blood and deliver a DNA - based treatment telling the cancerous cells to self - destruct .
Comment Dell has joined the domain name hall of shame , alongside such notables as Microsoft , the Easy Group and BAA , for its flagrantly unjustified hounding of website www.dellwebsites.com.
According to Dell 's laywers - old hands at this sort of thing - the owner of Dellwebsites is committing " an act of parasitism " and " creating a risk of confusion " between himself and the online PC vendor Dell .
It wants the domain signed over to it , at the owner 's cost .
The theory runs that as soon as someone sees or hears of www.dellwebsites.com, they immediately think " oh that lovely company that sells cheap but well - built PCs has got into web design " .
They are then overwhelmed with revulsion when they find out it 's nothing to do with Dell the PC maker .
Yes , incredible as it may seem , the name " Dell " did exist before 1984 .
You may think this was obvious since the company is named after founder Michael Dell .
If nothing else , his parents would have used the name before him .
Does Michael not realise that other families may also the same surname ?
He probably does , but tough - arse businessman that he is , he 's not afraid to screw over his own kin .
In this case that is one Paul Dell .
Paul lives in Spain and , incredibly , makes websites for a living .
Paul thought the Internet domain Dellwebsites.com was therefore a pretty good description of what he was up to online ( apparently , Dell.com had already gone ) .
But while Mr Dell ( Paul , that is ) was pleased with his purchase back in April 2001 , it now appears that he was trying to rip off Mr Dell ( Michael ) and his enormous US company .
Quite what the enormous impact Paul 's website has had on the PC giant is hard to gauge .
For the first half of this year , Dell 's revenue actually went up 20 per cent to $ 23 billion .
No mention of Paul Dell 's web design business has appeared in its financial results as having a negative impact on these sales .
Nonetheless , it 's not just about the money , it 's about the principle , is n't it ?
Which perhaps makes it hard to understand why it was that Dell backed down the last time it tried to take Dellwebsites.com off Paul Dell .
Yes , Paul Dell has been through this charade once before , in April 2002 .
Dell was still adamant that it rightly owned the domain , but when Paul Dell make it clear that he was n't prepared to cave in to pressure , the company walked away .
Why did n't it take him to a domain arbitrator or a law court , you ask ?
Most likely because it did n't stand a chance in hell of winning the case .
And so jump forward two - and - a - half years and we 're here again .
What has changed ?
Not much it seems : " You continue to use the denomination DELL WEB SITES as trade mark , company name , trade name or shop sign to designate your activities , " roars Dell 's lawyers - Lovells .
Er , yes .
" Alike you continue to use the denomination DELL WEB SITES as domain name and within the copyright notices to which the Site links . "
Well , that 's because that 's where I run my business , have n't we been here before ?
" Finally , you modified the copyright notice to ' Copyright 2004 , Paul Dell , Dell Web Sites ' in order to include your first name . "
That 's it !
They 've got Paul Dell bang to right because - get this - he included his first name as a copyright notice on his own website .
This would be funny were it not so worrying for the individuals and small businesses that find themselves at the end of such unwarranted demands by powerful legal firms and international businesses .
It shows how much there is still to be done on pulling the Internet into the world 's legal systems when big companies continue to issue threatening letters with impunity .
Who can a legitimate domain owner turn to when they are hounded by a huge corporation ?
What mechanism exists to punish those companies guilty of trying to steal online property through misrepresentation ?
As far as we can see , nothing .
Except of course public exposure and embarrassment .
Mike Rowe got expenses , a visit to the Microsoft campus , an X - box and other assorted goodies when the fact that Microsoft was threatening him over the domain www.MikeRoweSoft.com started appearing in the press .
It made a good story , he was a kid and the phonetics were so good that it was irrestible .
But it did n't stop Microsoft for one second .
It continued to pursue , and eventually beat Mike Rushton and his " Mikerosoft.net " domain .
It had no rights to that either .
It was only when Microsoft went for " mocosoft.com " that a WIPO arbitrator finally revealed where the limits lay in the great domain name grab .
On this side of the Atlantic , Stelios Haji -Iannou of Easy Group has embarked on a similar crusade , claiming , incredibly , that any domain that begins with the word " easy " ( or even , " easi " ) is his by right .
It is simply ludicrous , but when faced with a huge company and aggressive lawyers , who can blame an individual for handing over their domain rather than deal with the pressure ?
Again , Easy Group knows that it has no rights as recognised by either the law courts of the domain arbitrators but that does n't stop it from claiming it does in threatening legal letters .
And if a company really does want that domain , it is prepared to go further than that .
In the case of Gatwick.com , BAA appeared to repeat the iron - fist tactics it had earlier applied to win Baa.com , sparking a number of accusations from the lawyer hired by Gatwick .
com 's owner that the company had knowingly and purposefully lied and misrepresented itself to the domain arbitrator .
Dellwebsites.com is just the latest in a long line of unfair disputes and the situation will continue so long as big companies hold sway over the Internet and no one institutes a system of penalties for abusive behaviour .
The domain arbitrators are n't going to introduce it because big companies are their bread and butter .
The registry owners - VeriSign and the like - virtually define themselves by their refusal to accept any liability for the product that they grow rich on the back of .
Perhaps it 's time for Internet overseeing organisation ICANN to show some mettle and start making the internet a medium for the planet and not just lawyers and multi-nationals . ®

But sure enough , there were a few who were beginning to say , " wait a minute .
Real estate prices have gone up a lot in some areas over the last few years .
Maybe that 's the next bubble . "
Back in 2002 we heard the first of the rumblings .
Stocks were down big from their highs , and real estate prices had begun what turned out to be the early stages of a huge run up in prices .
It was quiet at first , as most of the media was focused on the impending war in Iraq , the Enron accounting scandal , and the massive deterioration of stock prices .
It 's funny because the very idea of an asset price bubble had only recently become part of the American nomenclature .
Only a few years earlier , in the late 90s , it had become widely preached that asset bubbles were a thing of the past .
Whether technology was credited , investor sophistication , freedom of information , efficiency of markets , many believed that we would never again experience a stock market decline like 1929 , 1974 or 1987 .
Then the unthinkable happened .
Stocks declined .
" Just be patient , do n't panic , " the same people assured everybody .
" you have n't lost any money until you sell , " they philosophized .
Believe me , you had lost money .
It 's like telling somebody who walked up to a blackjack table with $ 100 , finding themselves down to $ 20 in chips , that they have n't lost anything unless they get up from the table right now .
No , they have lost real money .
All of a sudden something different happened .
Instead of predicting that bubbles were a thing of the past , everyone wanted to be the one to predict the next bubble .
Well , real estate prices had been increasing , especially in coastal cities .
It was a fairly natural target .
But were they wrong ?
Many in the housing industry , like David Lereah , the Chief Economist for the National Association of Realtors , would point to the fact that there have been talk that a housing bubble exists , may exist or is forming , as early as 2002 as evidence that one does not currently , nor ever did exist .
Truthfully , the real estate bubble talk did n't really pick up steam until sometime around early 2004 .
Of course , that 's faulty logic to begin with .
As asset bubbles go , they typically extend valuations beyond what economics or logic allows .
It is generally a condition created under the widespread belief that prices will continue to inflate , thus today 's high prices are acceptably low compared to tomorrow 's even higher prices .
Call it the " greater fool " theory , a house of cards or a pyramid scheme , we are talking about the same thing .
What typically happens is that prices do n't just go past reasonable valuations , they sail WAY past them .
And it goes on for longer than most would estimate .
Look again at stocks .
Most people remember former Federal Reserve Chairman , Alan Greenspan 's speech in which he noted that there was " irrational exuberance " in the stock market .
Most remember only those two words , and assume it to mean that Greenspan was calling the stock market a bubble at that time .
There are two important things that most people do n't know or remember about that quote .
First , what did he really say ?
Again , most assume that it was a " Greenspanism " for " a stock market bubble exists . "
It 's certainly open for interpretation , but in that speech , he was asking a question .
" how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values , which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade ? "
He went on to say that even if a collapsing asset bubble exists , but does not threaten the real economy , production , jobs or price stability , then the Fed need not be concerned .
Second , WHEN did he say it ?
Those ( in ) famous words were uttered during his speech at a dinner that took place on Deceber 5 , 1996 .
That same day , the Dow Industrials closed at 6,437 and the NASDAQ closed at 1,300 .
In the years after that speech , prices continued to climb , and to have heard those words in Deceber 1996 , and pulled all of your money out of the stock market would have cost you considerable potential gains .
The Dow closed at an all time high of 11,722 on January 14 , 2000 with an intraday high of 11,908.50 .
The NASDAQ closed at an all time high of 5,048.62 on March 10 , 2000 with an intraday high of 5,132.52 .
As of today 's writing , the Dow closed at 11,584.54 , very close to the all time high .
The NASDAQ closed at 2,344.99 , still less than half of the all time high .
Today 's close for BOTH market indices , however , was still higher than their level on the day of Greenspan 's speech .
So , given that , you should have ignored Greenspan then , right ?
Just as now , you should ignore those who claim that there exists a real estate bubble .
Well , let me continue .
Those who began uttering the words " real estate bubble " in 2002 were clearly early to the game , much as Greenspan was in 1996 .
But remember , Greenspan did not outright say that stocks were experiencing a bubble , rather asking if they were .
Likewise , the quiet rumblings in 2002 about the real estate market were mostly asking the question , " Stocks are down big , is real estate next ? "
Just as stock prices continued to ascend at a rip- roaring pace in the three years following Greenspan 's speech , so have real estate prices in the three years that followed the early warnings .
As illustrated by the massive differential in how much the NASDAQ went up versus the Dow on a percentage basis from 1996 to 2000 , the entire stock market does not simply go up or go down together in concert .
Certain sectors or asset classes move up more and faster at times , and are likely to be more susceptible to faster and more dramatic downturns as well .
Everyone knows that tech stocks , particularly dot-coms , led the way up AND down in the late 90s and after the bursting of the bubble in 2000 .
Likewise , while there has been a nationwide increase in real estate prices , certain areas , particularly the coastal regions , have certainly led the way up .
It is when prices reach a peak that investors become willing to take additional risk in order to maximize gains .
Investors used more margin debt to buy stocks in early 2000 than any time since securities regulations put limits on these things in the 1930s .
And over the last couple of years the use of no or low down , ARM , interest only and negative amortization loans have increased remarkably .
I 'm not saying the bubble is about to burst , or that prices will decline anywhere near the magnitude that stocks did .
But would you rather have listened to Greenspan in 1996 , or James Glassman , author of Dow 36,000 , published in October , 1999 ?
In the introduction of Glassman 's book he notes , " The Dow should rise to 36,000 immediately , but to be realistic , we believe the rise will take some time , perhaps three to five years . "
I would act with caution .

In general , Hollywood filmmakers follow the laws of physics because they have no other choice .
It ’s just when they cheat with special effects that we seem to forget how the world really works .
1 . Those Exploding Cars
No car explosions , please - found at LookyLuc [ Flickr ]
When you ’re watching an action flick , all it takes is a crash , or maybe a stream of leaky gasoline that acts like a fuse , and suddenly , bang !
You see a terrific explosion that ’s complete and violent .
But gasoline does n’t explode unless mixed with about 93 % air .
Gas - induced car explosions were discovered on film relatively recently ( you do n’t see them in the old black - and - white movies ) , and now audiences just take them for granted .
In general , there ’s no need to rush out of a crashed car , risking injury , because you fear an imminent explosion – it ’s probably not gonna happen .
2 . Sound that Moves at the Speed of Light Hollywood always gets this one wrong .
On film , thunder does n’t follow lightning ( as in real life , because sound is slower ) ; they occur simultaneously .
Similarly , a distant volcano erupts , and the blast is heard immediately rather than five seconds later for each mile .
Explosions on the battlefield go boom right away , no matter how far away spectators are .
Even a small thing , like the crack of a baseball player ’s bat , is simultaneous with ball contact , unlike at a real game .
3 . Everything is Illuminated : The Myth of Radioactivity Film would have you believe that radioactivity is contagious and makes you glow in the dark .
Where did this idea come from ?
The Simpsons ?
Perhaps , but the truth is that the most common forms of radioactivity will make you radioactive only if the radioactive particles stick on you .
Radioactivity is not contagious .
If a person is exposed to the radioactive neutrons from a nuclear reactor , then he can become slightly radioactive , but he certainly wo n’t glow .
And because radioactive things emit light only when they run into phosphor – like the coating on the inner surface of a TV tube – you do n’t really need to worry .
4 . Shotgun Blasts and Kung Fu Kicks Make Targets
Fly across the Room With the string of new kung fu films out ( they run the gamut from The Matrix to Charlie ’s Angels ) , you just ca n’t escape the small matter of bad physics .
Yeah , the action scenes look great and all , but in reality momentum is conserved , such that every action has an equal and opposite reaction .
So , when you see a gal kick someone across the room , technically , the kicker ( or holder of a gun ) must fly across the room in the opposite direction – unless she has a back against the wall .
5 . Legends of the Fall We are n’t surprised when the cartoon character Wile .
E. Coyote runs off a cliff and is suspended there momentarily before he falls .
But in the movies , buses and cars should n’t be able to jump across gaps in bridges , even if they go heavy on the accelerator .
The fact is , a vehicle will fall even if it ’s moving at a high speed .
During the 1989 San Francisco earthquake , a driver saw a gap in the bridge too late , and probably inspired by the movies , accelerated to try to make it across .
Unfortunately , the laws of physics were not suspended , and he fell into the hole and crashed on the other side .
Movies with special effects should come with a warning : “ Laws of physics are violated in this movie .
Do n’t try these stunts at home . ”
6 . The Sounds of Science All across the silver screen , you ’ll catch people screaming as their car flies in slow motion across the gap in the bridge .
The problem , though , is that their voices do n’t change .
In reality , if you slow down motion by a factor of two , the frequency of all sounds should drop by an octave .
Women will sound like men , and men will sound like Henry Kissinger .
Sound is an oscillation of the air .
Middle C , for example , is 256 vibrations per second .
If time is slowed down , there are fewer cycles per second , and the resulting sound is lower in pitch .
7 . Shell Shock !
Exploding Artillery Shells that Blow Straight Up
In movies , shells tend to kill only the person standing directly over them .
It seems like a waste of artillery , since – if you believe the movies – each shell can’t kill more than a single rifle bullet can .
But in real life , artillery shells blow out in all directions , killing people all over .
Movie directors like to have their actors running through a field of such shells , but they do n’t want their actors killed , so they arrange for underground explosions in holes that blow straight up , missing anyone who ’s more than 5 feet away .
8 . The Sparking Bullet Sparking bullets are relatively recent invention in movie special effects .
The gimmick provides a way of letting the audience know that the bullet just barely missed its target .
In real life , sparks do occur when you scrape steel or other hard metals on hard surfaces ( such as brick ) because little pieces of brittle materials are heated to glow and fly off .
The problem here is that bullets are generally made of lead because it ’s dense and soft , and you do n’t want the bullets scarring the steel of the gun barrel .
Ever notice that no sparks fly from the front of the gun ?
That ’s because you ’re seeing lead bullets .
9 . Sound Travels in Space
This is the granddaddy of all scientific complaints about space movies .
For instance , in space the hero should n’t be able to shout out instructions to the other astronauts from a spot several yards away .
The movie Aliens corrected this misimpression with its tagline : “ In space , nobody can hear you scream . ”
And it ’s true .
Sound is the vibration of air , and it ’s sensed when the air makes your eardrums vibrate .
But try to forget this rule as soon as possible ; it ’ll wreck a good many movies for you .

Big bad billionaire Boris Berezovsky declared to the Guardian that he is " plotting a new Russian revolution , " saying that force is the only way to remove Putin from office and change the regime of ex-KGB officers .
His latest is that he 's bankrolling members of the Russian political elite in an attempt to cause a split .
He 's made statements like this before , and it 's always hilarious because Pootie Poot 's cronies go bonkers .
His criticisms of Putin 's regime , that he 's rolling back democracy and that it may only be possible to remove his regime through force , are ideas and options that should be weighed and considered -- especially the first .
But when it comes to violence , some character assassination is in order .
Boris Berezovsky and his ilk , along with Putin , are just two sides of the same corrupt coin .
He spent a great part of the 90s buying up the country at bargain barrel prices using his own connections in the government , leaving the country in ravages while he profited .
Berezovsky , at one point , was Russia just as Putin is now .
Since he was sent into exile , he has been using words such as " democracy " like he owns them .
But contrary to what he says , democracy is n't just political elites -- him and Putin -- being able to fight like dogs for power .
It certainly is n't a slogan to be thrown around to gain Western support .
All in all , he 's just another billionaire slimeball whose very actions led to the rise of a person like Putin .
There are plenty of people who are actually in Russia , risking imprisonment and police baton beatings , who are fighting for democracy there .
Chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov , ex- prime minister Kasyanov , and a host of others are trying to put together a feasible democratic opposition at this very moment .
Others , like Anna Politkovskaya , actually died trying to bring about a democratic Russia .
In other words , Berezovsky can shove it .
In July 2005 , California bannedall tobacco products from it ’s state prison system .
The results have been about what you ’d expect :
There are no ifs , ands or butts about it : California ’s ban on tobacco in prisons has produced a burgeoning black market behind bars , where a pack of smokes can fetch up to $ 125 .
Prison officials who already have their hands full keeping drugs and weapons away from inmates now are spending time tracking down tobacco smugglers , some of them guards and other prison employees .
Fights over tobacco have broken out — at one Northern California prison , guards had to use pepper spray to break up a brawl among 30 inmates .
The ban was put in place in July 2005 to improve work conditions and cut rising health care costs among inmates , but it also has led to an explosive growth of tobacco trafficking .
The combination of potentially big profits and relatively light penalties are driving the surge .
In other words , a black market .
And along with the black market , comes the corruption :
At the fortress - like Pelican Bay State Prison near Crescent City , a felon sneaked back onto prison grounds hours after being paroled .
He was found with a pillowcase of almost 50 ounces of rolling tobacco — worth thousands of dollars on the black market .
The plan was to throw it over the facility ’s fence .
“ It ’s almost becoming a better market than drugs , ” said Devan Hawkes , an anti-gang officer at Pelican Bay .
“ A lot of people are trying to make money . ”
And that includes prison workers .
Last year , a corrections officer was put on leave at California State Prison , Solano , for smuggling tobacco .
The guard made several hundred dollars a week through tobacco , officials say . ( …)
“ There ’s quite a bit of money to be made , ” said Lt. Tim Wamble , a Solano prison spokesman .
“ In a department this size , you ’re gonna have people who will succumb to the temptation . ”
The same thing happened with alcohol during prohibition , and it happens every day with the War On ( Some ) Drugs .
One of these days , people will learn that you can ban products that people want but , in the end , you really can’t prevent them from getting those products if they really want them .
Until then , we ’ll have more nonsense like this .
H/T : Hit & Run
Fears of another impending health crisis were accentuated today as news stories threaten “ Flu virus could kill 81 million . ”
These latest death threat statistics , reported from the same press release , appear to have been created for the greatest scare value , according to Steve Milloy .
In a Fox News article , he reviewed the flaws in how those numbers were derived , along with some valuable cautionary science :
... First , the researchers ’ estimate of 62 million deaths has far more shock - value than credibility ....
The 62 million - death sound - bite is the product of statistical modeling that uses worst - case death rate estimates from the 1918 - 1920 pandemic influenza – an epidemic that medical historians believe killed somewhere between 20 million to 100 million people .
[ T ]he researchers ignored several key ( not to mention glaring ) differences between 1918 and 2006 .
First ... modern medical care and public health practices have dramatically improved since 1918 .
So any flu epidemic is likely to be far less severe .... Next , a great proportion of the deaths in 1918 was probably due to secondary bacterial infections that followed the initial viral infections .
Today , antibiotics would be used to treat bacterial infections .
And let ’s not forget that during 1918 - 1920 , much of the world was still recovering from the strains of World War I .
Poverty , hunger , unsanitary living conditions and stress likely made much of the global population ripe for a killer flu pandemic .
None of these considerations were factored into the researchers ’ estimate .
But perhaps the researchers ’ choice that most reveals their apparent desire to come up with a scary – rather than a realistic – death toll from pandemic flu is their decision to use the 1918 pandemic flu data in the first place .
There were , after all , two other more recent and , in all likelihood , more relevant pandemic flu outbreaks in the 20th century ....
While scares about a global bird flu pandemic have been brewing for years , the “ shock we are seeing is way out of proportion to the risk , ” said Anni McLeod , a senior officer of livestock policy for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization .
“ Consumers are not very much at risk from this disease , ” she said at a World Poultry conference in May .
Infectious disease and agricultural scientists have been presenting science that tempers concerns for years , but it ’s been underplayed in the media .
Fostering fears of a crisis is too irresistible for a host of interests , from public health officials creating new emergency management programs , activists trying to frighten consumers away from animal products and modern farming , pharmaceutical companies and researchers seeking funding for vaccines , and media garnering readership and viewers with sensational headlines .
In the 1940s , a decade before achieving international renown with “ Lolita , ” Vladimir Nabokov solidified his reputation as a lepidopterist by reclassifying the wide - ranging North American butterfly genus Lycaeides , the “ blues . ”
Nabokov divided the blues into two large species — Lycaeides melissa , the Melissa blue , and Lycaeides idas , the northern blue , with overlapping ranges in the mountains of the West .
He also theorized that the blues he found high in the Tetons and Colorado Rockies were hybrids , but he lacked the tools to prove it .
Now , a group of scientists from Texas State University , the University of California at Davis , the University of Nevada at Reno and the University of Tennessee have proposed that an “ unnamed ” population of Alpine Lycaeides in the Sierra Nevada is a hybrid species formed through an ancient mixing of Lycaeides melissa and Lycaeides idas .
These blues have colonized the treeless alpine region , at a higher altitude than the habitats of their parents , said Zachariah Gompert , a graduate student in biology at Texas State and principal author of the group ’s paper , published in the Nov. 30 online edition of Science .
Lycaeides melissa is found in the Great Basin on the east side of the Sierras ; Lycaeides idas frequents wet meadows that reach halfway up the west slope .

In " The Mystery of Larry Wachowski , " Peter Wilkinson writes : " Leaving Los Angeles , he and Ilsa moved into a $ 2.7 million home in San Francisco , on a steep hill in the Castro , with sweeping views of San Francisco Bay .
( As of last month , work was still under way on an expensive addition to the house , and a sparkling new red Lexus was parked in the indoor garage . )
On the transfer deed for the Castro home , the name Laurence Wachowski does not appear .
Instead , it 's ' Laurenca ' Wachowski .
And in a judge 's order , filed in the divorce proceeding , he is similarly identified as Laurence Wachowski , a.k.a. Laurenca Wachowski . "
9. .XXX Goes Down
In March 2005 , Sen. Mark Pryor ( D - Ark. ) and Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) proposed a bill that would require all commercial Web sites with material " harmful to minors " ( in other words , sexually explicit content ) to move to a .xxx domain within six months of their bill becoming law .
Anyone with a vaguely sex-related Web site instantly felt the first frost of the chilling effects that would come from such an Internet red light district .
In a Boing Boing post , San Francisco 's Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Jason Schultz said , " Talk about a misguided attempt at Internet zoning ... also has severe implications for filtering as I 'd imagine every .xxx domain would be on the universal black list . "
But by May 2006 the Register reported .xxx dead in the water , and all the sex writers in Blogistan heaved a collective sigh of relief .
8. 2257 Raids
The Justice Department added a whole bunch of new age - monitoring regulations in 2005 to their 2257 requirements for pornographers .
They added so many , you 'd expect them to be done for a while .
And because 2257 news died down last year , it 's really easy to get lulled into thinking the harassment and shakedowns of pornographers are over .
But 2006 has been the year of the surprise 2257 raid for porn film companies .
Even though porn is not illegal in the United States and 2257 is For the Children , the laundry list of legitimate businesses on the receiving end of raids this year grew by one more entry this month .
In addition to Pure Play Media , Evasive Angles , Darkside Entertainment , Legend , Sunshine Films , Robert Hill Releasing , Sebastian Sloane Productions and Diabolic -- a team of FBI agents conducting 2257 records inspections visited the offices of K - Beech Inc .
7. Einstein , Sex Fiend
Yeah , he could talk the talk , but could he walk the walk ?
As it happens , Albert Einstein talked all kinds of smack about his fellow scientists -- and if he ever boasted about how chicks dig physics geeks or his theory of ( his own ) relativity to a trophy - drawer of personally collected science - wife panties , he was n't just pulling another fast equation on y'all .
In July , a bevy of Einstein 's private letters were unlocked after a 20 - year hold , revealing that the king of all high - math nerds had a number of mistresses and numerous sexual liaisons with women who showered him with " affection and gifts . "
6. Toxic Sex Toys
Sex educators had been making increasing noise all year about the use of phthalates ( toxic chemicals ) in cheaply made sex toys , but the lube really hit the fan when Greenpeace issued a toxic sex toy warning based on their investigative report that put those Crystal Jelly Dongs right off the menu .
Calling on the European Union to address what they called an " EU sex scandal , " Greenpeace requested a ban on the toys similar to one put on children 's toys made with the same chemicals -- just like we 've proposed here in San Francisco .
Blogs responded in kind , with more information on the chemicals and a guide to unsafe sex toys ( or two ) .
5. Sex Toy Bans
Sex toys had a rough year , coming and going .
Not only did people freak out about what was in their toys , but legislators had fits so profound about their very existence that it kinda made us all a bit uncomfortable to associate senators and butt plugs all in one sentence .
...
But because they tried -- in some cases , successfully -- to make sex toys illegal in certain states , we have all been forced ( with a vibrator to our collective heads ) to consider anal beads and politicians in bed together , as it were .
But seriously -- healthy , average adult Americans were forbidden their fundamental right to buzzing bunny vibrators and bend - over - boyfriend behind closed doors when a federal appeals court in Mississippi upheld the dismissal of a case challenging the state 's sex toy ban .
Mississippi joined the ranks of sex - toy hatin ' states Alabama , Georgia , Indiana , Texas , Louisiana and Virginia .
4. Sex in Space
In space , no one can hear you masturbate .
At least that was the theory tossed ( ahem ) about the Internet and in print this year , especially when Laura S. Woodmansee came out with the well - researched ( and highly amusing ) book " Sex in Space . "
Aside from jokes about getting fluids out of your hair , the choreography of connection and not leaving condoms on the console , MSNBC 's science writer Alan Boyle remarked that " new devices and data would be required to hit the zero - g g- spot , " and zero - gravity veteran Xeni Jardin got a sex- positive microgravity post going on Boing Boing that garnered comments from pro-abstinence pseudo - Christians as well as hanky - flagging space sluts .
3. ' Girls Gone Wild "s Joe Francis
We all knew that those annoying " Girls Gone Wild " ads we had to sit through while waiting for Stephen Colbert to come back on just had to come from the father of all douche bags , but then this year we found out we were right .
Joe Francis , the founder and director of the video series , is officially looking like the king craziest douche bag of all times .
He was robbed at gunpoint and forced to perform in a bend - over - boyfriend extortion video and was arrested on charges of racketeering and drugs .
The Los Angeles Times profile in which he publicly sexually humiliated the female journalist on the story significantly raised his douche bag quotient ( DQ ) .
And this month , his guilty plea for using underage girls ( gone wild with lawyers , natch ) got him a tidy little sentence .
2. The Craigslist Experiment Sex Scandal
In September , Seattle resident Jason Fortuny ( and a friend ) carried a Craigslist thought experiment over into shocking reality .
He took a hard - core Women Seeking Men ad from another city and reposted it to see how many replies he could get in 24 hours .
Then he published every single response -- photos , e-mails , IM info , phone numbers , names , everything -- to a public wiki .
Then he went public on Jason 's LiveJournal page , calling it " The Craigslist Experiment . "
He got 178 responses , with 145 photos of men -- one respondent used a Microsoft employee e-mail address , another used a usar.army.mil ( military ) e-mail address -- all sparking huge debates on Internet privacy .
Since then , Portland copycat Michael Crook performed the same experiment but took it further , baiting respondents into giving more sexual and personal information .
Crook became a troll par excellence by trying to milk his 15 minutes of attention by barraging local Web sites like 10 Zen Monkeys and Web hosting providers like Laughing Squid with bogus DMCA takedown notices related to his image ( when they wrote about him ) , turning sex - baiting into DMCA - baiting -- and now the local Electronic Frontier Foundation is suing Crook for bogus DMCA claims .
1. The HPV Vaccine
HPV ( human papillomavirus ) is a very popular sexually transmitted virus , but not exactly the kind of popular that makes you want to be in the " in " crowd .
It 's believed that 75 percent of the population will become infected with HPV during their adulthood , and studies show that certain types of HPV infections cause about 70 percent of all cervical cancer. , while 370,000 cases of cervical cancer are identified in the United States every year and the CDC estimates that 6.2 million Americans are infected every year .
In June , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first preventive HPV vaccine , marketed by Merck & Co. under the trade name Gardasil .
Yay !
But wait : Conservative Christian groups have come out in opposition against the HPV vaccine , claiming that a vaccine will only encourage promiscuity and that abstinence is the best way to avoid getting HPV -- and thus injecting a life - saving breakthrough with a virus of its own : life - threatening sexual hysteria .
It 's too bad : Something called " The Promiscuity Vaccine " sounds like a shot I 'd like to get from a naughty nurse , rather than a dose of misinformation from the Family Research Council .

According to a Republican with close ties to the White House , Bush and Gonzales are in denial about getting a new Attorney General .
“ They ’re the only two people on the planet Earth who do n’t see it . ”
And yet , there ’s a small problem : Gonzales is still there .
Slate recently created a “ Gonzo - meter ” to gauge the likelihood of the AG ’s ouster .
Late last week , after Gonzales ’ ridiculous performance in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee , the “ Gonzo - meter ” hit 95 % .
Monday , after the president publicly praised the AG , it slipped to 85 % .
Yesterday , it slipped again , to 75 % , in light of the White House 's ongoing support .
Congress is n’t in a position to fire Gonzales , no matter how much bipartisan support there is to replace him .
Like the U.S. Attorneys Bush purged , Gonzales serves at the pleasure of the president .
And with the president saying , “ Screw you , ” what can anyone do about it ?
As it turns out , congressional Dems may have come up with a “ screw you ” of their own .
Roll Call reports :
With Attorney General Alberto Gonzales vowing to remain in his job and President Bush standing by him , Senate Democratic leaders are seriously considering bringing a resolution to the floor expressing no confidence in Gonzales , according to a senior leadership source .
“ I do n’t think [ Gonzales ] can survive , no matter what the president says , ” said the source .
The vote would be nonbinding and have no substantive impact , but it would force all Republican Senators into the politically uncomfortable position of saying publicly whether they continue to support Gonzales in the wake of the scandal surrounding the firings of eight U.S. attorneys .
Democratic leaders have not yet set an exact time frame for when they would bring such a resolution to the floor .
This is exactly the kind of vote the Republicans used to schedule all the time before they lost their majority — the kind the minority does n’t want to see .
In Praise of the Lowly Comment
The compiler removes them completely .
The computer ignores them .
Some developers think we should do away with them entirely .
But in the grand scheme of software development , I personally think they have a very important part to play .
What are they ?
Comments , of course .
Now , that 's not to say that all comments are created equal , or that you should just sprinkle your code with comments without thinking about what you 're doing .
But in my experience , good developers recognize that comments are a useful tool , and employ them to make code more clear and maintainable .
With some practice , you can do the same .
Dysfunctional Comments
Let 's sneak up on the notion of good comments by considering the other kind first .
There are some comments that I think you can ( and should ) safely eradicate from your code .
These include :
The tracking comment , listing who modified the code , when they did it , what they had for breakfast , and so on , in some sort of carefully formatted block ( generally with a border made up of asterisks ) .
You have a source code control system , right ?
Let it keep track of this sort of thing and do n't bother repeating it in the source code .
The " what " comment , repeating the code itself in English .
You 've probably seen code where every line had a comment , and i++ was painfully annotated with " increment the counter variable . "
You should presume that anyone reading your code understands the syntax and leave these comments out , unless you 're actually writing a tutorial for beginning developers .
was painfully annotated with " increment the counter variable . "
You should presume that anyone reading your code understands the syntax and leave these comments out , unless you 're actually writing a tutorial for beginning developers .
The long explanatory comment far removed from the code it is purportedly explaining .
I have seen developers stick entire readme files into comments , discussing the overall architecture and logic of their application .
The problem is that the architecture and logic gets revised and the comment does n't , and out of sync explanations are worse than no explanation at all .
This sort of overview belongs in external documentation , where it has some hope of being maintained .
In general , if a comment is n't going to bring lasting value to the code - leave it out .
Why Not Leave Them All Out ?
Some developers look at the problem of comments going out of sync with the code and see an insurmountable issue .
Others ( and these tend to be among the best and brightest developers ) proudly boast that they write " self - documenting code . "
In either case , their prescription is the same : code with no comments at all .
While the notion of self - documenting code is seductive , in the end , I just do n't believe it .
Clarity in code is worth striving for , but as I 've said elsewhere , this software stuff is hard .
No matter how crisp your naming conventions , no matter how perfect your choice of implementation language , no matter how much effort you put into refactoring , there is going to come a time when you need to do something clever in your code to meet a business need .
And the more clever the code , the less self - documenting it will be .
If you leave it undocumented , you risk a maintenance nightmare when you go back in six months to make an improvement and can't quite remember what you were doing in the first place .
White Hat Comments
So if code needs comments , but not all comments are good , how do you write good comments ?
In general , there are at least four kinds of comments that I think are worthwhile in most source code :
Placeholder comments
Summary comments
Intent comments
Rocket Science comments
The Placeholder Comment : A String Around Your Virtual Finger
Some commands exist mainly to remind the developer to do something ( or not to do something ) .
By convention , most of us tend to introduce these with a single word in all caps : TODO , BUG , POSTPONE , HACK , UNDONE , and so on .
Such comments act as little bookmarks in the code , preventing the need to cover your monitor with sticky notes as you have work in progress .
Placeholder comments are most useful when you 're working with an IDE that will collect them automatically for you into a virtual to - do list ( as most of them will these days ) .
If you sprinkle your code with TODO labels as things occur to you , and you have a window open showing all the TODO lines in the code , you may be able to get by with relatively little process for tracking bugs and features ( though your manager might complain about this theory ) .
Such comments should generally be short ; if there 's a bug that takes a paragraph to explain , it belongs in a more formal bug - tracking system .
If there 's any chance of your source code being publicly released ( or even privately released to selected customers ) , you should do a careful review of placeholder comments to make sure that you 're not shipping something that will embarrass you .
You can take a look at Google Code search to find people who did n't follow this rule of thumb .
The Summary Comment : Compensating for Tiny Brains
I 'm not a fan of explaining every line of code with a line of comment that says exactly the same thing .
But summary comments , that explain an entire block of code at one time , are a somewhat different animal .
Rather than explain ten lines of code individually , a summary comment might say something like " Sort the customer list by age of oldest invoice and display " or " Now center the uploaded graphic on a white rectangle that fills the target area . "
Most likely , there is n't any single line of code in these blocks that would be difficult to understand on its own .
But by summarizing the code , you can make it easier to understand the overall flow of the application .
Given the choice between reading 100 lines of code or ten lines of summary comments , the latter can be much more efficient .
Depending on your IDE , you can make the process even easier by coloring the comments so that they stand out visually .
To a certain extent , good coding practices can obviate the need for summary comments .
If you keep methods very short and use descriptive names for the methods themselves , then the naming can become the comments .
But the more procedural the code gets , the more likely you are to find that some sort of summary commenting can serve as a useful road map to what 's going on .
Intent Comments : Why is This Code Here ?
With intent comments , instead of explaining how code works or what it does , you explain why it 's there in the first place .
A typical intent comment is longer than a summary comment , and applies to a larger section of code - an entire object , or a substantial piece of procedural code .
You might explain in an intent comment , for example , that the EnahncedTableAdapter class is necessary because the standard TableAdapter does n't include transactions or interface with your company 's custom configuration classes .
Intent comments can be very difficult to write , because they force you to actually think about what you 're saying ; they 're not a mechanical process .
If you have a good functional spec for your application , you may be able to reuse some of it for these comments .
In any case , they 're worth the effort , because they pay off when it becomes time for maintenance programming .
Intent comments can help you very quickly come back up to speed on code that you have n't touched for a while ( or that someone else wrote ) and easily locate a section that you need to work on .
Rocket Science Comments : Sometimes it is .
Finally , you will occasionally hear writing code dismissed as " well , it is n't rocket science . "
The problem is that sometimes , in fact , it is rocket science ( or pick the metaphor of your choice for difficult intellectual pursuits ) .
Multi-threading , database transactions , optimization algorithms , fancy graphics processing ... there are plenty of things that you can do in code that wo n't be immediately obvious to the average developer , even if they understand the basic syntax of the language that you 're using .
In such cases , you need to write comments to explain the tricky code .
You 'll find many people to tell you that having code this tricky is a bad thing , and that the right answer is to rewrite the code until it 's not tricky .
But sometimes , your code will be as simple , as direct , and as clear as it can be - and it will still be tricky , just because of the nature of the problem .
In those cases , you can't assume that every future reader of the source code will be as brilliant as you are today .
( Future readers , of course , include you three weeks from now ) .
The simple fact is that such sections of code need comments .
Rocket science comments might be summary comments or intent comments , but they need to be written with particular care .
It does n't help if the comments are just as difficult to understand as the code itself .
You need to strive for a tutorial voice that explains any difficult concepts , possibly with further reference material .
At times , you may find that such comments are longer than the code they apply to .
That 's fine ; writing a long comment now is better than wasting hours six months from now trying to decipher your brilliant code .
It 's All a Matter of Discipline
Why do developers write bad comments , or spend so much energy trying to justify a " no comments " policy ?
I think it 's because writing good comments is hard , and maintaining them ( so that the comments continue to reflect the actual state of the code ) is hard too .
But trying to avoid development work by skimping on comments is like trying to avoid housework by skimping on the daily cleanup chores .
Over the long run , you 'll be much better off if you develop the discipline to write crisp , clear , useful comments in your source code - comments that will actually help you and other developers make sense of the code when it 's time to work on it again .
In this business , anything you can do to help yourself out in understanding complexity is worth the effort .

A metal probe attached to the underbelly of my arm heated up and cooled down at set intervals .
I was told that although the heat probe would feel uncomfortable , my skin would not be burned .
During one exposure , I was instructed to think of the pain as positively as possible , during another to think of it as negatively .
After each sequence , I was asked to rate my pain on a 0 - to - 10 scale , with 10 being the worst pain I could imagine .
Although I discovered that I could make the pain fluctuate depending on whether I was imagining that I was sunbathing or was the victim of an inquisition , I still rated all the pain as low — ranging from a 1 to a 3 .
If 10 was being slowly burned alive , I felt I should at least be begging for mercy to justify a rating of 5 .
So I insisted that Mackey turn up the dial so I could get a real response .
But even during the moments when I was actively trying to imagine the pain as negatively as possible , it remained in a mental box of " not even burned , " which kept it from really hurting : hurting , that is , the way a burn would .
As it turned out , I got a second - degree burn that later darkened into a square mark .
Mackey was more than a little dismayed as we watched the reddening skin pucker , but I was thrilled .
Naturally the protocol had been carefully designed not to injure anyone , yet in my case that protection had failed because of the very phenomenon it was designed to study : expectation — the effect of the mind on pain or placebo .
I had recently spent several weeks observing Mackey in the university 's pain clinic , where he is associate director .
I was so convinced that Mackey — then a tall sandy - haired 39 - year - old with a deep interest in technology ( he got a Ph.D. in electrical engineering before he went to medical school ) and an air of radiant integrity — would not burn me that my brain had not perceived the stimulus as a threat and generated pain .
I admired him , I trusted him , I was positive that he would n't hurt me .
And , ipso facto , he had n't .
Mackey 's genius as a practitioner , I thought , lay partly in his ability to similarly inspire patients .
" When I started working with pain patients , I realized how much of the treatment involved trying to reverse learned helplessness , " he said — to rally them out of the despair ingrained from years of unremitting pain and cajole their minds to chip in its own analgesic to their therapies .
" The purpose of this study is to show patients their mind matters , " Mackey said .
The mark of the burn is barely visible now , but for a couple of years afterward , at times when my chronic pain was making me miserable , the sight of it would both encourage and reproach me .
Here is the ultimate proof that my mind can control pain , I would think , yet I did n't know how to make it wake up and do so .
I could take the edge off the pain by conjuring positive images , but the effects did n't last , and I never again had the remarkable placebo response that masked a second - degree burn .
In fact , a mild burn from spilling tea on my hand one day brought tears to my eyes .
When the real - time neuroimaging study began , I could n't wait to try it .
The area of the brain that the scanner focuses on is the rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC ) .
The rACC ( a quarter - size patch in the middle - front of the brain , the cingular cortex ) plays a critical role in the awareness of the nastiness of pain : the feeling of dislike for it , a loathing so intense that you are immediately compelled to try to make it stop .
Indeed , the pain of pain , you might say , its defining element , is the way in which the sensation is suffused with a particular unpleasantness researchers refer to as dysphoria .
Since pain is a perception , it 's not pain if you do n't experience it as hurting .
You can feel hot or cold or pressure , and note them simply as stimuli , but when they exceed a certain intensity , the rACC kicks in , and suddenly they become painful , riveting your attention and causing you to recoil .
There is much discussion in the local media here in Washington D.C. about this tragic story :
Twelve - year - old Deamonte Driver died of a toothache Sunday .
A routine , $ 80 tooth extraction might have saved him .
If his mother had been insured .
If his family had not lost its Medicaid .
If Medicaid dentists were n’t so hard to find .
If his mother had n’t been focused on getting a dentist for his brother , who had six rotted teeth .
By the time Deamonte ’s own aching tooth got any attention , the bacteria from the abscess had spread to his brain , doctors said .
After two operations and more than six weeks of hospital care , the Prince George ’s County boy died .
The article itself focuses on the alleged lack of dental care coverage for the poor and apporvingly quotes those who argue for the expansion of Medcaid benefits in this area .
But that ’s not the only lesson you can draw from this tragic event .
Consider , for example , what this boys mother did in response to an obviously serious dental problem :
When Deamonte got sick , his mother had not realized that his tooth had been bothering him .
Instead , she was focusing on his younger brother , 10 - year - old DaShawn , who “ complains about his teeth all the time , ” she said .
DaShawn saw a dentist a couple of years ago , but the dentist discontinued the treatments , she said , after the boy squirmed too much in the chair .
Then the family went through a crisis and spent some time in an Adelphi homeless shelter .
From there , three of Driver ’s sons went to stay with their grandparents in a two - bedroom mobile home in Clinton .
By September , several of DaShawn ’s teeth had become abscessed .
Driver began making calls about the boy ’s coverage but grew frustrated .
She turned to Norris , who was working with homeless families in Prince George ’s .
Norris and her staff also ran into barriers :
They said they made more than two dozen calls before reaching an official at the Driver family ’s Medicaid provider and a state supervising nurse who helped them find a dentist .
On Oct. 5 , DaShawn saw Arthur Fridley , who cleaned the boy ’s teeth , took an X - ray and referred him to an oral surgeon .
But the surgeon could not see him until Nov. 21 , and that would be only for a consultation .
Driver said she learned that DaShawn would need six teeth extracted and made an appointment for the earliest date available : Jan. 16 .
But she had to cancel after learning Jan. 8 that the children had lost their Medicaid coverage a month earlier .
She suspects that the paperwork to confirm their eligibility was mailed to the shelter in Adelphi , where they no longer live .
The natural instinct for any parent faced with this situation would be , I think , to do whatever it took to make sure that your child received proper medical , or in this case dental , care by taking the child to a clinic , like this Dentist in Yuma , and working with them on a method of payment .
Remember we ’re not talking about a cavity here , or teeth that are misaligned and need braces , we are talking about an infection that ultimately killed her son .
With all due respect to a mother who has lost her son , it seems that the only thing she did was rely on Medicaid ( i.e. , the state ) to take care of this .
From the article , there appears to have been no consideration of looking to a church or charity for help , for example , or , quite honestly , doing whatever it took to make sure your child received the care they needed .
This is what happens when people become dependent on the welfare state .

Olbermann :
And lastly tonight , a Special Comment , about -- lying .
While the leadership in Congress has self - destructed over the revelations of an unmatched , and unrelieved , march through a cesspool ...
While the leadership inside the White House has self - destructed over the revelations of a book with a glowing red cover ...
The President of the United States -- unbowed , undeterred , and unconnected to reality -- has continued his extraordinary trek through our country rooting out the enemies of freedom : The Democrats .
Transcripts below the fold
Yesterday at a fundraiser for an Arizona Congressman , Mr. Bush claimed , quote , " 177 of the opposition party said ' You know , we do n't think we ought to be listening to the conversations of terrorists . "
The hell they did .
177 Democrats opposed the President 's seizure of another part of the Constitution * .
Not even the White House press office could actually name a single Democrat who had ever said the government should n't be listening to the conversations of terrorists .
President Bush hears ... what he wants .
Tuesday , at another fundraiser in California , he had said " Democrats take a law enforcement approach to terrorism .
That means America will wait until we 're attacked again before we respond . "
Mr. Bush fabricated that , too .
And evidently he has begun to fancy himself as a mind - reader .
" If you listen closely to some of the leaders of the Democratic Party , " the President said at another fundraiser Monday in Nevada , " it sounds like they think the best way to protect the American people is -- wait until we 're attacked again . "
The President does n't just hear what he wants .
He hears things , that only he can hear .
It defies belief that this President and his administration could continue to find new unexplored political gutters into which they could wallow .
Yet they do .
It is startling enough that such things could be said out loud by any President of this nation .
Rhetorically , it is about an inch short of Mr. Bush accusing Democratic leaders ; Democrats ; the majority of Americans who disagree with his policies -- of treason .
But it is the context that truly makes the head spin .
Just 25 days ago , on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , this same man spoke to this nation and insisted , quote , " we must put aside our differences and work together to meet the test that history has given us . "
Mr. Bush , this is a test you have already failed .
If your commitment to " put aside differences and work together " is replaced in the span of just three weeks by claiming your political opponents prefer to wait to see this country attacked again , and by spewing fabrications about what they 've said , then the questions your critics need to be asking , are no longer about your policies .
They are , instead -- solemn and even terrible questions , about your fitness to fulfill the responsibilities of your office .
No Democrat , sir , has ever said anything approaching the suggestion that the best means of self - defense is to " wait until we 're attacked again . "
No critic , no commentator , no reluctant Republican in the Senate , has ever said anything that any responsible person could even have exaggerated into the slander you spoke in Nevada on Monday night , nor the slander you spoke in California on Tuesday , nor the slander you spoke in Arizona on Wednesday ... nor whatever is next .
You have dishonored your party , sir -- you have dishonored your supporters -- you have dishonored yourself .
But tonight the stark question we must face is - why ?
Why has the ferocity of your venom against the Democrats , now exceeded the ferocity of your venom against the terrorists ?
Why have you chosen to go down in history as the President who made things up ?
In less than one month you have gone from a flawed call to unity , to this clarion call to hatred of Americans , by Americans .
If this is not simply the most shameless example of the rhetoric of political hackery , then it would have to be the cry of a leader crumbling under the weight of his own lies .
We have , of course , survived all manner of political hackery , of every shape , size , and party .
We will have to suffer it , for as long as the Republic stands .
But the premise of a President who comes across as a compulsive liar -- is nothing less than terrifying .
A President who since 9/11 will not listen , is not listening -- and thanks to Bob Woodward 's most recent account -- evidently has never listened .
A President who since 9/11 so hates or fears other Americans , that he accuses them of advocating deliberate inaction in the face of the enemy .
A President who since 9/11 has savaged the very freedoms he claims to be protecting from attack .
Attack by terrorists , or by Democrats , or by both -- it is now impossible to find a consistent thread of logic as to who Mr. Bush believes the enemy is .
But if we know one thing for certain about Mr. Bush , it is this :
This President -- in his bullying of the Senate last month and in his slandering of the Democrats this month -- has shown us that he believes whoever the enemies are -- they are hiding themselves inside a dangerous cloak , called the Constitution of the United States of America .
How often do we find priceless truth in the unlikeliest of places ?
I tonight quote , not Jefferson nor Voltaire -- but " Cigar Aficionado Magazine . "
On September 11th , 2003 , the editor of that publication interviewed General Tommy Franks -- at that point , just retired from his post as Commander - In - Chief of U.S. Central Command -- of Cent - Com .
And amid his quaint defenses of the - then nagging absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq , or the continuing freedom of Osama Bin Laden , General Franks said some of the most profound words of this generation .
He spoke of " the worst thing that can happen " to this country :
First , quoting , a " massive casualty - producing event somewhere in the Western World -- it may be in the United States of America . "
Then , the general continued , " the western world , the free world , loses what it cherishes most , and that is freedom and liberty we 've seen for a couple of hundred years , in this grand experiment that we call democracy . "
It was this super - patriotic warrior 's fear that we would lose that most cherished liberty , because of another attack , one -- again quoting General Franks -- " that causes our population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass - casualty - producing event .
Which , in fact , then begins to potentially unravel the fabric of our Constitution . "
And here we are , the fabric of our Constitution being unraveled anyway .
Habeus Corpus neutered ; the rights of self - defense now as malleable and impermanent as clay ; a President stifling all critics by every means available and when he runs out of those , by simply lying about what they said or felt .
And all this , even without the dreaded attack .
General Franks , like all of us , loves this country , and believes not just in its values , but in its continuity .
He has been trained to look for threats to that continuity from without .
He has , perhaps been as naive as the rest of us , in failing to keep close enough vigil on the threats to that continuity , from within :
Secretary of State Rice first cannot remember urgent cautionary meetings with counter - terrorism officials before 9/11 .
Then within hours of this lie , her spokesman confirms the meetings in question .
Then she dismisses those meetings as nothing new -- yet insists she wanted the same cautions expressed to Secretaries Ashcroft and Rumsfeld .
Mr. Rumsfeld , meantime , has been unable to accept the most logical and simple influence , of the most noble and neutral of advisers .
He and his employer insist they rely on the ' generals in the field . '
But dozens of those generals have now come forward to say how their words , their experiences , have been ignored .
And , of course , inherent in the Pentagon 's war - making functions , is the regulation of Presidential war - lust .
Enacting that regulation should include everything up to , symbolically wrestling the Chief Executive to the floor .
Yet -- and it is Pentagon transcripts that now tell us this -- evidently Mr. Rumsfeld 's strongest check on Mr. Bush 's ambitions , was to get somebody to excise the phrase " Mission Accomplished " out of the infamous Air Force Carrier speech of May 1st , 2003 - even while the same empty words hung on a banner over the President 's shoulder .
And the Vice President is a chilling figure , still unable , it seems , to accept the conclusions of his own party 's leaders in the Senate , that the foundations of his public position , are made out of sand .
There were no Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq .
But he still says so .
There was no link between Saddam Hussein and Al - Qaeda .
But he still says so .
And thus , gripping firmly these figments of his own imagination , Mr. Cheney lives on , in defiance and spreads -- around him and before him -- darkness ... like some contagion of fear .
They are never wrong , and they never regret .
Admirable in a French torch singer .
Cataclysmic in an American leader .
Thus the sickening attempt to blame the Foley Scandal on the negligence of others or " The Clinton Era " -- even though the Foley Scandal began before the Lewinsky Scandal .
Thus last month 's enraged attacks on this Administration 's predecessors , about Osama Bin Laden -- a projection of their own negligence in the immediate months before 9/11 .
Thus the terrifying attempt to hamstring the fundament of our freedom -- the Constitution -- a triumph for Al - Qaeda , for which the terrorists could not hope to achieve with a hundred 9/11's .
And thus , worst of all perhaps , these newest lies by President Bush about Democrats choosing to await another attack and not listen to the conversations of terrorists .
It is the terror and the guilt within your own heart , Mr. Bush , that you re-direct at others who simply wish for you to temper your certainty with counsel .
It is the failure and the incompetence within your own memory , Mr. Bush , that leads you to demonize those who might merely quote to you the pleadings of Oliver Cromwell : " I beseech you , in the bowels of Christ , think it possible you may be mistaken . "
It is not the Democrats whose inaction in the face of the enemy you fear , sir .
It is your own -- before 9/11 - ( and you alone know this ) , perhaps afterwards .
Mr. President , these new lies go to the heart of what it is that you truly wish to preserve .
It is not our freedom , nor our country -- your actions against the Constitution give irrefutable proof of that .
You want to preserve a political party 's power .
And obviously you 'll sell this country out , to do it .
These are lies about the Democrats piled atop lies about Iraq which were piled atop lies about your preparations for Al - Qaeda .
To you , perhaps , they feel like the weight of a million centuries .
As crushing .
As immovable .
They are not .
If you add more lies to them , you cannot free yourself , and us , from them .
But if you stop -- if you stop fabricating quotes , and building straw - men , and inspiring those around you to do the same -- you may yet liberate yourself and this nation .
Please , sir , do not throw this country 's principles away because your lies have made it such that you can no longer differentiate between the terrorists and the critics .

Good night , and good luck .

eBags.com ranks as one of the more notable successes among Internet retailers .
The leading online purveyor of luggage , eBags generates more than $ 38 million in revenue a year and has been consistently profitable since its founding in 1998 , in the heyday of the Internet bubble .
Operating with minimal inventory thanks to direct “ drop shipments ” from manufacturers to end customers , eBags could be the model for the future of commerce .
But that model is still developing .
EBags continues to expand and adapt its business .
In 2004 , the online retailer , which is based in Greenwood Village , Colo. , acquired Shoedini.com , a seller of dress shoes for men and women , and renamed it 6 pm.com .
Having expanded from its original focus on luggage into backpacks , handbags , and other accessories , eBags considered shoes the next logical category for marketing synergies .
Yet , despite the clear marketing logic , selling shoes online turned out to be more complicated than selling the other product lines .
The issue , as eBags discovered and as many online vendors have yet to understand , highlights the fundamental operational challenges of Internet retailing .
It centers on a concept common in the business - to - business realm but rarely employed in a business - to - consumer context : cost - to - serve .
Defined as the total supply chain cost from origin to destination , cost - to - serve incorporates such factors as inventory stocking , packaging , shipping , and returns processing .
This metric also helps to explain why some of the early high - flying “ e- tailers , ” such as eToys and Webvan , failed miserably .
In the eBags example , the cost of serving shoe customers is far higher than the cost of serving luggage customers .
The Shoedini acquisition more than doubled the number of SKUs that eBags handled , and the complexity of managing the inventory exploded .
Most bags come in two variations — usually different colors .
But a shoe style comes in several colors and many sizes ; there can be 30 or more variations of a single model .
Bags , furthermore , come in boxes that manufacturers use for shipping via small - package delivery to a fragmented base of mostly mom-and - pop retail customers .
But shoes ship to retailers in bulk packaging rather than in individual boxes .
When 6 pm.com sells a pair of dress loafers direct to a consumer , the manufacturer thus has to incur extra shipping and handling costs to repackage and ship the shoes .
Most important , shoes have a short product life cycle — typically three to six months — and suffer from a high return rate .
( Some customers order two pairs at a time , planning to return the pair that does n’t fit . )
Luggage life cycles can last six years , and return rates are minimal .
For eBags , this means that although shoes and luggage command similar gross margins , shoes carry a much higher cost - to - serve , and selling them online thus requires a different business model .
Understanding the cost - to - serve dynamics is more important than ever as online retailing continues its growth spurt .
More than a third of U.S. households now shop online , according to a September 2005 report from Forrester Research , and annual sales of physical goods are expected to hit $ 100 billion for the year .
Over the second decade of online retailing , the companies that truly grasp the drivers of cost - to - serve at the level of individual items and individual customers will unlock the full value - creating potential of online retailing as an alternative to — and complement of — traditional retailing .
Trial and Error
Back at the dawn of online retailing , highflyers like Value America ( an online “ department store ” ) and Webvan ( an Internet - based delivery service that focused its offerings on grocery items ) did not comprehend the operational cost implications of their business models .
Value America started with a virtual inventory model supposedly applicable to any branded product .
Although its initial offering , computer hardware , sold well , shipping and handling costs for lower - value goods proved prohibitive , and an unmanageable flood of returns ultimately sank the company in August 2000 .
Less than a year later , in July 2001 , Webvan declared bankruptcy after concluding that it would never turn a profit , despite its state - of - the - art supply chain with a hub - and - spoke network of delivery cross-docks and highly automated distribution centers .
( The flaws in its economic model were highlighted in a Booz Allen Hamilton study more than a year before its collapse .
See “ The Last Mile to Nowhere : Flaws & Fallacies in Internet Home - Delivery Schemes , ” by Tim Laseter , Pat Houston , Anne Chung , Silas Byrne , Martha Turner , and Anand Devendran , s+b , Third Quarter 2000 . )
Even Amazon.com did not fully appreciate all the factors driving its cost - to - serve .
When Jeff Bezos opened his Internet store in 1995 , he started with books , reasoning that it would be easier to offer the millions of titles in print online than through a traditional mail - order catalog .
Although Mr. Bezos may not have fully grasped all of the inefficiencies inherent in the book industry , he saw that his model could minimize inventory risk — a significant problem in book retailing .
Unlike other manufacturers , publishers take back all unsold copies of their product .
Up to 30 percent of trade books ship back to the publisher at enormous cost to everyone : to the publisher , who refunds the payment to the retailer ; to the retailer , who pays for shipping and restocking ; and indirectly to the consumer .
Amazon ’s online model minimizes the inherent inefficiency of placing potentially unsellable titles on thousands of retail bookshelves by relying instead on a relatively small inventory to support a “ virtual bookshelf . ”
If Amazon returns fewer books than a bricks - and - mortar retailer , it should be able to negotiate lower prices from the publishers ( reflecting its lower cost - to - serve as a customer of the publisher ) .
Amazon can then pass along those savings through lower prices to the consumer .
Although books worked for Amazon , toys were a different matter .
As Jeff Bezos learned , the toy supply chain comes with a much higher cost - to - serve .
Toys are more seasonal than books and demand for them is far less predictable .
Magnifying those challenges , most toys are made in Asia , and the replenishment cycle can easily outlast the actual selling season .
That means merchandisers must accurately predict which toys will be hits and then buy enough inventory for the whole season ; Amazon therefore gained no benefit from its “ virtual shelves . ”
Guessing too conservatively results in missed sales , and guessing too optimistically leads to write - offs because toy manufacturers do not typically accept returns of unsold goods .
Without any toy merchandising expertise , Amazon guessed wrong for the 1999 holiday season and wrote off $ 39 million in excess toy inventory in early 2000 , having sold only $ 95 million worth of toys .
Furthermore , conventional toy retailers enjoy advantages that traditional booksellers do n’t .
Unlike Barnes & Noble , Wal - Mart and Toys “ R ” Us ship multiple truckloads of goods to each store weekly , which puts their transportation costs far below the cost of shipping individual toys to consumers .
Recognizing these differences , Amazon gladly partnered with Toys “ R ” Us in 2000 , shifting the inventory risk to the experts but leveraging the additional product lines to lower its own shipping cost for multi-item orders .
Nonetheless , the two partners had a falling - out in 2004 , with dueling lawsuits in the New Jersey court system .
This denouement suggests that the cost - to - serve for online toy retailing produced a financial model that would not support the two parties ’ aspirations adequately .
Channels and Brands
Although successful online retailing depends on a variety of factors , the cost - to - serve of a particular product category can explain much of the variance in the penetration rates of Internet sales .
For example , according to the United States Census Bureau , in 2002 ( the latest data available ) , 44 percent of retail sales of computer hardware and software took place via the Internet .
Certainly tech - savvy computer buyers are more likely than the general population to shop online .
But equally important , the high value - to - weight ratio of computers — especially as laptops become more popular — minimizes the importance of transportation cost and makes the category a low - cost - to - serve option over the Internet .
Cost - to - serve factors like inventory , packaging , shipping , and returns help explain why online sales of books outstrip online sales of other kinds of merchandise .
E- commerce accounts for nearly 13 percent of the total bookstore and newsstand sales in the United States — $ 15 billion in 2002 ( the latest year available from the U.S. Census Bureau ) — and the same portion of the $ 21 billion market for office equipment and supplies .
By contrast , the Internet accounted for just 2.7 percent of the $ 92 billion in U.S. sales of furniture and home furnishings .
Or consider the largest retail category , food and beverages .
Online sales accounted for only two - tenths of 1 percent of the $ 450 billion U.S. food and beverage retail sales total in 2002 .
As Webvan ( and many investors ) learned , targeting a huge market does not guarantee success if the cost - to - serve economics do n’t work .
Future growth in e-commerce will likely come from continued modification of existing supply chains rather than wholesale replacement .
For example , despite the generally low level of Internet sales in furniture and housewares , Williams - Sonoma has achieved great success online .
The company , which operates a mix of retail , catalog , and Internet channels under its eponymous store brand as well as the Pottery Barn and Hold Everything brands ( among others ) , sold $ 3.1 billion in fiscal 2005 — 52 percent through its traditional retail stores and 48 percent through its two direct - to - consumer channels .
At $ 3.3 million in annual sales for its average kitchenware store , Williams - Sonoma does n’t gain any significant transportation economies in shipping to its stores rather than directly to its customers .
Ultimately , the company can maximize profits by assigning items to channels and brands to reach consumers at the lowest cost - to - serve .
Circuit City ’s Opportunity
Rather than minimizing the cost - to - serve across channels , traditional retailers often put their most popular items on their Web site .
Although such an approach sounds logical , the reverse would typically work better .
Traditional store - based retailing requires turning inventory quickly to justify expensive floor space .
Slow - moving inventory — especially products with a high risk of obsolescence — can benefit from the centralized inventory pooling of online retailing .
And if the product commands a high value - to - weight ratio , the cost penalty from direct - to - consumer shipping is minimal .
Circuit City , the “ big box ” consumer electronics and small appliances retailer , has an opportunity to minimize its cost - to - serve by making smart use of its many service options : in - store shopping , in - store or online ordering with delivery from the store , online ordering with store pickup , and online ordering with direct home delivery .
Consumer electronics is a category currently underexploited by e-commerce .
In 2002 , only 2.5 percent of electronics and appliances sales went through online channels despite the fact that many electronic goods share the high value - to - weight ratio of computer hardware and software .
Finding the optimal cost - to - serve for each product and customer category would give Circuit City a competitive advantage over pure - play online retailers or less aggressive traditional competitors .
Circuit City operates a network of nine regional distribution centers to serve its 621 domestic stores .
With average weekly sales of more than $ 300,000 per store , Circuit City generates overall cost savings from its transportation network scale .
But the relative importance of this bulk shipping network varies by product .
Consider the Hitachi 65 " HDTV Display recently offered at $ 1,299 .
It weighs 324 pounds and measures 5 - feet - by - 5 - feet with a 28 - inch depth .
Shipment of such a bulky item through the company ’s full - truckload distribution network offers significant savings over a small - package shipment directly to a consumer ’s home via UPS .
But , with relatively low unit sales and a short product life cycle , inventory held at the store represents a high cost and big risk .
Circuit City might benefit from keeping a minimum inventory of this item at the store — even just a display model — and having customers order it online for in - store pickup after the next delivery from the regional distribution network .
A pure online offering might work best for the Sony HDV camcorder .
Priced at around $ 1,999 , it is the most expensive model among the 60 - plus camcorders that Circuit City sells , and it costs three to five times the price of the most popular models .
As with the Hitachi HDTV , low unit sales of the Sony HDV camcorder may not justify stocking the item at the store because of the high inventory - carrying cost and risk of obsolescence .
But unlike the Hitachi HDTV , the camcorder weighs very little — less than two pounds — and , accordingly , Circuit City ’s distribution network provides little transportation cost savings .
Rather than stocking it at each of the nine regional distribution centers , Circuit City could gain further savings by pooling the inventory in a single national distribution center and shipping directly to customers ’ homes , minimizing the cost - to - serve for Circuit City as well as for the customer .
For each combination of customer and merchandise , there is an optimal cost - to - serve option among the different delivery choices : store inventory , store delivery , in - store pickup , and direct delivery .
For customers living far from a store , for example , even for bulky products like the HDTV , the benefits of routing the goods through a regional distribution center ( such as that maintained by Circuit City ) may be offset by the extra costs of a two - step distribution cycle , compared to the simplicity of direct home delivery .
Finding the optimal cost - to - serve at the levels of customer and item may be challenging , but it will be rewarding .
Even pure - play online retailers should consider the cost - to - serve in their pricing .
Despite having the ability to customize Web pages to each individual , few companies fully leverage the potential to price products to reflect the different underlying costs .
For example , eBags offers special pricing for bulk purchases for corporate sales , but it does not attempt to adjust shipping costs on the basis of a customer ’s geographic location .
Such fine - tuned pricing could potentially increase the company ’s profitability .
That ’s the kind of detail that retailers will have to consider as they grow their online businesses .
Accounting for Intangibles
Cost - to - serve in online retailing includes such factors as the expenses associated with inventory , transportation , and replication of the existing offerings of traditional retailers .
But to get a truer sense of cost - to - serve , it should also take into account intangible costs to the customer .
Consider the current approach to furniture retailing , one of the least customer - friendly supply chains in retailing .
Because there are so many manufacturers offering so many styles in so many woods , finishes , and fabrics , most furniture retailers display a limited selection of goods .
Customers place their orders and then wait for the couch , table , or chair to be manufactured , shipped to the retailer , and finally delivered to their homes .
The whole process regularly takes 12 or more weeks — a cost in “ pain and suffering ” that falls squarely on the customers .
Early attempts to improve on the furniture retailing process via the Internet proved daunting .
Living.com and Furniture.com , two failed Web retailers , focused on the “ consumer experience ” by investing in technology to allow shoppers to visualize the furniture in virtual mockups of their home .
These companies ’ supply chains — which , like Amazon ’s , depended on outside delivery services — proved untenable .
The challenge of scheduling precisely timed home deliveries , something Amazon ’s products typically do not demand , proved to be beyond the ability of these nascent furniture retailers .
Moreover , products often arrived damaged or unacceptable for some other reason , resulting in return rates of up to 35 percent of sales .
Despite good efforts , the “ virtual ” model failed in the furniture category .
The Amazon online model does n’t work for furniture sellers .
It would be better for them to emulate the automotive industry .
The big opportunity online for furniture retailers may lie not in eliminating storefronts , but in dramatically reducing the lead times in the order - to - delivery cycle .
Car dealers resolve the choice challenge by sharing inventory information among dealerships and exchanging vehicles to better meet a particular customer ’s desires .
Roughly half of the vehicles sold by a typical dealership come from such an exchange ; the other half come from the dealer ’s own inventory on the lot .
Similarly , with furniture , customers could check the “ look and feel ” of a display model , and the retailer would then locate the desired inventory at another store or at a centralized stock pool with delivery in days , not weeks .
Such a business model would leverage the Internet ’s information - sharing power to lower the “ cost ” of long lead times without incurring an undue level of inventory investment .
In the end , future success for retailers of furniture , electronics , luggage — any sort of retailers — wo n’t be a matter of expanding standard offerings to the burgeoning Internet channel or replicating existing online models .
Despite the obvious marketing synergies , toys present different challenges from books , and shoes different challenges from luggage .
Smart retailers will take a closer look at the costs of bringing each item to each consumer — the cost - to - serve — to decide how to merchandise their offerings and ultimately grow their business by applying the right retail model at the right time .

I ’m sitting in a big room at XTech 2006 listening to Paul Graham talk about why there are n’t more start - ups in Europe .
It ’s essentially a Thatcherite screed about why businesses should be able to get away with doing anything they want and treat employees like slaves .
In comparing Europe to the US , Guru Graham points out that the US has a large domestic market .
Fair point .
The EU — designed to be one big domestic market — suffers , he feels , by the proliferation of languages .
However , he also thinks that it wo n’t be long before Europe is all speaking one language — namely , his .
In fact , he said

Mr. Chew is a Ph.D. candidate at Arizona State University in the School of Life Sciences .
“ Global warming , ” which may regionally include cooling , drying , humidification , or changes in the seasonality of winds and precipitation , is only one dynamic factor among many contributing to the constant flux of the biosphere .
Another factor that will inevitably interact with any climate trend is the continuing redistribution of biota .
Organisms besides humans are affected by climate change , regardless of its causes .
If average temperatures rise in the Arctic Ocean and the pack ice shrinks , polar bears and some seals lose habitat .
If pack ice becomes rare enough , these animals will be at an ecological , and therefore evolutionary , disadvantage .
They might even “ blink out ” altogether .
Whenever climates shift , there are ecological “ winners and losers . ”
In extreme circumstances , everyone loses .
A large - scale glaciation simply scrapes a continental surface clean of not only almost all life , but also accumulated soil .
When the ice retreats , life returns and soil building begins again , as organisms begin penetrating from the margins .
Likewise , changing sea levels repeatedly inundate and expose low - lying areas of islands and continents , swapping terrestrial for aquatic ecosystems .
As long as there is a supply of potential biotic colonists and a transport mechanism , be it active locomotion or passive drift with winds and currents , some individual organisms , their larvae , eggs , seeds or spores , will eventually arrive just about anywhere .
A few survive to “ found ” new populations .
This kind of colonization has always been a fundamental fact of life on earth .
It is possible , even likely , that life on earth began only once , and therefore in one place .
After that , well , it got around .
Being both inclined and equipped to acquire , carry , and exchange , humans have recently become involved in this process as well .
Humans desire and facilitate changes in the environment that seem likely to be advantageous .
But purely fortuitous change is uncomfortable , even alarming .
Surprised by the arrival of new species in familiar landscapes , we speak of “ invasions ” or “ infestations . ”
But invasion is in the eye of the beholder .
Few people are inclined to describe the occupation of vast areas of North America by maize , wheat , soybeans and other field crops as “ infestation , ” even though it occurred at the expense of the prairies and woodlands formerly in residence .
And hardly anyone worries about transoceanic invasions by tigers , even though there are apparently now more tigers in the United States than in all of Asia .
What about zebra mussels in the Great Lakes ?
That was nobody ’s plan .
It ’s an invasion .
Although it seems blatantly naive today , in the mid-18th century , Karl Linnaeus thought he could turn Sweden into a self - sufficient kingdom .
He thought he could achieve this end not by milking wealth from colonies ; that opportunity had passed , and Sweden , which could n’t even establish a Baltic hegemony , never acquired substantial overseas holdings .
Instead , Linnaeus wanted to identify important crops and commercially valuable plants and animals in many parts of the world , collect them , and grow them in Scandinavia .
He planned a sort of reverse colonization by invading his homeland with exotics .
Among other things , Linnaeus hoped to raise mulberry trees , and upon them , silkworms ( reputedly carried to southern Europe from China during Justinian ’s reign ) .
But his government - backed effort collapsed .
The maladapted mulberries , like many other plants , did not cooperate .
They languished in the dark and cold of the near - arctic climate .
Decades later , investigators following Alexander von Humboldt attempted to correlate vegetation with latitude , altitude , precipitation and soils .
As 19th century explorers mapped the world in ever greater detail , botanists like Augustin and his son , Alphonse DeCandolle , in Switzerland and H.C. Watson in England mapped the ranges of European plant species , and speculated about the correspondence of plants , animals and places .
After 150 years of such efforts , Alfred Russell Wallace claimed he could divide the globe into six great regions , or realms , of animal life , and many other writers were proposing ever more detailed divisions and subdivisions .
Biogeography was a growing concern .
Early debaters concentrated on problems like “ centers of creation , ” attempting to reconcile empiricism with the Genesis account .
As information poured in regarding not only contemporary geography , but also ancient peoples and fossilized prehistory , a new big picture was developing .
Unfruitful Biblical debates gave way to accounts tracing human dispersal , the development of civilizations , and , along with them , the domestication and diffusion of agricultural plants and animals .
Within limits , species were obviously moving around .
While establishing a biogeographical baseline of sorts , most of these investigators also realized that new populations of some species were appearing , unbidden , along trade routes , around port cities and even in railroad yards .
Strangers sprouted among the detritus of industries like textile manufacturing , which imported raw materials from far - flung producers .
Downstream of fleece processing factories , exotic “ wool gardens ” blossomed .
Upon finding vast stands of European “ cardoon ” thistles growing in Patagonia , Charles Darwin concluded that the plants must be somehow “ specially favoured ” there .
And every hypothesis concerning biodiversity that followed remains a version of Darwin ’s assessment .
All else being equal , or at least nearly so , the absence of some previously limiting factor , such as a predator , a competitor , or a disease , allows some species to become established and flourish to an extent not seen in their “ native ” habitats .
Or , alternatively , the immigrant has capabilities that present new challenges to the locals : the immigrant becomes the overweening predator , competitor , or disease where none was known before .
Finally , something was new under the sun .
Organisms were entrained in the currents of human commerce .
Carried across once - impassable barriers like mountain ranges , deserts and oceans , they were deposited , to live or die wherever they found themselves .
Most , like Linnaeus ’s mulberries , were doomed by some maladaptation to a brief struggle , without issue ; others , however , seemed destined to succeed .
Some even became human “ camp - followers , ” or in the words of Alfred Crosby , our “ portmanteau biota , ” appearing in practically every human settlement .
Thus Hans Zinsser could write of Rats , Lice and History .
All this smacks of an economics lesson .
And like many economics lessons today , it involves overseas outsourcing .
The very commercial and transportation infrastructure that brings goods and materials in vast quantities from low - cost producers on one continent to consumers on another is also bearing disease organisms , fungi , seeds , eggs and spores , spiders and insects , rats and other small mammals , and sometimes reptiles and amphibians .
As exemplified by the polar bears , climate change puts the existing biota of any set “ place ” on the map at mounting risk of being selected against .
As prevailing conditions change , adaptations that once promoted survival become irrelevant or even disadvantageous .
As far as polar bears are concerned , once the ice melts , “ there is no ‘ there , ’ there . ”
When abiotic factors shift , biotic ones must shift as well .
When it happens too quickly for evolutionary adjustments to occur within populations , other populations — outside populations — better equipped to meet the new challenges may take advantage of the opportunity .
Climate change makes “ patches ” of habitat appear , disappear , or in “ time lapse ” seem to flow , amoeba - like , across the landscape .
With warming climates , alpine and polar habitats shrink , and lowland or tropical ones expand .
With cooling , the reverse occurs .
Intermediate vegetation , like evergreen forests , moves “ up and down ” and in between , along various resource gradients .
Plants and animals must move along with survivable conditions or die off .
The same applies to aquatic habitats , although the effects are stranger to contemplate .
Melting ice caps overlay dense seawater with cold freshwater .
As water temperatures change , so too do convection - induced currents .
This alters the upwelling of nutrient laden deep waters .
The Gulf Stream might change or even fail , with major consequences for Northern Europe .
Increasingly exposed to “ greenhouse ” gases , seawater ’s chemistry changes in other ways , too .
As more atmospheric CO2 dissolves , waters become more acidic .
This makes it harder for corals and mollusks to deposit the calcium carbonate of shells and reefs .
Changes thus cascade through entire ecosystems .
Rooted plants cannot move , so their offspring , as seeds , spores , or parts capable of rooting , have somehow to find their ways to more hospitable habitats .
Such dispersal of plants has long been an absorbing topic for natural historians .
Henry Ridley summarized it at length , and in detail , in 1930 .
A huge system of terms was coined to describe variations on the theme .
The general suffix used is from the Greek , “ –chory , ” “ to spread . ”
Therefore , anemochory is wind dispersal ( a dandelion seed comes to mind ) while zoochory is dispersal by an animal — inside or outside it .
Human transport is anthropochory , and whether that is considered subsidiary to zoochory will depend on whom you ask .
Johnny Appleseed notwithstanding , anthropochory is also the only form of dispersal that seems readily susceptible to moral censure .
Customs officers and state - line vehicle inspectors are in charge of upholding society ’s judgments on this issue .
Transporters of agricultural weeds and plant diseases are frowned upon .
Upon detection , inadvertent carriers are lectured ; smugglers are cited or jailed .
At the same time , however , there remains a huge transoceanic and transcontinental trade , not only in fruits , nuts , and other produce , but also in nursery stock , cuttings and seeds .
Since ( and even before ) Linnaeus , opportunists have looked for ways to move plants from continent to continent and island to island , in order to become producers rather than consumers .
On his second voyage , Christopher Columbus carried with him numerous old - world fruit trees , domestic animals and vegetable seeds for provisioning his would - be colonists .
Captain Bligh was transporting breadfruit trees on H.M.S. Bounty .
Rubber production was a Brazilian monopoly until rubber tree seeds were “ smuggled ” to Kew Gardens and thence to Malaysia and Ceylon .
Almost every commercially grown crop has been substantially relocated in such fashion .
In 1898 the U.S. Department of Agriculture even opened an Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction whose function was not to inspect , but to seek and collect plants for production by American farmers and horticulturists .
Its most zealous employee , supervisor , and collector was David Fairchild , son - in - law to Alexander Graham Bell .
Fairchild proudly claimed general responsibility for bringing 200,000 varieties of plants to the United States .
British colonists in Australia and New Zealand were long dedicated to importing crops and game animals and “ amenity species ” like songbirds and garden flowers from “ back home . ”
Citizens of post - colonial Australia and New Zealand , belatedly developing a nationalistic sense of nature , are now dedicated to wiping out precisely those same species their ancestors had previously striven to establish .
However , these countries are scarcely the same as they were before the introduction of species from back home , and in the words of Australian Tim Low , there are no “ final answers , only unfolding stories . ”
So anthropochory can be intentional or accidental , celebrated or deplored .
Occasionally , we firmly deplore a previously applauded case , like carp , house sparrows , kudzu , multiflora rose , buffelgrass , or even English ivy .
But we are just learning to wonder about such cases in terms of climate change .
Is global warming “ specially favoring ” any of the thousands of biotic immigrants ?
Can we exploit these effects ?
Can we anticipate them ?
Should we ?
Glib schemes to farm ever higher latitudes tell only part of the story .
If anthropogenic climate change accelerates habitat shifting to a pace that other “ chories ” cannot match , we might even find ourselves moving “ wild ’ plants and animals to new locations , getting them established , and tending them .
Going beyond “ restoration ” and growing wilderness to order could become another branch of agriculture .
It is already passé to speak of a “ state ” of the world .
Like it or not , all is flux .
For the foreseeable future , rapid biogeographical change , linked to climatic dynamics and facilitated by commerce may well be the norm .
If reining in the climate proves too difficult , at least redistributing biota will be a familiar exercise .
Not easy , but familiar .
In a changing world , even that kind of familiarity has a certain appeal .
I discovered the importance of paperclips in first grade .
One day at lunchtime , my friend Brad gathered a few of us geeky types together on the playground and solemnly handed each of us a small , shiny object .
“ These , ” he said , “ are paperclip communicators .
You must carry them with you at all times and guard them carefully : these are the only ones of their kind . ”
He went on to explain that using these special communicators , which merely looked like paperclips , we could talk to each other from a distance .
The next morning , a few of us arrived at school early , before Brad got there .
We decided to call him on our paperclip communicators .
We did n’t hear a reply , but perhaps we just were n’t listening carefully enough .
A few minutes later when Brad walked in , we asked if he ’d heard us .
“ Oh yes , ” he said , “ I heard you on my paperclip communicator when I was riding the bus . ”
Well , that settled it : there could be no doubt that we were in possession of some powerful technology .
I proudly wore my paperclip communicator on my belt .
A few weeks later , though , it disappeared .
I looked everywhere , but could n’t find it .
In tears , I told my mother what had happened .
She did n’t seem upset ; she simply reached into a drawer and handed me another paperclip .
“ No ! ” I shouted .
“ It ’s not the same thing !
That ’s just an ordinary paperclip .
Brad could n’t hear me if I talked into that ! ”
For days I was inconsolable at my loss , and deeply frustrated that my mother could n’t tell the obvious difference between a paperclip communicator and a bent piece of wire .
Brad , of course , could n’t help me : there were no more paperclip communicators to be had .
Little Things Mean a Lot
About twenty - five years later , I started working for a computer accessories company called Kensington , which is a business unit of ACCO Brands — a major office - products manufacturer .
I knew that ACCO made products like paperclips and binders , but what I did not know until I ’d worked there for several years was that ACCO was originally short for “ American Clip Company . ”
The humble paperclip was largely responsible for the initial success of what is today a gigantic and extremely profitable business .
( There is , I should mention , a school of thought according to which this fastener ’s name should be rendered as two words : paper clip .
My opinion is that , inasmuch as the purpose of the object is to join things , it ’s only right to join the words , too . )
Where did this simple , cheap , and indispensable invention come from ?
Appropriately , the story is twisted .
As recently as the late 19th century , the most common way to hold papers together was by using a straight pin .
This was an inexpensive and functional solution — and , unlike staples , easily removable .
It did , however , leave holes in the paper ( and occasionally in the finger ) .
But as steel wire became more common , inventors began to notice that it had just the right amount of springiness to be formed into various sorts of effective cliplike devices .
In the years just prior to 1900 , quite a few paperclip designs emerged — both in the U.S. and in Europe .
Some were patented , some not .
There was at the time , and still is now , considerable disagreement about who devised which particular type of wire loop when .
The Norwegian Clipper
The name most frequently associated with the invention of the paperclip is Johan Vaaler , a Norwegian inventor who received patents on several designs — from Germany in 1899 and from the U.S. in 1901 .
However , Vaaler ’s clips were by no means the first , nor are they the same as what we think of today as the paperclip — they did not have an interior loop .
The familiar double - U design was devised by Gem Manufacturing Ltd. in England ; this clip is therefore sometimes known as the Gem clip .
( Incidentally , despite the fact that ACCO made a name for itself with paperclips , the so - called ACCO Fastener is not a paperclip ; it ’s a two - pronged brass fastener that was invented in 1912 . )
Because the Gem clip itself was never patented , we do n’t know exactly when it first appeared .
Some sources speculate that it may have been as early as 1890 ; in any case , it was certainly well before Vaaler ’s first patent in 1899 .
In that year , a Connecticut man named William Middlebrook patented a machine for bending Gem - style clips .
Such a device would be crucial to the paperclip ’s success , as it would enable the clips to be manufactured much more quickly and inexpensively .
Clip Will Keep Us Together
Despite the fact that Norway holds a rather dubious claim as the birthplace of the paperclip , it played an important historical role there .
During World War II , when the German army occupied Norway , they forbade citizens to wear any likeness of the king , or even his initials .
So instead , people began to wear paperclips on their lapels — symbolizing both national pride and “ sticking together . ”
When the Nazis realized that paperclips were a sign of solidarity against the occupation , they outlawed the practice .
Later , a giant paperclip statue was erected in Oslo to honor Vaaler — even though his design was never actually manufactured .
The Gem clip ( by whatever name ) is , of course , just one of many modern paperclip designs .
Some competing clips have little or no tendency to become tangled with each other .
But this seeming advantage has n’t kept the Gem design from becoming synonymous with “ paperclip ” and holding the top position by far , to this day , in worldwide sales .
As for the paperclip communicator … unfortunately , it has n’t been manufactured since 1973 .

Reg Reader Workshop
It 's amazing how many people who have Microsoft Windows everywhere look flummoxed when asked whether Windows is their " standard " for desktop computing .
The reason they are thrown by this question is typically because they have n't thought about it that way before .
In all likelihood , they never actually made a proactive decision to select Windows , in the sense of looking at alternatives and making a conscious objective choice .
So how did they end up with it ?
It 's an example of a phenomenon that we come across time and time again when looking at how people have arrived at the IT landscapes they have today , and if you explore it a little further , it becomes clear the key to a lot of Microsoft 's success is establishing as many of its products as possible as the " default " when it comes to decision making .
Just like the default value for a field on a form or a column in a database is the value used when you do n't specify anything else , so Microsoft Windows , Office , SharePoint and so on are the defaults used in the absence of any alternative being explicitly selected in their respective domains .
A few conversations with " alternative " vendors who bump into Microsoft in various ways have highlighted the phenomenon to us recently .
One of these is a company called Recommind , which you may not have heard of unless you are in the legal profession , but has been very successful at delivering enterprise search solutions into big law firms and the legal departments of large pharmaceutical companies and the like .
During a chat with Craig Carpenter , VP of marketing , the question was raised of whether we were seeing lots of organisations standardising on the enterprise search capability embedded in SharePoint , as Recommind is beginning to spread its wings beyond legal into the broader enterprise search arena .
When we pointed out that it was more a case of defaulting than standardisation , we got into discussing the challenges faced by vendors in differentiating their specialist solutions when people have already ticked the box for a particular area of functionality based on some Microsoft capability that has become pervasive by , well , default .
Other conversations have gone in the same direction .
Meridio , for example , which overlays a pretty complete set of compliance capability over the top of SharePoint is constantly having to explain that when Microsoft ticks the " auditing " box on the product spec sheet , that does n't mean that all of your compliance needs are dealt with .
Similarly , we recently spoke with Spotfire , a vendor with a very nice platform for publishing intuitive analytical capability to a broad audience , and the story there was the difficulty in explaining that Excel is not the be - all - and - end - all of data analysis .
Standard settings
Standing back a little , there are basically two schools of thought on the Microsoft default phenomenon .
One says that it is outrageous that unthinking people let Microsoft get away with it by simply " going with the flow " and not bothering to even look at alternatives .
Others take the more pragmatic view that you might as well accept the Microsoft default in many areas as it will probably do or is already doing the job , and this frees you up to focus your time and resources on more pressing and challenging areas where selecting the right solution really does matter .
To put it another way , when the business is screaming for new functionality to support the call centre , the supply chain , or to deal with the latest set of regulations to hit your industry , can you really justify taking time out to explore the merits of Desktop Linux over Windows , or OpenOffice over Microsoft Office , let alone undertaking a potentially costly and disruptive desktop migration ?
But before we run away with the idea that the Microsoft option is always just the " good enough " default , we have to be aware that while it sometimes takes time for the Redmond giant to get there , when it does , what it comes up with is often very good .
Some of the stuff it is doing in the areas of systems management , business intelligence , collaboration , and so on shows it can compete with best of breed players on a function by function basis , not necessarily everywhere , but in enough places to keep customers on board and gradually expand that default footprint .
What exactly is good enough ?
In the meantime , the reality is that many vendors have come to the conclusion that it is not worth trying to fight the Microsoft default phenomenon – it's far more effective to just accept and work around it .
Recommind , for example , will happily snuggle its advanced search engine into a SharePoint environment , and Meridio compliance functionality is designed to be embedded into Microsoft Office .
Even strategic competitors play this game too , e.g. IBM 's latest Sametime unified communications solution is designed to integrate seamlessly into a Microsoft as well as Lotus environment on the basis that it is n't likely to convert the world from Exchange and Outlook to Domino and Notes any time soon .
The tricky question in all this is knowing when it makes sense to go with the Microsoft flow and when to stop , think , and evaluate .
This is obviously a function of circumstances and the problem at hand .
In our recent BI research , for example , we found that as organisations were looking to deliver management information out to a broader audience , it made sense to acknowledge that generic office tools , Microsoft Office in the vast majority of cases , were going to be the most common delivery mechanism .
But what do you think on this whole topic ?
Are there areas like desktop operating systems where a pervasive default is a good thing to drive consistency , economies with regard to skill sets , etc ?
Are there areas where the default phenomenon is definitely not desirable ?
And what about other vendors like Cisco that 's so often the default for networking , Sage for small business accounting , etc ?
We 'd appreciate your views in the discussion below . ®
Childhood obesity rates are rising
The research , published in the journal Pediatrics , adds to mounting evidence suggesting childhood obesity is causing the trend of earlier puberty in girls .
Studies suggest girls who reach puberty earlier than the " normal " age of 10 and above also start drinking alcohol and begin having sexual intercourse sooner .
UK experts said early puberty could cause girls significant distress .
They are also at increased risk of certain cancers , including breast cancer .
Rights of passage
The " normal " age for a girl to show the first signs of puberty is generally accepted as 10 and above .
But Dr Joyce Lee and colleagues at the University of Michigan Health System found many girls , who had been overweight as children and toddlers , reached puberty aged nine .
Fat and hormones
Of the 354 girls they followed from the age of three up to 12 , almost half ( 168 ) showed signs of puberty - breast development - by their ninth birthday .
Many of these girls had a high ' body mass index ' - a calculation of metric weight divided by height squared , which doctors use as a measure of obesity - throughout their childhood .
The University of Michigan study follows University of Bristol research in 2000 which suggested one girl in six reaches puberty before the age of eight - 18 months earlier than their mothers .
One theory is that puberty is triggered by the hormone leptin , which is produced by fat tissue .
We are seeing girls of seven , eight and nine who are starting their periods and going through puberty
Helen Crocker , research dietician at University College London
Dr Lee explained : " Previous studies had found that girls who have earlier puberty tend to have higher body mass index , but it was unclear whether puberty led to the weight gain or weight gain led to the earlier onset of puberty .
" Our study offers evidence that it is the latter . "
Researchers at the Karolinska Institute are investigating whether animals that are overfed produce more of the male and female sexual hormones that trigger puberty .
Helen Crocker , research dietician at University College London , said : " In our clinics we are seeing girls of seven , eight and nine who are starting their periods and going through puberty .
It can be pretty distressing for them .
" It 's another good reason for tackling the wider issue of childhood obesity . "

HUMAN STEM CELL TRANSPLANTS REPAIR RAT SPINAL CORDS
Human nerve stem cells transplanted into rats ’ damaged spinal cords have survived , grown and in some cases connected with the rats ’ own spinal cord cells in a Johns Hopkins laboratory , overturning the long - held notion that spinal cords wo n’t allow nerve repair .
A report on the experiments will be published online this week at PLoS Medicine and “ establishes a new doctrine for regenerative neuroscience , ” says Vassilis Koliatsos , M.D. , associate professor of neuropathology at Johns Hopkins .
“ The spinal cord , a part of the nervous system that is thought of as incapable of repairing itself , can support the development of transplanted cells , ” he added .
“ We do n’t yet know whether the connections we ’ve seen can transmit nerve signals to the degree that a rat could be made to walk again , ” says Koliatsos , “ We ’re still in the proof of concept stage , but we ’re making progress and we ’re encouraged . ”
In their experiments , the scientists gave anesthetized rats a range of spinal cord injuries to lesion or kill motor neurons or performed sham surgeries .
They varied experimental conditions to see if the presence or absence of spinal cord lesions had an effect on the survival and maturation of human stem cell grafts .
Two weeks after lesion or sham surgery , they injected human neural stem cells into the left side of each rat ’s spinal cord .
After six months , the team found more than three times the number of human cells than they injected in the damaged cords , meaning the transplanted cells not only survived but divided at least twice to form more cells .
Moreover , says Koliatsos , the cells not only grew in the area around the original injection , but also migrated over a much larger spinal cord territory .
Three months after injection , the researchers found evidence that some of the transplanted cells developed into support cells rather than nerve cells , while the majority became mature nerve cells .
High - powered microscopic examination showed that these nerve cells appear to have made contacts with the rat ’s own spinal cord cells .
The research was funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins .
Authors on the paper are Jun Yan , Leyan Xu , Annie M. Welsh , Glen Hatfield and Koliatsos , all of Hopkins , and Thomas Hazel and Karl Johe of Neuralstem of Rockville , Md .

The Curious Case of the Supposed MacBook Wi-Fi Hack
So remember a few weeks ago when Brian Krebs posted a report titled “ Hijacking a MacBook in 60 Seconds or Less ” on his Washington Post computer security weblog ?
He reported on a supposed Wi-Fi security exploit demonstrated at the Black Hat security conference , wherein “ security researchers ” Jon Ellch and David Maynor hacked into a MacBook via Wi-Fi .
Krebs ’s shoddy reporting left several essential questions unanswered , which I raised on August 3 .
Namely :
Maynor and Ellch ’s demonstration video showed the MacBook — the target of their “ attack ” — using a USB - dongle Wi-Fi card .
Given that every MacBook comes with a built - in AirPort Wi-Fi card , the central question of this entire saga is whether that built - in AirPort card is similarly vulnerable .
Krebs reported that they used a third - party card and driver in their demonstration because “ Apple had leaned on Maynor and Ellch pretty hard not to make this an issue about the Mac drivers ” .
Who at Apple “ leaned on ” them ?
And what does “ leaned on ” them actually mean ?
Before proceeding , it ’s worth clarifying a few terms here : card , driver , and third - party .
A card is the wireless networking hardware ; e.g. the AirPort card built into every Apple notebook , or the external USB dongle Maynor plugged into the MacBook in his demo .
A driver is software that allows an operating system to communicate with a piece of hardware .
Modern operating systems — Mac OS X , Windows , and Linux distributions — all ship with standard drivers for all sorts of hardware .
For any hardware that your operating system does not already have a driver for , however , you need to install a driver before the hardware will work .
For example , Mac OS X ships with a USB mouse driver that “ just works ” with any standard USB mouse that you plug in , but Apple updated this driver when they shipped the Mighty Mouse to add support for its specific features .
AirPort “ just works ” because Mac OS X ships with drivers for all of the various AirPort cards that Apple has ever shipped .
When Mac users connect to a Wi -Fi network , they normally do so using the built - in AirPort card and the built - in AirPort driver , where by “ normally ” I mean “ almost always ” .
Third - party refers to a component — hardware or software — that is not produced or officially supported by your computer manufacturer or operating system supplier .
In the case of the MacBook , a third - party card would be any Wi-Fi card other than the one pre-installed inside the machine by Apple .
A third - party driver would be any software used to control a Wi-Fi card other than the drivers installed as part of Mac OS X .
You might think this is a silly thing to clarify , but Krebs himself is creating confusion with his use of the term , on the grounds that some of the code in the drivers that Apple ships with Mac OS X are written by programmers at the companies that make the Wi-Fi chipsets used in Apple ’s AirPort - brand cards .
Do not be confused : if the driver is supplied by Apple and supported by Apple , it is not “ third - party software ” .
The central point here is that for this particular exploit to be of any concern whatsoever to MacBook users , it would have to work against the MacBook ’s built - in card using Mac OS X ’s built - in driver .
Using a third - party card — as Maynor clearly and admittedly did in their video demonstration — makes the issue moot to any Mac user using the built - in card .
But the same goes for the driver — if Maynor and Ellch can demonstrate an attack that works against the MacBook ’s built - in card , but which requires a third - party software driver , that ’s equally moot .
What We Know
SecureWorks ( slogan : “ The Information Security Experts ” ) is the security group where Maynor is employed as a researcher .
As of Thursday , their web page devoted to this vulnerability contained the following disclaimer ( emphasis added ) :
This video presentation at Black Hat demonstrates vulnerabilities found in wireless device drivers .
Although an Apple MacBook was used as the demo platform , it was exploited through a third - party wireless device driver — not the original wireless device driver that ships with the MacBook .
As part of a responsible disclosure policy , we are not disclosing the name of the third - party wireless device driver until a patch is available .
What ’s notable about this disclosure is that it is about the driver .
We already know , just from watching the demonstration video , that it was also based on a third - party card .
This means that either ( a ) the exploit they discovered uses neither the MacBook ’s built - in card nor Mac OS X ’s built - in driver ; ( b ) the exploit they discovered works against both the third - party driver demonstrated in the video and against Apple ’s standard driver , and they have inexplicably decided to post this disclaimer to explicitly describe only what is being demonstrated in the video ; or ( c ) that the “ experts ” at SecureWorks do not understand the difference between a driver and a card .
My money is on ( a ) .
The reason this is notable is that if ( a ) is true ( that the vulnerability they discovered does not apply to the standard AirPort driver software from Apple ) it entirely contradicts Brian Krebs ’s original and much - publicized story .
Krebs wrote ( emphasis added ) :
The video shows Ellch and Maynor targeting a specific security flaw in the Macbook ’s [ sic ] wireless “ device driver , ” the software that allows the internal wireless card to communicate with the underlying OS X operating system .
While those device driver flaws are particular to the MacBook — and presently not publicly disclosed —
Maynor said the two have found at least two similar flaws in device drivers for wireless cards either designed for or embedded in machines running the Windows OS .
Still , the presenters said they ultimately decided to run the demo against a Mac due to what Maynor called the “ Mac user base aura of smugness on security . ”
In response to SecureWorks ’s admission that their demonstration did not exploit the built - in driver , Apple on Friday released a statement regarding the supposed vulnerability .
Lynn Fox , Apple ’s director of Mac PR , told Macworld :
“ Despite SecureWorks being quoted saying the Mac is threatened by the exploit demonstrated at Black Hat , they have provided no evidence that in fact it is .
To the contrary , the SecureWorks demonstration used a third party USB 802.11 device — not the 802.11 hardware in the Mac — a device which uses a different chip and different software drivers than those on the Mac .
Further , SecureWorks has not shared or demonstrated any code in relation to the Black Hat - demonstrated exploit that is relevant to the hardware and software that we ship . ”
Fox ’s statement on behalf of Apple is unequivocal : Maynor and Ellch ’s exploit involves neither the MacBook ’s standard Wi-Fi hardware card or software driver .
That , of course , does not mean that Apple ’s standard driver is n’t somehow similarly vulnerable , but if it is , Maynor and Ellch have not demonstrated such a vulnerability to Apple , according to Fox .
Further , Bill McFarland , the chief technical office of Atheros Communications , the company that produces the built - in AirPort chipsets Apple includes in every MacBook , sent the following message to Brian Krebs via email :
Atheros has not been contacted by SecureWorks and Atheros has not received any code or other proof demonstrating a security vulnerability in our chips or wireless drivers used in any laptop computers .
We believe SecureWorks ’ modified statement and the flaws revealed in its presentation and methodology demonstrates only a security vulnerability in the wireless USB adapter they used in the demo , not in the laptop ’s internal Wi -Fi card .
Again , this statement is unequivocal .
The chief technical officer of the company that makes the MacBook AirPort cards — and , I believe , that writes at least some of the source code for the drivers that Apple uses — says that Maynor and Ellch have n’t even contacted them , let alone disclosed any actual flaws in their card or driver .
But back on August 3 , in a follow - up to his original “ Hijacking a MacBook in 60 Seconds or Less ” , Krebs wrote :
During the course of our interview , it came out that Apple had leaned on Maynor and Ellch pretty hard not to make this an issue about the Mac drivers — mainly because Apple had not fixed the problem yet .
Maynor acknowledged that he used a third - party wireless card in the demo so as not to draw attention to the flaw resident in Macbook drivers .
But he also admitted that the same flaws were resident in the default Macbook wireless device drivers , and that those drivers were identically exploitable .
And that is what I reported .
I stand by my own reporting , as according to Maynor and Ellch it remains a fact that the default Macbook drivers are indeed exploitable .
So at the beginning of August , Maynor and Ellch told Krebs that the default MacBook drivers were exploitable , but would not , even on video , demonstrate an exploit against them publicly .
As of last Thursday , however , their SecureWorks web site explicitly states that their video demonstration does not involve Apple ’s default drivers , and both Apple and Atheros issued unequivocal statements that Maynor and Ellch have not provided Apple with any evidence showing a flaw in Apple ’s drivers .
The Central , as Yet Unanswered Question
This entire saga boils down to one simple question : Have Maynor and Ellch discovered a vulnerability against MacBooks using Apple ’s built - in AirPort cards and drivers ?
Given all the facts laid out in the previous section , you might at first think this question has been answered , and that the answer is “ no ” , but unless I ’m missing something , this is , inexplicably , still an open question .
Maynor and Ellch ’s recent statement on the SecureWorks web site declares that their video demonstration does not involve Apple ’s driver ; that is not the same thing as declaring that they have not also identified an exploit against Apple ’s driver which is not demonstrated in the video .
They have been conspicuously silent on this specific point , other than Maynor ’s statement to Krebs earlier this month that Apple ’s drivers are “ identically exploitable ” ( which are Krebs ’s words , not a direct quote from Maynor ) .
We do have enough facts , however , to know with certainty that some of our protagonists will not emerge with their reputations intact .
Someone , clearly , is either lying or incompetent ( or both ) .
For example , from Apple ’s statement on Friday , we know that if Maynor and Ellch have identified an exploit against a stock MacBook , that they have not yet contacted Apple ( or Atheros ) with details about the vulnerability — which is both enormously irresponsible for ostensibly professional security researchers , and which contradicts statements they previously made to Brian Krebs that they had been in contact with Apple regarding their discoveries .
Or , if they have contacted Apple , the statement issued by Apple ’s Lynn Fox is flat - out false and Apple has committed an enormous , almost incomprehensibly foolish mistake , because such a mendacious lie will prove far worse for Apple than divulging a Wi -Fi exploit that , if it actually exists , is surely going to come to light soon anyway .
I.e. why would Apple lie about this if Maynor could call them on it ?
On the other hand , if Maynor and Ellch have not identified an exploit that works against Apple ’s standard MacBook card and driver , then the only possible explanation for what Brian Krebs has reported — that Maynor told him that the default MacBook drivers are “ identically exploitable ” to those used in their video — is that either ( a ) Maynor and Ellch are liars and frauds ; ( b ) Brian Krebs is an incompetent hack who grossly and utterly misquoted and misstated what Maynor had told him ; or ( c ) Krebs was in over his head and did not understand the issues he was reporting on .
( A ) seems the most likely explanation here ; if ( b ) or ( c ) were the case — i.e. that Maynor had not told Krebs that the MacBook ’s default driver was identically or even similarly vulnerable , surely Maynor would have spoken out to set the record straight and call Krebs out on his error — a simple “ Hey , I did n’t say what Brian Krebs has reported that I said ” would have sufficed .
That has n’t happened .
I thus see no way out of this where Maynor and Ellch escape with their reputations intact , other than if they have in fact discovered a vulnerability against the stock MacBook card and driver , that they have disclosed their findings privately to Apple , and that the statement issued Friday by Apple ’s Lynn Fox is in fact scurrilously false .
But even in this scenario — which as I see it is the best case for Maynor and Ellch — if they know for certain that MacBooks , as shipped by Apple , are vulnerable , why have they not plainly said so ?
I ’m not saying they should have publicly described the nature of the vulnerability in any detail , but they certainly should have stated clearly that owners of whatever specific Macintoshes they have identified flaws against should be careful when turning on AirPort in any public or non-trusted environment .
In short , either Maynor and Ellch have discovered an exploit against a stock MacBook and Apple has decided , incomprehensibly , to scurrilously besmirch their reputations with flat - out lies that will soon be disproved and will bring disgrace to Apple Computer , or , Maynor and Ellch have not discovered such an exploit and they are , at best , gross exaggerators , or , at worst ( and more likely in my opinion ) , outright frauds .
Brian Krebs Has ‘ Dugg ’ Himself a Mighty Deep Hole
The Washington Post ’s Brian Krebs seems to have painted himself into a particularly uncomfortable corner .
It was Krebs who broke the original story , and it was Krebs who gave it the made - for - Digg headline “ Hijacking a MacBook in 60 Seconds or Less ” .
It was Krebs who then wrote , in a follow - up :
During the course of our interview , it came out that Apple had leaned on Maynor and Ellch pretty hard not to make this an issue about the Mac drivers — mainly because Apple had not fixed the problem yet .
Maynor acknowledged that he used a third - party wireless card in the demo so as not to draw attention to the flaw resident in Macbook drivers .
But he also admitted that the same flaws were resident in the default Macbook wireless device drivers , and that those drivers were identically exploitable .
And that is what I reported .
I stand by my own reporting , as according to Maynor and Ellch it remains a fact that the default Macbook drivers are indeed exploitable .
It is becoming more and more clear that the reporting Krebs “ stands by ” is false .
Maynor and Ellch , I believe , have discovered no such exploit against a stock MacBook .
And if I ’m right , not only has Krebs blown the story with regard to the security of the MacBook , he has also impugned the integrity of Apple by publishing the claim that the company “ leaned on ” Maynor and Ellch — an accusation Krebs published without evidence , without details regarding what exactly constituted “ leaning on ” , and without comment from Apple .
Last week , on Tuesday August 15 , Krebs published a third weblog entry on the topic , in which he began :
I ’ve received an overwhelming amount of hate mail from Mac enthusiasts over two previous posts on a wireless - device - driver presentation at the Black Hat hacker conference , with people accusing me of all kinds of nasty things .
Where by “ hate mail ” Krebs apparently means “ criticism ” , and where by “ nasty things ” he apparently means “ shitty reporting ” .
This is one of the oldest tricks in the hack tech writer book :
Because , yes , some small number of devoted Mac users are in fact kooks , when you begin receiving criticism after publishing some sort of false or inaccurate analysis regarding the Mac or Apple , you just dismiss it all on the grounds that all Mac users are irrational cultists who simply can’t stand to see their beloved company or OS criticized .
Krebs continues :
I ’ve been asked this many times , so let me make this crystal clear : I had the opportunity to see a live version of the demo Maynor gave to a public audience the next day .
In the video shown at Black Hat , he plugged a third - party USB wireless card into the Macbook — but in the demo Maynor showed me personally , he exploited the Macbook without any third - party wireless card plugged in .
And then he follows this undeniably bold claim with a transcript of a taped interview he conducted with Maynor , while Maynor performed this demonstration using the built - in AirPort card .
Krebs did not ask several very obvious questions regarding this demonstration .
For example : Had Maynor diddled at all with the wireless drivers on the MacBook to make this work ?
Had he diddled with the default network settings ?
Could Maynor demonstrate this exploit on a MacBook supplied by Krebs ?
Not asking these questions indicates that Krebs is incompetent to write about computer security issues .
It ’s like watching a magician perform a trick using his own deck of cards , and then not only not asking to see the trick performed with a deck of cards as - yet untouched by the magician , but not even asking whether the cards had been tampered with .
The most interesting part of the transcript is this exchange ( emphasis mine ) :
Krebs : Explain to me exactly what you ’re exploiting in here .
Is it a flaw in the Macbook itself ?
Maynor :
Yes , it ’s a device driver .
The thing is , there ’s a flaw in the OS , but I do n’t want to specifically point to it , so in the video you ’ll see I used a third - party USB device .
What I ’m trying to do is highlight the problems in device drivers themselves , not any one particular flaw .
[ Maynor misspoke here , and I later clarified this point with him .
The wireless device driver that powers the internal wireless card on the Macbook contains flaws that — when exploited — give the attacker the ability to create or delete files , or modify system settings .
The flaw is in fact in the Macbook ’s wireless device driver , which is made by a third party .
So again , to be clear , the flaw is not , as he suggests in the transcript of this interview , in the Mac OS X operating system itself . ]
The bracketed section is an editorial aside from Krebs , who seems deeply confused as to what constitutes “ third - party ” drivers .
Even if portions or the entirety of the MacBook ’s AirPort driver are written by engineers at a company other than Apple ( like , say , Atheros , the producers of the chipset ) , if it ’s the software that drives the built - in card , and it is installed as a standard component in Mac OS X , and Apple is the company that offers support for the driver — then it is not third - party software .
The built - in AirPort drivers are part of Mac OS X.1
Curiously , at the end of this transcript , Krebs provides a link to a PowerPoint file created by Maynor and Ellch , containing “ slides responding to some of the questions they ’d heard from Mac users , ” which they apparently presented at DefCon , their second appearance to give this talk .
There are only six slides in the file , the last of which reads :
[ Q :] I saw some people quote you as saying the bug is in the built - in in card and other people quote you as saying as its [ sic ] not , who is right ? [ A :]
They both are .
The exploit shown in the video was targeting a specific third party driver and that same vulnerability does not affect the built in [ sic ] card .
We are , however , doing ongoing research on the built - in card as well and have shared our findings with Apple .
So “ both ” are right , but they have n’t found an exploit against the Apple card and driver — just “ ongoing research ” ?
Tell me that does n’t sound like , “ We ’re trying to find an exploit that works against the MacBook ’s built - in driver and card , but have n’t found one yet . ”
Krebs goes further off the rails in the comment thread attached to this article .
After Macworld published Lynn Fox ’s statement on behalf of Apple , a reader named James Bailey called it out in the comments , asking Krebs to justify the discrepancy between what he had reported — that Maynor and Ellch had discovered a vulnerability in Apple ’s products and reported it to Apple ( and had in turn been “ leaned on ” to keep quiet about it ) — and Apple ’s unequivocal statement they had n’t seen or heard squat from Maynor and Ellch regarding an exploit against the MacBook .
Krebs responded ( Krebs ’s weblog does not offer per-comment permalinks , alas ) :
James — and you think that Macworld articles adds anything to this because why ?
You should spend a little bit of time looking at what Apple is actually claiming , and what they ’re not talking about here .
Apple ’s PR people are basically pointing out exactly what I ’ve said for the past two posts on this issue — that Maynor et .
al indeed used a third - party USB card in the video .
What Krebs is doing here is accusing Apple spokesperson Lynn Fox of speaking in precise “ it depends what the meaning of the word ‘ is ’ is ” - style legalese .
But Fox ’s statement did not end with her reiteration of the fact that their video demonstration involved a third - party card ( which is a fact that is not disputed by anyone who has watched the video — Maynor makes it explicitly clear in the demonstration video that he ’s using a USB wireless card ) .
Fox continued by adding : “ Further , SecureWorks has not shared or demonstrated any code in relation to the Black Hat - demonstrated exploit that is relevant to the hardware and software that we ship . ”
That ’s the part of Apple ’s statement that contradicts Krebs ’s reporting .
Krebs continues :
SecureWorks is claiming that despite Apple ’s claims to the contrary , that the company is shipping Mac products with vulnerable wireless device drivers .
What Apple has not addressed in any kind of detail is whether or not the embedded drivers in the Macbook are vulnerable .
All of their response so far is aimed at the demo showed in the video publicly .
Not true .
The second part of Fox ’s statement is that Maynor and Ellch “ have not shared or demonstrated any code ” with Apple related to this supposed exploit .
As for why Apple has not addressed “ whether or not the embedded drivers in the Macbook are vulnerable ” — it ’s because they do n’t know , because , and I ’ll repeat this again , one last time , Apple says Maynor and Ellch have n’t shared a demonstration or code with them .
If there is a vulnerability , Apple ca n’t confirm it because Maynor and Ellch have n’t shared it with them .
If there is not a vulnerability , Apple ca n’t know for certain that this is the case — for all Apple knows , Maynor and Ellch have identified an exploit against the MacBook ’s built - in driver and card , but have , for whatever reason , not yet come forward with it .
And since they do n’t know , they ca n’t say , “ There is no vulnerability in our product ” .
What they do know is what they did say : that they have n’t seen code or a demo from Maynor and Ellch .
That this sort of basic middle - school - level logic should need to be painstakingly spelled out for the computer security columnist for the Washington Post is astounding .
Finally , on Friday , 16 days after his original post , the cracks began to show in Krebs ’s “ I stand by my own reporting ” facade .
He published this fourth post on the topic , headlined “ Follow - Up to the Macbook [ sic ] Post ” .
2
After publishing the statement from Lynn Fox which he had callously dismissed as little more than devilish PR corporate ass - covering double - speak the day before , Krebs wrote :
I have several times now asked SecureWorks to share with me more specific information to back up their claims , but so far I have received no further details .
If I hear back from SecureWorks with any more material information , I will update the blog .
Translation : “ I no longer stand by my own reporting . ”
Alternative translation : “ Oh boy am I fucked . ”
Krebs then added this intriguing bit , which I ’ll return to later :
Apple ’s
Fox said that prior to the Black Hat demo , SecureWorks did contact Apple about a wireless flaw in FreeBSD , the open - source code upon which Apple ’s OS X operating system is based .
In January , FreeBSD released a patch to fix the problem , which according to the accompanying advisory , related to a flaw in the way FreeBSD systems scanned for wireless networks that could be exploited to allow attackers to take complete control over the targeted machine . [ … ]
Fox also said Apple staff were already aware of the flaw when SecureWorks contacted them about it prior to their Black Hat presentation , and that Apple had already determined that the wireless flaw addressed in the FreeBSD patch was not exploitable on any of the Mac products .
“ SecureWorks has not be able to exploit this for us , ” Fox said .
“ No one has been able to show us a way to exploit our internal [ wireless ] device drivers with that flaw . ”
So Krebs , albeit belatedly , finally now seems suspicious of the claims Maynor and Ellch had made to him previously , which claims he reported without verification .
But so is it just me , or does the headline Krebs chose for this mea culpa — “ Follow - up to the Macbook Post ” — seem slightly less provocative than the headline he chose for his original post in the series — “ Hijacking a Macbook in 60 Seconds or Less ” ?
A more reciprocally sensational ( and therefore reciprocally diggable ) but yet completely accurate headline might have been , say , “ Losing My Journalistic Integrity in 60 Seconds or Less ” , or “ I ’m a Gullible Rube and Got So Excited I Nearly Stained My Pants at the Thought of Breaking a Story on a Major Mac Security Exploit ” . )
George Ou : Going Down With the Ship
Joining Krebs in line to flush his credibility and reputation down the journalistic toilet is ZDNet ’s George Ou .
Ou , who attended the Black Hat conference where Maynor and Ellch first presented their talk , almost had it right when he first wrote about the story on his weblog :
The truth of the matter is that this was a hack on a MacBook but it pertains to third party hardware and third party drivers .
While this is n’t a flaw on the part of Apple [ UPDATE : The same flaw also seems to affect Apple ’s drivers ] , it is an attack on a MacBook and it should n’t be entirely dismissed either by the Mac community
But then he added the “ update ” which pointed to Krebs ’s now - seemingly - discredited reporting that Maynor and Ellch had discovered a flaw in Apple ’s own driver .
Ou continues :
This particular Wireless [ sic ] hack should n’t be pinned on Apple ’s products or Apple ’s programming , but remember that just this week there were 26 flaws patched by Apple and many of the flaws were critical .
In fact , there were months when Apple patched more than 30 vulnerabilities a month so it ’s clear that security vulnerabilities on the Mac are abundant .
David Maynor stated that he loves his Mac but it is a fact that the Mac has many security flaws .
The point is that no one should not [ sic ] be dismissing security issues on Mac and claiming that they are invincible .
This is a straw - man argument ; no one sane or knowledgeable has argued that Mac OS X is “ invincible ” , or that Mac security issues should be dismissed or ignored .
What many Mac users pointed out regarding Maynor and Ellch ’s demonstration , however , is that if it does n’t work as an exploit against the MacBook ’s built - in card , then Mac users could dismiss this particular issue .
I detect an undertone of “ Some day you Mac users are going to get yours and I ’m going to rub it in your faces when it happens , ” but all told , this was not a particularly noteworthy weblog entry .
His follow - up published Sunday , however , is a doozy , starting right from the headline : “ Vicious Orchestrated Assault on MacBook Wireless Researchers ” .
Ou begins :
There has been a vicious orchestrated assault on researcher David Maynor and the company SecureWorks claiming that the Maynor and SecureWorks falsified their research presented at Black Hat 2006 .
Ou ’s conspicuous use of the passive voice ( “ There has been … ” ) thinly veils the implication that the perpetrator of this “ vicious orchestrated assault ” is Apple Computer .
E.g. that Apple ’s Lynn Fox is maligning the reputations of Maynor and Ellch in the press .
Ou , thankfully , is here to stand up for and defend their honor .
MacWorld ’s [ sic ]

Jim Dalrymple was the first to regurgitate this bogus story on Thursday and followed up with “ MacBook Wi- Fi hack exposed ” by calling the original research a “ misrepresentation ” .
David Chartier of “ The Unofficial Apple Weblog ” went as far as saying “ SecureWorks admits to falsifying MacBook wireless hack ” .
Plenty of other media outlets were fed the same story but most of them knew better and refused to run this bogus story .
But once Digg and Slashdot ran with this story on Friday , all hell broke loose and the story has infected the blogsphere [ sic ] .
The “ regurgitated ” , “ bogus ” story that “ most ” media outlets knew better than to run that Ou refers to were stories simply publishing Lynn Fox ’s statement on behalf of Apple .
That ’s it .
Ou continues :
I was absolutely shocked when I ran across these stories on Digg .
Indeed , who would n’t be shocked to find over - hyped sensational bullshit on Digg ?
What paragon of journalistic integrity is next ?
The New York Times ?
The Wall Street Journal ?
I had personally video interviewed Maynor and his partner Jon “ Johnny Cache ” Ellch and these two gentlemen were very honest and straightforward .
But as soon as I read the stories , the stench began to rise .
I was tempted to make a joke here about what Ou might have eaten for lunch , but decided against it .
Maynor and SecureWorks had been telling the truth the entire time and they had falsified nothing .
The only falsification going on was the stories themselves !
( Boldface emphasis is Ou’s . )
Even Brian Krebs is n’t sticking with this line .
Ou , on the other hand , seems determined to go down with the SecureWorks ship .
So what exactly are Maynor and SecureWorks accused of falsifying ?
They are accused of “ admitting ” that the wireless hack was an exploit of a third party device and a third party driver .
The only problem with this accusation is that it is n’t exactly news since this is precisely what Maynor and company have been saying all along .
This was not only evident in my video interview , but it was even in Maynor ’s original video demonstration along with every other news report earlier this month during Black Hat .
Yet another straw - man argument .
No one who has actually watched their video is disputing that the exploit demonstrated by Maynor and Ellch in the video of a MacBook equipped with a third - party USB wireless card .
The dispute is whether Maynor and Ellch had ever indicated , explicitly or implicitly , that they had also discovered similar or identical vulnerabilities in the MacBook ’s built - in card and driver , and if they had , whether they had presented evidence of such to Apple .
Ou continues :
So Maynor and SecureWorks have been telling the truth about this being a third party driver and hardware from the very beginning and they never misrepresented anything .
If anything , Maynor went out of his way to avoid implicating any issues on the part of Apple because Brian Krebs of The Washington Post reported that Apple had leaned on Maynor and SecureWorks not to disclose the fact that the default Mac wireless hardware and default drivers were in fact vulnerable as well .
Be careful here , because if you think about the contradictions in this single paragraph too hard , your head will hurt .
Ou claims in the first sentence that it was only ever about third - party cards and drivers , but then in the next sentence trumpets Maynor ’s claim to Krebs that the default MacBook card and drivers were “ vulnerable as well ” .
Uh , George , that ’s the part that ’s in dispute , not the external USB dongle demo in their video .
And then there ’s the lovely idea of Maynor going “ out of his way to avoid implicating any issues on the part of Apple ” followed immediately by Maynor ’s unsubstantiated claim to Krebs that Apple had “ leaned on ” him to keep his mouth shut .
When I asked Maynor about this at Black Hat , Maynor would not confirm or deny whether Apple had leaned on him or not saying that he did n’t want to discuss it at the moment .
He does n’t seem to have wanted to discuss this leaning - on incident since the conference , either .
The transcript clearly reveals that Maynor had demonstrated the same exploit on a Mac without any third party wireless hardware !
It also turns out Maynor chose an external third party hardware wireless adapter to avoid focusing attention on possible Apple hardware and software issues which may endanger Mac users .
If a transcript from Brian Krebs says it happened , it must be true .
When I contacted David Maynor by email and later phoned him late Saturday night , Maynor was very disturbed by the whole incident .
I ’ll bet .
He had already been receiving hate mail and even death threats at the Black Hat convention but the threats had escalated with this latest fabricated story about him falsifying his research .
In one such threat , the person stated “ I ’m going to f*ing kill you and your dog ” to which Maynor replied “ I do n’t have a dog . ”
Death threats are funny when they come from those wacky Mac kooks .
Maynor was even more disgusted with the despicable way this story was set up and then planted in the press though [… ]
This “ despicable ” story - planting method apparently being Apple spokesperson Lynn Fox ’s technique of calling reporters on the phone , going on the record , and issuing an unequivocal statement on the matter .
I ’ve been asked not to reveal any more details on this time [ sic ] .
What I can tell you is that Maynor and SecureWorks will not be taking this laying down and the fireworks will start in the next couple of days .
Consider the fuses lit .
Conclusion
The principle of Occam ’s Razor holds that the simplest explanation is the most likely to be true .
By that guideline and the evidence at hand , it is my guess that Maynor and Ellch are disingenuous publicity hounds who studied a previously - identified vulnerability in a FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver and concluded that they could perhaps use this published vulnerability against Mac OS X .
I think they tried — and failed — to find an exploit that works against the standard AirPort cards and drivers used by nearly all Mac users , and that they then realized they could , in a demo , exploit buggy drivers other than Apple ’s on a doctored MacBook and draw much more attention to themselves and their firm than if their demo had been performed on any other computer , using Windows or an open source operating system .
I believe they “ informed ” Apple about a FreeBSD wireless driver issue that Apple already knew about , so that they ( i.e. Maynor and Ellch ) could honestly claim to have approached Apple “ about a wireless security vulnerability ” , even though it was n’t actually a flaw that they themselves had discovered , or that had actually affected shipping Apple code .
I.e. that despite the fact that the exploit they had discovered is completely and utterly irrelevant to anyone using a MacBook with Apple ’s default AirPort driver and card , which is to say all MacBooks other than the one that Maynor and Ellch modified specifically for their contrived demo , they chose to perform their demo using the MacBook .
When their supposed exploit was publicized by The Washington Post ’s Brian Krebs , who reported that they had found Apple ’s own drivers to be “ identically exploitable ” , they said nothing to dispute Krebs ’s report .
I believe Maynor and Ellch cultivated the misconception that they had identified a vulnerability in the MacBook ’s built - in AirPort card and driver but had performed their demonstration using an external USB card for their video at the request of Apple .
This made little sense , as I wrote at the time , but the misconception took root , and Maynor and Ellch said nothing to dispute it while their consulting firm racked up the media attention .
Now that the “ fireworks ” are starting , my guess is that Maynor and Ellch , if they choose to defend themselves rather than quietly walking away from the table , will do so by claiming that they never stated nor implied that they had found any vulnerabilities in the MacBook ’s built - in card and driver .
But their prevarications were far too clumsy for them to get away with this .
( And that ’s the best case scenario for how I see this working out .
Jim Thompson , after obtaining and studying a high - resolution copy of their exploit demonstration video from which he can read the characters in the terminal windows on - screen , suggests that even their exploit of the third - party USB card was a fraud , based on discrepencies in the MAC addresses and networking interfaces . )
It is a simple yes or no question : Have Maynor and Ellch found a vulnerability that affects MacBooks using Apple ’s built - in cards and drivers ?
That Maynor and Ellch have n’t answered it speaks volumes .
Bring on the fireworks .
CHENNAI : In an incredible effort for preservation of ecology on a single day , 8,13,226 saplings were planted in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday .
The feat , achieved by Project Green Hands volunteers and led by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation , will now enter the Guinness Book of Records .
Sadhguru 's message for the 2,15,700 volunteers , including students who participated in the plantation of 30 varieties of saplings , was : " On this day , what all of you have done is a privilege very few in this world enjoy .
You have created something far bigger than yourselves , and will live well beyond you .
This massive expression of concern and commitment for the well being of all is unique and I am sure it will inspire many around the world to emulate the same . "
The first two saplings were planted at the Gopalpuram residence of chief minister M Karunanidhi on Sunday .
The rest were planted on Tuesday .
The last sapling was planted in the garden of Raj Bhavan with the Sadhguru assisting governor Surjit Singh Barnala .
The exercise began early in the morning across Tamil Nadu's 27 districts and Puducherry ( Pondicherry ) on the premises of 33 government organisations , 11 NGOs , 47 industrial areas , 12 corporates and six institutions .
The right panel is an image from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope of stars and galaxies in the Ursa Major constellation .
The left panel is the same image after stars , galaxies and other sources were masked out .
Image
Astronomers might have seen the very first stars in the universe .
If so , these are incredible stars , some 1,000 times as massive as the Sun .
The alternative is just as interesting :
The objects might be early black holes consuming gas voraciously and spitting out radiation like crazy as nascent galaxies form .
The observations , by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , were first reported on a preliminary basis in November 2005 in the journal Nature .
A new analysis was announced today .
" We are pushing our telescopes to the limit and are tantalizingly close to getting a clear picture of the very first collections of objects , " said Alexander Kashlinsky of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author on two reports to be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
" Whatever these objects are , they are intrinsically incredibly bright and very different from anything in existence today . "
Way back
The light comes from objects that are more than 13 billion light - years away .
That means the light began its journey more than 13 billion years ago .
The universe is just a smidgeon older , at 13.7 billion years , and astronomers are pretty sure it took a few hundred million years for the matter of the Big Bang to spread out enough , and cool , to allow the first stars to form .
A little math therefore shows that these newfound objects are indeed the infants of the universe .
But what are they ?
If they are stars , they are about 10 times more massive than theories suggest the first stars would have been .
The mysterious objects are in clusters .
If they are each stars , then the clusters might be the first mini-galaxies .
And if so , each apparently has a mass that 's less than a million suns .
Our Milky
Way , by contrast , holds the mass of about 100 billion suns and is thought to have been built up by mergers of smaller galaxies - perhaps like those the astronomers now think they might be seeing .
What they see
When light travels to us from near the beginning of the universe , it is stretched .
Other observations of the universe 's first light have been made in the microwave range .
This cosmic microwave background reveals patterns of matter clumping , but no specific objects .
The light measured in the new study is thought to have started as ultraviolet and optical light , and it has been stretched over time to infrared .
Kashlinsky 's team calls it the cosmic infrared background and describes it as a diffuse light from the early time when structure first emerged .
" There 's ongoing debate about what the first objects were and how galaxies formed , " said Harvey Moseley of Goddard , a co-author on the new papers .
Some think our galaxy and other large galaxies grew through mergers .
One recent study questioned that notion , however .
" We are on the right track to figuring this out , " Moseley said .
" We 've now reached the hilltop and are looking down on the village below , trying to make sense of what 's going on . "
Difficult observations
The problem in making sense of it all lies with the fact that the observations are not clear - cut .
The scientists had to remove light from foreground stars and galaxies , and then study fluctuations in what is a relatively diffuse light [ image ] .
" Imagine trying to see fireworks at night from across a crowded city , " Kashlinsky suggested .
" If you could turn off the city lights , you might get a glimpse at the fireworks .
We have shut down the lights of the universe to see the outlines of its first fireworks . "
The researchers expect NASA 's planned James Webb Space Telescope will be able to identify the nature of the newfound clusters .
IR X - Ray Vision Applications
IR X - Ray Vision can be used for improving visibility through certain kinds of fog or haze .
This property is particularly important for long - distance photography on the ground where the detail of distant objects is often obscured by fog , mist , haze , rain , snow , smog , dust or sand .
It is also useful for high altitude , and especially oblique photography from the air like when landing an airplane in a foggy airport .
Actually , IR X - Ray Vision does not always result in a very striking increase in the range of vision , but it generally increases the contrast of the distant objects and thus the amount of detail that can be seen .
Police Force
IR X - Ray Vision can help you to see perfectly through sunglasses and dark , tinted car windows .
Let 's imagine there 's a man walking the street .
He fits the description of a known murder suspect , but he is wearing a pair of dark sunglasses , so no - one can see his eyes .
Yet there is a way to check his identity without even having to approach the man - a camera equipped with a KAYA PF filter would see straight through the dark sunglasses .
To the viewer , they now appear totally transparent , like standard glasses .
The man 's face would be identifiable even if he was in a car with tinted windows !
Voyeurism ( not encouraged ! )
IR X - Ray Vision is able to see through some types of clothes , for example , thin clothes , tight clothes , sundresses , swimsuits and so forth .
Be aware that this means that you can see a person 's body or underwear through the external garment .
In other words , a camera equipped with the PF filter allows you to " see through " someone 's clothes .
It is also possible to see through a woman 's made - up face as if no lipstick and foundation had been applied .
Pollution Monitoring
IR X - Ray Vision can be used in pollution monitoring applications .
Since both water and air when pure have very low NIR ( Near Infrared Rays ) reflectance those appear very dark when viewed through a camera equipped with the PF filter .
But their reflectance may be greatly increased by the presence of minute quantities of dissolved or suspended materials and this makes them appear less dark under the same conditions .
Though IR X - Ray Vision will not detect thermal pollution such as warm water entering a river from a generating station or hot gases above a smokestack , it may detect chemicals , certain dusts , pollens , aerosols and gases dissolved in gaseous or aqueous effluents owing to pure water and air 's low NIR reflectance .
Ice Reconnaissance
IR X - Ray Vision can be used to obtain data on sea-ice distribution and movement .
Because of its low reflectance to infrared radiation , water appears very dark and the ice appears light in an image .
Therefore , the interface between water and ice and land becomes highly discernible .
Agriculture , Plant Pathology and Forest Survey
IR X - Ray Vision can be used in agriculture , plant pathology and forest surveys for the detection of crop yields , crop and tree diseases , insect infestations in forests and orchards , and identification of tree species .
NIR images of foliage made with a camera equipped with the PF filter often show great variations in NIR reflectance even when leaves visually show just small variations in shades of green .
When viewed through a camera equipped with the PF filter , healthy grasses and the foliage of healthy deciduous trees appear white because of the high NIR transmission characteristic of green chlorophyll and the high NIR reflectance of the underlying cellular structure of these subjects .
On the contrary , diseased and dead trees and burned grass tend to appear dark in an NIR images .
Also in any given vegetation , the season , the water and mineral content of the soil , and the age and health of the vegetation may cause its NIR reflectance to vary .
In fact , the first sign of a distressed tree ( or plant ) is often a decrease in NIR reflectance , which frequently first becomes apparent in NIR images .
This means that the first sign can be detected by using IR X - Ray Vision before trouble becomes apparent visually .
Documents and Paintings Inspection
Inks , dyes , pigments , and other materials which may appear indistinguishable to the eye often appear differently in NIR images .
Printed matter , engravings and photographs that have become undecipherable through dirt or age or other damage can frequently be revealed when viewed through a camera equipped with the PF filter .
Mechanical or chemical erasure can often be determined , even if overwritten , provided the overwriting is in an ink transparent to NIR .
Even writing on documents charred in fires can also be readable provided the charring has not gone too far .
Differences in inks and dyes used in forged documents , certificates or identification can also be distinguished when viewed through a camera equipped with the PF filter .
IR X - Ray Vision often penetrates the surface of ancient inks and dyes of paintings , art or artifacts and reveal what lies beneath .
Thus , paintings or other similar works of art can be examined to determine the authenticity of those or to see if there has been over - painting or other alterations .
Particularly , fluoresced see - through techniques often show off its surprising ability to make visible a subject that gives our eyes very little or no clue as to its existence .
Here is one example :
The subject was a letter that had been placed in a home - made time capsule and buried near the cornerstone of a private home .
20 years later it was unearthed and , to the dismay of the family , all the words written by the mother of the family with pen and ink were washed away by water that had seeped into the box .
The residual ink remaining in the paper was quite invisible to the naked eye but our fluoresced see - through technique reveals the messages dramatically .
Thus , IR X - Ray Vision can be a simple yet powerful tool for the study of faded , burned , worn , dirty or altered documents or paintings , secret writing and so forth .
Camouflage Detection
IR X - Ray Vision can be effective for detecting camouflage when photographing objects painted to simulate foliage .
Camouflage detection may be possible by directly comparing a normal picture with a NIR picture of the same objects .
For example , most normal green paints , which match green foliage visually , are strong absorbers of NIR and appear dark in a NIR picture , while natural healthy green foliage appears white .
So camouflaged areas are most easily detected through a PF - equipped camera 's viewfinder or LCD screen .
Textile Industry
IR X - Ray Vision can be used in the textile field for detection of irregularities to the fibers , particularly where the material is dyed a dark tone and visual examination is difficult .
Some other applications where IR X - Ray Vision can be used include : environmental studies , natural resource studies , monitoring geographical and geological changes , investigating coastal erosion and identifying marsh land vegetation , archaeological exploration , surface mining and mined land disturbances , hydrological studies and channel mapping , monitoring oil spills , irrigation studies , medicine , mineralogy , philately , art history , entomology , etc .
Thus , the imaginative user should have little difficulty in recognizing the potential of IR X - Ray Vision and expanding its use . ﻿
“ So long , and thanks for the Ph.D. ! ” a.k.a.
“ Everything I wanted to know about C.S. graduate school at the beginning but did n’t learn until later . ”
The 4th guide in the Hitchhiker ’s guide trilogy ( and if that does n’t make sense , you obviously have not read Douglas Adams ) by Ronald T. Azuma v. 1.14 Original version 1997 , last revised February 2019
TL ;DR ( Executive Summary )
A computer science graduate school survival guide , intended for prospective or novice graduate students .
This guide describes what I wish I had known at the start of graduate school but had to learn the hard way instead .
It focuses on mental toughness and the skills a graduate student needs .
The guide also discusses finding a job after completing the Ph.D. and points to many other related web pages .
This guide covers the traits and skills that separate the star graduate students from the ordinary ones .
If you do n’t have a good reason for pursuing the Ph.D. , then get a Master ’s degree instead .
A Ph.D. program is very different from getting a Bachelor ’s degree , and you must treat it as a strange type of job .
Initiative , tenacity , flexibility , interpersonal skills , organizational skills , and communication skills are all critical and not things that universities typically test for in selecting incoming students .
A Ph.D. is a means to an end : employment in a startup , commercial business , government or industrial research lab , or academia .
This guide explains the characteristics of these four career choices .
If you spend 15 minutes reading the rest of this guide , you might increase your chances of successfully completing the Ph.D. and finishing earlier .
Introduction
“ To know the road ahead , ask those coming back . ”
- Chinese proverb
In February 1995 , on a beautiful sunny day with clear Carolina blue skies , I turned in the final , signed copy of my dissertation .
The graduate school staff member did some last - minute checks on the document and pronounced it acceptable .
After six and a half years of toil and sweat , I was finally done !
While walking back to the C.S. department building , I was sorely disappointed that the heavens did n‘t part , with trumpet - playing angels descending to announce this monumental occasion .
Upon hearing this observation , Dr. Fred Brooks ( one of my committee members ) commented , “ And the sad fact is , you ’re no smarter today than you were yesterday . ”
“ That ’s true , ” I replied , “ but the important thing is that I am smarter than I was six and a half years ago . ”
I wrote the first version of this guide two years after graduating , after reflecting upon my graduate student career .
One thought that has repeatedly struck me is how much easier graduate school might have been if somehow , magically , some of the things I knew when I turned in my dissertation I could have known when I first entered graduate school .
Instead , I had to learn those the hard way .
Of course , for many topics this is impossible : the point of graduate school is to learn those by going through the experience .
However , I believe other lessons can be taught ahead of time .
Unfortunately , such guidance is rarely offered .
While I had to learn everything the hard way , new graduate students might benefit from my experiences and what I learned .
That is the purpose of this guide .
Very little of this guide discusses technical matters .
Technical skills , intelligence and creativity are certainly strong factors for success in graduate school .
For example , I doubt there is a C.S. graduate student who did n’t at one point wish he or she had a stronger mathematical background .
However , it ’s beyond the scope of this guide to tell you how to be technically brilliant , as the following joke implies :
The Feynman Problem Solving Algorithm
1 ) Write down the problem .
2 ) Think very hard .
3 ) Write down the solution .
You do n’t have to be a genius to do well in graduate school .
You must be reasonably intelligent , but after a certain point , I think other traits become more important in determining success .
This guide covers the character traits and social skills that often separate the “ star ” graduate students from the ordinary ones .
Who are the students who are self - motivated , take initiative , find ways around obstacles , communicate well both orally and in writing , and get along well enough with their committee and other department members to marshal resources to their cause ?
Which students seem to know “ how the system works ” and manage to get things done ?
These traits are hardly unique to succeeding in graduate school ; they are the same ones vital to success in academic or industrial careers , which is probably why many of the best graduate students that I knew were ones who had spent some time working before they came back to school .
This document is aimed at junior C.S. graduate students , but these observations are probably broad enough to apply to graduate education in other technical fields .
My conclusions are certainly colored by my particular experiences ( doing my dissertation work in interactive computer graphics in the Computer Science department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) but I think they are fairly general in application and should be of interest to readers at other schools and other C.S. specialties .
Obviously , these are only my opinions and may not represent the views of other sane individuals or organizations .
Some points may be controversial , but if they were n’t this would not be interesting reading .
Parts of this document come from two informal talks I gave at UNC about “ the Ph.D. job hunt ” and “ observations from spending one year in industrial research . ”
Both talks had larger audiences than any informal technical talk I gave at UNC , which told me that students are definitely interested in these subjects !
This guide does not discuss how to be accepted for admission into graduate school .
I have never been a professor , so I do not have insights to share on how professors decide which students to admit .
For one professor ’s view , read Matt Might ’s advice on getting into graduate school .
Why get a Ph.D. ?
“ Being a graduate student is like becoming all of the Seven Dwarves .
In the beginning , you ’re Dopey and Bashful .
In the middle , you are usually sick ( Sneezy ) , tired ( Sleepy ) , and irritable ( Grumpy ) .
But at the end , they call you Doc , and then you ’re Happy . ”
- yours truly
The most basic question every Ph.D. student must know the answer to is : “ Why the hell am I doing this ? ”
It ’s a good question .
The hours are long .
The pay is low , with minimal benefits .
After graduation , Ph.D. salaries are higher than B.S. and M.S. salaries , but the difference does n’t make up for the income lost by staying in school longer .
The M.S. has a better “ bucks for the time invested ” ratio than the Ph.D. does .
And in terms of social status , a graduate student does n’t rank very high on the ladder .
If you do not have an acceptable answer to this question , then do n’t get a Ph.D. I repeat : if you do not have a rock - solid reason for getting the Ph.D. , then it is better that you leave with a Master ’s .
Why ?
Completing a Ph.D. is a long , hard road with many potholes and washed out bridges along the way .
You may run over some land mines and have to stop and turn around and explore other routes .
If the goal is important enough to you , then these obstacles will not prevent you from completing your journey .
But if you do n’t know why you are on this road , then you will get discouraged and will probably leave without finishing , having wasted years of your life .
I faced this situation after the first time I took the Doctoral Written Exam ( which at the time was the entrance examination into the Ph.D. program ) .
I missed passing it by just 4 percentage points .
I then had to decide whether or not to try again next semester ( committing myself again to spending months getting ready for the test ) or to just leave with an M.S. degree .
I did n’t come to graduate school with the Ph.D. as the primary goal .
So this test result forced me to answer the basic question “ Why the hell am I doing this ? ”
After much soul searching , I found my answer and decided to take the test again , passed it , and went on to get my Ph.D. I got the Ph.D. because I wanted to get a research position after leaving graduate school .
I wanted to work with the state of the art and extend it .
I did not want to “ bring yesterday ’s technology one step closer to tomorrow . ”
I wanted a job that would I find interesting , challenging and stimulating .
While an M.S. would give me a chance at landing a research position , the Ph.D. would give me a much better chance .
And I did not want to live with regrets .
If I took the Doctoral Written Exam again and failed again , then I could say that it was n’t meant to be and move on with my life .
I would have no regrets because I had given it my best shot and was not able to make it .
However , if I left with an M.S. without taking the test a second time , and five years later I was in a job that was boring and uninteresting , then I would have to lie awake every night for the rest of my life wondering “ What if ? ”
What if I had taken the test again and passed ?
Would I then be in the job that I really wanted ?
That was not a situation I wanted to be in .
I did not want to live the rest of my life regretting what might have been .
In hindsight , I think one of the main reasons I successfully completed the Ph.D. was the fact that I did n’t pass the exam on the first try .
It ’s ironic , but life sometimes works in strange ways .
That initial failure caused me to answer the basic question , providing the mental fortitude to keep going despite the hurdles and problems I would later face .
My answer is you should get a Ph.D. if it is required for your goals after graduate school , such as becoming a professor or a researcher in academia , government or industry .
Your answer may differ from mine .
As long as you have an answer that you believe in passionately , then that ’s enough .
If you do n’t have an answer , then save yourself a lot of grief and do n't get the Ph.D .
The best answer to this question I have ever seen comes from William Lipscomb , a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry .
He said , “ With a Ph.D. you will have a better chance of spending the rest of your life doing what you want to do , instead of what someone else wants you to do . ”
Tim Hopper created a site that interviews many people who provide their opinions about why someone should or should not pursue a Ph.D .
Academia is a business
“ Remember the Golden Rule : Those who have the gold make the rules . ”
Academia is a business , and “ graduate student ” is a job title .
This is especially true at private universities .
Academia is very peculiar type of business .
It is certainly not the Real World and does not work in the same way that the ordinary corporate world does .
However , it is a business nonetheless and as a graduate student , you must treat it that way .
Graduate school made a lot more sense and became much easier for me after I realized this .
If you think of graduate school as an “ Ivory Tower ” free of politics , money problems , and real - world concerns , you are going to be severely disappointed .
If you do n’t believe me , read The Idea Factory by Pepper White ( listed in the references ) for one account of graduate life at MIT .
A few graduate students are independently wealthy or have fellowship and scholarship money that cover all their expenses in graduate school .
Such students are rare , however .
Most of us needed financial support , in the form of Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships ( RA’s ) .
In general , RA ’s are more desirable to students since those can directly fund the research you need to finish .
Where does the money come from to fund RA ’s ?
Your professors have to raise funds from external organizations .
These include government agencies such as the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) , and others .
Private companies also fund some university research , and as government funding has become harder to get .
private sources have become more important .
For example , Intel spends tens of millions of dollars a year funding university research centers .
These organizations do n’t just give money away as charity .
They expect their money to accomplish something .
Increasingly these days , this takes the form of a contract for a working demonstration that must be shown at the end .
That means once the money is delivered , your professors must come through with the working demonstration .
It is rare that they do this by themselves .
Instead , they find some very capable , young , self - motivated people who are willing to work long hours for small amounts of pay .
In other words , they fund RA’s .
The RA job is crucial to the academic business .
If the RA ’s cannot successfully conduct the research , then the demonstration will not work in the end and the funding agencies may not be happy .
They may choose to not fund your professor in the future , which will bring his or her research program to a halt .
And there are many professors and other researchers chasing too few research dollars these days ; it is a competitive market .
Thus , each professor wants the best students available .
These students are the most capable ones who can get the research done required to fulfill the funding contracts .
That means you must treat an RA like a job .
You must prove to your professors that you are capable of getting the work done , being a team player , communicating your results , and most of the other characteristics needed to do well in regular jobs .
That ’s why many of the upcoming sections in this guide sound like ones written for the regular workplace .
What do you get out of this ?
At the start , you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts .
But eventually your professor must be flexible enough to fund your own specific research program that leads to the completion of your dissertation .
Your stipend and tuition waiver should be enough to live on frugally without going into debt .
You will learn the state of the art in your chosen speciality and conduct cutting - edge research on a subject that you find interesting and enjoyable .
If you do n’t find this compensation sufficient , then you should n’t be in graduate school in the first place .
The bottom line : realize that academia is a peculiar kind of business and the role you play in this enterprise .
If you do your job well ( and have good negotiation and interpersonal skills , as discussed in future sections ) , both your needs and your professors ’ needs will be met .
But do n’t enter an RA position thinking that the computers , research equipment , staff members and other resources that you are provided with are your birthright .
Do n’t take them for granted !
Most of those exist only because your professors have been able to raise the money to provide those to you .
In turn , you must fulfill your end of the deal by doing great research with those resources .
If you do n’t do your job well , do n’t be surprised if your professors choose to not fund you in the future .
They do not have to provide you with an RA job or let you use the computing equipment they acquired .
And the student who has no funding , no tuition reimbursement and no access to required computing resources is the student who leaves the university that semester .
How do you make sure you are one of those best , highly desired RA ’s ?

Graduate school is a different ballgame
“ Do n’t let school get in the way of your education . ”
- Mark Twain
“ The IQ test was invented to predict academic performance , nothing else .
If we wanted something that would predict life success , we ’d have to invent another test completely . ”
- Robert Zajonc
If you go through a Ph.D. program , you will find graduate school a very different world from undergraduate school .
If you just get an M.S. , then graduate school may not be much different from undergrad ( depending on where you get your degree ) , except that the courses are deeper and more advanced .
But for a Ph.D. student , graduate school is a whole new ballgame .
The students who do well are the ones who learn this earlier rather than later and make the necessary adjustments .
Jason Hong has an article on this theme called Ph.D. Students Must Break Away From Undergraduate Mentality ( ACM digital library subscription required for access ) .
Graduate school is not primarily about taking courses .
You will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wo n’t have any classes .
People judge a recently graduated Ph.D. by his or her research , not by his or her class grades .
And , without any offense to my professors , most of what you learn in a Ph.D. program comes outside of classes : from doing research on your own , attending conferences , and discussions with your fellow students .
Success in graduate school does not come from completing a set number of course units but rather from successfully completing a research program .
Graduate school is more like an apprenticeship where each student has his or her own project , and the masters may or may not be particularly helpful .
It ’s like teaching swimming by tossing students into the deep end of the pool and seeing who makes it to the other end alive and who drowns .
It ’s like training clock designers by locking students inside a clock factory with some working clocks and lots of clock parts and machines for building clocks .
However , the instructions are at best incomplete and even the masters themselves do n’t know exactly how to build next year ’s models .
Excelling in a Ph.D. program requires different skills than doing well in undergrad .
Undergraduate education tests you through class projects ( that do not last more than a semester ) , essays , midterms and finals .
For the most part , you work alone .
Your professor may not know your name .
Every other student in your class takes the same tests or does similar projects .
But in a Ph.D. program , you must select and complete a unique long - term research program .
For most of us , this means you have to learn how to do research and all that entails : working closely with your professors , staff and fellow students , communicating results , finding your way around obstacles , dealing with politics , etc. Carl Vogel suggests the most important personality traits of successful graduate students are being inquisitive , disciplined , obsessive and delusional ( certain that their research programs will uncover something new and important ) .
I ’m not saying that tests and grades are completely unimportant in graduate school .
One of the two biggest hurdles in completing a Ph.D. is passing the qualifying exam .
( The other is finding an acceptable dissertation topic . )
But because graduate school is not nearly as exam - based as undergraduate education and requires different skills , the GRE and undergraduate grades are not as good an indicator of who will excel and who will drop out as admission committees seem to think .
Those tests do not measure creativity , tenacity , interpersonal skills , oral presentation skills , and many other important traits .
The next several sections discuss these traits .
Initiative
“ The difference between people who exercise initiative and those who do n’t is literally the difference between night and day .
I ’m not talking about a 25 to 50 percent difference in effectiveness ; I ’m talking about a 5000 - plus percent difference , particularly if they are smart , aware , and sensitive to others . ”
- Stephen R. Covey , The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
The dissertation represents a focused , personal research effort where you take the lead on your own , unique project .
If you expect that your advisor is going to hold your hands and tell you what to do every step of the way , you are missing the point of the dissertation .
Ph.D. students must show initiative to successfully complete the dissertation .
This does not mean that guidance from professors is unimportant , just that this guidance should be at a reasonably high level , not at a micromanaging level .
If you never do any tasks except those that your professor specifically tells you to do , then you need to work on initiative .
At UNC , there is a famous anecdote about a former UNC graduate student named Joe Capowski .
Many years ago , UNC got a pair of force - feedback mechanical arms to use with molecular visualization and docking experiments .
The problem was how to move them to UNC .
These mechanical arms were large , heavy beasts , and were in Argonne National Labs in Chicago , IL .
Unfortunately , there was a trucker ’s strike going on at the time .
Joe Capowski , on his own initiative ( and without telling anyone ) , flew out to Argonne , rented a truck , drove the mechanical arms all the way back to North Carolina , and then handed the computer science department the bill !
Many years later , Joe Capowski ran for the Chapel Hill city council and won a seat .
Prof. Fred Brooks gave him an endorsement .
I still remember the words Dr. Brooks said : “ I may not agree with his politics , but I know he ’ll get things done . ”
( Thanks to Jim Lipscomb for corrections to this anecdote . )
While the Joe Capowski anecdote is perhaps a bit extreme , it does show that it is often better to ask forgiveness than permission , provided you are not becoming a “ loose cannon . ”
Certain universities ( e.g. MIT ) are good at fostering a “ can do ” attitude among their graduate students , and therefore they become more assertive and productive .
One of the hallmarks of a senior graduate student is that he or she knows the types of tasks that require permission and those that do n’t .
That knowledge will come with experience .
Generally , the senior graduate students have the most freedom to take initiative on projects .
This privilege has to be earned .
The more that you have proven that you can work independently and initiate and complete appropriate tasks , the more your professors will leave you alone to do what you want to do .
Tenacity
“ Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal .
My strength lies solely in my tenacity . ”
- Louis Pasteur
You do n’t need to be a genius to earn a Ph.D. ( although it does n’t hurt ) .
But nobody finishes a dissertation without being tenacious .
A dissertation usually takes several years to complete .
This can be a culture shock to former undergraduates who have never worked on a project that lasted longer than one quarter or semester ( at the end of which , whatever the state of the project , one declares victory and then goes home ) .
No one can tell you in advance exactly how long the dissertation will take , so it ’s hard to see where the “ end of the road ” lies .
You will encounter unexpected problems and obstacles that can add months or years to the project .
It ’s very easy to become depressed and unmotivated about going on .
If you are not tenacious about working on the dissertation , you wo n’t finish .
Tenacity means sticking with things even when you get depressed or when things are n’t going well .
For example , I did not enjoy my first year of graduate school .
I did n’t tell anyone this until after leaving UNC .
I was not on a project and was focused on taking classes , some of which I did n’t do all that well in .
I did n’t feel a part of the Department , and really wondered whether or not I fit in .
Still , I stuck with it and when summer rolled around and I got a job in the Department , I became much more involved in research and enjoyed graduate school much more .
Part of earning a Ph.D. is building a “ thick skin ” so you are not so fragile that you will give up at the first sign on any difficulties .
One lesson I learned as a graduate student is the best way to finish the dissertation is to do something every day that gets you closer to being done .
If all you have left is writing , then write part of the dissertation every day .
If you still have research to do , then do part of it every day .
Do n’t just do it when you are “ in the mood ” or feeling productive .
This level of discipline will keep you going through the good times and the bad and will ensure that you finish .
Flexibility
“ Back in graduate school , I ’d learned how to survive without funding , power , or even office space .
Grad students are lowest in the academic hierarchy , and so they have to squeeze resources from between the cracks .
When you ’re last on the list for telescope time , you make your observations by hanging around the mountaintop , waiting for a slice of time between other observers .
When you need an electronic gizmo in the lab , you borrow it in the evening , use it all night , and return it before anyone notices .
I did n’t learn much about planetary physics , but weaseling came naturally . ”
- Clifford Stoll , The Cuckoo's Egg
Flexibility means taking advantage of opportunities and synergies , working around problems , and being willing to change plans as required .
As a graduate student , you are on the bottom of the academic totem pole .
Even undergraduates can rank higher , especially at private universities ( because they actually pay tuition ! )
You can not order anybody to do anything .
In general , you will be in the position of reacting to big events rather than controlling them .
Therefore , you must be flexible in your approach and research program .
For example , you may not have as much access to a piece of laboratory equipment as you would like , or maybe access is suddenly cut off due to events beyond your control .
What do you do ?
Can you find a replacement ?
Or reduce the time needed on that equipment ?
Or come in at odd hours when no normal person uses that equipment ?
Or redefine the direction of your project so that equipment is no longer required ?
Events can be good as well as bad .
The difference between the highly effective graduate student and the average one is that the former recognizes those opportunities and takes advantage of them .
I had nothing to do with bringing Gary Bishop to UNC .
But after he arrived , I realized my research would progress much faster if he became my advisor so I made the switch and that was a big help to my graduate student career .
Opportunities for synergy and serendipity do occur , but one has to be flexible enough to recognize them and take advantage of them .
Interpersonal skills
“ For humans , honesty is a matter of degree .
Engineers are always honest in matters of technology and human relationships .
That ’s why it ’s a good idea to keep engineers away from customers , romantic interests , and other people who ca n’t handle the truth . ”
- Scott Adams , The Dilbert Principle
“ I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies , but not the madness of people . ”
- Isaac Newton
Computer Science majors are not , in general , known for their interpersonal skills .
Some of us got into this field because it is easier to understand machines than people .
As frustrating as computers can be , they at least behave in a logical manner , while human beings often do not .
However , your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your advisor , your committee , your research and support staff and your fellow students .
This does not mean you must become the “ life of the party . ”
I am not and never will be a gregarious , extroverted person .
But I did make a serious effort to learn and practice interpersonal skills , and those were crucial to my graduate student career and my subsequent jobs in industrial research .
Why should this matter , you may ask ?
If one is technically brilliant , should n’t that be all that counts ?
The answer is no , because the situation is different from your undergraduate days .
In both graduate school and in business , you must depend upon and work with other people to achieve your goals
To put this in perspective , I have excerpted the following from an article called “ Organizations : The Soft and Gushy Side ” by Kerry J. Patterson , published in the Fall 1991 issue of The Bent :
I first learned of the capricious , human side of organizations some 15 years ago while studying the careers of engineers and scientists .
The research design required that I spend eight hours a day in one - on - one interviews .
For two hours I 'd ask “ career ” questions of an engineer , chemist , physicist , or applied mathematician -- all of whom worked for a Fortune 500 firm .
During these 120 minutes , the subjects talked about the perils of the organizations .
Two hours was scarcely enough time to share their stories .
All energetically discussed their personal careers .
Most had been frustrated with the “ soft and gushy ” side of organizations .
Some had figured out the system and learned to master it .
Others had not .
As part of the research design , we asked to talk to low , medium , and high performers .
This in itself was an interesting exercise .
To determine performance rankings , we would place in front of a senior manager the names of the 10 - 50 people within his or her organization .
Each name would be typed neatly in the middle of a three - by - five card .
After asking the manager to rank the employees from top to bottom , the managers would then go through a card sort .
Typically the executive would sort the names into three or four piles and then resort each pile again .
Whatever the strategy , the exercise usually took only minutes .
Just like that , the individual in charge of the professionals in question was able to rank , from top to bottom , as many as 50 people .
It rarely took more than three minutes and a couple of head scratches and grunts .
Three minutes .
Although politics may appear ambiguous to those on the receiving end , those at the top were able to judge performance with crystal clarity .
This performance ranking ( conducted by individuals not involved in the interviews ) was then used as a dependent measure .
Those of us conducting the interviews attempted to surface information ( independent measures ) that would predict the ranking .
What about a scientist ’s career would lead to a top ranking ?
What trashed a perfectly good career ?
Surely scientific prowess would have an impact .
And it did .
But technological prowess was n’t as predictive as another factor .
We discovered that we could tell what performance group the interviewees belonged to within a minute or two by their attitudes toward people and politics .
Individuals who were ranked low by their managers spoke of organizational politics as if it were poison .
They were exceptionally annoyed by the people side of the business .
They frequently stated they would rather be left alone to conduct their research untrammeled by human emotions .
They characterized the social side of organizations as “ soft and gushy . ”
They sounded like Spock turned bitter .
Top performers , in contrast , found a way to work within the political system .
They had n’t exactly embraced politics .
They did n’t appear like that toothy kid you knew back in college who lived to fight political battles .
They did n’t come off as glad - handling sales folks .
These were professional scientists who were often top ranked in their field .
They looked and talked liked scientists .
The difference between them and those ranked at the bottom of the totem pole was clear .
They had found a way to make peace with organizations , people , and politics .
They climbed to the top of their field by mastering both hard things and soft and gushy people .
Engineers and scientists are n’t the only ones who find the human side of the organizations to be annoying .
As we expanded our research to include professors , accountants , and other professionals , the findings were remarkably similar .
All found political machinations to be distasteful .
It ’s just that some had found a way to master the social aspects -- the top performers .
Students usually look down on politics , but politics in its most basic , positive form is simply the art of getting things done .
Politics is mostly about who is allowed to do what and who gets the resources ( money , people , equipment , etc . )
To succeed in your research , you will need resources , both capital and personnel .
Interpersonal skills are mandatory for acquiring those resources .
If you are incapable of working with certain people or make them mad at you , you will not get those resources and will not complete your research .
Furthermore , people who complete a Ph.D. generally have careers where they take leadership roles .
Leadership requires good interpersonal skills to convince and motivate others to think a certain way or to take certain actions .
If you do not have good interpersonal or “ soft ” skills , the amount of influence you will have will be restricted to yourself .
Your potential will be limited .
Here is an example of how relationships are important :
As a graduate student , which group of people did I try my best to avoid offending ?
Was it my committee ?
No , because healthy disagreements and negotiations with your advisor and committee are crucial to graduating within a reasonable amount of time .
Nor was it my fellow students , because I did not need help from most of them , and most of them did not need me .
The critical group was the research and support staff .
These include the research faculty and all the various support positions ( the system administrators , network administrators , audio - visual experts , electronic services , optical and mechanical engineers , and above all , the administrative assistants ) .
I needed their help to get my research done , but they did not directly need me .
Consequently , I made it a priority to establish and maintain good working relationships with them .
Cultivating interpersonal relationships is mostly about treating people with respect and determining their different working styles .
Give credit where credit is due .
Acknowledge and thank them for their help .
Return favors .
Respect their expertise , advice and time .
Apologize if you are at fault .
Realize that different people work in different ways and are motivated by different things -- the more you understand this diversity , the better you will be able to interact and motivate them to help you .
For certain people , offering to buy them dinner or giving them free basketball tickets can work wonders .
A true example : at one point in my research , I needed to make significant modifications to some low - level code in the graphics computer called “ Pixel Planes 5 . ”
Doing this required expertise that I did not have , but another graduate student named Marc Olano did .
How should I tap into Marc ’s expertise and get the changes I needed done ?
The wrong way is to go up to Marc , explain the problem , and get him to make the changes .
Marc does n’t need the changes done ; I do .
Therefore , I should do most of the work .
Expecting him to do the work shows disrespect of his time .
What I actually did was to explain the problem to Marc and he sketched out a possible solution .
Then I ran off and worked on my own for a few days , trying to implement the solution .
I got part of it working , but ended up getting stuck on another part .
Only at that point did I go back to Marc and ask him for help .
By doing this , I showed that I respected his time and wanted to minimize his burden , thus making him more willing to help me .
Months later , when he and Jon Cohen needed my help in setting up a system to demonstrate some of their software , I was more than happy to return the favor .
Interpersonal interaction is a huge subject and goes far beyond my description here .
All I can really do in this section is ( hopefully ) convince you that these skills are vital to your graduate student career and encourage you to learn more if you need to improve these skills .
I still have a lot to learn myself .
I recommend reading The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and Type Talk ( both listed in the References section ) as starting points .
The magazine article “ How to be a star engineer ” ( listed in the References ) also touches on this subject .
Scott Adams ( the creator of Dilbert ) wrote an interesting book called How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big : Kind of the Story of My Life where he describes systems and skills that correlate with life success .
Those include psychology and understanding people .
Organizational skills
“ Failing to plan is planning to fail . ”
Since academia is a type of business , you will have responsibilities that you must uphold .
You will be asked to greet and talk with visitors , give demos , show up to meetings , get projects done on time , etc .
If you are not well organized , you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations .
A technically brilliant student will be greatly hampered if he or she exhibits an “ absent minded ” personality and develops a reputation for being disorganized .
There are many different time management and organization skills , and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore .
This guide is not going to describe them .
Find one that works for you and use it .
I can highly recommend Stephen Covey ’s book , listed in the references .
Another book is Getting Things Done by David Allen .
But whatever system you pick , just make sure it works for you .
I have never found anyone else who uses my filing scheme , but it is effective for me ( by minimizing the combined time of putting away and locating a piece of information ) .
All that really matters is whether or not it works .
One metaphor I found useful is the following : Organize your tasks as if you were juggling them .
Juggling several balls requires planning and skill .
You must grab and toss each ball before it hits the ground .
You can only toss one ball at a time , just as you can only work on one task at a time .
The order in which you toss the balls is crucial , much as the order of working on tasks often determines whether or not you meet all your deadlines .
Finally , once you start a task ( grab a ball ) you want to get enough done so you can ignore it for a while ( throw it high enough in the air so it wo n’t come down for a while ) .
Otherwise you waste too much time in context switches between tasks .
Do you see jugglers try to keep each ball at the same height above the ground , frantically touching every ball every second ?
Randy Pausch ( who was a professor at Virginia and CMU ) has a set of notes on time management .
Three words in his guide summarize the most vital step : Kill your television .
He asks you to keep your priorities straight .
What is the most important thing to a Ph.D. student ?
It should be finishing the dissertation , not watching every episode of your favorite TV series .
That does n’t mean dropping everything else in life , but it does mean knowing what takes priority and allocating time accordingly .
Taking advantage of opportunities
“ The Chinese call luck opportunity and they say it knocks every day on your door .
Some people hear it ; some do not .
It ’s not enough to hear opportunity knock .
You must let him in , greet him , make friends and work together . ”
- Bernard Gittelson
I have been asked several times on how to get a good mentor or how to get professors or others in positions of power to give them opportunities that can further their careers .
The best way is to get yourself noticed in a positive way , so that professors or others in positions to hand out opportunities will decide it is worth spending time mentoring you or to offer you such opportunities .
And then you must do the work necessary to exploit those opportunities .
Let me share a personal story about this .
When I was a graduate student at UNC Chapel Hill , a group of us drove up to the University of Virginia to visit Randy Pausch ’s group .
Not surprisingly , Randy asked some of us to give talks .
I was one of those students .
After my presentation , Randy commented that he never knew that I was such a dynamic speaker .
It was probably because of that presentation that later on I was invited to join a group of speakers teaching a course at the SIGGRAPH conference .
Randy was one of those speakers .
They were teaching a class on Virtual Reality and wanted me to be the last speaker and talk about Augmented Reality .
I accepted .
This meant creating a set of notes to include with the course .
I decided I would try to define , characterize and summarize the field of Augmented Reality ( this was back in 1995 when the field was small enough that this was a reasonable goal for such a document ! ) .
After we taught the course , Steven Feiner , who was another professor in that course , suggested that I update my notes and submit them to a new MIT Press journal called Presence : Teleoperators and Virtual Environments .
So I did the work to change my notes into a journal paper and it was accepted and published .
That paper ended up becoming the single most cited reference in the field of Augmented Reality .
The definition of “ Augmented Reality ” I provided in that paper became accepted by the research community , and researchers cited my paper when they wanted to explain that their paper was on the topic of Augmented Reality .
It opened other opportunities for me , such as serving on the Steering Committee of the premier research conference in the field , and was probably one reason I was honored as an IEEE Fellow .
I did not plan any of this .
Luck definitely was a factor .
But the key points are : I did something that got myself noticed in a positive way by top professors in my field .
Because I showed potential , they decided to take a chance on me by providing opportunities .
And most importantly , I did the work to exploit these opportunities .
Now that I am a senior researcher , I see things from the perspective of those professors .
If someone does something that shows potential or catches my attention , I am much more willing to invest time in such a person or to steer opportunities his or her way .
Do n’t go around demanding to be mentored or to receive opportunities .
Show that you are worth it , make sure that people in positions to grant things are aware of your potential , and when you get opportunities , put in the necessary effort .
Communication skills
“ What is written without effort is , in general , read without pleasure . ”
- Samuel Johnson
“ Present to inform , not to impress ; if you inform , you will impress . ”
- Frederick P. Brooks , Jr.
As a student , I was always amazed that articles written about business consistently put good communication skills at or near the top of the list of skills that employers want to see but often did n’t find in candidates .
Now , as someone who has worked in industry for a long time and also hired people , I can confirm this is true .
Communication skills , both written and oral , are vital for making a good impression as a Ph.D. student and as a researcher .
At a minimum , you have to defend your dissertation with an oral presentation .
But you should also expect to write technical papers and reports , give presentations at conferences , and give demonstrations to groups of visitors .
If you can write and speak well , you will earn recognition and distinguish yourself from other graduate students .
This is especially true when giving presentations in front of important visitors or at major conferences .
Conversely , if you cannot communicate well , then your career opportunities after graduation will be limited .
Professors spend most of their time communicating : teaching , fundraising , guiding graduate students , and documenting their results ( through papers , videos , slidesets , etc. ) .
In industry , we need people who can communicate well so they can work in teams , learn what businesses and customers need , present their results , raise funds , and transition to leadership roles in project and personnel management .
If you are technically brilliant but are incapable of communicating or working with other people , then your results will be limited to what you can accomplish alone and your career growth will have a low ceiling , both in industry and academia .
Unfortunately , not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents ( which are different from English essays ) .
These are skills that can be learned !
Do n’t worry if giving presentations and writing papers are not something that comes naturally to you .
I was not very comfortable giving oral presentations when I started graduate school , so I made a concerted effort to learn how to do so , by taking classes , reading about the subject , and practicing .
It ’s not easy , but it ’s well worth the investment .
If you need practice , try giving informal talks at research luncheons , joining Toastmasters , and studying good speakers to see what they do .
Covering everything about this subject would fill a guide by itself , and would probably be better explained in a video rather than a written document .
But here are a few basic points : Organization counts .
Within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes , tell me why I should read your paper or listen to your talk .
Make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered .
Make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them .
For large presentation halls , this usually means no more than 6 - 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum .
You ’d be surprised how many experts on visualization ( especially tenured professors ! ) give presentations with unreadable slides .
Variety retains interest .
Vary your pace , tone , and volume .
Emphasize the important points .
Look around the room .
Throw in some video , pictures , or live examples .
Do n’t stand in front of the screen and block everyone ’s view .
You ’d be surprised how often people do this without realizing it .
Point out the limitations of your work .
That helps your credibility .
Similarly , credit others where appropriate .
Make friends with the A/V crew !
Running A/V is a thankless job .
If everything runs smoothly , well , that ’s what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything .
But if anything goes wrong , the entire audience looks back at the control room .
Help the A/V people help you .
Always check in early and test the equipment .
Tell them what you are going to do in your presentation ( e.g. , I ’m running 3 video segments ) .
Make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium .
And thank the A/V crew for their help after you are done !
Confidence is the key to giving a good presentation .
And the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations .
When you ’re just starting out , this is a Catch - 22 .
However , once you become good enough , this turns into a positive feedback cycle that can make giving talks a pleasure .
If you want to see an example of an excellent talk , please watch The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch ( video available on YouTube ) .
I knew Randy personally , and I had the difficult task of having to speak directly after him , not once but twice .
Randy gave the talk of his life in The Last Lecture but I will tell you that was not an aberration .
He was a superb speaker , and someone we can all learn a lot from .
One time , after I spoke at the University of Virginia , Randy told me that he had n’t realized I was such a dynamic speaker .
I replied that it had n’t come naturally for me , unlike Randy who was a naturally talented speaker .
For me , I had to work hard at it .
But I am proof that with hard work , one can develop good presentation skills and get noticed by someone like Randy .
A good reference on how to communicate in a compelling manner is the book Made to Stick : Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip and Dan Heath .
They give concrete approaches for crafting a message in a way that people will remember .
Writing papers and getting them published is vital for Ph.D. students who want to get research positions after graduation .
Your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted .
When I was a young graduate student and reviewed a paper that I did n’t understand , I thought “ Gee , I must be dumb . ”
Today I will read the same paper and think “ Boy , this is a lousy paper .
The authors did not do a good job explaining and presenting their work . ”
Such a reaction is enough for me to reject the paper .
Where do you submit your papers ?
Your professors will help you with this choice , but in general I would suggest shooting for the best conferences or journals where you think it has a reasonable chance of being accepted .
It ’s not much more work to write , submit and present a paper in a highly respected venue than in less respected venues .
And if you do n’t shoot for the top you ’ll never know if it would have made it .
The field of computer graphics is a bit unusual in that the most desirable place to publish is a conference ( SIGGRAPH ) , rather than a journal ( although SIGGRAPH papers now are published in a journal called Transactions on Graphics ) .
Be aware that journals can take years to publish submitted papers ; the turn - around time is much faster in a conference .
Finally , do n’t forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates .
Keep your committee appraised of your progress .
One thing I do ( which few others do ) is write short ( 1 screenfull ) status reports , which I religiously e-mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis .
These serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what I ’m doing .
They are also a good way for me to record my progress .
If I need to remember what I got done during a six month period , I have plenty of old status reports that I can read .
You ’d be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice .
I also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each week ’s report to reward people for reading it .
When you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result , let people know about it !
Bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off !
That ’s a win -win situation .
It lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results , and you get valuable feedback and advice .
Choosing an advisor and a committee
“ Some students in the lab are only nominally supervised by a thesis advisor .
This can work out well for people who are independent self - starters .
It has the advantage that you have only your own neuroses to deal with , not your advisor ’s as well . ”
- from “ How to do research at the MIT AI Lab ”
The choice of an appropriate advisor is crucial to successfully completing the Ph.D.
Your advisor must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with .
When I started graduate school , I thought the advisor - student relationship was supposed to be very close , both professionally and socially .
In reality , the relationship is whatever the professor and the student choose to make of it .
It can be close , with invited dinners at the professor ’s home , or it can be distant , e.g. meeting occasionally to remind the professor that the student is still alive .
One basic question in choosing an advisor is whether to pick a junior ( non-tenured ) or a senior ( tenured ) professor .
Non-tenured professors tend to travel less and are generally more available .
It is difficult to get help from an advisor who is never in town .
Non -tenured faculty have fewer advisees that you have to compete with to get time with the professor .
They are more likely to be personally involved with your research -- writing code , spending time in the lab at midnight , etc .
Non-tenured faculty must be energetic and hard working if they want to be awarded tenure , and this work habit can rub off on their students .
However , tenured faculty have several advantages as well .
They are usually the ones with most of the money and resources to support you .
They do not have to compete with their students for publications and recognition .
The advisee does not run the risk of having his or her advisor not getting tenure and leaving the university .
Tenured faculty are more experienced with “ how the game works ” and thus may be better sources of guidance , personal contacts , jobs after graduation , etc .
I ended up with a non-tenured professor ( actually , he was not even on the tenure track at the time ) as my advisor , but also put several tenured professors on my committee , including some of the most senior ones in my specialty .
In that way , I got the best of both worlds : the day - to - day attention from the primary advisor , combined with the resources and experience of the committee .
Professors develop reputations amongst graduate students .
Some are known to graduate their Ph.D. students rapidly .
Others are impossible to get hold of , so their students take forever to finish or leave without graduating .
Some dictate what their advisees have to do , while others are accommodating of student interests .
Ask around .
What you learn may be revealing .
And if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs , do n’t be afraid to switch if that is an overall win .
When picking a committee , you want to make sure they can cover all areas of your thesis .
You also want to make sure that it is likely that all the committee members will be available for meetings !
Including too many professors who travel often will make it difficult to get all five or six together in one room for a three hour oral exam or proposal meeting .
When scheduling such meetings , start by finding times when the difficult - to - reach professors are in town , and then add in the other committee members .
Balance and Perspective
“ Life goes by so fast , that if you do n’t stop and look around , you might miss it . ”
- from the film Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off
“ Generally speaking , people provide better maintenance for their cars than for their own bodies . ”
- Scott Adams , The Dilbert Future
When I was in graduate school , my top priority was crystal clear to me : getting out with a Ph.D.
Other people described me as “ focused like a laser beam ” on that goal .
In retrospect , I may have been too focused .
There is more to life than graduate work .
Keeping your health and your sanity intact are both vital to achieving the primary goal of getting out .
Repetitive Strain Injury ( RSI ) is a major occupational hazard in our industry .
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is just one type of RSI .
If you do not know how to set up your workspace for good ergonomics , learn now !
The Pascarelli reference at the end of this guide is a good book on this subject .
Over a dozen of my friends and coworkers have been inflicted with this problem .
In severe cases , RSI can be a career - ending injury .
If you ca n’t type , it ’s rather difficult to write papers , computer programs , presentations , etc .
Do n’t let this happen to you !
Prevention is the way to go .
When lifting weights , I exercise to strengthen my shoulders and wrists as an additional preventative step .
Earning a Ph.D. is like running a marathon .
You have to learn to pace yourself and take care of your body if you want to reach the finish line .
Unfortunately , students often act like sprinters trying to run a marathon .
They are highly productive for a while , but then fall by the wayside because they are n’t eating correctly , exercising , taking time out to recharge their batteries , etc .
You maximize your long - term productivity by not ignoring those other aspects .
While I was in graduate school , I took time out to travel up and down the East Coast , from Boston down to Orlando .
That was an important part of keeping my stress down and recharging my batteries .
I also did some running and circuit training for exercise .
For shorter breaks , I shot nerf basketballs at a tiny hoop mounted in the graphics lab and kept a guitar in my office .
Figure out what works for you .
It ’s easy to lose perspective while in graduate school .
You are surrounded by so many other smart , hard working people that it is easy to feel inferior and lose self esteem and confidence .
But without an underlying confidence that you do have what it takes to complete a dissertation , it ’s too easy to drop out when the going gets tough instead of sticking it through .
I found it useful to keep in touch with the “ real world , ” to remind myself that the graduate student population is not representative of humanity in general and to keep my perspective .
You got into graduate school because you have already shown to your professors that you have potential and skills that are not typical among most college students , let alone most people -- do n't forget that .
I freely admit that this section reflects my personal bias that balance in life is important .
For some people , focusing on work to the exclusion of almost everything else is how they achieve excellence .
Jim Lipscomb , who was a graduate student before me at UNC , describes the traits that enabled his father , William Lipscomb , to win a Nobel Prize .
However , I chose a different set of priorities and have not regretted that choice .
Decide for yourself what is most important in your life .
The Ph.D. job hunt
On résumés : “ The closest to perfection a person ever comes is when he fills out a job application form . ”
- Stanley Randall
Real World , The ( n. ) :
Where a computer science student goes after graduation ; used pejoratively ( “ Poor slob , he got his degree and had to go out into the REAL WORLD . ” ) .
Among programmers , discussing someone in residence there is not unlike talking about a deceased person .
- the fortune program
“ Never forget this primary rule : Graduate school is not your job ; graduate school is a means to the job you want .
Do not settle in to your graduate department like a little hamster burrowing in the wood shavings .
Stay alert with your eye always poised for the next opportunity , whatever it is : to present a paper , attend a conference , meet a scholar in your field , forge a connection , gain a professional skill . ”
- Dr. Karen Kelsky
“ Startups are business experiments performed with other people ’s money . ”
- Antonio Garcia Martinez , from the book Chaos Monkeys
Ideally , the job hunt begins years before you graduate .
Networking is very important : while you are in the middle to late phases of your graduate studies , try to get yourself noticed by professors and industry people at other sites .
One way to do this is to offer to give a talk about your work at another site .
This is not that difficult to do , since most research places love to host seminars and bring in fresh ideas .
Attending conferences and working elsewhere during the summer are other ways to get exposure .
Make friends with graduate students and personnel at other schools .
Make and carry your own business cards .
Schmooze with important visitors during major site visits .
For about two years , I ran the informal “ Graphics Lunch ” symposia at UNC .
That means I was the point of contact for many speakers who visited UNC and that helped me make contacts .
There is also a “ star ” system that exists .
Certain outstanding graduate students can get labeled as “ stars ” by their professors and that can be an enormous help in getting an interview at CMU or other prestigious locations .
It ’s nice if you can get on that track but one should n’t rely upon it !
Networking is important because many jobs are found and filled that way .
I got my position at HRL partially because I visited there , at my own expense , two years before I even started my job hunt .
That meant that when I circulated my résumé , I was more than just a piece of paper to them .
You ’ll look for job announcements in major journals , at conferences , online , and through your contacts .
In most companies , the hiring authority resides with the manager who owns the job position , not with the Human Resources department .
HR can reject a candidate , but they cannot hire a candidate .
As a hiring manager , my job is to only talk directly to candidates who are best qualified for the position .
As a candidate , your job is to find the individual with the ability to hire and deal with that person directly , rather than solely with the HR department .
When do you start asking for interviews ?
You can start when you are able to give a talk about your dissertation work .
Do n’t be too early or too late , because you only get one chance per site .
Academic positions generally have a particular “ season ” ( much like getting admitted to school ) that starts in the Fall and ends around April ; industrial positions generally do n’t follow that .
The job hunt and interviewing process can take months ; factor that into your time allocation .
The job supply and demand situation can vary dramatically in a few years , and anything I say here about the job market today will likely be out of date by the time you read this .
For example , during the time I was initially job hunting ( end of 1994 to early 1995 ) , good positions were not easy to find .
If I had a dollar for every site that told me “ We do n’t have a permanent position , but would you take a postdoc ? ” I could buy a lot of lunches .
However , around 1997 the graphics job market became very strong , with many individuals getting multiple offers with high salaries .
1998 was an excellent year for people looking for tenure - track graphics faculty positions .
I know many friends who found good tenure - track positions that year .
So when I revised this guide in 2000 , I said the job market was strong with high demand .
Of course , the tech industry went downhill at that point .
So I no longer say anything about how strong or weak the job market appears to be .
Instead , I will describe two consistent but unfortunate trends I have observed since graduating : Tenure - track positions are increasingly requiring candidates to do one or more postdocs :
This trend has been documented by Anita Jones in the article The Explosive Growth of Postdocs in Computer Science ( ACM Digital Library subscription required ) .
Since 2007 , hiring of Ph.D. ’s in academia is increasingly dominated by postdoc positions rather than tenure - track positions .
The requirements for a tenure - track position appear to have been redefined to make one or more postdocs nearly mandatory .
This has been the case in other disciplines for a long time , but it is relatively new for Computer Science .
This delays a Ph.D. ’s career and forces people who want to become professors to endure several more years of low pay and status .
Industrial research positions have become difficult to find : Overall , most businesses focus on the short term .
Therefore , the trend has been to cut back or close industrial research labs .
Big companies increasingly rely on letting startups attempt certain kinds of innovation and then partnering with or acquiring those .
Companies also pursue innovation through advanced development groups that are different than traditional research labs .
Before starting the job hunt , determine your goals and parameters in advance and the “ angle ” you will take to sell yourself .
For example , my strength was in systems , so I chose to emphasize that in my cover letters .
Customize your approach to each site , if time permits .
What you do for your thesis determines who will and who wo n’t take a look at you .
Try to get at least one reference from outside your university .
This guide is not going to cover the basics of interviewing ; you can get that from many books ( e.g. the Martin Yate and Bob Weinstein books listed in the references ) .
However , I will mention some tips .
Do n’t interview on the day of arrival , and try to avoid Mondays and Fridays .
Be prepared for hard or illegal questions , by finding polite ways of addressing the underlying concern .
Do your homework on each site before interviewing !
It continually amazes me that people show up for interviews without knowing anything about the institution they want to join .
If the target is a research lab for a major company , you can easily look up Wall St. Journal articles , annual reports and stockbroker reports .
If your goal is an academic position , check out the Tomorrow ’s Professor site and The Professor Is In for guidance .
If you interview at a university , get their course catalog and use their numbering scheme to describe the courses you can teach .
Interview to find out more about them , not just to sell yourself .
Your 45 - 60 minute research presentation is crucial ; make sure you practice it thoroughly .
Interviews create interviews .
That is , if you ’ve already gone on many interviews at other places , that makes you appear more desirable since others want you , and that makes it easier for you to get more interviews .
Broadcast this fact by keeping your interview schedule on your web page .
There is an anecdote about one student who received offers to interview at many different places , but only after Stanford interviewed him !
Keep logs on who you talk to , what you talked about , and when .
That makes it easier to keep things straight when juggling several contenders .
The major conferences in your field are a good place to schedule preliminary interviews to get your foot in the door , because it is cheap for the company or university .
The people you need to meet are already there , so that saves them the expense of having to fly you out and house you at their site .
Offers are a waiting game .
Be prepared for lots of frustration .
You need a written offer or nothing is official ; you should also accept or reject in writing .
Negotiate , but be aware of the strength or weakness of your position .
I also recommend doing only one round of negotiating ( i.e. you counterpropose terms , and the organization responds to that , and then you make a decision ) .
As a hiring manager , I can tell you that it is very frustrating when a candidate attempts to negotiate for a long time , and that can make an employer upset and possibly even rescind the offer .
Look at the entire package .
Starting salary may not be as important as the type of work , the environment , benefits , growth potential , and work - life balance .
Drug tests and other factors are becoming more common ; you will have to decide how you want to respond to those .
Ah yes , salaries .
Everybody wants to know about those .
For academic ( tenure track ) salaries , you can get typical numbers from the annual Taulbee surveys , printed in the Computing Research News newsletter and the Communications of the ACM .
For example , the median salary listed in the 2015 Taulbee survey for associate professors was almost $ 114 k .
Realize that these are 9 - month salaries .
Whether or not you can procure funding to cover 2 or 3 months of summer salary makes a big difference to your bottom line .
Also , professors can make money by consulting , although this is more common among established professors .
Rates can be up to $ 4000 per day or more , depending on the type of consulting and the client .
Figures for industrial salaries are harder to come by .
The Maisel and Gaddy references are the only ones I have found that specifically survey young Ph.D. ’s in industry , and those figures are now very old .
Salaries depend heavily on geography .
For example , salaries in the Silicon Valley and San Francisco are high .
But before you decide to move to Palo Alto , remember that the cost of living there is also in the stratosphere .
When I first wrote this guide ( in 1997 ) , nice houses in the Silicon Valley in good areas cost more than half a million dollars .
In 2017 , those same houses probably cost $ 1.25 M to $ 1.5 M or more .
More general computer science salary surveys are run by the IEEE and EE Times .
As a hiring manager , I will caution you against believing self - reported figures from sites such as Glassdoor .
My experience is that those are not accurate and generally exaggerate salary figures .
They also often confuse base salaries with total compensation that includes bonuses , stock and other benefits .
Acquire salary information on your own by making use of your network .
Do n’t ask for someone ’s salary directly , unless it ’s someone you know very well and even then be very careful .
Instead , bounce figures off people and see how they respond .
Do they think the figure you mention is high , low , or about right ?
By seeing how people respond you can get an idea of what the market range is .
Factor in benefits and the expected workload into your compensation evaluation .
An offer with high compensation may seem less attractive if you have to work 80 hour weeks in that position .
You may have to do some detective work to determine the truth .
A company might say they value work - life balance , while the established culture tells you a different story : where people have to work 80 hour weeks to get promoted or to even keep up with expectations and deadlines .
For many positions , particularly in Silicon Valley , variable compensation ( cash bonuses , restricted stock units and stock options ) make up a significant part of the total compensation , along with benefits .
For Computer Science Ph.D. ’s , there are four major categories of employers : Startups ( including starting your own business or consulting )
Commercial businesses
Industrial or government research labs
Academia Startups : Joining a startup , or starting your own company , is potentially the most lucrative route .
It is also the riskiest .
Most startups pay below market compensation and cannot offer the benefits that Google can , but may offer equity that provides the chance of a “ home run ” that you wo n’t get at a big company .
Most startups fail .
Overall , the home runs are few , but they do occur .
For example , I know some people who joined Oculus prior to it being acquired by Facebook .
Startups are a very different work environment than established big companies .
They are typically small , informal , agile , and lacking in resources .
They may be more flexible in work environment than most Fortune 500 companies .
But they are also less likely to have knowledgable HR personnel who ensure that laws are followed .
A paycheck from a Fortune 500 company is not likely to bounce .
Startups tend to fire quickly and are more likely to shut down .
A startup has a limited amount of time and resources to establish itself so that it can become self sustaining or an acquisition target .
That means it is not a place to pursue long - term research , no matter what the founders may say .
The best analogy I heard : Joining a startup is like deciding to jump off a tall cliff with a bunch of other people , believing that you will successfully build working sets of wings and will soar away prior to hitting the ground .
If you do this , you do n’t want to spend time and energy on things that are n’t directly related to building wings !
You might also check the base of the cliff beforehand to see how many bodies you find there .
Startups are not generally compatible with work - life balance .
Due to the limited resources , startups have to demand more sacrifices than a more established company .
By working in a startup , you will likely fall out of touch with the research community in your field and lose the state - of - the - art knowledge that you worked so hard to acquire by getting a Ph.D .
It is easier to go from a research background to a startup or commercial position than it is to go the other direction .
Although old , the Kawasaki and Bell references listed at the end of this document may be useful if you want to work at a startup .
Matt Cutts was a graduate student at UNC Chapel Hill .
We both had the same advisor .
Unlike me , Matt did not finish his Ph.D. Instead , he left early to join a startup that had less than 100 people at that time .
You might have heard of this startup .
It was called Google .
If you win the startup lottery , like Matt , he offers some advice here and here .
I also like how Google prepared its employees prior to its IPO .
For two different perspectives of startups , read Disrupted : My Misadventure in the Start - Up Bubble for a perspective of an older worker and how he did n’t fit into one startup , and The Founder ’s Dilemmas , which explains challenges and key decisions that founders face in starting their own company .
Commercial businesses : Normal development or production jobs that focus on supporting or developing new products represent the vast majority of employment opportunities .
However , getting a Ph.D. makes you overqualified for most of these .
Ph.D. training prepares students for academic careers , rather than business careers .
Most people who seek a Ph.D. are looking for different types of work than normal commercial jobs .
However , if your interests lie in business rather than research , this can be the best way to go .
There are Ph.D ’s who have become VP ’s and CEO’s .
Advanced development jobs can be interesting and challenging , and they provide the satisfaction of seeing your work impact product or a company .
Industrial or government research labs :
These sit somewhere in between normal commercial jobs and academia .
Typically they enable you to look somewhat longer term than a normal job , publish papers , go to conferences , etc .
However , these are managed environments , so your research work must tie into the business of the company or the mission of the lab .
Reorganizations and changes in priorities can commonly occur , and you have to surf those changes to stay employed and viable .
The compensation in industrial research can be good , generally much better than government positions or academia .
But like commercial jobs or startups , your job can get cut at any time .
I worked at a lab where one day , without any warning , managers appeared and informed us that the company was shutting down our lab and that almost everyone would be laid off , including me .
You also will not have the “ home run ” potential of a startup .
If you work in industrial research , you should really be motivated to make an impact on your company , by transitioning research into product or processes that directly contribute to your company ’s future .
If your primary goals are to publish papers , advance the field and make a name for yourself , and you do n’t really care about the commercial and business aspects , then academia is a better choice .
However , even if you focus on doing research that is important to your company , it is possible to achieve external recognition .
For example , I recently was elected an IEEE Fellow , despite spending my entire career in industrial research .
In this role , you should be ambitious to accomplish something rather than being ambitious to make yourself famous .
Labs that are completely owned by commercial companies or ones that have mandated government funding generally have a consistent stream of funding ( until executives or politicians decide to change things ) .
Other labs must rely on winning contracts , from other companies or from the government .
That can be a volatile , frustrating way to work .
It can be stressful knowing that your team ’s continued employment depends on winning the next contract .
In a previous job , I sometimes felt we spent 100 % of our time trying to secure funding , so we could spend the other 100 % getting some research done .
Academia : Working in universities is the traditional career path for Ph.D.’s.
A tenured professor is the most secure and stable research position that exists , and the one that grants the most freedom .
Professors can choose what they want to work on .
If you are focused on publishing and want to ensure that nobody can tell you what to do , then become a tenured professor .
If your main motivation is to become a very famous researcher , then become a tenured professor .
However , tenure is not easy to achieve .
Getting a tenure - track position is difficult .
You have to be good and possibly lucky to get one .
As I previously mentioned , postdoc experience is becoming an almost mandatory prerequisite .
Read the Feibelman and Ralston references for tips on surviving a postdoc .
Furthermore , getting tenure is a race against the clock to publish enough impressive research results that your department decides to grant tenure rather than sending you out the door .
As Randy Pausch put it , tenure is a competitive process where you get compared with the other assistant professors and the already - tenured professors .
If they worked 70 hour weeks for six years to get tenure , do n’t expect to get away with working 40 hour weeks .
The tenure track is not kind to those who want to start a family .
Even if you start graduate school directly after finishing your Bachelor ’s degree , you will probably be in your late 20’s when finishing the Ph.D. and in your mid to late 30 ’s when achieving tenure .
The realities of the biological clock tend to conflict with the demands required to achieve tenure .
Professor jobs tend to be focused either on research or teaching .
Smaller colleges and universities tend to focus mostly on teaching , and professors are evaluated that way .
Teaching positions generally pay less than the research positions at big universities , where professors are primarily evaluated by their research and how many trees they kill by publishing papers , and if their teaching is good enough to keep the dean from hearing complaints .
There are also “ soft money ” positions in academia , which are professors and staff who are paid from contracts and grants rather than tenured positions .
These lack the security of tenure and it can be difficult to stay alive on such funding .
Most contracts and grants are aimed at funding graduate students and covering one or two months of a professor ’s salary , but not toward paying for full - time staff .
The comments I made about fundraising in industrial or government research labs also apply to academic positions .
Most of my friends who are professors in the US have to spend far too much time writing proposals , and the percentage of those that are awarded seems to keep going down .
If you are tenured , then your job does not rely upon winning proposals , but without external money , you will not be able to support graduate students or pay for extra staff , and your impact will therefore be limited .
I saw a Computing Research News article estimating that total compensation for assistant and associate professors lags that of industrial counterparts by 25 % .
Compared against Silicon Valley compensation , I estimate the difference to be around 50 % .
If you want to get a tenure - track position , read The Professor Is In , a book that goes into great detail about how to land a tenure - track job .
The author also runs a blog and service to help students seeking to become professors .
Keep in mind that the author has a background in the humanities , so if you are a CS Ph.D. student you have to factor in the differences between a CS Ph.D. program vs. one in the humanities .
For example , CS Ph.D. students typically receive financial support , so accumulating large debts is less of a problem .
In CS , publications at certain conferences are valuable , whereas in the humanities , conference publications may not count for much .
Other tips :
When I had to look for a job in 2012 , the single thing I did that was most helpful to my job hunt was creating my own website .
A C.V. is a very dry , hard to read document .
My website serves as a visual version of a C.V. where I provide images , videos , and detailed descriptions of the projects I worked on .
This is a much more compelling way of communicating who I am and what I can offer .
As a hiring manager , I found it very helpful when candidates had good websites about themselves .
LinkedIn is sufficient for many job hunters , but for people with a Ph.D. , I highly recommend creating and maintaining your own website .
It does n’t cost that much and is well worth the effort .
The article The Secret Formula for Choosing the Right Next Role ( ACM digital library access required ) suggests that when choosing jobs , focus more on what skills you will acquire , what you can accomplish there and who you will work with , rather than focusing on your job title , paycheck and initial project .
No matter where you go after you graduate , maintain your contacts with your alma mater .
You may change jobs and move from place to place , but you will always have your degree from your university .
If you keep good relations with your university and your fellow former students , that will serve as an excellent base for your personal network .
Conclusion
“ Dissertations are not finished ; they are abandoned . ”
- Frederick P. Brooks , Jr.
The following story , called “ The Parable of the Black Belt , ” is excerpted from Built to Last : Successful Habits of Visionary Companies , by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras .
Picture a martial artist kneeling before the master sensei in a ceremony to receive a hard - earned black belt .
After years of relentless training , the student has finally reached a pinnacle of achievement in the discipline .
“ Before granting the belt , you must pass one more test , ” says the sensei .
“ I am ready , ” responds the student , expecting perhaps one final round of sparring .
“ You must answer the essential question :
What is the true meaning of the black belt ? ”
“ The end of my journey , ” says the student .
“ A well - deserved reward for all my hard work . ”
The sensei waits for more .
Clearly , he is not satisfied .
Finally , the sensei speaks .
“ You are not yet ready for the black belt .
Return in one year . ”
A year later , the student kneels again in front of the sensei .
“ What is the true meaning of the black belt ? ” asks the sensei .
“ A symbol of distinction and the highest achievement in our art , ” says the student .
The sensei says nothing for many minutes , waiting .
Clearly , he is not satisfied .
Finally , he speaks .
“ You are still not ready for the black belt .
Return in one year . ”
A year later , the student kneels once again in front of the sensei .
And again the sensei asks : “ What is the true meaning of the black belt ? ”
“ The black belt represents the beginning -- the start of a never - ending journey of discipline , work , and the pursuit of an ever - higher standard , ” says the student .
“ Yes .
You are now ready to receive the black belt and begin your work . ”
To me , there are two lessons in this story .
First , the Ph.D. is the beginning , not the culmination , of your career .
Do n’t worry about making it your magnum opus .
Get out sooner , rather than later .
Second , if you bother to talk to and learn from the people who have already gone through this process , you might graduate two years earlier .
Good luck .

Unless you 've been living under a rock for the last few years , you 've probably heard about the game Katamari Damacy .
The gameplay consists of little more than rolling stuff up into an ever - increasing ball of stuff .
That 's literally all you do .
You start by rolling up small things like matchsticks , thimbles , pushpins , and so on .
As the ball gets larger , you roll up ever larger and larger items .
Eventually , your Katamari ball gets so large you end up rolling together cities , mountains , clouds -- eventually entire planets .
It 's unbelievably fun , and completely mesmerizing .
After I played for a while , I realized that Katamari Damacy is a game about the scale of life , reminiscent of the classic Eames powers of ten movie .
As Bob Koss points out , code has a natural tendency to become a giant Katamari ball of " stuff " , too :
I travel a lot and I get to visit a lot of different companies .
No matter which industry a company is in or which programming language a team is using , there is one commonality in all of the code that I see Ã¢â‚¬â€œ classes are just too damn big and methods are just too damn long .
We programmers must take matters into our own hands and become masters of our domains .
Unless we take action , things are just going to get bigger and bigger until we have a real mess on our hands .
Bob 's article is about managing the scale of your code :
This notion of breaking a class into smaller and smaller pieces is exactly opposite to what I learned when I first started studying OO .
Way back when I worried about bad - hair days , people believed that a class should encapsulate everything that concerned it .
A Customer class would know the business rules of being a Customer as well as how to retrieve itself from the database and display it 's data .
That 's a fine idea , provided the database schema never changes , the display never changes , or the business rules never change .
If any one of those responsibilities change , we are at a high risk of breaking other things that are coupled to it .
So many aspects of software development can be summarized as small is beautiful :
The odds of failure for a software project are directly proportional to the size of the project .
Slicing a large project into several smaller subprojects is the single most direct way to increase your project 's chances of success .
The relationship between lines of code and bugs is completely linear .
Fewer code means fewer bugs .
Smaller code avoids TL ; DR ( Too Long ; Didn't Read ) syndrome .
The less code there is to read , the higher the odds are that someone will actually read it .
actually read it .
If you keep your dependencies to a minimum , your code will be simpler and easier to understand .
It 's up to us to resist the natural tendency of any project to snowball into a giant rolling Katamari ball of code .
Code smaller !
Abdullah Gul is expected to be elected president
PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Tuesday that Mr Gul had been named the governing AK party 's candidate .
The decision came after thousands had taken to the streets to urge Mr Erdogan not to stand .
Secularists fear that a president from the AK - a party with Islamist roots - could undermine Turkey 's secular order .
Mr Gul insisted that " the president must be loyal to secular principles " , adding : " If I am elected I will act accordingly " .
Both Mr Erdogan and Mr Gul have wives who wear the Islamic headscarf - a highly divisive issue in Turkey .
Mr Gul ( right ) was cheered in the AK - dominated parliament
Analysis : Tense election
Mr Gul defended the headscarf choice on Tuesday , saying " these are individual preferences and everybody should respect them " .
Parliament will hold the first round of voting on Friday and the AK 's majority means its candidate is likely to win .
Turkey has been a republic since 1923 , with a strict separation of religion and the state .
The AK party has its roots in political Islam .
But correspondents say that Mr Gul is seen as less confrontational than Mr Erdogan .
Establishment pressure
Turkey 's chief of staff , Gen Yasar Buyukanit , and outgoing President Ahmet Necdet Sezer have urged the new president to defend Turkey 's secular values .
Speaking to the AK group in parliament , Mr Erdogan said Mr Gul was " the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become Turkey 's 11th president " .
There will be several rounds of voting in the 550 - member parliament before the new head of state takes office on 16 May .
Mr Gul , 56 , has steered Turkey 's European Union accession talks since becoming foreign minister in 2003 .
He had a brief spell as prime minister after the AK party 's election victory in November 2002 .
Educated in England as well as Turkey , he is an English speaker and is regarded as a moderate , the BBC's Pam O'Toole reports .
Cloaking devices are a staple of science fiction stories
So far , cloaking has been confined to science fiction ; in Star Trek it is used to render spacecraft invisible .
Professor Sir John
Pendry says a simple demonstration model that could work for radar might be possible within 18 months ' time .
In the journal Science two separate teams , including Professor Pendry's , have outlined ways to cloak objects .
These research papers present the maths required to verify that the concept could work .
But developing an invisibility cloak is likely to pose significant challenges .
Both groups propose methods using the unusual properties of so - called " metamaterials " to build a cloak .
These metamaterials can be designed to induce a desired change in the direction of electromagnetic waves , such as light .
This is done by tinkering with the nano - scale structure of the metamaterial , not by altering its chemistry .
Light flow
John Pendry 's team suggest that by enveloping an object in a metamaterial cloak , light waves can be made to flow around the object in the same way that water would do so .
" Water behaves a little differently to light .
If you put a pencil in water that 's moving , the water naturally flows around the pencil .
When it gets to the other side , the water closes up , " Professor Pendry told the BBC .
Special materials could make light " flow " around an object like water
" Light does n't do that of course , it hits the pencil and scatters .
So you want to put a coating around the pencil that allows light to flow around it like water , in a nice , curved way . "
The work provides a mathematical " recipe " for bending light waves in such a way as to achieve a desired cloaking effect .
John Pendry , along with colleagues David Smith and David Schurig at Duke University in North Carolina , US , have been testing suitable metamaterials for the device they plan to build .
This , Sir John explained , would consist of a sphere or cylinder wrapped in a sheath of metamaterial which could cloak it from radio waves .
" It 's not tremendously fancy , but that for us would be quite an achievement , " he told the BBC News website .
Professor Ulf Leonhardt , author of another cloaking paper in Science , described the effect for light as a " mirage " .
" What you 're trying to do is guide light around an object , but the art is to bend it such that it leaves the object in precisely the same way that it initially hits it .
You have the illusion that there is nothing there , " he told the BBC's Science in Action programme .
The work could have uses in military stealth technology - but engineers have not yet created the materials that could be used to cloak an aircraft or a tank , John Pendry explains .
Professor Pendry 's research has been supported by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) .
Several other scientific teams have proposed ideas for cloaking devices .
One theoretical paper proposed using a material known as a superlens to cancel out light being scattered from an object .

A young woman went to her mother , told her about her life and how things were so hard for her .
She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up .
She was tired of fighting and struggling .
It seemed as though every time one problem was solved , a new one arose .
Her mother took her to the kitchen .
She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire .
Soon the pots came to boil .
In the first she placed carrots , in the second she placed eggs , and in the last she placed ground coffee beans .
She let them sit and boil , without saying a word .
In about twenty minutes , she turned off the burners .
She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl .
She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl .
Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl .
Turning to her daughter , she asked , " Tell me what you see . "
" Carrots , eggs and coffee , " she replied .
Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots .
She did and noted that they were soft .
The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it .
After pulling off the shell , she observed the hard boiled egg .
Finally , the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee .
The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich aroma .
The daughter then asked , " What does it mean , mother ? "
Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity , boiling water .
Each reacted differently .
The carrot went in strong , hard and unrelenting .
But after being subjected to the boiling water , it softened and became weak .
The egg had been fragile .
Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior , but after sitting through the boiling water , its inside became hardened .
The ground coffee beans were unique , however .
After they were in the boiling water , they had changed the water .
" Which are you ? " she asked her daughter .
" When adversity knocks on your door , how do you respond ?
Are you a carrot , an egg or a coffee bean ? "
Think of this :
Which am I ?
Am I the carrot that seems strong , but with pain and adversity do I wilt , become soft and lose my strength ?
Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart , but changes with the heat ?
Did I have a fluid spirit , but after a death , a break - up , a financial hardship or some other trial , have I become hardened and stiff ?
Does my shell look the same , but on the inside , am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart ?
Or am I like the coffee bean ?
The bean actually changes the hot water , the very circumstance that brings the pain .
When the water gets hot , it releases the fragrance and flavour .
If you are like the bean , when things are at their worst , you get better and change the situation around you .
When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest , do you elevate yourself to another level ?
How do you handle adversity ?
Are you a carrot , an egg or a coffee bean ?
May you have enough happiness to make you sweet , enough trials to make you strong , enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy .
The happiest of people do n't necessarily have the best or most of everything they just make the most of everything that comes along their way .
The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches .
When you were born , you were crying and everyone around you was smiling .
Live your life so that , at the end , you 're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying .
It 's easier to build a child than repair an adult .
This is so true ...
May we all be like the COFFEE !

Coffee , Carrot and Eggs : A philosophical lesson on life
This is your scene ; love and respect it and it will grow .
Disrespect it and it will go .
The internet telephony industry let out a collective sigh of relief Tuesday after a federal appeals court issued a stay order allowing Vonage to continue signing up new customers during its appeal in a major patent - infringement case .
The case is being closely watched by the internet telephony industry , as opponent Verizon 's patents might also affect other voice - over internet protocol , or VOIP , providers ' ability to connect their services to the public telephone network .
Tuesday 's temporary reprieve ( .pdf ) means the window for dozens of other VOIP carriers remains open , for the time being , while Vonage attempts to disprove Verizon 's wide - ranging patent claims .
The original injunction would have completely blocked Vonage 's ability to sell its VOIP service .
That injunction stemmed from a patent - infringement lawsuit brought by Verizon last June , alleging that Vonage violated seven of Verizon 's patents .
The courts eventually ruled in favor of the telecom giant , recognizing three patent infringements , and ordered Vonage to pay Verizon $ 58 million in damages and a 5.5 percent royalty rate on each Vonage customer .
Vonage is currently the largest VOIP provider in the United States , with approximately 2.2 million users .
The case currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is a litmus test that may well determine the future of the telecom industry .
If Verizon 's patent claims against Vonage hold up in the appeals court , the fate of many smaller VOIP companies , such as SunRocket and Packet8 , could immediately be put in jeopardy , as the same patents could also prevent them from connecting their internet phone services to the public phone network .
The short - term effect could give Verizon a de facto VOIP monopoly .
Long - term , the case could affect more purely internet - based communication services , such as those offered by peer - to - peer telephony leader Skype .
SunRocket distanced itself from the technology and patent issues involved in the Vonage case .
" We cannot comment on intellectual property matters , " said spokesman Jeremy James .
" What we can say is that SunRocket 's network is architected differently from Vonage's . "
Still , some VOIP experts believe Verizon 's legal claims are bound to fail .
Jeff Pulver , a VOIP pioneer and early partner of Vonage founder and interim CEO Jeffrey Citron , recently noted that Verizon 's patent claims describe a process that Pulver helped create in 1995 , well before the Verizon patent .
Apparently , Vonage agrees with Pulver 's assertions .
After Tuesday 's stay order , Vonage 's Sharon O'Leary said , " We believe the original verdict was based on an erroneous claim construction ....
As a result , ( the district court 's decisions ) artificially expanded the coverage of Verizon 's patents well beyond what was intended by the patent trademark process . "
As the industry watches the embattled company fight for its life , the future of VOIP hangs in the balance , even as millions of people remain mostly unaware that the way they have become accustomed to making calls could drastically change in the near future .

Anti-American protests in Tehran are a regular event
" It 's the most unusual relationship we have with any country in the world , " explains US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns .
" It 's been 27 years since we 've had a normal diplomatic , social and political relationship .
And so for instance I am one of the people responsible for Iran in our government and yet I have never met an Iranian government official in my 25 - year career . "
The fiery rhetoric between Iran and the US of recent months has made it appear that the two countries are on a collision course .
But did it have to be this way and could the two sides still sit down face to face ?
9/11 opportunity
In the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US , there were some tentative steps .
In Iran , vast crowds turned out on the streets and held candlelit vigils for the victims .
Sixty - thousand spectators respected a minute 's silence at Tehran 's football stadium .
Iran came close to a war with the Taleban
Some of Iran 's leaders also sensed an opportunity .
America quickly fixed its sights on the Taleban in Afghanistan with whom the Iranians had nearly come to war just three years earlier .
With a common enemy in the Taleban , the two found grounds to co-operate .
After the Afghan war , US negotiators worked closely with Iranian counterparts to form a new Afghan government .
Some of the talks between US and Iranian officials moved beyond Afghanistan and there was hope that it could lead to tentative re-engagement and eventually a restoration of relations .
But back in their respective capitals , there were voices of dissent .
Debates in Washington and Tehran paralleled each other .
Hardliners and moderates clashed about whether it was worth talking to the other side and whether it could ever be trusted .
And just a few weeks after Iran and the US had worked so closely over Afghanistan , Iran was described by President George W Bush as part of an " axis of evil " in his 2002 State of the Union address .
Javad Zarif , now Iran 's ambassador to the United Nations , said this was a big surprise after the co-operation over the Afghan government .
" We were all shocked by the fact that the US had such a short memory and was so ungrateful about what had happened just a month ago , " he said .
But the hardliners in Washington had been bolstered by Israel 's discovery just a few weeks before the speech of a consignment of arms alleged to be heading from Iran to Palestinian groups .
Surprise overture
Another potential opening came in May 2003 .
America 's swift march to Baghdad the previous month had led to fears in Tehran that it would be next .
So Tehran made a dramatic - but surprisingly little known - approach to the Americans .
Iran 's offer came in the form of a letter , although Iranian diplomats have suggested that their letter was in turn a response to a set of talking points that had come from US intermediaries .
In it , Iran appeared willing to put everything on the table - including being completely open about its nuclear programme , helping to stabilise Iraq , ending its support for Palestinian militant groups and help in disarming Hezbollah .
I believe the nuclear issue could have been resolved long time ago
Javad Zarif , Iran ambassador
The letter was the product of an internal debate inside Tehran and had the support of leaders at the highest level .
" That letter went to the Americans to say that we are ready to talk , we are ready to address our issues , " explains Seyed Adeli , who was then a deputy foreign minister in Iran .
But in Washington , the letter was ignored .
Larry Wilkerson , who was then chief of staff to US Secretary of State Colin Powell , thinks that was a big mistake .
" In my mind it was one of those things you throw up in the air and say I can't believe we did this . "
He says the hardliners who stood against dialogue had a memorable refrain .
" We do n't speak to evil " .
The problem was that at the very moment that Iranian vulnerability was at its greatest , thanks to America 's swift march to Baghdad , Washington was at its most triumphalist .
Why talk to Iran when you could simply dictate terms from a position of strength ?
Gift to the hardliners
The effect of America 's rejection of talks was far reaching .
It would tilt the balance of power within Tehran towards the hardliners .
" The failure is not just for the idea , but also for the group who were pursuing the idea , " explains Seyed Adeli .
Over the following years , the hardliners in Tehran who were far less supportive of dialogue moved into the ascendancy .
And the balance of power between Iran and the US began to shift .
President Ahmadinejad ponders tactics at the UN General Assembly
America 's victory in Iraq began to look like something far more ambivalent as a bloody insurgency gathered strength .
Meanwhile , Iran 's influence both in Iraq and across the Middle East grew , augmented by rising oil prices .
In March 2005 , the US announced it would back the EU 's negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme , which Iran says is peaceful but the US and others believe is geared towards weapons .
The possibility of talks is currently on the table .
But the US insists that Iran must suspend its nuclear activity first .
At the UN , Iran 's ambassador Javad Zarif argues that this is the source of the problem .
" Had it not been for those arbitrary red lines and the pressure that went along with those arbitrary red lines imposed on our negotiating partners , I believe the nuclear issue could have been resolved a long time ago . "
But the US believes that Iran has failed to be open about its nuclear programme and needs to abide by UN demands that it halt its activity first .
The two sides may be able to sit down and talk face to face in the coming months , if agreement can be reached regarding some form of Iranian suspension of nuclear activity .
But if this chance is lost , there may not be many more .

Illustrator Walter Moers is famous for his comic books depicting the dictator as a frustrated little man who throws fits every time the Jews are mentioned .
But with the release of the short film " Der Bonker " , Germans seem to feel he has gone too far .
Despite thousands of Moers fans making the clip one of this week 's top internet downloads , many prominent German Jews have complained at the comic portryal of the mass - murdering dictator .
Jewish author Ralph Giordano , one of those speaking out against Moers ' film , said : " You cannot treat the father of the Holocaust in this way . "
And TV channels RTL2 , ProSieben , MTV and Viva are refusing to show any ads by the Jamba ringtone company , which offers the clip as a mobile phone download .
Jamba spokesman Niels Genzmer said " Der Bonker " is still one of the top five most popular downloads despite the boycott and he disagreed that the film is anything other than a satire .
" First we were told it promotes rightwing extremism , then we were told it could be conceived as doing so .
We cannot comprehend this , " he said .
In the cartoon , presented in the style of a music video , a caricatured version of Hitler is shown in the bathroom of his bunker in 1945 , singing angrily to himself about the way the war is going .
At one point he sits on his toilet and sings in rhyming German slang : " The Second World War is n't any fun any more .
The bombs are not falling on England , but Germany instead .
No one 's listening to me , everyone does what they want , and the cause of everything is that Churchill .
That hurts . "
Later he gets in to the bath with his sheepdog " Blondie " where little rubber ducks wearing Hitler moustaches sing : " Adolf , you old Nazi pig , do n't you see it 's time to surrender ? "
When Moers was criticised for satirising such a serious topic he replied : " May we do this ?
We have to do this . "
Lea Rosh , co-founder of the Berlin Holocaust Memorial , said she does not believe " that this is a topic that one can make jokes about " .
But Jewish publicist Henryk M Broder says he thinks the cartoon is a refreshing way of looking at an old topic .
" That Hitler was a murderer - we know that , it does n't have to be the topic of every thesis .
But Moers shows wonderfully what kind of a wretched , useless gasbag the Germans fell for .
And that 's groovy . "

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia wants an apology from a Dutch politician who said Muslims should “ tear out half the Koran ” if they wanted to live in his country and has asked the Dutch government to intervene , a Saudi newspaper said on Sunday .
The Dutch government , which said it did not agree with the remarks made by populist anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders , confirmed that foreign ministry officials held informal talks last week with the Saudi embassy in The Hague .
“ It ( the embassy ) appealed to the appropriate authorities on the need for Wilders ’ insulting statements to be withdrawn and an apology given to Muslims , ” the Saudi newspaper al - Watan reported .
“ The embassy has demanded that the Dutch side put an end to such statements and actions . ”
Wilders said in an interview published last week that Muslims should throw away half their holy book if they wanted to stay in the Netherlands and that he would chase Islam ’s Prophet Mohammad out of the country if he were alive today .
“ Our minister is not happy with Wilders ’ remarks , ” a Dutch foreign ministry spokesman said .
“ It is not the point of view of the Dutch government .
Wilders is a parliamentarian , it is his right to express himself , ” the spokesman added .
Last year Saudi Arabia , the birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest shrines , withdrew its ambassador to Copenhagen over Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet , which provoked worldwide protests among Muslims .
Wilders , who has lived under heavy guard since 2004 when a Dutch - Moroccan killed filmmaker and Islam critic
Theo van Gogh , has campaigned to ban the Muslim burqa veil , wants to freeze immigration and ban new mosques and religious schools .
Wilders , who is seen as an heir to murdered populist Pim Fortuyn and whose new party won nine seats out of 150 in November parliamentary elections , has warned of a “ tsunami of Islamisation ” in a country that is home to 1 million Muslims out of a population of some 16 million .
“ Islam is a violent religion .
If Mohammad lived here today I could imagine chasing him out of the country tarred and feathered as an extremist , ” Wilders said in the interview with the daily De Pers on February 13 .
The Dutch news agency ANP quoted Wilders as saying on Sunday he would not retract his remarks .
“ I would not dream of taking any of it back , ” Wilders said .
“ Have they gone completely mad ?
It is scandalous that a country which does not have freedom of speech teaches me a lesson .
They must learn that when you are a parliamentarian here , you may say what you want . ”
In an era when the educated elite seems wholly comfortable with overt sexual imagery ( Nerve.com depicts highbrow group gropes ; Fleshbot.com and others archly parse the nether parts of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears ) , maybe it ’s not so strange that students are confronting their own sex lives so graphically and publicly .
But there ’s more to the phenomenon .
Considering that a smorgasbord of Internet porn is but a mouse click away for most college students , there ’s something valiant , even quaint , about the attempt to organize and consider sex in a printed magazine .
It ’s as if , though curious to explore the possibly frightening boundlessness of adult eroticism , they also wish to keep it at arm ’s length , contained within the safety of the campus .
The students involved display a host of contradictory qualities : cheekiness and earnestness , progressive politics and retro sensibilities , salacity and sensitivity .
They are n’t so much answering the question of what is and what is n’t porn — or what those categories might even mean today — as artfully , disarmingly and sometimes deliberately skirting it .
Despite the sex magazines ’ brash names and general air of exuberance , a scrim of protectiveness , even primness hangs over many of them — a vestige , perhaps , of a not - so - distant past when topics like date rape , sexual harassment and AIDS were dominating the national discourse .
Seminars addressing these issues are still a part of most freshman orientations , though mention of the infamous Antioch sex code of the early 1990s — which postulated that students should secure their partner ’s verbal consent , button by button , before each stage of lovemaking — tends to evoke blank stares and giggles from the undergraduates of 2007 .
Still , though personal online pages on Web sites like MySpace or home videos on YouTube often reveal as much as students do in these magazines , Squirm ’s release form specifies that the magazine is intended solely for on - campus distribution and that students retain the copyright to their contributions .
“ We try to limit unwanted exposure as much as we can , ” wrote its current editor , Sarah Fraser , in an e-mail message .
“ It ’s one thing to know you ’re posing nude or writing erotica for an insulated campus , and understandably quite another to know it ’s being disseminated widely . ”
After a brief initial flurry of publicity , Kimi Traube , one of Outlet ’s founders , began declining interviews from noncampus press .
“ We ’re flattered by all the attention but have decided it ’s best for the magazine to focus our energies on the Columbia community , ” she said , also via e-mail .
The current editor of H Bomb , Ming Vandenberg , is especially concerned about the security of the magazine ’s content on the Web .
“ I am trying to design a foolproof plan to prevent any negative externalities , ” she said , adding with a note of horror , “ There could be a photo of a clothed Harvard student that someone goes into , chops the head off and puts it on an unclothed body . ”
These publications vary in tone and content , but while all strive to be provocative after a fashion , they generally eschew the term “ pornographic , ” hurling it as an insult with the good - natured mutual contempt of varsity football teams .
“ Outlet ... is not intended to be porn , ” sniffs a December letter from Traube to readers , saucily addressed “ Dear Hotbottoms . ”
“ They do a very good job of that over at Harvard . ”
On their Web site , Harvard staff members retort : “ If you are n’t mature enough to tell the difference between playful nudity and pornography you probably should n’t be reading H Bomb . ”
The exception is Boink , which Oleyourryk calls “ user - friendly porn ” : an unblushing assortment of bared private parts , lewd prose and graphic caricatures .
With its panoply of contributors — about 50 percent of whom are enrolled at B.U. , most of the rest at other colleges —
Boink is the most independent and commercially ambitious of the pack , and at first glance the least interested in critical thought .
It retails for $ 7.95 at Newbury Comics and other stores in the Boston area , has a print run of 10,000 and , atypically for a college publication , pays its contributors .
Boink has also sponsored a number of parties , some shut down by the police for under - age drinking .
Recalling one of these events , Aaron Foster said enthusiastically : “ Girls walk around with their tops off .
But it ’s just a party .
My buddy was convinced there was some secret orgy room .
I was like , Dude , there is no secret orgy room ! ”
The absence of a secret sex dungeon was not enough to endear Boink to Boston University ’s administrators .
Before the first issue even appeared , it was denounced by Kenneth Elmore , the dean of students .
It did , however , attract the attention of Howard Stern , a B.U. alumnus , who promptly booked Oleyourryk on his radio talk show .
Ben Greenberg , a young editor at Warner Books , was alerted to the broadcast by a friend .
“ I was like , Wow , I ca n’t believe someone would do that — what would their parents think ? ” he says .
But the shock wore off quickly .
Harvard ’s sex magazine might have been more obvious fodder for a book , but “ the general consensus was that the H Bomb one was kind of tame , ” Greenberg says .
“ It did n’t want to consider itself in any way porn .
The Boink people were willing to embrace that and run with it and turn it into something sex - positive rather than something that was dirty and smut . ”
Warner , which has published anthologies by Penthouse and Vice magazines , eventually offered Anderson and Oleyourryk a six - figure advance to compile “ Boink : The Book , ” a collection of erotic writings and photographs from college students around the country ; it is scheduled for publication in 2008 , to coincide with spring break .
How 's this for the beginning of a lawsuit filed today in Los Angeles County Superior Court ? --
" Sacha Baron Cohen is a prankster . "
Two anonymous plaintiffs are suing 20th Century Fox and One America Productions , claiming members of their college fraternity were interviewed to become part of the smash " Borat : Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan " film .
The plaintiffs -- listed as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 -- were allegedly assured the film would not be shown in the U.S. and their identities would not be revealed .
They were both selected to appear in the movie and , according to the suit , taken " to a drinking establishment ' to loosen up ' and provided alcoholic beverages . "
They claim they signed the movie releases after " heavy drinking . "
The suit claims both men were then taken to a motor home where they were filmed , all the while " encouraged to continue drinking . "
The movie features a scene in a motor home where Cohen gets drunk with three frat boys who go on a racist rant about how they wished they had slaves and how minorities in the United States " have all the power . "
According to the lawsuit , the frat boys only received $ 200 for the controversial appearance .
The plaintiffs claim they suffered " humiliation , mental anguish , and emotional and physical distress , loss of reputation , goodwill and standing in the community ... " because the movie was indeed released in the U.S .
The suit asks for unspecified damages .
The Ranger has been involved in many neighbour disputes over trees and hedges .
Trees and hedges are usually on boundaries , you see , and so that ’s where the trouble starts .
It ’s very easy to underestimate the fury , rage and pain that courses through such seemingly storm - in - teacup matters .
On at least two occasions in recent times people have died over these disputes , one of these being shot by his neighbour .
So , not trifling matters .
What the protagonists almost invariably fail to recognise when they come to the Ranger for some assistance is that the authorities will rarely take one side or the other – in fact , they are more interested in the tree itself , because it is the tree which has amenity for the rest of us .
What is one person ’s nuisance is a beautiful addition to the landscape for many others .
So , in many cases , the Ranger finds himself defending not the harassed householder , nor the hysterical neighbour , but the trees .
How many times has the Ranger heard this one ?
‘ Dear Ranger , how do I kill my neighbour ’s nasty tree ?
I ’ve tried copper nails and it dos n’t work ’ .
So regularly the old ‘ copper nail ’ story is trotted out .
No doubt there are innumerable midnight expeditions by surreptitious neighbours silently tapping copper into the trunk of the hated specimen – indeed , the Ranger has actually found these nails in disputed trees .
Healthy , vigorous trees .
Yes , friends , let an old Ranger reveal a terrible truth – copper nails do not kill trees .
Where this story originated is a mystery , but practical experience demonstrates that the supposed ‘ magic bullet ’ solution is simply false .
Driving a copper nail into a tree does nothing .
You might kill a tree if you bought enough copper nails to make a pile big enough to hide the tree , but short of that you ’re wasting your time .
And where do you get copper nails from anyway ?
Is this whole thing promoted by the Copper Nail Retailers Association ?
Perhaps they do n’t have any other use for their product .
A tale from Berlin , where the 2006 World Cup fans filled the city , and the urinals , suggests a more enlightened alternative .
It seems that all those fans peeing in the bushes were killing the bushes .
We are wasting our time buying all these copper nails .
Let ’s just hold a big party , with lots of free beer , and no toilets .
Then , even if the trees survive , the neighbours might just have chilled out enough to all be friends again .
Oh , and if you came to this page wondering how to kill a tree with copper nails , or even how to kill trees without them ( yes , there is a way , and it ’s even easier than copper nails ) – sorry , this is not a page about killing trees so that ’s another story .
You probably wo n’t be too surprised to hear that the Ranger wo n’t be telling it to you .

Still do n’t believe me about the copper nails ?

Subject : Free Linux Driver Development !
Date : Mon , 29 Jan 2007 17:29:04 - 0800 Archive - link : Article , Thread
Free Linux Driver Development !
Yes , that 's right , the Linux kernel community is offering all companies free Linux driver development .
No longer do you have to suffer through all of the different examples in the Linux Device Driver Kit , or pick through the thousands of example drivers in the Linux kernel source tree trying to determine which one is the closest to what you need to do .
All that is needed is some kind of specification that describes how your device works , or the email address of an engineer that is willing to answer questions every once in a while .
A few sample devices might be good to have so that debugging does n't have to be done by email , but if necessary , that can be done .
In return , you will receive a complete and working Linux driver that is added to the main Linux kernel source tree .
The driver will be written by some of the members of the Linux kernel developer community ( over 1500 strong and growing ) .
This driver will then be automatically included in all Linux distributions , including the " enterprise " ones .
It will be automatically kept up to date and working through all Linux kernel API changes .
This driver will work with all [ 1 ] of the different CPU types supported by Linux , the largest number of CPU types supported by any operating system ever before in the history of computing .
As for support , the driver will be supported through email by the original developers , when they can help out , and by the " enterprise " Linux distributors as part of their service agreements with their customers .
If your company is worried about NDA issues surrounding your device 's specifications , we have arranged a program with OSDL / TLF's Tech Board to provide the legal framework where a company can interact with a member of the kernel community in order to properly assure that all needed NDA requirements are fulfilled .
Now your developers will have more time to work on drivers for all of the other operating systems out there , and you can add " supported on Linux " to your product 's marketing material .
This offer is in affect for all different types of devices , from USB toys to PCI video devices to high - speed networking cards .
If you build it , we can get Linux drivers working for it .
For any questions about this program , please feel free to respond to this email , or contact me directly at greg@kroah.com .
I will also be available at FreedomHEC 2007 < http://freedomhec.pbwiki.com/> held adjacent to WinHEC , if anyone wants to bring devices and work face - to - face .
thanks , greg k-h [ 1 ] for the CPUs that support the bus types that your device works on .

A newly designed porous membrane , so thin it ’s invisible edge - on , may revolutionize the way doctors and scientists manipulate objects as small as a molecule .
The 50 - atom thick filter can withstand surprisingly high pressures and may be a key to better separation of blood proteins for dialysis patients , speeding ion exchange in fuel cells , creating a new environment for growing neurological stem cells , and purifying air and water in hospitals and clean - rooms at the nanoscopic level .

At more than 4,000 times thinner than a human hair , the new barely - there membrane is thousands of times thinner than similar filters in use today .
Details on the membrane , developed at the University of Rochester , appear in today ’s issue of the journal Nature .
“ It ’s amazing , we have a material as thin as some of the molecules it ’s sorting , and even riddled with holes , but can withstand enough pressure to make real - world nano - filtering a practical reality , ” says research associate Christopher Striemer , co-creator of the membrane .
“ That ultra - thinness means much higher efficiency and lower sample loss , so we can do things that ca n’t normally be done with current materials . ”

The membrane is a 15 - nanometer - thick slice of the same silicon that ’s used every day in computer - chip manufacturing .
In the lab of Philippe Fauchet , professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University , Striemer discovered the membrane as he was looking for a way to better understand how silicon crystallizes when heated .
He used such a thin piece of silicon — only about 50 atoms thick — because it would allow him to use an electron microscope to see the crystal structure in his samples , formed with different heat treatments .
Striemer found that as parts of the silicon contracted into crystals , holes opened up in their wakes .
Imagine a party of people spread out evenly throughout a room , but as the evening progresses and people huddle into cliques , scattered areas of empty floor open up .
In talks with Striemer and Fauchet , James L. McGrath , assistant professor of biomedical engineering , and his graduate student , Tom Gaborski , realized that since the membrane ’s holes were only nanometers in size , it might be possible to separate objects as small as proteins much more effectively than is being done now .
Current molecular - level filters use a polymer - based design that is a jumble of varying holes and tunnels .
The sizes of holes in the polymer model vary greatly , and since its “ holes ” are really convoluted tunnels through the material , they require much more time for proteins to pass through , and they are prone to clogging .
Recently , researchers had tried to design an ideal filter by drilling holes into a thin slice of another silicon - based material with an ion beam .
While the effort did result in a filter with regular holes , the process was too laborious to be cost effective , and its membrane was so brittle that it required an elaborate support structure to prevent it from shattering .
While McGrath knew he might have the exact filter researchers have been searching for , he needed to test if the predictions held up .
“ When you build something at this scale , you ’re closing in on the quantum world and you never know what the properties are going to be , ” he says .
When Striemer tested his design , he found that the same 50 - atom thickness could hold back an astonishing 15 pounds per square inch of pressure .
To test the membrane , Gaborski placed a solution of two blood proteins , albumin and IgG , behind the membrane and forced it gently through the nanoscopic holes .
In just over six minutes , the albumin had passed through , but the larger IgG protein was stopped .
And as if filtering by nanoscale size were n’t enough , the Rochester team has found a way for the nano - filter to carry a fixed charge , effectively making the hole “ smaller ” for molecules of a certain charge than for others .
In a single filter it ’s now possible to quickly and easily separate molecules by their size and their charge — a serious boon for fuel cell researchers , who wish to move only certain ions from one part of a fuel cell to another .
Separating molecules by size and charge efficiently is also the goal of kidney dialysis researchers .
Johnson & Johnson recently gave the Rochester team a $ 100,000 grant to pursue developing the membrane ’s use in separating blood proteins with the hope of creating a more efficient method of dialysis .
“ Kidneys do a much better job than dialysis machines of filtering blood proteins and keeping the ones you need , like albumin , and getting rid of toxins , which in some cases are smaller proteins , ” says McGrath .
“ They use a type of cellulose or plastic membrane with relatively poor discrimination .
We think we can engineer these membranes to provide superior discrimination of proteins , which may make the process of dialysis faster and more effective than it is today . ”
The Rochester group sees many more applications for the membrane in the future .
One of the most intriguing ideas is that it may play a role in growing neurons from stem cells .
Steve Goldman , Glenn - Zutes Chair in Biology of the Aging Brain and professor of neurology at the University of Rochester , discussed the technology with McGrath and colleagues and was impressed .
“ It ’s a spectacularly interesting technology , that opens a realm of new possibilities in fields as diverse as organ reconstitution , proteomics and microfluidics , ” says Goldman .
“ Its potential applications to neuroscience , cell biology and medical research may be profound . ”
Recent evidence suggests that neurological stem cells may grow better when in the immediate vicinity of certain “ helper ” cells .
A problem arises after the new neurons are grown , when scientists need to separate the neurons from these helper cells .
McGrath suggests that the neurological stem cells can be adhered to one side of the membrane , and the helper cells on the other .
The silicon membrane is about the thickness of the cell ’s own membranes , meaning the two groups of cells can actually touch each other through the membrane ’s pores without passing through themselves .
The chemical communication between the helper and stem cells can continue as if the two sets of cells were in direct contact , but after the neurons are fully formed , they can easily be separated from the helper cells .
The Rochester team is working to realize the potential of the membrane by refining its fabrication .
Striemer found he could “ tune ” the size of the filter holes depending on the temperature to which the silicon is heated , but the process is not yet accurate enough for engineers to simply select any pore size and fabricate it .
The researchers have just founded a company , SiMPore , to commercialize the numerous applications of the nanomembrane .
Many of the University ’s laboratories will be involved in testing and developing the membrane , and the founders have already been approached by semiconductor giants such as Intel to see if the filter could remove nanoparticles from solutions used in microchip - manufacturing .
The team is currently testing the membranes to see how they stand up to regular wear and tear , and how resistant they are to clogging , which is a chief problem with conventional filters .

In 1999 , when I was in China , the then prime minister , Zhu Rongji , spoke at the Harvard Business School .
During the question - and - answer period , a smart aleck asked , “ Are you going to devalue the Chinese currency ? ”
Since 1984 , the Chinese currency , the renminbi , has been pegged to the U.S. dollar , and there had been a lot of speculation in the press that the Chinese would be making their currency convertible  the sine qua non for China to become a truly great economy .
Rumors persisted that before the government made the currency convertible , it would devalue it .
The premier assured the questioner that devaluation would not occur , and then invited the skeptics in the room to buy “ puts ” on the renminbi .
Buying puts  the right to sell or go short  is a sophisticated way to profit from the collapse of a stock or currency .
It was an extraordinary remark from the mouth of any politician , never mind a leader of the Chinese Communist Party .
Zhu put the Harvard wise guy in his place while proving to a sophisticated audience of businesspeople that the premier of China knew a thing or two about playing the currency market .
That kind of financial sophistication permeates the Chinese bureaucracy as well as the business community .
Some of the best capitalists in the world live and work in Communist China .
Not so long ago , the government denounced entrepreneurs as “ exploiters ” and banned them from the Chinese Communist Party .
But in 2001 , then president Jiang Zemin praised business leaders for pushing ahead with modernization ; now , a political party created to represent the interests of peasants and workers includes millionaire entrepreneurs .
And therein lies the problem :
How does a market economy champing at the bit function under a Leninist regime ?
The central government has been learning how to benefit from the markets by trial and error .
But Chinese bureaucrats are fast learners , supported by talented young economists , bankers , and financiers faced with the challenge of dealing with an unprecedented rate of growth in an increasingly globalized marketplace .
For decades , the best and the brightest in China have aspired to careers in the Party and the government rather than in the private sector .
These people now run China , so it should be no surprise that China has some of the most capable politicians in the world .
Frankly , we should all wish these people well , regardless of their political beliefs or ours .
Worldwide economic growth  indeed the stability of the world  depends on how well the leadership in Beijing manages its economy .
Despite the challenges , it seems to be doing fine .
For no matter how long China ’s leaders persist in calling themselves Communists , they seem quite intent on creating the world ’s dominant capitalist economy .
Plato wrote that the natural progression of government was from tyranny to oligarchy to democracy , and then came chaos , with dictatorship on its heels .
China is now at the stage of moving from tyranny toward democracy , and those in charge probably have their sleep disturbed by dreams of the chaos that might follow that transition .
By most accounts , however , even the Party ’s homegrown entrepreneurs  known as “ red capitalists ” by China scholars outside the country  are actually a conservative lot .
Eager to protect their own wealth and status , they will not be much in favor of any radical democratic reforms too soon .
They saw what happened in the USSR .
These Party entrepreneurs may end up being democracy ’s Trojan horse  pushing for the kinds of economic and legal reforms that will make doing business easier and more productive and thus busting up the Marxist - Leninist foundations of the Party itself .
Their success has already emboldened the tens of millions of small entrepreneurs and ambitious young people who want to get rich .
Unlike Russia , which had a feudal society before its Communist revolution in 1917 , China , which opted for a Communist economy in 1949 , has had a vibrant merchant class throughout much of its history ; many are still alive who remember what capitalism was like before Mao Zedong ’s revolution .
Many of those Chinese capitalists went abroad to Hong Kong , Taiwan , and elsewhere to pursue their business interests .
Before the Communist revolution , Shanghai had the largest stock market in Asia and between London and New York , and it will again .
Even after a half - century of a strictly controlled Communist economy , the Chinese seem more culturally predisposed to capitalism than their Russian counterparts .
They also have the habits of ready - made capitalists :
The Chinese save and invest upwards of 40 percent of their income ( Americans save barely 2 percent ) , and they have an incredible work ethic .
The Chinese work and work to get the job done .
I saw men and women working on highways late at night under floodlights .
They demonstrate the kind of productivity and ingenuity that are required to build good companies .
The conversion from Communism to the world ’s most dominant capitalistic economy will not be instantaneous or smooth .
In the meantime , China will have to settle for being the world champion in commodity consumption .
The Chinese currency , the renminbi , has been extremely undervalued  by 15 percent or more , some experts contend .
Even if its currency doubled in value against the U.S. dollar , China would still be competitive .
( The Japanese yen has risen 400 percent against the dollar over several decades , yet Japan still has a trade surplus with the U.S. )
The renminbi is one of the few currencies in the world whose value does not fluctuate , pegged 8.3 to the U.S. dollar , which has weakened in recent years against the euro and other currencies .
The dollar ’s decreasing value means that Chinese goods and services are a lot cheaper than they ought to be in European and Japanese markets .
The U.S. imports relatively little from China , but U.S. politicians are nevertheless worried that China ’s low prices will squeeze U.S. companies out of markets all around the world and have urged the Chinese government to “ unpeg ” its currency from the dollar .
Threats of protectionism have been tossed around in the U.S. and the European Union , whose members have suggested that the Chinese might consider the euro as an alternative reserve currency to the dollar .
Most European politicians and their Asian counterparts tend to have fewer complaints about China , since they sell huge amounts of their goods there , and many of those nations have trade surpluses with China .
Rarely does anyone complain about their best customers .
Historically , China ’s leaders have been afraid to let their currency float , presuming that its citizens would move money out of the country and the renminbi would collapse .
A higher rate of exchange would also slow foreign investment and exports , another threat to the economy .
The Chinese leadership still uses that argument as a means of refusing to revalue the renminbi .
It would have had merit 20 years ago , but China is a much more attractive investment opportunity now .
Let the currency go down , I say .
If people want to dump the renminbi , go for it .
I would be a buyer whether it declines or rises , and I doubt that I would be alone .
Nor do I think that the overseas Chinese will stop sending money home or abandon investing in one of the world ’s largest and fastest - growing economies .
I suspect that once the Chinese currency floats , even more funds will pour in .
Capital is always more likely to go where it will not be trapped by currency controls .
But the best argument against a fixed currency is that it has never worked and it never will .
No fixed currency in history has ever been able to maintain its peg .
Another argument that should appeal to the Chinese leadership , which is extremely nationalistic and sensitive to the charge of sucking up to Washington , the capital of “ capitalist roaders ” :
The renminbi is in a possible position to take over as the dominant currency in the world , beating out the euro , the yen , and the dollar .
Businesses around the world have long sought to sell to the American consumer .
By 2004 , China had passed nearly everyone as one of the world ’s largest importers of goods .
Now , every businessperson in the world salivates as he or she calculates the current price of a product multiplied times 1.3 billion Chinese .
And though China is buying more stuff from the rest of the world than ever and has finally racked up a trade deficit , its vaults are filled with stacks of foreign currencies  more than $ 400 billion worth , second only to Japan .
China is a creditor nation .
The U.S. became a debtor nation again in 1987 and has been the world ’s largest debtor nation since .
The international debts of the U.S. are more than $ 8 trillion and growing , at the rate of $ 1 trillion every 21 months .
For years , we have been financing our standard of living with other people ’s money , and one of our biggest bankers is China .
That dependency makes the renminbi a perfect candidate for a world currency  once its leaders allow it to be freely convertible and tradable on the world market .
The sine qua non of free trade is that people can come and go with their money .
When that will happen in China I do not know for certain .
Surely , however , the Chinese have been feeling the pinch of buying commodities at high prices and selling goods at cheaper ones .
One thing ’s for sure : China ’s leaders will not unpeg the renminbi to the dollar just because foreign politicians say they must .
Ironically , when the Chinese pegged their currency to the dollar in 1994 the U.S. applauded it as a smart move .
Now that we are begging them to unpeg it , they are bound to express their independence by letting the renminbi float in their own good time .
China has been accepted into the World Trade Organization , which requires that its members have convertible funds .
I suspect that the renminbi will be floating quite freely by the time the Olympic torch is lit in Beijing in 2008 .

The following is a chronological account of the actions taken by the U.S. Military under the leadership of George W. Bush as Commander - in - Chief that lead to multiple violations of the Geneva convention and U.S. Military Code .
Charge George W. Bush has conspired to commit the torture of prisoners in violation of the “ Federal Torture Act ” Title 18 United States Code , Section 113C , the U.N. Torture convention and the Geneva Convention , which under Article VI of the Constitution are part of the “ supreme Law of the Land ; ” George W. Bush has conspired to deny due process to prisoners of war , indiscriminantly bomb cities , transfer prisoners of war from an occupied territory , and planned , prepared , initiated and waged of a war of aggression in violation of U.S. Military Code section 2441 , Geneva convention ( I Art 3 , II Art 18 , Art 19 , III Art 13 , Art 17 , Art 33 , Art 34 , Art 49 , IV Art 3 ) , and the 1945 Nuremberg Principles articles 6 ( a ) and ( b ) ; General Geneva Violations : The U.S. Military Code specifies that it is a crime to violate the Geneva convention :
“ Whoever , … commits a war crime , … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years , … and if death results to the victim , shall also be subject to the penalty of death .
…
Definition :
As used in this section the term ‘ war crime ’ means … a grave breach in any of the international conventions signed at Geneva 12 August 1949 [ or acts ] prohibited by Article 23 , 25 , 27 , or 28 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV , Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land , signed 18 October 1907 … ” ( Section 2441 : U.S. Military Code on War Crimes ) 1945 Nuremberg Principles :
After WWII , the U.S. led the formation of the “ ˜Nuremberg Principles , ’ which form the United Nations Charter .
Every country in the world is bound by that Charter .
Defines as a crime : “ Planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties , agreements or assurances ; ” ( Nuremberg Principles , 1950 )

White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales writes a memo urging President George Bush to declare the war in Afghanistan exempt from the Geneva convention .
In the memo , the White House lawyer references a 1996 law passed by Congress , known as the War Crimes Act , that law banned any Americans from committing war crimes – defined in part as “ grave breaches ” of the Geneva convention .
The memo warns that the law applies to “ U.S. officials ” and that punishments for violators “ include the death penalty . ” [ PDF of Gonzales memo ] ( Newsweek , May 17 , 2004 ) Subsequent to January 25 , 2002
Secretary Powell writes a memo arguing that Alberto Gonzales ’ attempt to declare the war in Afghanistan exempt from the Geneva convention undermines more than a century of U.S. policy and practice .
“ It will reverse over a century of U.S. policy and practice in supporting the Geneva conventions and undermine the protections of the law of war for our troops , both in this specific conflict and in general . …
It may provoke some individual foreign prosecutors to investigate and prosecute our officials and troops . …
We will be challenged in international fora ( UN Commission on Human Rights ; World Court ; etc. ) . ” ( Powell memo ) March 19 , 2003
Bush declares pre-emptive war in Iraq which constitutes a “ grave breach ” of the Geneva convention as Iraq posed no “ imminent threat ” to the U.S .
“ Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self - defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury , to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life , to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority , or to prevent his or her escape , and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives .
In any event , intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life . ”
( United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva , Fall 1990 ) TORTURE Geneva Convention :
“ Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated .
Any unlawful act or omission … causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited , and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention .
Likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity . ”
“ No physical or mental torture , nor any other form of coercion , may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever .
Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened , insulted , or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind . ”
“ Prisoners of war shall enjoy complete latitude in the exercise of their religious duties , including attendance at the service of their faith , on condition that they comply with the disciplinary routine prescribed by the military authorities . ”
“ The following acts are and shall remain prohibited … cruel treatment and torture ; … Outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment ; “ “ Individual or mass forcible transfers , as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory … are prohibited , regardless of their motive . ”

Department of Defense writes a memo which authorizes interrogation tactics for use at Guantanamo including using dogs to induce stress , stripping and shaving prisoners , and stress positions .
Also included is a memo with an analysis of how the interrogators at Guantanamo ( GTMO ) became more willing to conduct extreme interrogation techniques .
“ The Office of the Secretary of Defense ( OSD ) has not adopted specific guidelines regarding interrogation techniques for detainee operations at GTMO . ”
“ Compounding this problem is the fact that there is no established clear policy for interrogation limits and operations at GTMO , and many interrogators have felt in the past that they could not do anything that could be considered ‘ controversial . ' ”

Blurring boundaries
High up on the bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean in southern California , strange animals scurry about in their cages .
They eat , drink , copulate and occasionally try to run away from human hands that enter their confined quarters .
If you did n't know better , you would think they were ordinary mice .
But these particular animals contain a hidden component not present in their naturally conceived cousins .
Inside their brains are living human neurons that help them to see , hear and think .
Fred Gage , a biologist at the Salk Institute , has created these part - human animals to understand how human neurons degrade or die in people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson 's and Alzheimer's .
Studying and perturbing brain cells in their natural environment — which is to say , inside a functioning brain — provide the best hope for developing therapies to prevent or overcome disease symptoms .
But experimentation on human brains is obviously unacceptable , and so scientists are hoping that animals with a small percentage of human brain cells will provide a substitute for human subjects .
Many people , however , are deeply disturbed by this research .
U.S. President George W. Bush believes that scientists like Gage have stepped across a moral line that must be defended , even at the cost of biomedical progress .
In his 2006 State of the Union address , he implored Congress to " pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research [ including ] creating human - animal hybrids , " because " human life is a gift from our Creator " that should never be " devalued . "
Animal chimeras : from absurdity to reality
To understand the fear and anger evoked by chimeras , it is useful to go back in scientific history to March 1984 , when an animal unlike any other ever born , or seen , adorned the cover of Nature , the international journal of science .
The journal 's audience of scientists was treated to an unforgettable photograph of an animal with a head that was mostly goat , an upper torso that was wooly sheep , with other body parts that alternated between the two species types .
" It behaved like a goat , " according to its creator , Danish embryologist Steen Willadsen , " but did not quite smell like one , preferring the company of sheep . "
This first geep ( as the animal became christened ) was physically healthy , long - lived , and even fertile .
Additional geeps were created by Willadsen over the next several years .
The geep is an alluring example of a laboratory - created chimera , named by scientists in honor of the creature from Greek mythology with the head of a lion , the torso of a goat , and a tail sprouting the head of a venomous snake .
Like other mythological species composites , the chimera was imagined as a monster because it violated a perceived " natural order " in which each species is divinely created as a separate and unique category .
Indeed , a chimera 's potential violation of nature was so profound that rational thinkers have always assumed it could n't possibly exist , and the word chimera has become a metaphor for a wishful idea without any basis in reality .
Willadsen , unlike most scientists , was unwilling to accept the natural limitations imposed by traditional beliefs .
" The role of the [ biological ] scientist , " he said , " is to break the laws of nature , rather than to establish , let alone accept them . "
With this spark of irreverence , Willadsen created not only geeps but other species composites including a cow - sheep creature that he cooked and ate after completing his analysis .
( The same refusal to accept conventional wisdom provided him with the confidence to bypass fertilization in the invention of the cloning technology used to create Dolly and thousands of other subsequently cloned animals . )
Building upon Willadsen 's pioneering work , other scientists combined even more distant species , creating chicken - turtle and chicken - mouse fetuses , for example ( which were dissected before hatching ) .
In all of these instances , chimeras were used as models to study basic biological processes .
Animal rights activists who reject all types of animal experimentation will obviously object to chimera creation as well .
But , in fact , chimeric animals are no more likely to suffer than any other animal bred by people for food or research .
Each of Willadsen 's chimeras was created in a petri dish by mixing together cells from two embryos .
The cells stuck together , but did n't fuse , which is why the composite embryos produced animals with species - distinct component parts .
( A chimera is different than a hybrid , which is formed by cross-species fertilization .
A hybrid animal like the mule has cells that are all genetically equivalent and halfway between a donkey and a horse .
George W. Bush was obviously not aware of this distinction when he gave his State of the Union address . )
Because of the fundamental similarity in the body plans of all vertebrate species , live - born chimeras are typically healthy -- albeit bizarre - looking -- animals .
And so dual - animal - species chimera production should pose no ethical problems beyond those encountered in traditional animal research .
Stem cells and animal - human chimeras
Until the year 2000 , chimera production and analysis was just an esoteric tool for basic research on animal development , with little direct clinical relevance .
But explosive advances in stem cell biology have provided scientists with the ability to create animal chimeras containing human component parts , and these partial - human chimeras could potentially revolutionize biomedical analysis and therapy .
The significance of stem cells lies in the fact that they are , in essence , embryonic or otherwise immature precursors to the cells that function within our mature tissues and organs .
The mother of all stem cells is the embryonic stem ( ES ) cell , which exists naturally in 10 - day old embryos .
ES cells have the capacity to form everything in the human body .
During normal development , ES cells divide repeatedly , giving rise to an array of stem cell types that each have a more restricted capacity to form only one or a few tissues or organs .
Human stem cells at many different stages , from embryonic to adult , can now be cultivated in laboratory petri dishes .
And chimeras can now be produced by inserting these stem cells into animal fetuses or embryos .
Biomedical scientists are hopeful that a more sophisticated understanding and ability to control both animal development and human stem cells will someday allow the production of animals with human organs formed in place of animal organs .
Remarkably , progress along these lines has already been made .
Alan Flake at Children 's Hospital in Philadelphia and Esmail Zanjani at the University of Nevada , incorporated human stem cells into early sheep fetuses while they were growing in their mothers ' wombs .
After birth , a wide variety of lamb tissues including blood , cartilage , muscle and heart displayed human contributions of up to 40 % , although external body features were always entirely animal - like .
In another type of chimera experiment , Yair Reisner at the Weizmann Institute in Israel implanted nondescript human kidney stem cells into mice , and coaxed the cells to multiply and develop into miniature , but fully functional , human kidneys that actually secrete urine .
Results obtained from these lines of research and others suggest that the personalized therapeutic potential of stem cells might be most fully exploited in conjunction with the developmental potential provided through chimeras to create fully functional , replacement kidneys , livers , and hearts .
Where is the line ?
Although pigs with human hearts will , upon first description , cause people to shudder , education and self - interest is likely to drive the acceptance of chimeras developed strictly for organ transplantation .
As long as they look like animals and behave like animals , most people will view them as animals because internal organs by themselves do not tug upon our emotions .
( But ask yourself whether an animal such as the following is acceptable to provide an arm to someone who lost their own in accident . )
The debate line shifts , however , when scientists begin to chimerize the essential features of mentality that distinguish us as human beings .
Educated people understand that human mentality emerges from human brains , which is why chimeric mice with human brain cells are liable to perturb many more people .
Last December , Gage injected human embryonic stem cells into the brain regions of developing mouse fetuses still inside their mother 's uterus .
The human cells became " active human neurons that successfully integrate into the adult mouse forebrain , " where higher brain function is localized , Gage explained .
Although Gage 's mice have brains that are less than 1 percent human , Stanford professor Irving Weissman believes that mice with brains made entirely of human cells would make a better " model " for human neurological diseases , and he 's proposed creating them .
Would a mouse with a 100 percent human brain cross a moral red line ?
No biologist thinks a mouse - size brain filled with human cells could produce anything remotely resembling human consciousness .
But the presence of a biologically human brain inside an organism able to propel and feed itself is typically accepted as clear biological evidence that the organism is a human being .
This logic would force an ethical person to grant the chimeric mouse I 've just described a right to life , which is patently absurd .
Yet if we follow our intuition and decide that this mouse is not a human being , we are forced to conclude that the presence of a fully - human brain inside an alert , responsive organism is not a sufficient criterion for inclusion within the family of human beings , which not only violates common sense but challenges the very foundation of universal human rights .
The moral conundrums provoked by animal - human chimeras multiply tremendously when the companion species is not a mouse but a non -human primate with a far larger brain capacity .
So far , scientists have only integrated small numbers of human neurons into monkey brains .
Although members of the scientific community have no intention of creating chimeras with even minimal human - specific mental attributes , the fact is that modern biotechnology has moved such ambiguous beings from the realm of mythology to the realm of possibility .
And this fact elicits the greatest challenge to western thought , which is that the existence of a strict line separating human beings from non -human beings may simply by a figment of our imagination .

Special Report
New Spy Investigation Suppressed at Crucial Juncture
By Richard H. Curtiss
The United States is investigating another case of Israeli espionage that apparently neither the Democrats nor the Republicans want to touch until after the Nov. 2 election .
This latest case involves two long - time staff members of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
U.S. investigators were surveilling a lunch meeting between an AIPAC employee and an Israeli Embassy official when an unknown person joined them .
The investigators had no idea who he was .
The man turned out to be Lawrence A. Franklin , a mid-level civil service employee who worked for many years at the Defense Intelligence Agency .
The FBI obtained warrants from a special federal court for surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , and for months kept tabs on Franklin .
About three years ago Franklin transferred to the staff of Douglas Feith , under secretary of defense for policy , who has spent most of his career looking out for the interests of Israel .
Interestingly , Feith ’s father , Dalck , was an Israeli extremist and a long - time protégé of Zev Jabotinsky .
Dalck Feith , who now lives in the United States , is just as extreme today as he was all those years ago in Israel .
His son Douglas , as the person in charge of the Pentagon ’s Office of Special Plans ( OSP ) , for some time has worked on compiling any material , no matter how vague or extreme , to make the case for military action in Iraq .
Having successfully made that case , Feith and his colleagues proceeded to the next step : making the case for war on Iran .
He and his staff — which now totals roughly 1,500 people — are unstinting in their efforts to start another war as soon as possible against either Iran or Syria — or both .
The point is to keep the spotlight and pressure off Israel .
Even though it ’s clear to everyone — even to Vice President Richard Cheney — that there should be no new war immediately , that does n’t keep Feith from putting a sinister spin on everything .
After working for the Defense Intelligence Agency for most of his career , Franklin transferred to Feith ’s Office of Special Plans in the summer of 2001 to deal with Iranian issues .
He currently is one of two Iran desk officers who work in the OSP ’s Northern Gulf directorate .
Franklin works under William J. Luti , deputy undersecretary for defense for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs , whose office is part of the operation under Feith .
Franklin is also a colonel in the Air Force Reserve , and spent at least one of his annual tours on active duty working in the Defense Attaché ’s office in the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv in the 1990s .
According to a U.S. government official familiar with the investigation , Franklin , a Christian , is outwardly very supportive of Israel .
In February 2000 , he wrote an op - ed piece for the Wall Street Journal ’s European edition that was sharply critical of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami , arguing that the leader was launching a “ charm offensive ” that was simply a “ ruse ” to make the Iranian government look better to Westerners while it continued to abuse human rights .
Lawrence Franklin “ was very close to the anti-Iranian dissidents . ”
Franklin also participated in secret meetings with Manucher Ghorbanifar , the Iranian arms dealer who acted as a middleman in the Iran - Contra affair during the Reagan administration .
The secret meetings , first held in Rome in December 2001 , were brokered by Michael Ledeen , a leading neocon and long - time supporter of Israel .
Ledeen said he arranged the meetings to put the Bush administration in closer contact with Iranian dissidents who could provide information on the war on terrorism .
But he said that Franklin was always skeptical about the usefulness of the back - channel meetings .
At one point in early 2003 , during the run-up to the Iraq war , Franklin was brought in to help arrange meetings between Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and American Shi’i and Sunni clerics , a defense official said .
A one - time Cold War specialist , after the Soviet Union collapsed Franklin studied Farsi , the language spoken in Iran .
“ He was very close to the anti-Iranian dissidents , ” a former defense colleague said .
“ He was a good analyst of the Iranian political scene , but he was also someone who would go off on his own . ”
Franklin is now talking to FBI investigators as they try to determine the extent of , if any , involvement by a senior member of the Israel lobby .
The FBI ’s investigation of AIPAC has been assigned to federal prosecutors in Alexandria , Virginia .
Headed by Paul McNulty , the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia , the office has long experience in prosecuting espionage issues .
A high - ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , however , demanded that a new prosecutor be assigned to investigate the alleged leaks , questioning McNulty ’s “ political leanings . ”
In a letter to Attorney General John D. Ashcroft , Rep. John Conyers Jr. ( D - MI ) wrote , “ The role of U.S. Attorney Paul J. McNulty in the case has obvious political implications ” in an election year .
Conyers cited anonymous allegations contained in a news report that McNulty “ had put the brakes on ” the probe .
“ While I have no reason to question Mr. McNulty ’s integrity , ” Conyers wrote , he ” suggested that either a special counsel or U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald of Chicago , who is overseeing a separate probe into the disclosure of CIA operative Valerie Plame , should take over the Pentagon probe . ”
Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo declined to comment on the specifics of Conyer ’s allegations .
“ We will review the congressman ’s letter and give it the attention it is due . ”
Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz , as well as Feith , have been briefed on Franklin ’s case .
According to the AP , neither Wolfowitz nor Feith is regarded as having any involvement in the matter , other than as potential witnesses because of their familiarity with Franklin ’s work .
The Israeli press provided the names of two possible suspects .
They are Steven Rosen , AIPAC ’s director of foreign policy issues , and Keith Weissman , an AIPAC expert on Iran .
It is quite possible that the FBI was looking even higher in the organization .
It appears , however , that someone blew the whistle on what might have been a major scandal .
Why the investigation seems to have come to a standstill is not clear .
In his first comments on the case , Israeli Ambassador to the United States Daniel Ayalon protested on Aug. 31 that the intelligence investigation was a “ non-issue , ” adding , “ I can tell you here , very authoritatively , very categorically , Israel does not spy on the United States . ”
According to The New York Times ’ Steven Erlanger , “ After the hugely embarrassing spying scandal of 1985 , when Jonathan Pollard , an American intelligence analyst , was arrested and convicted of spying for Israel , the Israeli government made a firm decision to stop all clandestine spying in the United States , Yuval Steinitz , the chairman of the foreign and defense committee in Parliament , said on Aug. 28 .
“ ” ˜This was a firm decision , ’ Steinitz said .
” ˜ And I ’m 100 percent confident — not 99 percent but 100 percent — that Israel is not spying in the United States .
We have no agents there and we are not gathering intelligence there , unlike probably every other country in the world , including some of America ’s best friends in Europe . ’ ”
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ’s office emphasized the same point on Aug. 28 , issuing a statement saying : “ Israel has no connection to this matter .
The U.S. is Israel ’s greatest ally .
Israel is not engaged in intelligence activities in the U.S. and denies reports to the contrary . ”
While Israel does have representatives of the Mossad , its intelligence agency , and military intelligence in Washington , they are attached to the embassy and their presence is known to American authorities , officials said .
At an Aug. 29 event held in New York on the eve of the Republican National Convention , and sponsored by AIPAC , the Republican Jewish Coalition and the United Jewish Communities , AIPAC President Bernice Manocherian described the allegations against her group as “ outrageous as well as baseless . ”
In her speech to Jewish Republicans , Manocherian vowed , “ We will not allow innuendo or false allegations against AIPAC to distract us from our central mission . ”
Timing Is Everything
Just about the time news organizations began reporting on the existence of the FBI counterintelligence investigation , the FBI was interviewing Rosen and Weissman .
The interviews were halted when both men asked to be represented by a lawyer before answering more questions .
Washington defense attorney Abbe Lowell said he had been hired to represent Rosen and Weissman , and would not discuss the case .
AIPAC has said it is “ cooperating fully ” with investigators , but strongly denied any wrongdoing .
Investigators believe that the AIPAC officials turned over Franklin ’s information to the Israelis , although the exact nature of their contacts with Israel remains unclear , and it is uncertain if Franklin knew of their discussions with Israel .
“ It is not illegal for employees of AIPAC to meet with Pentagon officials or representatives of the Israeli government , which has wide - ranging information - sharing with the United States , ” wrote New York Timescorrespondent David Johnson .
“ But knowingly passing classified materials to a foreign power could be a crime under American espionage statutes . ”
Franklin ’s legal status is unclear .
Authorities believe he gave a draft policy directive on Iran to AIPAC officials , who then provided the information to Israeli intelligence .
When FBI agents visitied AIPAC headquarters on Capitol Hill , they searched Rosen ’s office and copied his computer hard drive .
Agents also met with AIPAC executive director Howard Kohr , who was asked about AIPAC ’s structure , acoording to people who have been officially briefed on the matter .
“ The whole thing makes no sense to me , ” said Dennis Ross , special envoy in the Arab - Israeli peace process in the first Bush and the Clinton administrations .
“ The Israelis have access to all sorts of people .
They have access to Congress and the administration , ” said Ross , now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy — an AIPAC spinoff .
Israel sees Iran as the single biggest threat to its existence , and as a result closely monitors Washington ’s Iranian policy — especially as the Bush administration presses Tehran to disclose more about the state of its nuclear program .
One former State Department officer recalled being told that U.S. government experts considered the countries whose spying most threatened the U.S. to be Russia , South Korea and Israel .
“ I also know from my time in Jerusalem that official U.S. visitors to Israel were warned about the counterintelligence threat from Israel , ” she added .
Neither Rosen nor Weissman has been advised that he is a target of the investigation , and government officials said the men ’s legal status remained uncertain .
National Security adviser Condoleeza Rice and her deputy , Stephen J. Hadley , were told about the investigation early in the Bush administration .
Federal agents had been preparing to lead authorities to contacts inside the Israeli government when the case became public , government officials said on Aug. 29 .
The disclosure of the inquiry by CBS News revealed what had been for nearly a year a covert national security investigation conducted by the FBI , according to officials who said that news reports about the inquiry compromised important investigative steps — such as the effort to follow the trail back to the Israelis .
David Johnston and Eric Schmitt of The New York Times wrote that Franklin would have had top - secret security clearance , giving him access to much of the nation ’s most sensitive intelligence about Iran , including that relating to its nuclear program , Pentagon officials said .
According to The New York Times , Franklin is thought to be negotiating a deal with the government that could result in leniency in the form of reduced charges in exchange for his information about other people in the case .
It is not clear when or even whether he will be charged .
Eric Schmitt of The New York Times wrote , “ ” ˜We do n’t have a presidential directive on Iran , ’ said a government official familiar with the internal debate .
” ˜ We have an ad hoc policy that we ’re making up as we go along .
And it is to squeeze Iran , using international pressure , to get them to rid themselves of their nuclear program . ’ ”
For more than a year , a major debate over Iran policy has divided the administration .
Hard - liners in the Pentagon , including some in the policy office , and , to some extent , in Cheney ’s office , have advocated a policy of threatening confrontation with Tehran , and supporting opposition groups and student demonstrations , government officials said .
Last May , one proposal advocated by some lower - level Pentagon officials advocated covert support for Iranian resistance groups to destabilize Iran ’s powerful clergy .
Some officials even raised the prospect of air strikes against an Iranian nuclear site if Iran ’s nuclear program proceeded .
Others expected to be interviewed will probably include Iraq and Iran specialist Harold Rhode , former Defense Policy Board chairman Richard Perle , and Iran specialist David Wurmser , Cheney ’s principal deputy assistant for national security affairs , according to sources familiar with or involved in the case .
Wurmser , Feith and Perle were among the authors of a 1996 policy paper for then - Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu entitled : “ A Clean Break : A new Strategy for Securing the Realm . ”
The realm in question was not the United States , of course , but Israel .

How to Choose Led Grow Lights
We 've done our best to showcase the best LED grow lights in different categories to save your precious time and to focus on growing your plants or buds , however if you want to make your own research and to choose LED grow light on your own we strongly suggest to consider following factors while choosing led grow light .
The Quality of Materials
You may not know it , but the quality of your LED grow lights will determine the yield your plants produce .
A light made using high - quality materials can last up to 10 years .
A good LED grow light has high - quality semiconductor chips , metal housing ( typically aluminum ) , and good wiring .
Faulty wiring can generate excess heat which may damage your plants – or become a fire hazard .
Aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat and helps move additional heat discharged by LEDs .
If a unit has plastic casing , do n’t buy it .
A top - notch LED grow light has a constantcurrent driver and not a constant voltage driver .
As LEDs become warm , their voltage drops .
A constant current driver ensures the current remains steady as the voltage changes due to increasing temperature .
This prolongs the life of the diodes .
Reputation of the Brand
When it comes to LED grow lights , the brand makes all the difference .
Do n't make the mistake of buying a " no name " light on an e-commerce site as it will get spoilt very fast .
While there are numerous LED brands on the market , not all offer high - quality products .
Good LED grow light brands ( manufacturers ) have made many growers happy and boast excellent reviews by customers .
They are reputable and can always be trusted to provide quality products .
Many well - built LED grow lights are designed in the United States and manufactured in China .
They are made according to the specifications of the American company .
Some high - quality grow lights are designed and manufactured in china by well - known brands ( like Mars Hydro ) and are just as good as AmericanLED grow lights .
Consider the Plants You Are Growing Some plants need full sunlight ( like flowering plants ) , others thrive in low - light conditions ( like succulents ) , while others need bright and dull light at different stages of growth ( like vegetables and Marijuana ) .
Dimmable LED lights allow you to increase and decrease the light output without altering the height of the light .
The light you buy must be ideal for the plants you plan to grow .
While all LED grow lights will illuminate plants to some extent , some models are designed to address specific plant needs and have different wavelengths for different growth stages .
Most LED grow lights have a full spectrum and can be used for an entire grow cycle – from seedling to harvest .
Watts Needed for the Square Feet
The growing area you want to cover should dictate the grow light you buy .
A large 600 - watt light can cover approximately 12 square feet while a small 100 - watt light can cover less than 4 square feet .
If you plan to expand your growing area in the near future , consider getting a large dimmable light because you can dial down the light intensity .
ALED grow light should illuminate the specific space you want it to illuminate .
Generally , one square foot of growing space needs about 32 watts of power .
And this does not mean LED wattage but the actual watts the light draws .
The Chips Many research studies done on indoor plants suggest that 3 watts is the ideal wattage for a LED chip .
3 - watt chips perfectly balance cost , size , and heat generation .
While 1 - watt chips produce the lowest amount of heat and are the most durable , they do not contain the power needed to pierce into the plant canopy .
5 - watt , 10 - watt , and other higher - wattage chips are very intense , but they are the least efficient and do n't have a long lifespan like 1 - watt chips .
LED grow lights with low - wattage chips need more chips to produce intense light while those with high - wattage chips need fewer chips .
The Spectrum Plants usually convert light energy into energy they can use through photosynthesis .
And for photosynthesis to be efficient , plants must be exposed to different wavelengths of light .
The best LED grow lights provide plants with the spectrum needed during every growth phase .
Blue light ( 440 n m - 470 nm ) mimics the summer sun and stimulates vegetative leaf growth while red light ( 640 n m - 660 nm ) replicates the autumn sun and encourages flowering .
Ultraviolet light ( 315 nm - 400 nm ) activates a plant 's defense mechanisms and influences plant development and metabolism .
Infrared light helps boost plant growth .
A good LED grow light has all these colors as well as white , red , and green lights .
The LED Output Wattage
The advertised LED output wattage usually varies from the actual LED output wattage by up to 75 % .
A manufacturer may say that they use 3 - watt chips in their grow lights .
But the diodes never operate at full capacity and usually run between 500 mA and 700 mA .
Most LEDs run at 550 mA to enhance the lifetime of the diodes .
This means that a 3 - watt chip may only pull 1.7 watts , based on the wavelength .
When comparing a LED grow light to a metal halide ( MH ) or a high pressure sodium ( HPS ) light , use the true LED output wattage .
To obtain the same amount of PAR from a LED grow light as you would from a HPS or MH light , use between 50 - 75 % less wattage .
For instance , if a panel uses 300 3 - watt chips , it does n't emit 900 watts of power .
Rather , it emits about 500 to 600 watts of power .
Always use the real wattage to determine the power output .
The Warranty Good companies make good LED grow lights , you always get what you pay for .
Since LED lights can be a costly investment , look for those made by companies that give lengthy warranties ( 3 years and above ) .
The likelihood is they use materials of the highest quality to make their grow lights .
Some manufacturers even offer a 5 - year warranty .
The return policy is also worth considering .
Some manufacturers have a no return policy while others give a 30 - day or a 90 - day money - back guarantee .
The internet makes copying cheap .
Businesses that see their livelihood as dependent on the restriction of copying – concentrated in the recording , film , publishing and software industries – are understandably upset .
Their goal is to have the same ability to control their content as they had in an analog world but to keep all the benefits of pervasiveness , cost saving , and viral marketing that a global digital network brings .
To that end , they have moved aggressively to change laws worldwide , to introduce stiffer penalties , expand rights , mandate technological locks , forbid reverse engineering , and increase enforcement .
It is not so much a case of wanting to have their cake and eat it , as to have their cake and make your cake illegal .
Yet there are hints in each of these industries of a different business model , one that aims to encourage , rather than to forbid copying .
At the moment , the hints are only that – a scattering of anecdotes suggesting alternative ways of supporting creativity .
It is not clear if they will thrive or even survive , still less whether they can “ scale ” to a broader audience .
Still , if the alternative plan is to make the internet illegal or sue grandmothers for downloading , it might be worth taking a look at them .
In my next few columns , that is what I will do – study “ copy - friendly ” businesses , beginning today with publishing .
Yochai Benkler is a prominent academic .
His widely praised book about the network economy , The Wealth of Networks , was published by Yale Press – a publisher not known for its radicalism .
Yet with his publisher ’s approval Benkler ’s book is available for free online under a Creative Commons license .
Instead of paying $ 40 one can simply download the book .
Its sales are reportedly in the top rank of academic books .
Benkler is delighted with the additional 20,000 readers who have downloaded it .
Benkler is following in the footsteps of Larry Lessig , the founder of Creative Commons and author of Free Culture .
Lessig ’s work has been central to the practice of making books available for free online under licenses that make it legal for readers to copy , print and share them with others .
He stopped counting downloads of his own work once the count hit 500,000 .
Yet his mass - market books continue to sell well .
Can this method work for authors – and publishers – who need to make their living out of books ?
There are hints it might .
Even before the academics , Cory Doctorow , a brilliant young science fiction author , had adopted the same system for his work .
700,000 copies of his first novel , Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom have been downloaded for free .
It is also in its sixth print edition .
In a recent article in Forbes , Doctorow listed benefits from the exposure he gains , ranging from speaking engagements , to magazine commissions , and professional advancement .
Presumably his publishers believe it attracts paying readers .
More generally , science fiction writers – with their delight in counter - intuitive futurism – are conspicuous early adopters of copy - friendly methods .
One publishing house – Baen – has a free library on its site in which authors put up their older books for free download ; in some cases directly competing with the publisher ’s own paperbacks .
The editor of the library reports a strong positive effect on sales .
Outside of sci-fi O’Reilly , the software publishing house , does something similar with its Open Books Project .
I have experimented too .
My co-authors and I made our comic book about filmmaking and intellectual property freely available digitally .
In 9 months it has been downloaded by over 100,000 people from all over the world .
The license allows anyone to copy it or put it on P2P networks – provided the use is non-commercial – and this happened immediately .
We have no way of tracking those downloads , but they add to the total .
We have sold about 6000 paper copies , had two offers of translation and one film channel approach us about animation – and the book will not even reach brick and mortar bookstores until next month .
I am trying the same thing , chapter by chapter , with my new novel – a literary mystery about the search for the true author of Shakespeare ’s works .
Are readers of historical detective stories as net - savvy as science fiction aficionados ?
It will be interesting to find out .
Of course , these experiments are marginal .
They are being tried by those in non-traditional genres , or those who can afford to gamble .
At the moment , the numbers are small .
But most innovation happens on the margins .
It would be just as wrong for us to conclude that these experiments represent the future as to assume they do not .
Why might free digital availability make sense for parts of the publishing industry ?
First , most people hate reading a book on a screen , but like finding out if it is worth buying .
I am sure I have lost some sales , but my guess is that I have gained more new readers who otherwise would be unaware of my work , and who treat the digital version as a “ sampler , ” to which they then introduce others .
This is a leap of faith but not an unreasonable one .
Second , even professional authors make money in multiple ways other than by royalties - ranging from options on film production to commissions for magazine articles to consulting , teaching and speaker fees .
Most are aided by wider exposure .
As Doctorow says , “ my biggest fear as an author is n’t illicit copying , it is obscurity . ”
Third , digital distribution is almost free .
The “ cost ” is the gamble over lost sales , not remaindered books with their covers torn off .
Some publishers are willing to take the risk to build current and future demand .
Who is least likely to try free digital distribution ?
The blockbuster author .
Do not expect to see Harry Potter released this way .
JK
Rowling does not have to struggle against obscurity , and , given market saturation , it is unlikely that her publisher would see the method working for her .
But the next Rowling ?
That is another story .
And perhaps a free one .
James Boyle is professor of law at Duke University .
His newest book is a literary mystery called The Shakespeare Chronicles .
Take a trip to ease your final journey
Times Higher Education Supplement 10 February 2006 p 23
This is the original version .
It may have been slightly edited for publication
Albert Hofmann ,
The father of LSD , is 100 years old .
He has super - bright eyes , a firm handshake and a voice strong enough to address the 1500 people from all over the world who attended “ LSD : problem child and wonder drug ” , a grand conference to celebrate his birthday in Basel , Switzerland .
Admittedly he walks with a crutch but then , as he puts it , “ I must remember I ’m no longer 90 ” .
He attributes his extraordinary health to a daily raw egg , but fans of LSD suspect it has something to do with his wonder drug .
Lucius Werthmüller , who organised the conference as a birthday present , claims that the poets and artists who have flocked to Hofmann all his life keep him young , while Hofmann himself says that LSD reconnected him with the profound mystical experiences he had as a young child roaming in the Swiss mountains .
Certainly LSD is no ordinary substance .
Its reputation in some circles is positively demonic .
In the UK it is a Class A drug , and in the United States there are prisoners locked up for 20 and 30 years for taking it .
Yet the city of Basel gave its discoverer a birthday reception , the Swiss President wrote him a letter ; and in his home village children sang special birthday songs , and a bench was erected with his name on .
Best of all , the famous route along which he road his bicycle on the first ever acid trip in 1943 has been renamed in his honour .
So this is a drug of extreme contrasts , from the classic bad trip to ecstatic spiritual experiences ; and that ’s what makes it socially and scientifically so challenging .
As many contributors to this conference stressed , there is no single state that LSD induces ; rather , the effect depends on the preparation , setting and expectations of the person taking it .
“ The same drug that can control the mind can also free the mind ” says Martin Lee , cultural historian and author of “ Acid Dreams ” .
He tells horrific stories of the CIA ’s attempts to use the drug as a weapon and even for torture .
Remember that this is a drug that opens one ’s mind , transforms perception , and dissolves the sense of self into oneness with the world around , and they gave it to people without telling them what it was or how long the effect would last .
They threatened to keep people in that state forever , and experimented with electric shocks and even lobotomies while people were under its influence .
Once the CIA decided that it was too unpredictable to be of use they abandoned the experiments , and the drug was made illegal in 1971 .
During this time a certain amount of scientific research into psychedelics had been going on .
In 1954 Aldous Huxley ’s experiences with mescaline were published in “ The doors of perception ” , and in 1958 Hofmann isolated and named the active ingredients of magic mushrooms ; psilocybin and psilocin .
It became clear that all these psychedelic , or mind - revealing , drugs could have profoundly positive effects on people .
Huxley claimed that they could make death “ a more conscious experience ” and on his deathbed , in 1963 , asked for an injection of LSD .
He died at peace .
In line with this , experiments in 1964 showed that a single session with LSD could reduce pain in the terminally ill for days or even weeks , breaking the cycle of anticipating pain and dramatically reducing the fear of death .
But prohibition , led by the USA , and followed by the rest of the world , effectively put a stop to all research on the positive effects of psychedelics .
Research intended to reveal damaging effects did continue , but not with the expected results .
There is no known lethal dose of LSD and early claims that it causes chromosomal damage were apparently fabricated .
Now research on psychedelics is tentatively starting up again .
With fearsome controls , and mountains of red tape it is a wonder that researchers are willing even to try , but those I met seemed extraordinarily determined .
The situation is least difficult in Switzerland , as Felix Hasler , a researcher at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich , explained .
Switzerland did join the world - wide prohibition in 1971 , but has a history of resistance to US policy , and in the 1990s began to allow research on psilocybin .
The Zurich research group , headed by Franz Vollenweider , is using brain scans , visual illusions , tests of attention , and other methods to investigate its effects .
LSD and psilocybin both have structural similarities to the neurotransmitter serotonin and affect its pathways in the brain , and both can create a kaleidoscopic world of extraordinary colour and movement .
But oddly enough brain scans do not reveal increased activity in the visual cortex .
Rather , the increase is seen in prefrontal , parietal and temporal regions .
It seems that the cortex can become overloaded with sensory information , with psilocybin affecting high level motion detection systems but not low level ones in the visual cortex .
The result can be effects similar to those observed in schizophrenics .
Although the connection with psychosis is often stressed , psychedelics , like meditation and sensory deprivation , have also been widely used as aids to spiritual practice .
The Zurich research is showing that all three of these spiritual techniques have a common core of effects which can be understood using a 5 - dimensional model of altered states of consciousness .
In the drug experiments , the type of drug , its dose and the setting all work together to shift a person ’s state along these dimensions .
In addition , PET scans are beginning to reveal which areas of the brain are implicated ; for example the inferior temporal lobe is involved in the feelings of boundlessness .
Most important to many researchers is the therapeutic potential of psychedelics , but they have to fight to be allowed to investigate this .
Psychiatrist , Charles Grob says that he has wanted to do such research since 1972 and at last is beginning , although it took him more than ten years to get approval for his study .
He is using psilocybin rather than LSD , partly because its action is rather shorter and its effects more controllable , but partly because it is politically less sensitive .
He has redecorated a drab hospital room for the purpose and is beginning to treat anxiety and pain in twelve patients with end stage cancer , giving them either drug or placebo , and so far the results are very promising .
This is the kind of research that might eventually confirm what Huxley , and so many other users , have seen for themselves , that just one or a very few meetings with a psychedelic can – under the right circumstances – enhance life and abolish the fear of death .
Why , if psychedelics really do have such magical therapeutic potential , have they been ignored for so long ?
Why are they not legal , or at least available on prescription ?
One depressing reason is that the pharmaceutical companies cannot make money out of them ; not only are there are no patents to be had but these drugs do n’t need to be taken regularly .
Indeed that is part of their magic .
Even one LSD trip can change a person ’s outlook forever .
In therapy , one or a few sessions may be enough .
So what can be done ?
Rick Doblin , founder of MAPS ( the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ) cynically points out that the big pharmaceutical companies prefer a hair restorer needed twice a day , or an anti-depressant taken daily for life , to a once - off miracle drug .
His solution is not to aim to make money from the drug itself but to set up clinics that train psychedelic guides and use the clinics as the business model .
Other initiatives are afoot in the hope that one day prohibition will fall .
One suggestion that was much discussed at the conference was the LSD driver ’s license proposed by German philosophy professor , Thomas Metzinger .
He laughingly told me that if people knew what he really had in mind they might not be so keen , for the licenses could be taken away as well as awarded , and people could be prosecuted for the equivalent of driving without one .
So this is hardly the free - for - all some proponents of prohibition might fear .
Also applicants would have to undergo a thorough psychiatric examination , pass a theory test , and take several training sessions with an experienced guide .
Once through all these hurdles they would be licensed to take the drug just once or twice a year .
Curiously enough , once or twice a year is probably quite enough .
As Hofmann remarked , “ once the gates of perception are open you do n’t need any more substances ” .
Users seem to agree : the founders of the most comprehensive drugs site on the web , the Vaults of Erowid , surveyed tens of thousands of LSD users .
The majority said that , if LSD were legal , they would take it no more than once or twice a year .
I hope that one day soon it will be ; that as a society we will prove wise enough to use LSD for its highest potential not its worst .
And purely selfishly I hope this will happen in time for me to take LSD again in my lifetime and that , like Huxley , I may be able to take it on my deathbed .
Eavesdropping program ruled unconstitutional
The defendants “ are permanently enjoined from directly or indirectly utilizing the Terrorist Surveillance Program in any way , including , but not limited to , conducting warrantless wiretaps of telephone and Internet communications , in contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Title III , ” she wrote .
She declared that the program “ violates the separation of powers doctrine , the Administrative Procedures Act , the First and Fourth amendments to the United States Constitution , the FISA and Title III . ”
Her ruling went on to say that “ the president of the United States … has undisputedly violated the Fourth in failing to procure judicial orders . ”
Before I get into the reactions of the fringe right blogs let me restate the issue .
As the judge stated , not this president , not any president is above the law .
Bush must follow well established legal precedent in regards to the surveillance of American citizens .
The AUMF in no way gave him the authority to ignore FISA or the 4th amendment .
He may not place under electronic surveillance any American citizen in America any time he chooses to without a warrant for longer then 72 hours ( a FISA provision added after 9 - 11 ) .
Right - wing bloggers have chosen to ignore Bush ’s violation of the law and opted to smear the judge instead ,
The reactionary Patterico ’s Pontifications – 08-17-2006 – writes ,
Ideologue Leftist Judge Rules NSA Program Unconstitutional
Based on this history , I predicted in my earlier post that Judge Taylor would rule the NSA program unconstitutional .
If Judge Taylor was willing to bend the rules to promote affirmative action , why not twist the law in order to rule unconstitutional a significant Bush anti-terror program ?
If one rules in favor of affirmative action one can assume that one will rule against Bush ?
Here again we also have right - wing double - speak calling the warrantless surveillance of Americans rephrased as an “ anti- terror program ” .
If Bush was sincerely concerned about keeping the program running as is he says he is he should have gone to the people ’s Representatives in Congress and had the law changed .
At least that is what those that respect the co-equal branches of government provided for by the constitution think he should have done ; we should all obey the law first and then change it rather then break the law then try and rationalize it or get someone to retroactively change the law so that you ’re not guilty .
Patterico ’s quotes ,
Eugene Volokh says that the opinion “ seems not just ill - reasoned , but rhetorically ill - conceived . ”
He calls it a “ seemingly angry , almost partisan - sounding opinion ” which is “ rich in generalities , platitudes . . . and “ obviously ” ’s , and poor in detailed discussion of some of the government ’s strongest arguments . ”
Orin Kerr describes the opinion using phrases like : “ well , um , it ’s kind of hard to know what to make of it ” and “ I confess that this has me scratching my head . ”
Yes Kerr ( a lawyer ) is scratching his head , but does n’t offer up a real rebuttal to the judge ’s decision ,
It ’s hardly obvious that the program — or some aspect of it — violates the Fourth Amendment ; that ’s the issue before the court , and my sense is that we really do n’t know enough to answer it without knowing the facts .
The right - wing blog The Jawa Report writes , August 17 , 2006 – Judge Orders Wiretapping Program Shut , Nation Cheers
Thank you Judge Taylor for shutting down the international wiretapping program .
I feel so much safer knowing that my Constitutionally protected right to chat with Ayman al Zawahiri about the weather in Waziristan is safe in your hands .
Thank you for saving me from the evil hands of George W. Bush .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Actually Bush could continue to spy on Ayman al Zawahiri ( if he is still alive ) because the issue is not the government ’s prerogative to spy on foreign agents or foreign governments .
So does Jawa not understand the issues or the law ?
I do n’t thnk he does and that ’s OK .
Its alright not to understand the issues , to wait and do some reading and after some thought give forth an informed opinion , but Jawa like most of the far right would rather open mouth first and maybe think later .
Instead he has chosen to lie because that is what paid up members of the cult of Bush do .
Jawa and many other conservative bloggers may want to refresh their collective memories .
Bush started spying on Americans before 9 - 11 , Spy Agency Sought U.S. Call Records Before 9/11 , Lawyers Say
The U.S. National Security Agency asked AT&T Inc. to help it set up a domestic call monitoring site seven months before the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , lawyers claimed June 23 in court papers filed in New York federal court .
The allegation is part of a court filing adding AT&T , the nation ’s largest telephone company , as a defendant in a breach of privacy case filed earlier this month on behalf of Verizon Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp. customers .
The suit alleges that the three carriers , the NSA and President George W. Bush violated the Telecommunications Act of 1934 and the U.S. Constitution , and seeks money damages .
“ The Bush Administration asserted this became necessary after 9/11 , ” plaintiff ’s lawyer Carl Mayer said in a telephone interview .
“ This undermines that assertion . ”
Conservatives swear we ’re all gonna die unless we let Bush do what he wants .
He did what he wanted before 9 - 11 and we all know what happened .
The administration and the head of the NSA have already been caught lying , via The Great Society
Dick Cheney in an article in the January 4 , 2006 Washington Post : Vice President Cheney said yesterday that the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks might have been prevented if the Bush administration had had the power to secretly monitor conversations involving two of the hijackers without court orders . [… ]
Cheney said if the administration had the power “ before 9/11 , we might have been able to pick up on two of the hijackers who flew a jet into the Pentagon . ”
Current CIA director and former NSA chief , General Michael Hayden , as quoted by CNN , January 23 , 2006 : “ Had this program been in effect prior to 9/11 , it is my professional judgment that we would have detected some of the 9/11 al Qaeda operatives in the United States , and we would have identified them as such , ” said Hayden , who now is principal deputy director of national intelligence .
A commenter at Jawa writes ,
lets hope the first bomb that comes here is dropped on this judges head .
what a stupidm move .
i cannot believe she would do this .
she needs to be put out of office immediately .
frank la may
The right just ca n’t stop giving into their racism and day dreams of death for their opponents .
They can engage in all the fear mongering and blood lust they like it still does not change the fact that Bush is running America more like Cuba then then a democratic republic .
Blogs for Bush goes right for the tiresome and predictable McCarthyism , Federal Judge Rules In Favor of Terrorists – August 17 , 2006
It should come as no surprise that Judge Anna Digg Taylor was appointed to the federal bench by Jimmy Carter back in 1979 .
Why is the American Left so determined for us to lose the war on terror ?
The Terrorist Surveillance Program has prevented terrorist attacks and saved lives …
Why do Democrats oppose preventing terrorist attacks and saving American lives ?
The leash is pretty tight over there at Blogs for Mr B .
Bush ’s clear violation of FISA is directly responsible for saving lives ?.. if that were my president I would offer up proof of violating FISA has saved lives .
BFB could n’t be bothered with such proof because there is n’t any ( Surveillance Net Yields Few Suspects ) .
They even capitalize and push the Big Brother doublethink with the meme of the “ The Terrorist Surveillance Program ” .
If the program was about nothing but spying on known terrorists the only problem the left has with that is if they are known terrorists , stop spying on them and arrest them .
Want to save lives ?
Get Bush to take his memos from the CIA seriously , Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US .
A very simple fact , more American have died under G.W. Bush ’s watch from terrorists then all presidents in the last fifty years combined .
Another blog back - tracking there writes ,
UrbanGrounds linked with The Power of Perfect Irony
I would make U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs
Taylor the very next innocent person to be killed by an Islamofascit jihadist ( is there any other kind ? ) who would have otherwise been caught via President Bush ’s wireless surveillance program . …
It s not enough to disagree with the judge , do a little research and state your disagreement in the land of Wingnuttia .
If you dare to not march in lock - step agreement with the wing - nuts you deserve to die .
Again and again these pontificatots of conservatism give a lot of lip service to freedom and preserving freedom , but no one may exercise freedom , but them .
( note : comments copied as found ) .
There is a crack in the court ’s opinion and right - wing bloggers would be well advised to start reading some liberal blogs to get some real ammunition rather then relying on Swiftboating the judge and making incoherent assertions .
From the Anonymous Liberal , Missing the Mark
But what makes this even more frustrating is that there is no need to reach this question , much less rely on it to support your other conclusions .
The logical structure of the opinion is entirely ass backwards .
Because FISA is currently the law of the land , there is simply no reason to reach the Fourth Amendment issue .
The Fourth Amendment only comes into play if you first rule that the AUMF or article II authorizes the president to violate FISA .
And this is where the DOJ has absolutely nothing to support its position .
Judge Taylor ( and her clerks ! ) had to have known that this opinion would be subjected to instant and intense scrutiny , both within the legal system and in the court of public opinion .
In light of that , I just do n’t understand why she chose to issues such a bare - bones opinion .
Even if this decision is upheld by the Sixth Circuit , the appellate judges are likely to take issue with her reasoning .
TLA is more astute about these finer legalisms then I , but I have to agree that the judge should have centered her reasoning on FISA rather then the 4th amendment .
Just one more blogger who is so far to the right she makes Engelbert Dollfuss look progressive , Debbie Schlussel – NSA - Opposing Judge Engaged in Misconduct - August 17 , 2006 ,
I figured Judge Anna Diggs Taylor , a 73 - year - old Jimmy Carter appointee , would have the chutzpah to overturn the NSA wiretaps and rule in favor of the ACLU and its raft of Islamist , America - hating plaintiffs .
And she did not disappoint my low expectations of her .
She seems to hate America and fairness almost as much as the Plaintiffs do .
She certainly hates a fair , impartial Judiciary .
It ’s not just that she ’s a shameless liberal who always allows her politics to enter into her decisions .
It ’s that she ’s so shameless she improperly interferes with cases that are not even hers .
Appointed by Jimmy Carter , former president and minister from Georgia , yep that judge must be evil .
“ chutzpah ” ? , no the judge used legal reasoning and while that reasoning may be off a little , Schlussel would rather engage in character assassination then be bothered with rational arguments based on the law .
“ shameless liberal ” ?
There ’s no reason to be ashamed of being a liberal , liberals did invent democracy and wrote the constitution of the country where Schlussel is free to sling mud rather then act like anything resembling a mature adult and responsible citizen .
Hating America seems to be an art perfected by modern conservatives who stand by while while Bush shreds the Constitution and gets over 2500 Americans killed for a lie , who uses sigining statements as a back alley device to avoid legal responsibility for his actions .
Bush supporters are simply willing accomplices to treachery wrapped in our flag , they are the two faced scroundrels of our time .
More at Unclaimed Territory , Federal court finds warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional , enjoins the program
.. the court swiftly and dismissively rejected the administration ’s claim that the AUMF constitutes authorization to eavesdrop in violation of FISA , noting that FISA is an extremely specific statute while the AUMF says nothing about eavesdropping .
In any event , as the court noted , since the court found warrantless eavesdropping unconstitutional , Congress could not authorize warrantless eavesdropping by statute .
For those that think people are dying in Iraq to spread freedom and democracy , well that was only true when Bush ’s poll numbers were over fifty percent and the mid-term elections were n’t just around the corner .
Now the Whitehouse looks like they ’re looking for the easiest exits from the quiqmire that they created , White House Searching For ‘ Alternatives ’ To Democracy In Iraq
“ Senior administration officials have acknowledged to me that they are considering alternatives other than democracy , ” said one military affairs expert who received an Iraq briefing at the White House last month and agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity .
“ Everybody in the administration is being quite circumspect , ” the expert said , “ but you can sense their own concern that this is drifting away from democracy . ”
Bush has rationalized the Iraq war by arguing “ a free Iraq at the heart of the Middle East ” would transform the region and be remembered as a “ watershed event in the global democratic revolution . ”
It is for times like this that the gallows laugh was invented .
By the way the post at Think Progress says that Rich Lowry of National Review states that his sources at the Whitehouse denies that the administration is seeking alternatives .
Fred Amoroso is the CEO of Macrovision , a company that earns its keep by inventing and maintaining DRM systems and charging Hollywood an arm and a leg for it .
The two are a good match , insofar as they both greatly fear technology , and both spin amazing tales to bolster their views .
In the wake of Steve Jobs ' fashionably - late missive against DRM , Amoroso has crafted a response that seeks to convince us all that DRM is not only needed , it 's actually a fantastic " enabler " that consumers should embrace .
He focuses on four arguments :
DRM is broader than just music
DRM increases , not decreases consumer value
DRM will increase electronic distribution
DRM needs to be interoperable and open
DRM is indeed broader than music , and it's no surprise that the CEO of a DRM - producing company would like to see DRM put on everything possible , particularly movies , music , games and software .
The reasons why we should want this are ridiculous .
DRM is good for you ?
DRM is good for you because it can give you more options , Amoroso argues .
" For example , DRM is uniquely suitable for metering usage rights , so that consumers who do n't want to own content , such as a movie , can ' rent ' it .
Similarly , consumers who want to consume content on only a single device can pay less than those who want to use it across all of their entertainment areasvacation homes , cars , different devices and remotely , " he wrote .
Topping it off , Amoroso writes : " Abandoning DRM now will unnecessarily doom all consumers to a ' one size fits all ' situation that will increase costs for many of them . "
( Emphasis added . )
Here 's a question for you , the reader : what do cassette tapes , CDs , ( most ) VHS tapes , books , and vinyl records all have in common ?
They all doom their users to the horrid life of not having to pay more to use them in more than one usage scenario .
Your CDs can be played in vacation homes and cars !
Your vinyl records can be played back on more than just one " RIAA - approved " player .
Oh , the horror !
Amoroso has just admitted that DRM is about creating new ways to sell your rights back to you .
Implicit in his argument is the boogeyman threat of cost : without DRM , you 'll have to pay more .
Yet the emerging digital download market shows just the opposite : for the same price as a DVD , you can download crippled videos at crappier resolutions that do n't work on all of the devices you own .
Chances are you can't even watch them on your TV .
I can walk into my local record shop right now and buy a handful of CDs for less than it would cost on iTunes , and they 'll be better quality , universally playable and rippable .
Sure , you could do some of this with interoperable DRM , which Amoroso lauds later in his letter .
Yet for Amoroso , interoperable DRM is just another commercial opportunity : you can sell the interoperability !
Without DRM , you 'll get nothing
Amoroso does n't want you to think that prices are the only thing at stake here .
Without DRM , he argues , there wo n't be any content to enjoy .
" Quite simply , if the owners of high - value video entertainment are asked to enter , or stay in a digital world that is free of DRM , without protection for their content , then there will be no reason for them to enter , or to stay if they 've already entered .
The risk will be too great , " he writes .
Amoroso could be right , and the major players could balk at a DRM - free world .
Yet they already live in a DRM - free world , because the only people plagued by DRM right now are the honest customers handing over their hard - earned money to buy DRM - laden products .
The pirates perpetuate their piratical existence sans DRM , and from the looks of it , nothing can stop them .
Anyone with sufficient motivation can find DRM - free digital goods online without too much effort .
Let 's entertain Amoroso 's argument .
What happens if the major players decide to ignore the digital market entirely ?
They simply wo n't be major players anymore .
There 's no shortage of entertainment options vying for our attention , so let those who have the drive to compete to do so , and the rest can stay at home and whine about it .
If the major players want to surrender the market to those independent artists who are n't afraid of technology ( like the folks at eMusic ) , whose problem is that exactly ?

The world 's poorest people are being denied access to drugs because pharmaceutical companies are focusing their resources on diseases suffered by wealthy , middle - aged Americans , such as obesity and heart disease , a leading expert will say tomorrow .
Dr David Rhodes , the Health Protection Agency 's ( HPA ) head of business development , will claim that spiralling costs are driving firms to invest primarily in drugs that tackle diseases of ' older Americans ' .
As a result , the international market has been flooded with medicines to treat ' American diseases ' such as high blood pressure , obesity , heart disease and cancer , while drugs to tackle tuberculosis , malaria and water - borne diseases prevalent in the poorest countries have been neglected .
Presenting his research at the HPA 's annual conference tomorrow , Rhodes will show that more and more pharmaceutical companies are moving their headquarters to the US in search of profits .
Once there , they pump money into treatments that help the local population to live longer .
' Drugs and vaccines are becoming phenomenally expensive to develop , ' said Rhodes .
' Companies have to recoup their investments by selling the drugs and vaccines .
To be economic , they need a large population and the price has to be high .
That increasingly means that drugs are developed for older Americans , who are getting healthier and living longer . '
Costs are soaring , added Rhodes , because of extensive safety and efficacy testing and the fact that many drugs that show ' early promise ' never make it through the checks .
As such , companies looking to be ' economic ' shift resources to meet the needs - and benefit from the profits - of the biggest spenders .
' The US tend to get the first bite of the cherry , ' admitted Rhodes .
He said the trend had led to a ' vicious ' circle in the poorest countries of 'low economic growth leading to poor healthcare systems , creating a higher burden of disease which in turn affects the ability of the population to develop economically ' .
But while sub-Saharan Africa is heavily affected , China and India 's strong investment in their pharmaceutical industry has seen health improvements and economic bonuses that will in turn attract investment back .
Nevertheless , with many private companies turning their back on the developing world , Rhodes said research was heavily dependent on philanthropic funding and government backing .
He welcomed the International Finance Facility for Immunisation - the funding arm of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation - that was launched on Friday .
The group has pledged to raise $ 4 billion ( £ 2.2bn ) for an immunisation programme in the developing world .
A fiery object that nearly hit a Sydney - bound airliner over the Pacific may have been a meteorite or debris from a Russian satellite , New Zealand authorities say .
The Lan Chile A340 Airbus was flying between Santiago and Auckland , before heading to Australia , when it came within about 30 seconds of hitting the object about 10 pm ( 2000 AEST ) on Tuesday .
The pilots radioed air traffic controllers in New Zealand to report fiery objects falling in front and behind the plane .
Ken Mitchell from Airways New Zealand said the pilot reported the debris was falling " very close " to the plane .
" The pilot estimated the debris to be falling as close as five nautical miles ( 9.26 kilometres ) to the aircraft , " Mitchell said .
Mr. Maliki has been under considerable pressure , particularly from American officials and Sunni Arab leaders , to rid the country ’s Shiite - run security and intelligence forces of militia influence and human rights abuses .
American officials have warned Iraqi leaders that they might curtail aid to the Interior Ministry , which runs the country ’s police forces , if officials who commit “ gross violations of human rights ” and are not held accountable .

The Interior Ministry , dominated by Shiites , has long been accused by Sunni Arabs of complicity in torture and killings .
It was unclear whether the Basra detainees were still in custody , and there was no further information on the of the detainees or their captors .
A spokesman for the British military command in Basra , Maj .
David Gell , said in a telephone interview early Monday that he could not provide any further information about them .
Reuters news agency said the detainees included a woman and two children .
The raid in Basra comes as the British command is planning a drawdown of as many as 1,600 of its 7,200 troops , a decision driven by the British government ’s assessment that Iraqi forces are strong enough to manage the security of the region on their own .
In announcing the reduction on Feb. 22 , Prime Minister Tony Blair said that while the Basra area remained dangerous , British troops faced far less violence than Americans farther north and that “ the next chapter in Basra ’s history can be written by Iraqis . ”
It was unclear whether the discovery in Basra would have any impact on British planning .
Major Gell said the intelligence agency office was raided after an investigation earlier Sunday led to the capture of five suspected bomb makers and evidence that pointed to possible violations at the agency ’s offices .
In those offices , he said , “ Evidence of significant criminal activity such as torture was found . ”
In Baghdad , Iraqi and American soldiers began to patrol the streets of Sadr City and conducted house - to - house searches for illegal weapons and militia fighters linked to sectarian crimes , according to residents and the American military command .
No shots were fired .
This is a fascinating time in the Virtual Reality industry .
In many ways , it parallels the dawn of the film industry .
Going back to 1890 , when the first motion picture cameras were invented , people really did n’t know what to do with them , or have any idea of the profound impact they were soon going to have on the world .
The oldest surviving film is this :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhay_Garden_Scene
The novelty carried it along for a few years , and it grew into an industry .
People flocked to store fronts , and eventually retrofitted theaters to see these moving pictures .
It was like magic .
This is sort of where VR is today .
People are scrambling to find ( and make ) content that pushes the boundaries , and sets new standards , but the novelty factor is still a major part of what is giving VR legs .
But if we look at film , we see that after a few years , the novelty was n’t enough .
Once everyone had seen a few films of a horse running , or a person walking , they did n’t see much reason to keep watching films .
So early filmmakers began to film stage plays , so that they could be presented to people anywhere .
They also filmed far off places in the world , and brought those films to people who might never see these exotic locales .
These filmmakers took regular life , and captured it .
But something was missing .
The medium existed , but it was n’t its own thing .
It was an extension of things we already understood .
There ’s a quote I love , “ The electric light did not come from the continuous improvement of candles ” ( Oren Harari ) .
Filmmakers realized that films had to be something new .
In many ways , this too , is where VR sits today .
We ’re taking what we already know , and “ VR ” ing it .
We ’re filming scenes , but in 360 .
We ’re taking 3D games , and rendering them to a head mounted display .
How do we get away from it feeling gimmicky ?
A novelty ?
What is the thing that will only make sense in a VR headset .
Where the game or experience cannot be properly conveyed on a 2D screen alone .
Where does it go from here ?
Well , in the late 1800s , people started to expect films to contain meaningful content with narrative and story .
And this is where movies truly found their place – their purpose .
When movies began to tell a story , the movie industry exploded .
When the continuous narrative and the techniques behind editing and and special effects started to become common practice , the medium became its own thing , rather than a way of repackaging things we ’d already seen .
So what does this mean for VR ?
Where are we today ?
Well , I think we ’re somewhere in the late 1890s .
Many people are producing content , games & experiences , trying to figure out what will cause VR ’s explosion , but it has n’t exploded yet .
We have n’t yet seen the defining piece that makes it all gel .
We ’re still at the stage of viewing films in front of stores , and in retrofitted theaters .
VR as a go - to form of entertainment in the home is not widespread enough yet .
But it will happen .
There will be something that makes millions of people jump on board the VR train .
VR differentiates from movies in a profound way .
While movies create a trance - like shared viewing experience , VR is isolated , and reactive .
Turning your head in VR , changes your view of the world .
Movies bring a time and a place to you .
VR , on the other hand , brings YOU to a time and place .
You do n’t watch it , you are it .
So , what will make VR become truly mainstream ?
That point where people come home on a Friday night , pour a glass of wine , sit down , and throw on the VR headset , and settle into an evening of … what ?
Ask yourself , right now , if you were to sit down with a VR headset on for a few hours , what would you want to be doing ?
Since VR teleports you to a different time and place , the question is really asking , “ If you were to be able to do anything at all , right now , what would you do ? ” , and then make that possible with VR .
To me , the thing that pops to mind is something creative , something about exploring and discovering .
And probably something social .
Take a look at Pokemon GO this past summer .
The message that we heard over and over , was how much it was bringing people together .
We saw Augmented Reality take a huge leap forward , and possibly begin to find it ’s place and its voice .
What will that be in VR ?
I do n’t know yet , but I , like so many others in this new industry , am trying to figure it out .
A pair of Sumatran tiger cubs and a set of young orang - utans , all abandoned at birth , have become inseparable after sharing a room at an Indonesian zoo .
The four have lived side by side for a month without a hitch , although this goes against their natural instincts .
" This is unusual and would never happen in the wild , " zookeeper Sri Suwarni said .
" Like human babies , they only want to play . "
But the friendship is not destined to last as tigers start eating meat when they are three months old and will need to be separated from their new playmates .

Count Jesse Russell among those who are not impressed with Madison 's Wi-Fi wireless system , which is supposed to offer Internet access throughout 10 square miles in downtown Madison .
' It seems the only places I can get a Mad City Broadband signal is while sitting in coffeehouses , but they have free Internet , so who cares , ' says Russell , the technologically savvy co-founder of the blog Dane101 .
' I lived for a year on Jenifer Street and I could not get the Mad City Broadband signal in my apartment .
I now live on North Bedford and still get no signal .
I can look out my window and see a box on a pole , but no matter how close I put my laptop to the window , no signal . '
Russell 's experience is n't unique .
Over the past year , 1,300 of about 2,000 people who tried to use the Wi-Fi network canceled their subscriptions to ResTech Services , one of two Internet service providers for the city Wi -Fi system .
On Wednesday , ResTech director Bryan Schenker announced that his company will no longer provide service after May 31 .
' It has n't been an area where we 've seen a lot of growth , ' says Schenker , adding that many customers who canceled had been frustrated by ' difficulties getting connected . '
Eve Galanter , a spokeswoman for Mad City Broadband , promised a ' major announcement about the future of the network in two to three weeks .
She said that service for customers with the other Internet provider , Merrimac Communications , would continue without interruption .
Mad City Broadband , which launched the system in March 2006 , says it has encountered a number of ' challenges ' ' technological , geographical and even horticultural ' that interfere with its signal in some areas .
' The near west side is particularly challenging , ' says Todd Anderson , Mad City Broadband technical project manager .
' From University Heights to the Vilas neighborhood , hills and mature trees block the signal .'
Having more access points would help , but the company cannot install them on existing utility poles in much of that area because the poles are old and not up to code .
Anderson says signals are stronger on most of the east side because utility poles are taller .
' On the west side , we can't do much about it until MGE replaces the poles . '
The signal , adds Anderson , can also be blocked by stone , concrete or brick .
And a PC user will get better service than a Mac user at the same location because the wireless cards in Macintosh computers are less powerful .
To address these issues , Mad City Broadband offers a signal booster .
That device may improve reception , but it costs $ 118 , and users are tethered to it .
A similar gizmo that creates an in - house wireless network costs $ 169 .
In contrast , AT&T Internet offers a wireless gateway for $ 79.99 , and customers who sign up for that service get a rebate that reduces the cost to about $ 30 .
And for those who sign on for higher - speed connections , at $ 24.99 a month or more , the gateway is free after the rebate .
Charter offers a similar deal .
Anderson affirms that the competition has become intense : ' Other providers are matching our prices , and they are marketing directly to people in our service area with door tags ' that advertise services and prices .
Mad City 's service providers charge $ 24.95 a month ( $ 14.95 for customers affiliated with the University of Wisconsin ) .
AT&T , which has merged with SBC , and Charter now offer DSL connections for as little as $ 14.95 for slower - speed connections , which are still 10 times faster than a dial - up connection .
They offer service that promises to match Mad City Broadband 's speed of one - half to one Mbps ( megabits per second ) for $ 19.95 .
But these other providers can't give Internet access from more than a couple hundred feet from a customer 's base station .
A more subtle form of competition comes from the ubiquitous free Internet access available in coffee shops , bookstores and libraries , and from bleeding wireless signals from businesses and houses where a wireless network is unprotected .
' I was getting free Internet from a neighbor for months , ' one pirate surfer confesses , on condition of anonymity .
' It was great , but now it 's got a password on it , and I 'm back to the coffee shop to go online . '
Currently , Mad City Broadband signals can be found from Highland Avenue on the near west side to the Yahara River on the east side , and south along Park Street .
It 's also available at the airport , where visitors to the city can subscribe for a per-day rate .
According to Galanter , Madison is a pioneer in developing a citywide broadband system and a proving ground for the equipment , manufactured by Cisco Systems .
' It 's all so new , ' she says .
' Cisco is using our experience to continue to improve the technology .
And Madison 's approach is unique ' no two cities are thinking about it in the same way . '
Municipalities from coast to coast are experimenting with Wi -Fi systems .
Many are still in the talking phase ; others have implemented various kinds of wireless networks .
Seattle , ranked number one on Intel 's list of the 100 Most Unwired Cities in 2005 , has a system in place , but the service is apparently available in only a few hotspots .
In Fort Wayne , Ind. , the city paid $ 60,000 to subsidize its system and make it available free to users in 15 hotspots in a 15 - block area downtown .
A January 2007 article from the Fort Wayne News Sentinel said the service is considered unreliable .
' Sometimes it works .
Sometimes it does n't , ' the paper reported .
In Madison , there was some talk about providing the service at no cost to users , but the city decided against using tax dollars to subsidize the network , says mayoral spokesman George Twigg .
After early negotiations with AOL broke down , the city accepted a proposal from Cellnet Technology , an Atlanta - based company , to build the network .
Mad City Broadband is a division of Cellnet .
' Because of the name , some people think this is like a city utility , ' says Twigg .
' But the city 's only investment has been some staff time . '
Mad City Broadband currently has no concrete plans to extend Wi -Fi beyond its current boundaries , although that remains a long - range goal .
' We get calls from people who want to know when they can expect to get it , but now the focus is on improving the service within the 10 - square - mile service area , ' Galanter says .
' We are assessing the market .
The next phase may not be contiguous .
It will depend on where the greatest demand is .'
Liaw says the next phase might be providing service in apartment and condominium buildings .
But he agrees that 's not an immediate goal .
' We want to provide the best quality service where we are before we expand , ' he says .
' And with the improved technologies coming out , we do n't know when that will happen . '
Mr Carpenter ( r ) won the competition with George , part of Jabberwacky
George and its creator Rollo Carpenter competed against three other talkative bot finalists in New York .
Reigning three - time winner , Alice , came fourth in this year 's Loebner Prize .
The competition is based on the Turing Test , which suggests computers could be seen as " intelligent " if their chat was indistinguishable from humans .
George managed to convince the judges enough to earn himself the Hugh Loebner 's Bronze Medal , and $ 3,000 ( £ 1,660 ) , which goes to the most convincing entrant .
The gold medal and Grand Prize of $ 100,000 ( £ 55,400 ) , which goes to the bot that completely fools the judges , has remained unclaimed since the competition 's inception in 1990 .
British first
Mr Carpenter told the BBC News website that the win was a first for an AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) that learns from its interactions .
" The time of the learning AI is now here .
In a number of fields , technologies that observe and apply patterns in data to real - world situations have already come to the fore , " explained Mr Carpenter .
" Though Jabberwacky , and the George character within it , remain distinctly unusual in their behaviour , the fact that they work at all , and that they 've improved greatly over the last year , is a testament to the power of context . "
In previous years , Mr Carpenter has entered the competition with the program , Jabberwacky .
This year , George was the entered as a slightly different variant of that program .
George is a " character " which has learned its conversation skills from the interactions it has had with visitors to the Jabberwacky website , and through chats with Mr Carpenter .
Mr Carpenter thinks that in the not - too - distant future , it may be that programs or robots talk and act in place of humans , mimicking human behaviour .
Along with Jonathan Freeman , he has proposed a type of " Personal Turing Test " which would test a program 's ability to convince a judge that it is a person known to them .
LOEBNER PRIZE 2005 RESULTS
1 : R Carpenter - " Jabberwacky " 2 : V Veselov - " Eugene " 3 : S Watkins - " Tony " 4 : R Wallace - " Alice "
" Two things have made the difference this year : 2.5 million new entries [ chat interactions / data inputs ] , taking the total to 5.7 million , and new techniques that extract a distinct personality - a character - from a tiny subset of the data - in this case , George , " he explained .
" Anyone can create their own bot ' just by talking to it ' at the site , preserving their own or an invented persona in silicon . "
During the competition , the computer programs had to " chat " anonymously with four judges .
The judges also chatted with four humans , each paired with a program .
The judges then awarded " humanity " points to each of the pairs .
At one point in George 's " conversation " with one of the judges , it accused the judge of not being human and discussed its lack of hobbies .
Alice had won the international competition for the most convincing entry in 2000 , 2001 and 2004 .
Its creator , American Richard Wallace , started work on the software in 1995 .
It seems like Microsoft 's Live platform adds more products everyday .
Last week was the news on Windows Live Expo , and now this week John Montgomery , a program manager in Microsoft 's developer division , has started thinking out loud about what a Visual Studio Live service might look like and offer .
Montgomery notes that Visual Studio 2005 has already started a trend toward " software that is smarter when it 's online and back - ended by a set of services . "
He mentions CodeZone - integrated help , the Community Menu , and the Visual Studio Start Page as examples of quasi-Live services .
He also asks the readers what they 'd like to see in a " Live " Visual Studio .
Some of the responses include :
Instant messaging capabilities in the team system
Shared editing , allowing two people to edit code at the same time
Faster patching , meaning users do n't have to wait for service packs
Centralized project files
One - click " send solution to buddy " capabilities
Better documentation
One problem that Montgomery wants to avoid is users losing their IDE when the Internet goes down , or even worse , losing their work .
His solution is to only make the Visual Studio IDE " smarter " when the Internet is available , and keep it away from complete reliance on the ' Net .
I think that 's a great idea , and something that could be very beneficial to developers .
Does a " Live " Visual Studio sound viable ?
Is this a good direction for the IDE to move ?
It ’s true .
After all the financial advice I give out on this site , I keep a decent amount of cash “ under my mattress ” ( actually , it ’s in another secure place in my home , but it ’s effectively the same thing ) .
At first , this seems to fly right in the face of everything I preach on this site .
Why is n’t this money at least earning 4.5 % in a Capital One 360 savings account , if not earning a lot more in a mutual fund or something else ?
No , because this is a different kind of investment .
I keep a small pile of twenties in my home as my ultimate emergency fund .
I keep this money on hand for the sole purpose of being available if I have no access to funds in any other way – in the event of an absence of electricity or some other essentials , a cash economy will dominate and I do not wish to risk being in that situation with no leverage to make sure my family has food , water , and protection .
Even though it ’s not earning anything , I view this money as an investment .
It ’s an investment against the unexpected – situations where everything else has failed and I have no other options to turn to .
Knowing that it is there provides a certain level of security that money sitting in a bank account somewhere can’t quite provide .
Is this necessary ?
Let ’s step back to Labor Day 2005 , when Hurricane Katrina basically wiped a major city off of the map in the United States .
Let ’s step back to the summer of 2003 , when much of the northeastern United States blacked out , many areas for weeks .
What about the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 – I do live near the New Madrid fault line , after all .
I ’m only mentioning domestic disasters so far – what about the tsunami of 2004 ?
The dozens of devastating earthquakes in recent years ?
The fact is that such disasters happen , and quite often you have no way of knowing these things are coming .
To not be prepared for them on some level is a poor choice , the type of choice that leaves people in situations of desperation , like those poor souls who inhabited the Superdome after Katrina .
I view the pile of bills under my mattress as an insurance policy against such a disaster , so that I can get my family the things that they need or at least get us to a place where we can get the things we need .
If you live in a disaster prone area , there are home insurance policies that can prepare you for disaster .
Is this the right thing for you ?
That ’s a question you ’ll have to ask yourself – it comes down to whether or not you feel that such preparation for a relatively slim possibility is worthwhile .
Is it ?
Give it some thought today as you go through your activities – and put a few twenties under the mattress tonight if if feels right to you .

Rome is demanding Bruno the bear back , claiming he is Italian state property .
But despite a request from the German government , the Bavarian state environment minister is refusing to hand the brown bear 's body over .
Bruno wandered from Italy to Germany via Austria and was gunned down after eating 30 sheep , four rabbits and a guinea pig .
Freezer
Bruno took a tragic wrong turn in becoming the first brown bear to have been spotted in Germany for 170 years .
Bavarian hunters ended his life - but not the story .
Nine months on , the Italians are demanding Bruno 's body back .
All 100 kg of it .
But the Bavarians have blown the idea that Bruno is Italian state property out of the water .
As far as they are concerned , since Bruno died on Bavarian soil - the carcass is theirs to keep .
They plan to stuff him and put him on display in a local museum .
Germany 's federal government tried to intervene on the side of the Italians .
But the Bavarians will not budge .
As for the late bear himself , as long as Bruno 's fate remains unclear , he will remain in a freezer somewhere in Bavaria .
Most marketers think that getting on the front - page of Digg will solve all their problems .
The question is , “ if you could choose between the home page of Digg , TechCrunch , Netscape , or Reddit , which would you prefer ? ”
And the answer , it appears , is not what you would expect .
To provide some insight , we have brought in guest blogger , Mark Roberge , CEO of PawSpot.com .
Over the past six months , PawSpot has made an appearance on the home page of each of these entities .
So which home - page should you aspire to be on from a purely marketing perspective ?
To be honest , when TechCrunch covered us , we were still in user experience testing and had not even officially launched the site .
However , the mention alone led to coverage by at least 50 additional blogs and invitations to a number of speaking engagements within the next few weeks .

Jane Weeks , 44 , a freelance art and creative director in Truckee , Calif. , knows what it is like to be the object of another woman 's crush .
She has encountered a few women who have eagerly adopted her tastes in food and interior design , her favorite colors , even her hairdresser .
" At first it 's flattering you 're inspiring them , " she said .
" When they parrot back parts of yourself , it 's extremely uncomfortable . "
Ms. Weeks , an outdoorswoman who has hiked through the Andes from Argentina to Chile , said some women are more enamored with what she represents -- " some National Geographic chick " -- than with who she is .
" When you 're on a pedestal , there 's no way but down , " she said .
" And it 's lonely up there .
You ca n't share your weaknesses . "
Pepper Schwartz , a professor of sociology at the University of Washington and the relationship expert at PerfectMatch.com , said she also has been a frequent subject of girl crushes -- from her students .
Some have made it obvious by bringing gifts , including earrings , flowers and even poems .
But Dr. Schwartz does not encourage her students to look at her with starry eyes .
She would rather they look to her for guidance on developing their careers .
" You 're a hero because they think you 've done something unimaginably powerful , " Dr. Schwartz said .
" Your job is to show them that they own something equally special . "
Perhaps the last time that young women were as willing as they are now to admit to their attraction to each other was in the 19th century .
" Back when Louisa May Alcott was writing , women were writing these letters to each other , " Dr. Caplan said .
" They wrote : ' I miss you desperately .
I long to hug you and talk to you all night . " '
Referring to another woman as a girl crush , she said , is not dissimilar to that 19th century behavior .
But such impassioned expressions of affection were uncommon , for instance , in the 1960's and 70's , when homophobia was even more rampant than it is today , Dr. Caplan said .
Women were often uncomfortable admitting to strong feelings for other women , fearing that their emotions would seem lesbian , she said .
And those same women , older now , can still be shy about expressing their emotions for each other .
" Women my age are more likely to say ' I adore ' or ' I value ' my women friends , ' not girl crush , " she said .

This is a big deal :
Elections officials in several states are scrambling to understand and limit the risk from a “ dangerous ” security hole found in Diebold Election Systems Inc. ’s ATM - like touch - screen voting machines .
The hole is considered more worrisome than most security problems discovered on modern voting machines , such as weak encryption , easily pickable locks and use of the same , weak password nationwide .
Armed with a little basic knowledge of Diebold voting systems and a standard component available at any computer store , someone with a minute or two of access to a Diebold touch screen could load virtually any software into the machine and disable it , redistribute votes or alter its performance in myriad ways .
“ This one is worse than any of the others I ’ve seen .
It ’s more fundamental , ” said Douglas Jones , a University of Iowa computer scientist and veteran voting - system examiner for the state of Iowa .
“ In the other ones , we ’ve been arguing about the security of the locks on the front door , ” Jones said .
“ Now we find that there ’s no back door .
This is the kind of thing where if the states do n’t get out in front of the hackers , there ’s a real threat . ”
This newspaper is withholding some details of the vulnerability at the request of several elections officials and scientists , partly because exploiting it is so simple and the tools for doing so are widely available .
[…]
Scientists said Diebold appeared to have opened the hole by making it as easy as possible to upgrade the software inside its machines .
The result , said Iowa ’s Jones , is a violation of federal voting system rules .
“ All of us who have heard the technical details of this are really shocked .
It defies reason that anyone who works with security would tolerate this design , ” he said .

The plane crashed during take - off from Mehrabad airport
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that 36 people on board the Russian - built Antonov - 74 had been killed - 30 soldiers and six crew .
Two soldiers survived and were being treated in hospital , it added .
The commander of the Revolutionary Guards suggested to a local news agency that there may have been foul play , but he gave no further details .
Safety doubts
The plane was due to fly from Mehrabad airport to the southern city of Shiraz but crashed at the end of the runway .
A representative of parliament 's national security committee said the plane 's right engine failed , causing the wing tip to touch the runway and explode .
The guards are the ideological wing of the Iranian military and are believed to have wide influence in the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
There were reportedly several senior officers on board the plane .
The BBC correspondent in Tehran says Iran has an appalling air safety record .
There have been a number of disasters in recent years - this is the fourth plane crash in less than a year .
Almost a year ago , a military transport aircraft crashed , killing 128 people .
That plane was attempting an emergency landing at Tehran airport when it hit a 10 - storey building nearby .
Every guitarist has an opinion on the greatest recorded guitar solos .
The editors of Guitar World magazine put together a poll to find out what their readers considered to be the best guitar solos of all time .
The results reflect the magazine 's demographic ( all rock solos ) , but the top 15 winners boast great guitar work .
The following lists the top 15 guitar solos ever recorded including guitar tab , details on the guitarist who played the solo , album name , and links to audio .
01 of 15 Stairway to Heaven Dave Hogan / Getty Images Led Zeppelin ' s landmark 1971 album , " Led Zeppelin IV , " is one of the best - selling albums of all time and contains some of the band 's most memorable hits .
While Zep fans may argue over which of the album 's songs is best , nearly everyone agrees that nothing can touch Jimmy Page 's solo on " Stairway to Heaven . "
02 of 15 Eruption Paul Natkin / Getty Images Eddie Van Halen 's thunderous guitar solo is from the band 's 1978 debut album " Van Halen . "
It is the second track on the album and leads into " You Really Got Me , " which became Van Halen 's first single .
​ Eddie Van Halen only cut two versions of this instrumental in the studio , and it almost did n't make the final version of the album .
His guitar 's unique sound comes from tweaks Van Halen made using the echo chamber 's built - in 8 - track recorder .
03 of 15 Freebird Gijsbert Hanekroot / Redferns / Getty Images Lynyrd Skynyrd 's anthemic " Freebird " closes out the band 's debut 1973 release , " Pronounced Leh - nerd Skin-nerd . "
It was their second top - 20 hit .
Although guitarists Gary Rossington and Allen Collins would trade solos when they performed this power ballad live , it is Collins ' guitar work heard on the studio recording .
The song quickly became the band 's anthem , taking on more significance for fans after lead singer Ronnie Van Zant and several other band members died in a plane crash in 1977 .
04 of 15 Comfortably Numb Waring Abbott / Getty Images
With soaring orchestral accompaniment , " Comfortably Numb " closes outside three of ​ Pink Floyd 's epic 1979 concept album , " The Wall . "
Guitarist David Gilmour , who co-produced the album , was a legendary perfectionist in the studio .
After choosing the five or six best takes of his solo , Gilmour took the best bits from each and mixed them to produce the solo heard on the album .
05 of 15 All Along the Watchtower David Redfern / Redferns / Getty Images " All Along the Watchtower " was Jimi Hendrix 's only top - 40 hit in the U.S.
It is the second - to - last track on 1968 's " Electric Ladyland , " the third and final album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience .
Hendrix was a meticulous studio musician and drove his bandmates hard ; at one point , bassist Noel Redding walked out .
Hendrix recorded each of the solo's parts separately , with different setups for each ( he reportedly used a cigarette lighter to play slide guitar ) .
06 of 15 November Rain Ke.Mazur / WireImage / Getty Images Guns N' Roses went big on their third release , " Use Your Illusion Vols .
I and II . "
It was a double album that contained three epic - length tracks , including " November Rain . "
This cut from " Use Your Illusion I " is nearly nine minutes long and contains Slash 's smoking guitar solo .
The track was a huge hit in the U.S. , peaking at No. 3 . It also bears the distinction of being the longest song ever to enter the Billboard Hot 100 .
07 of 15 One Jim Steinfeldt / Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images Metallica hit the top 40 for the first time with this heavy metal grinder from their third album , 1987's " ... And Justice For All . "
Guitarist Kirk Hammet plays three distinct solos on this track .
The first and last solos came easy during recording , but Hammet was n't happy with the middle one .
He later took a quick break during that year 's Monsters of Rock tour to record a new solo in New York , which ended up on the album .
08 of 15 Hotel California Michael Putland / Getty Images
Even if you do n't know The Eagles , you 've probably heard " Hotel California , " the title track off the band 's 1976 record .
It 's one of the best - selling albums of all time , and the song is the group 's signature hit .
Guitarists Don Felder and Joe Walsh trade off solos on the studio version , but it 's Felder who wrote the intricate guitar lines , including the legendary 12 - string acoustic .
09 of 15 Crazy Train Paul Natkin / Getty Images Ozzy Osbourne went solo in 1980 with " Blizzard of Ozz , " and the single " Crazy Train " became a top - 10 hit in the U.S. Legendary guitarist Randy Rhoads gets credit for this solo , notable for containing a full minor chord ( something almost unheard of in heavy metal ) .
Rhoads , a classically trained musician , had his solo overdubbed three times to give his guitar added punch .
10 of 15 Crossroads Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images
It 's songs like " Crossroads " that had people scrawling " Clapton is God " on the walls back when he was with Cream .
This track , off the band 's 1968 double album " Wheels of Fire , " was recorded live in San Francisco .
Although the bluesy number has become one of Clapton 's most memorable solos , he says the version heard on the record is n't a great example of guitar playing .
As he told Guitar World , " Instead of playing on the two and the four , I ’m playing on the one and the three . "
11 of 15 Voodoo Chile ( Slight Return ) Vince Melamed / Getty Images Jimi Hendrix makes our list a second time with " Voodoo Chile ( Slight Return ) , " another track from his third album , " Electric Ladyland . "
The psychedelic blues number was a staple of Hendrix 's live performances ​when his solos could stretch the song to 10 or 15 minutes .
The single , released posthumously in the U.K. , became his only No. 1 in that country .
12 of 15 Johnny B. Goode Michael Ochs Archives / Getty Images
A pioneer of rock ' n ' roll , Chuck Berry 's " Johnny B. Goode " is a classic by any standard .
The song was a top hit in 1958 when it was released as a single , and it also appeared on Berry 's third album , " Chuck Berry Is On Top , " released the following year .
13 of 15 Texas Flood Larry Hulst / Getty Images Stevie Ray Vaughan 's
Texas blues put the Austin music scene on the map in the 1980s .
" Texas Flood " is the title track from the 1983 album from Vaughan and his band Double Trouble .
The band recorded the whole record in just two days .
The resulting sound is pure Vaughan , no overdubs .
14 of 15 Layla Redferns via Getty Images / Getty Images After Eric Clapton left Cream behind , he formed Derek and the Dominos .
The band only put out one album , but it 's considered a landmark of its era .
" Layla " appears on the double - LP " Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , " released in 1970 .
Clapton 's intense performance is backed up by Duane Allman on slide guitar .

AT TIMES , President Bush ’s second term has resembled a laboratory test of what happens to a large institution when all mechanisms of accountability are disabled .
The results have not been pretty .
Hurricane Katrina , the chaotic occupation and reconstruction of Iraq , the breakdown at Walter Reed Army Medical Center , the FBI ’s abuse of Patriot Act powers , the troubling dismissals of eight U.S. attorneys -- everywhere , the administration has been plagued by an epidemic of incompetence .
Bush has stumbled so badly at managing the basic responsibilities of government that even the National Review , the flagship magazine of the conservative movement and hardly a traditional critic of the president , used its latest cover to plaintively ask : “ Ca n’t anyone here play this game ? ”
Advertisement
How did it come to this for an administration that , as the National Review noted , initially portrayed itself as buttoned - down “ adults ” returning to Washington after President Clinton ’s baby boom bacchanal ?
The answer begins with Bush ’s management style .
He combines a distaste for details with a tendency to prize loyalty over performance .
Shaped by those attitudes , Bush typically worries more about signaling resolve to his critics by denying failures inside his government than demanding excellence by punishing it .
That impulse explains how Bush could present a prestigious medal to George J. Tenet -- who had resigned months earlier as CIA chief -- after his agency ’s declarations about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction crumbled like sand , and how Donald H. Rumsfeld survived so long as Defense secretary while Iraq disintegrated .
Bush ’s instincts were dangerously reinforced by the Republican - controlled Congress , which viewed itself less as an independent branch of government than as a junior partner to the White House in the American equivalent of a parliamentary system .

The Republican majority so completely abdicated its responsibilities to conduct oversight on the executive branch that its governing motto might have been “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell . ”
Key House and Senate committees sometimes went months without oversight hearings on Iraq .
Neither chamber managed more than a glancing review of the increased police powers the administration acquired for the war on terror .
Congress barely noted the collapse in care for many veterans at Walter Reed , and it almost completely avoided issues uncomfortable for Bush , such as global warming and declining access to health insurance .
This deference reflected the widespread tendency among congressional Republicans “ to think that your political welfare is tied up with the president , and you do n’t want to make him look bad , ” as Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( R - Va. ) , one of the few GOP leaders who maintained some independence from the White House , told The Times .
But the abandonment of oversight had the opposite effect .
By refusing to challenge the administration ’s performance , the Republican majority allowed problems to fester and dysfunction to deepen .
One senior House Republican said this week that nothing hurt the GOP more in 2006 than the collapse of its reputation for competent governance .

Many of the decisions now causing Bush grief could have been made only by a politician who did not believe anyone was looking over his shoulder .
It ’s inconceivable that the administration would have been so cavalier about planning the postwar occupation of Iraq -- or so dismissive of the Army warnings that it had not deployed enough troops to ensure order -- if it knew that Congress would closely examine its plans .
Likewise , it ’s difficult to imagine that an administration accustomed to serious scrutiny would have dismissed U.S. attorneys involved in sensitive decisions on whether to prosecute political corruption and fraud cases the way Bush ’s Justice Department did in December .
Depending on how they apply oversight power , the Democratic congressional majority could restore badly needed accountability to the system .
If Democrats focus on settling scores , they will succeed only in igniting partisan firefights .
They veered dangerously close to that mistake Friday with the hearing flogging the Valerie Plame case , which the criminal justice system had already adjudicated .
But congressional oversight aimed at legitimate targets will serve the country by increasing pressure on the administration to demonstrate results -- beginning in Iraq , but also at home .
Already , tough congressional questioning is forcing Bush to change the way he operates .

In the four months since Democrats won control , perhaps more administration officials linked to failure or ethical missteps -- Rumsfeld , officials directly responsible for Walter Reed , the Army secretary , the Justice Department chief of staff -- have resigned under fire than during the six years when the GOP majority averted its eyes .
Atty . Gen. Alberto R. Gonzales , even after Bush ’s vote of confidence Tuesday , may be the next to fall to the new breeze .
Tuesday ’s stormy news conference suggests that Bush will push back against tough oversight .
But his presidency might have turned out a lot better if he had n’t spent his first six years virtually immune from it .
What is Some Dating Advice for Geeks ?
Let 's face it , nearly everyone who is single would like to be a more successful dater .
Sadly , geeks often need a bit more redirection than others .
Maybe this is a result of society 's marginilization of those with specialized skills and interests , or maybe it 's because computers do , by nature , breed solitude .
Either way , we here at wiseGEEK thought that it was time to throw our hat into the ring of fire and help out our fellow geeks .
First things first :
These five ideas are pretty basic tips .
If they 're not surprising to you , then maybe you should re-examine your need to pursue dating advice -- seems either you do n't need it , or you 're not listening .
If these are surprising to you , then we 're glad you 've come .
Also , there is a strong possibility that you will read the list of tips below and find yourself thinking , " I ca n't do that , " or " that 's not me . "
A truth that few geeks seem to understand is that for many of these things , just doing it makes it who you are .
Like black coffee , the first time may make you shudder , but the more you drink it , the more you will enjoy it .
If that does n't make you feel better , then follow the advice of one of the ultimate geeks : " Do or do not .
There is no ' try . ' "
One more small disclaimer before we proceed .
These are dating tips .
This is not relationship advice , and this will not help you if you have other more specific goals .
1. Be Confident
Seriously , even if you 're not , just pretend you are .
Not too much , though , because there 's not a person on the planet who can't recognize arrogance as overcompensation for insecurity .
What makes geeks who they are is specialized skills , interests , or hobbies .
The best thing you can do is be confident in those things .
Be proud of them .
Be honest about them .
Do n't waste your time worrying about coming off as nerdy - - a nerd is a geek who is insecure about how he or she spends her time .
One of the biggest pitfalls that geeks are prone to is self - effacing comments or jokes .
This is a huge no - no .
Talking candidly about your deep insecurities or your perceived shortcomings is never , under any circumstances , attractive .
Just look at Woody Allen .
Saying things like , " I have really bad hair , " or " I 'm girl repellent , " will only make them truer , and they leave nowhere for your conversation partner to go , except phony affirmation .
Better to just leave it out .
2. Be Direct
Many have observed that geeks , more than any other brand of person , have a tendency to skirt the issue .
They become friends , they pine away from afar , or in the worst circumstances they become stalkers .
Though we are certainly advocates of being friends with the person you love , it 's the issue of ambiguity that we 're addressing here .
If you 're asking someone out on a date , make sure you use that word .
If you have romantic interest in someone you encounter in a chat room , ask them to meet you for real and tell them why .
Do n't be intimidated by this , because simple , direct language is the easiest to think of : " I 'd like to take you out on a date , " or , " I think you 're neat .
Can I buy you dinner ? "
This is important information for geeks who think that hanging out for coffee is a date .
Well , if you said it was a date , it is .
If you did n't , then no one knows .
You 'll both be wondering if you 're on a date , and wondering if your attendance status would have been different had you known ahead of time if it was a date .
This condition breeds insecurity , misunderstandings , and anxiety .
Like bad scallops , these things are to be avoided in potentially romantic settings .
3. Be Observant
Although this skill seems somewhat easier for females , geeks are who they are because of their ability to focus and learn .
The key here is to understand what you are observing and act accordingly .
Looking carefully at the way someone reacts to you and vice versa can tell you volumes more than listening to their words .
Watch , listen , and then believe what you learn , whether it be good news or bad .
A few hotspots to be aware of :
Body language :
If you are leaned toward each other , mirroring each other 's posture , or inching closer , these are all good signs .
Read the signs .
Eyes :
Is he focused on his beer ?
Is she glancing up every time someone passes by your table ?
Uh oh .
Our eyes subconciously reveal what we are thinking about -- if the person across the table is looking at you , you have their attention and you should feel good about that .
Physical contact : Duh .
Touching is good .
Spontaneous , unnecessary touching is really good .
Avoiding physical contact is an early bedtime .
Voice : Again , it 's not what they say so much as how they say it .
Han understands Chewie , Timmy understands Lassie , and everyone seems to understand that Korean guy on Lost .
It 's tone , intonation , volume , and cadence that tell the real story .
4. Be Curious
This is such an important point .
Geeks are notoriously good learners , thinkers , and problem solvers -- why not put that to work in a romantic setting ?
This plays out in two ways .
First , ask about the person .
Everyone likes someone who will listen to them , so being interested in their stories and hobbies will help you .
Do n't fake enthusiasm -- find something you can be enthusiastic about .
If you can't , then what are you doing there , anyway ?
Second , be candid about the things that you are curious about in your own life .
Share things you 're learning and thinking .
This is a good way for geeks to gauge if the person they 're interested in is a fellow geek , or if they 're geek averse .
5. Be Honest
Under no circumstances is dishonesty going to help you .
If you need to lie because you think it will help you look cooler , see # 1 .
If you think that lying will prevent someone 's feelings from getting hurt , you are wrong .
Be clear about what you want , and honest about what you do n't .
Period .
So there it is .
Simple , straightforward , and not nearly as easy as it sounds .
The good news is that if you really want to find someone who likes you for who you are , then you have an obligation to actually be who you are .
There is no better strategy than being yourself with someone who makes it easy for you to be yourself .
If you are hopelessly insecure , self - centered , self - concerned , and selfish , then you need more help than we can offer .
Otherwise , follow the advice of a Jedi master .
With Salam Talib
Few in Iraq have experienced sectarian violence more than residents of Samarra , an ancient , mid-sized city on the Tigris River northwest of Baghdad .
For centuries , the areas Sunni majority had lived at peace with its
Shi’ite minority  but in February , someone blew up a major Shi’ite shrine in the city , sparking sectarian killing across the country that continues to this day .
Now , Samarra is being hit with a second round of violence  two tribes , both of them Sunni , are battling each other over who will control an important area just west of city .
“ It started when a car bomb went off in one the al - Bubaz family ’s homes , ” explains Sheik Ahmed Yahir al - Samarrai .
“ They accused the al - Bubadri tribe of doing it .
Then people started killing each other . ”
Observers say the trouble actually started before that  when the al - Bubaz tribe began to cooperate with the U.S. military a year ago .
After the head of the tribe was killed , tribal leaders started to fight the movement of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and began taking money to guard a power plant .
“ The Americans asked the al - Bubaz family to cooperate with them by providing security , ” says lawyer Nezar al - Samarrai .
“ The other tribes felt offended with the fact that this tribe was cooperating with the Americans . ”
Like many Iraqis , Nezar al - Samarrai believes the U.S. military upset tribal relations on purpose to make the situation unstable .
“ They can stay in the city as long as there ’s instability here , and they want to stay here forever , ” he says .
According to the United States ’ Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity has paid tens of millions of dollars to tribes to protect the country ’s electric grid .
The GAO ’s Joseph Christof tells me while he has n’t heard of tribal warfare in Samarra , he has heard about a host of other problems .
He summarizes the findings of a report released in April this year :
“ The Iraqi Ministry of Electricity was providing the subcontracts with the tribes to protect the transmission lines and oftentimes they would n’t necessarily protect the transmission lines .
They would allow insurgents or other groups to come in and destroy the transmission lines , and they would in turn try to enact fees or tariffs to the reconstruction lines that they were supposed to be protecting . ”
Meanwhile , the body count continued to rise in Iraq .
In Baquba , northeast of the capital , a U.S. raid and air strike killed eight people , including seven members of one family , Wednesday .
Inside Baghdad itself , a car bomb exploded near a busy market in the mostly Shi’ite district of Bayaa , killing five people and wounding eight others .
Gunmen in Baghdad also shot and killed the sister of a Shi’ite member of parliament .
In Kirkuk in northern Iraq , at least 10 people were wounded when a car bomb exploded near the headquarters of the Turkmen Front Party .
For Sheik Ahmed Yahir al - Samarrai , three years of U.S. occupation have left him and his neighbors feeling trapped in their homes .
“ There ’s nothing good in this country , ” he says .
“ Every day is worse than the day before .
The only place that I can go to is the area around my house .
I can only shop in my own area .
The killings are based on the address of your identification card and your name . ”
Okay , there 's been too much written about this already , so I 'll try to keep my 2 cents short .
Concerned about Microsoft 's decision to make MSN Search the default search engine in Internet Explorer 7 ( earth shattering , is n't it ? ) , Marissa Mayer said :
" The market favors open choice for search , and companies should compete for users based on the quality of their search services , " said Marissa Mayer , the vice president for search products at Google .
" We do n't think it 's right for Microsoft to just set the default to MSN .
We believe users should choose . "
Here are both of my cents :
First off , I agree that companies should compete based on quality .
But Microsoft and McDonald 's are both shining examples of how that 's not necessarily the way it works when " the market " is involved in the decision making .
Price and convenience tend to trump quality .
However , if that 's what Google or Marissa really believe , why did they enter into an agreement that 'd result in paying $ 1 billion to Dell Computer in exchange for a Googlized web browser on the computers they ship ?
Right !
Because many users do n't choose .
And Google decided to take advantage of that fact .
Now that Microsoft is doing the same , it 's suddenly a big deal .
Cry me a river ...
Google has been pushing their toolbar for Internet Explorer very aggressively ever since information about Internet Explorer 7 was first available several months ago .
The writing was on the wall and they could see it as well as anyone .
If Google actually cared about user choice , they'd have asked the Mozilla Foundation to configure Firefox to prompt you to choose your favorite search engine the first time you ran it .
You know , a level playing field .
Did they do that ?
No !
Instead they bought their way into the default position with a revenue sharing deal .
And now they 're upset because they can't do the same with Internet Explorer .
Well , they can but they 're gonna have to pay OEMs like Dell , Gateway , HP , and so on .
That 's a lot of deal making and a lot more money that 'll hit their earnings in the form of TAC ( Traffic Acquisition Costs ) .
And let 's not forget about Safari , where Google is the default and it's very hard for normal people to change that .
I do n't know about you , but this whole " user choice " argument smells like a double standard to me .
Don seems to think so .
Did they think we were n't paying attention ?

The lethally inept response to Hurricane Katrina revealed to everyone that the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which earned universal praise during the Clinton years , is a shell of its former self .
The hapless Michael Brown -- who is no longer overseeing relief efforts but still heads the agency -- has become a symbol of cronyism .
But what we really should be asking is whether FEMA 's decline and fall is unique , or part of a larger pattern .
What other government functions have been crippled by politicization , cronyism and / or the departure of experienced professionals ?
How many FEMA 's are there ?
Unfortunately , it 's easy to find other agencies suffering from some version of the FEMA syndrome .
The first example wo n't surprise you : the Environmental Protection Agency , which has a key role to play in Hurricane Katrina 's aftermath , but which has seen a major exodus of experienced officials over the past few years .
In particular , senior officials have left in protest over what they say is the Bush administration 's unwillingness to enforce environmental law .
Yesterday The Independent , the British newspaper , published an interview about the environmental aftermath of Katrina with Hugh Kaufman , a senior policy analyst in the agency 's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response , whom one suspects is planning to join the exodus .
" The budget has been cut , " he said , " and inept political hacks have been put in key positions . "
That sounds familiar , and given what we 've learned over the last two weeks there 's no reason to doubt that characterization -- or to disregard his warning of an environmental cover - up in progress .
A couple weeks ago I went with a friend of mine to an " organic vegetarian restaurant . "
This was definitely my first mistake of the day .
The second came when I ordered a glass of red wine .
I figured if I was going to eat healthy , why not chase it down with some good old alcohol - just to balance out the experience .
I took a sip of the " organic " wine , and immediately cringed .
It tasted awful .
I gave my friend a sip , and she agreed that it had gone bad .
Up to that date , I had never returned a glass or bottle of wine .
Being unsure of whether a wine has definitely turned , I 've never wanted to be " that guy . "
You know the one - he takes a sip , then returns the bottle to show those around him how cool and sophisticated he is .
Anyway , I was pretty confident on this one .
I called over the overly tattooed and dread - locked waitress , and let her know .
She confirmed that the bottle had gone bad .
The experience at this restaurant got me thinking more and more about how an unsophisticated wine drinker like myself could identify if a wine has turned .
I 've searched the web , and found this awesome article by a guy named Jim Gordon .
I 've pasted the text below .
It 's a little long and wordy , but it 's a great summary of why a wine turns , and how to identity it .
I 've bold - ed some of the key points to make it easier to get through .
How to ... Know when a good wine has gone bad
by Jim Gordon
Here 's how to know the difference between a wine that just does n't suit you and one that should be poured down the drain .
Corked
The most common flaw in wine comes from a defective cork that infects the wine and turns the aroma to a mildewed , wet - cardboard smell and the taste to a flattened , dried out sensation .
The wine is called " corked " or " corky . "
Oxidized
The oxygen in air makes a good wine go bad in a day or two if an opened bottle is n't properly looked after .
An oxidized wine smells to me like stale bread or weak vinegar .
This a particular hazard with wines by the glass at restaurants , where half - empty bottles are often kept on the bar overnight .
Refrigeration helps , even for reds .
Cooked
Wine can be " cooked " if kept in hot attics or trunks , above stoves or in frugally minded corporate offices where the AC is turned off over the weekends .
It 's a slow simmer , but the wine gets ruined before long .
It will look brownish around the edges of the glass ( whether red or white ) and may smell caramelized .
If you also noticed that the cork in the bottle was pushed up and partway out , it 's probably cooked .
Going through malolactic
Winemakers put most red wines and many whites , especially Chardonnay , through a mild secondary transformation in addition to the yeast fermentation that turns them from grape juice into wine .
the conversion is called malolactic .
But if a winemaker is n't careful , the malolactic can happen after wine is bottled .
The result can vary from a mild effervescence to a totally stinky aroma and bizarre flavors .
One frequent sign is an unusually cloudy or hazy appearance .
Sulfury
Sulfur dioxide is added to virtually all wines in very small quantities to prevent oxidation and bacterial growth .
That 's why you see the note on the label that says " Contains Sulfides . "
Sulfur is a good thing in moderation , but if the winemaker goofs and adds too much , then the wine smells like matchsticks and can prickle the inside of your nostrils .
It 's not wise to drink it .
Another wrinkle on the sulfur problem is when a wine smells like rotten eggs .
Amazon and Yahoo have now both responded to Google 's subpoenas regarding their work on book digitization projects , and both have given the same basic response : you can see our confidential documents when you pry them from our cold , dead hands .
Amazon even went so far as to suggest that , instead of proprietary information , Google could learn all it needs to know from some press releases .
The current unpleasantness is a result of Google 's own legal difficulties with the Authors Guild , which is suing the search giant over its decision to digitize copyrighted books and make them a part of its Google Book Search project .
The Guild contends that this has to happen on an " opt - in " basis in which copyright owners must explicitly give Google permission to do the scanning and indexing .
Google claims that the current opt - out system is both fair and legal .
In its quest to prove its case , Google subpoenaed Amazon , Yahoo , and Microsoft at the beginning of October , seeking more information about their respective book projects .
Amazon already allows users to search inside of selected books on its website , while Yahoo and Microsoft are partners in the Open Content Alliance digitization project .
Both of these services rely on an opt - in approach to scanning copyrighted works , and Google demanded an incredible amount of information on each of them .
Amazon responded in late October that it had no intention of turning over most of the requested documents , and told Google that some of the information in question was " described on Amazon.com 's websites and in press releases . "
Yahoo has just filed its own objection to the subpoena , saying , " There is simply no need for Google to be peering into the minds and computers of Yahoo employees . "
As a result of the work done by all these companies , searching inside books has grown remarkably easy in the last few years — but searching inside your competitors ' confidential file cabinets remains difficult .
Update
Yahoo's even less pleased about the subpoenas than Amazon , judging by their response .
A copy of their legal filing seen by Ars Technica lays the smack on Google , saying that Yahoo " is not a party to the underlying action against Google relating to book scanning , does not have a book scanning program of its own , and has no information that is remotely relevant to the Google Action . "
It goes on to say , " Whether Yahoo may ever have considered developing a ' Book Project ' or Yahoo 's mental impressions about the copyright status of any book is not admissible or relevant with respect to Google 's pending dispute with book publishers . "
Bascially , Yahoo points out that they are a member of the Open Content Alliance , but that the group is a separate entity not under Yahoo's control .
The company " exercises no direction and control over the OCA 's operation of its project . "
The end result ?
Yahoo has no plans to give Google any documents , either .

So this is a critical moment .
We must do all we can to limit the civilizational fallout from this bombing .
But this is not going to be easy .
Why ?
Because unlike after 9/11 , there is no obvious , easy target to retaliate against for bombings like those in London .
There are no obvious terrorist headquarters and training camps in Afghanistan that we can hit with cruise missiles .
The Al Qaeda threat has metastasized and become franchised .
It is no longer vertical , something that we can punch in the face .
It is now horizontal , flat and widely distributed , operating through the Internet and tiny cells .
Because there is no obvious target to retaliate against , and because there are not enough police to police every opening in an open society , either the Muslim world begins to really restrain , inhibit and denounce its own extremists -- if it turns out that they are behind the London bombings -- or the West is going to do it for them .
And the West will do it in a rough , crude way -- by simply shutting them out , denying them visas and making every Muslim in its midst guilty until proven innocent .
And because I think that would be a disaster , it is essential that the Muslim world wake up to the fact that it has a jihadist death cult in its midst .
If it does not fight that death cult , that cancer , within its own body politic , it is going to infect Muslim - Western relations everywhere .
Only the Muslim world can root out that death cult .
It takes a village .
What do I mean ?
I mean that the greatest restraint on human behavior is never a policeman or a border guard .
The greatest restraint on human behavior is what a culture and a religion deem shameful .
It is what the village and its religious and political elders say is wrong or not allowed .
Many people said Palestinian suicide bombing was the spontaneous reaction of frustrated Palestinian youth .
But when Palestinians decided that it was in their interest to have a cease - fire with Israel , those bombings stopped cold .
The village said enough was enough .
The Muslim village has been derelict in condemning the madness of jihadist attacks .
When Salman Rushdie wrote a controversial novel involving the prophet Muhammad , he was sentenced to death by the leader of Iran .
To this day -- to this day -- no major Muslim cleric or religious body has ever issued a fatwa condemning Osama bin Laden .
Auschwitz - Birkenau : a report said one school was avoiding the issue E- mails are circulating , falsely claiming the UK has banned schools from teaching pupils about the Holocaust .
The suggestion is that this was done by the government to avoid offending some Muslim communities .
The source of the rumour may be a report that some history teachers were uncomfortable with sensitive subjects .
In fact the government has reaffirmed that in England , teaching children about the Holocaust is compulsory , and it is not banned elsewhere in the UK .
A number of people have contacted the BBC News website querying e-mails they have been sent .
One example is headed " In Memoriam " .
It says : " Recently this week , UK removed The Holocaust from its school curriculum because it ' offended ' the Moslem [ sic ] population which claims it never occurred . "
It adds : " This is a frightening portent of the fear that is gripping the world and how easily each country is giving into it . " ' Emotive '
The report that may have given rise to the alarm was commissioned by England 's Department for Education and Skills from the Historical Association , which promotes the study and teaching of history .
It said : " Teachers and schools avoid emotive and controversial history for a variety of reasons , some of which are well - intentioned .
" Staff may wish to avoid causing offence or appearing insensitive to individuals or groups in their classes .
" In particular settings , teachers of history are unwilling to challenge highly contentious or charged versions of history in which pupils are steeped at home , in their community or in a place of worship . "
' Holocaust denial '
The report gave as an example a history department in " a northern city " which " recently avoided selecting the Holocaust as a topic for GCSE coursework for fear of confronting anti-Semitic sentiment and Holocaust denial among some Muslim pupils " .
The government said there was scope for schools to make their own decisions on what to teach within England 's national curriculum .
But a spokesman for England 's Department for Education and Skills added : " Teaching of the Holocaust is already compulsory in schools at Key Stage 3 [ ages 11 to 14 ] .
" It will remain so in the new KS3 curriculum from September 2008 . "
He said Education Secretary Alan Johnson himself had stressed this .
There are separate national curriculums in Wales and in Northern Ireland , and 5 - 14 Guidelines in Scotland .
In those , Holocaust teaching is not compulsory but schools may teach it if they wish and this has not changed recently .
In Northern Ireland , for example , the Holocaust is given as an example of some of the things pupils " should " study .

" That 's a significant difference and I 'd imagine there are few men out there a little surprised and unimpressed that women have better luck without them , " said medical sex therapist Dr Jane Howard .
The findings come from the study What Does Sexuality Mean To Older Women ? , which assessed the sex lives of women in their 40s , 50s , 60s and 70s to find trends over the ages .
Dr Howard said she believed women on their own were better at achieving orgasm because they do n't have the " distraction " of having to please a man or subscribe to male - type sexual fantasies .
" Arousal is a lot about what erotic thoughts go through the mind , and for women that 's very different to men , " Dr Howard said .
" It may be focusing on Colin Firth 's smouldering eyes , some romantic novel or a waterfall or whatever . "
The therapist said the most outstanding aspect of the study was the variety of ways people lived their lives .
" Some people are in relationships and having sex , some are in relationships with no sex , others are single and are having sex ... it was just so varied , " Dr Howard said .
She said her results destroyed the cultural myth that people stay in life - long relationships and are sexually functional until they die .
" We like to think of people having wild sex for their whole lives but the reality is n't quite like that , " Dr Howard said .
More than 80 per cent of women in their 40s were sexually active , but this figure declined to 27 per cent for those in their 70s .
The fact that 70 per cent of men in their 70s were not capable of having an erection could affect this figure .
But results showed that three quarters of women over 70 were indifferent to sex .
While their libido dropped off and arousal was less , their capacity to orgasm was seemingly unaffected by age .
" That was quite surprising , actually , " Dr Howard said .
She said the results would help people understand the true impact that ageing had on sex .
The findings are part of the Longitudinal Assessment of Ageing in Women , conducted by the Royal Brisbane and Women 's Hospital .
Now , this perhaps is n't surprising for an organization that promotes a known hate group on its own Web site ( and even though we 've reported this repeatedly over the past year and a half , the hate group remains on the AFA Web site ) .
But still , call me naive , but being a Christian myself I always find it hard to believe that other people who claim to be Christians AND who claim to run Christian organizations would be such outright liars .
Alas , here we go again .
This time , the AFA is accusing the Democratic Party of something it did n't even do .
What , pray tell ?
Why of dissing Easter , of course .
You see , the AFA claims - and outright lies - that the Democrats issued an Easter proclamation that did n't mention that Easter is a Christian holiday .
In fact , the word " Christians " is right in the DNC release .
But look at what the AFA says in an email alert just broadcasted to their members :
[ T ]he Democratic Party has taken Christ and the Resurrection out of Easter ....
The DNC treated Easter as if was not unique to the Christian faith , and made it into a nondescript , universal , nonexclusive religious celebration celebrated by every religion in the world .
“ Easter Sunday is a joyful celebration .
The holiday represents peace , redemption and renewal , a theme which brings hope to people of all faiths .
During this time Christians are called to remember who they are as people of faith , and that even the greatest of evils will not have the last word .
It is also a time to reflect upon and be in solidarity with those who are persecuted and suffering among us .
We should also use this time to honor those who continue to make incredible sacrifices for us , including our brave men and women in the armed forces serving overseas during this holiday .
I would like to wish all those celebrating around the world this Sunday , a joyous Easter . ”
I remember during a weekly mandatory devotional at AFA , one top AFA executive made the statement that Catholics were not Christians ( being a Catholic ?
this was news to me ) .
Now I 'll quote in full what the DNC wrote , it 's quite lovely in fact :
See , quite a lovely proclamation .
And it clearly mentions Christians , by name , so how and why does the AFA claim that the Democrats have suddenly made Easter a non-Christian holiday ?
Read what the AFA wrote , " The DNC treated Easter as if was not unique to the Christian faith . "
That is an outright lie .
But again , the American Family Association is an organization that promotes the bigotry of a known hate group , so perhaps we should n't be surprised .
And , considering the recent charges of anti-Catholic bigotry leveled against the American Family Association by one of their former top lawyers , maybe the AFA should n't be casting the first stone .
And I quote their former lawyer
In fact , I spoke with the lawyer and he told me that the top AFA executive said that there were no Christians in Spain , everyone is Catholic .
Now who 's the bigot ?

War in Iraq is a " cause celebre " for jihadists , according to report
• Report says attacks could increase if " jihadist movement " grows
• Report says combating jihadists requires more than killing their leaders
• Dems , GOP disagree over meaning of NIE

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Islamist terrorists are adapting to global counterterrorism efforts , as the " jihadist movement " is becoming more decentralized and spawning offshoot organizations with anti-American agendas , according to a declassified intelligence document released Tuesday .
The movement lacks a global strategy , but new terror cells are likely to emerge , making it " harder to find and undermine jihadist groups , " states the National Intelligence Estimate on global terrorism trends .
The report adds that the U.S. - led Iraq war has become a " cause celebre for jihadists , breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement . "
If it is perceived that the jihadists in Iraq are succeeding , it will fuel more extremism , according to the report .
But if the jihadists are perceived to have failed , " we judge fewer fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight , " the report states .
Earlier Tuesday , President Bush angrily lambasted a media report that said the document asserted the Iraq war had increased the terrorist threat to the United States .
He added that media accounts of the leak of the intelligence report were meant to " create confusion in the minds of the American people " and promised to push Director of National Security John Negroponte to declassify the findings so " everyone can draw their own conclusions . "
( Watch Bush call critics of war ' naive ' -- 3:10 )
The NIE findings state that U.S. - led counterterrorism efforts have " seriously damaged " al Qaeda 's leadership and operations , but that the group still poses " the greatest threat to the homeland and U.S. interests . "
It adds that Muslims who describe themselves as jihadists are increasing in " number and geographic dispersion . "
" If this trend continues , threats to U.S. interests at home and abroad will become more diverse , leading to increasing attacks worldwide , " the report states .
Fighting jihad
The report credits four factors with facilitating the spread of the jihadist movement : 1 ) " entrenched grievances , such as corruption , injustice and fear of Western domination ; " 2 ) jihad in Iraq ; 3 ) the torpid pace of economic , social and political reforms in Muslim nations ; and 4 ) a " pervasive anti-U.S. sentiment among Muslims . "
The solution requires more than killing or capturing al Qaeda leaders , the estimate states , but " the loss of key leaders , particularly Osama bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri and [ Abu Musab ] al - Zarqawi , in rapid succession , probably would cause the group to fracture into smaller groups . "
The NIE was issued in April , several weeks before al Qaeda in Iraq leader al - Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. airstrike .
Among ways to combat the growing Islamist terror movement are exposing the jihadists ' radical ideology and urging respected Muslim leaders to denounce terrorist tactics , according to the report .
For instance , the idea of a government based in ultraconservative Islamic law , or Sharia , does n't sit well with the majority of Muslims , the report states .
Exposing the jihadists ' " ultimate political solution " would help divide jihadists " from the audiences they seek to persuade . "
Also , condemnations of violence by notable clerics signal a trend from terror to peaceful political activism , the report states .
The rejections of violence reduce " the ability of radicals to capitalize on passive community support .
In this way , the Muslim mainstream emerges as the most powerful weapon in the war on terror . "
The U.S. also must focus its efforts on stopping jihadists from obtaining chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear weapons , and on the increased use of the Internet to " communicate , propagandize , recruit , train and obtain logistical and financial support , " the report states .
The full findings are posted at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Web site .
( www.dni.gov ) .
Response mixed
Sen . Jay Rockefeller , D - West Virginia , said the NIE shows that the Iraq war has stretched the U.S. military too thin , reduced military readiness and misguided resources for the war on terror .
" The intelligence community -- all 16 agencies -- believes the war in Iraq has fueled terrorism , " he said in a statement .
" But it is the mistakes we made in Iraq -- the lack of planning , the mismanagement and the complete incompetence of our leadership -- that has done the most damage to our security . "
House Majority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , had a different take , saying the NIE shows the U.S. not only damaged and disrupted al Qaeda operations , but also " that U.S. success in Iraq is the key to ensuring that this terrorist threat does not grow . "
The diffusion of terrorists have made organizations like al Qaeda less effective " because President Bush and Republicans rightly chose to confront these challenges directly , seeking to destroy their sanctuaries , terrorist financing and planning networks , " Boehner said in a written statement .
On Tuesday , congressional Democrats put pressure on the administration to disclose more analysis by the intelligence community on Iraq and the new generation of Islamic terrorists .
( Watch Iraq at the center of a highly charged day in Washington -- 2:23 )
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D - California , asked that the chamber go into secret session to discuss the intelligence reports , something the House has not done since 1983 .
The proposal was denied by a vote of 171 - 217 along mostly party lines .
Senate Democrats also demanded Tuesday that Negroponte testify about the report and fully declassify not only the portion leaked over the weekend but also all intelligence estimates dealing with terrorism .
Rep. Jane Harman , the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , called on the White House to release a second , previously unknown national intelligence document that focuses solely on Iraq .
Harman says the document has been kept in draft form so that it wo n't be seen before midterm elections .
" I hear it paints a grim picture .
And because it does , I am told it is being held until after the November elections .
If this estimate is finished , it should not be stamped ' draft ' and hidden from the American people until after the elections , " Harman said in a statement .
White House homeland security adviser Frances Townsend denied the claim , saying the report in question was commissioned in August and wo n't be complete until January .
CNN 's Andrea Koppel and Ted Barrett contributed to this report .
A recent movie , ‘ Thank You for Smoking ‘ , amusingly highlighted the lengths that PR reps for the tobacco companies would go to distort the public discourse on the health effects of smoking .
Lest you thought that was of merely historical relevance , we would like to draw your attention to two of the funniest videos around .
Lifting a page straight out of the Nick Naylor playbook , the CEI ( an industry - funded lobby group ) has launched a new ad campaign that is supposed to counteract all those pesky scientific facts about global warming .
The first ad ( both available here ) deserves to become a classic of the genre .
It contains the immortal lines ‘ CO 2 : they call it pollution , we call it Life ! ’ – it is beyond parody and without content – and so you should definitely see it .
The second ad has a little more substance – but is as misleading as you might expect .
They only discuss one scientific point which relates to whether ‘ glaciers are melting ’ .
Unsurprisingly , they do n’t discuss the dramatic evidence of tropical glacier melting , the almost worldwide retreat of other mountain glaciers , the rapid acceleration of fringing glaciers on Greenland or the Antarctic peninsula .
Neither do they mention that the preliminary gravity measurements imply that both Antarctica and Greenland appear to be net contributors to sea level rise .
No .
The only studies that they highlight are ones which demonstrate that in the interior of the ice shelves , there is actually some accumulation of snow ( which clearly balances some of the fringing loss ) .
These studies actually confirm climate model predictions that as the poles warm , water vapour there will increase and so , in general , will precipitation .
In the extreme environments of the central ice sheets , it will not get warm enough to rain and so snowfall and accumulation are expected to increase .
To be sure , calculating the net balance of the ice sheets is difficult and given the uncertainties of different techniques ( altimeters , gravity measurements , interferometers etc. ) and the shortness of many of the records , it ’s difficult to make very definitive statements about the present day situation .
Our sense of the data is that Greenland is probably losing mass – the rapid wasting around the edge is larger than the accumulation in the center , whereas Antarctica in toto is a more difficult call .
However , one should step back a bit from what has been going on in recent years , and consider what is likely to happen in the future .
The last time the planet may have been a degree or so warmer than today ( about 120,000 years ago ) , sea level was around 5 to 6 meters higher – and that water must have come from Greenland and ( probably ) the West Antarctic ice sheet .
With projected future rises in emissions of ‘ Life ! ‘ ( though we like to call it ‘ carbon dioxide ’ ) , these sorts of temperature rises are clearly possible , and the danger that would eventually pose to the continued existence of some ice sheets is clearly cause for concern .
To summarise , while CEI clearly demonstrate that their job ( paraphrasing Nick Naylor again ) “ requires a certain …. moral flexibility ” , the rest of us can be grateful for the amusement they appear to have accidentally bestowed on the world .

Abstract
Infant male circumcision continues despite growing questions about its medical justification .
As usually performed without analgesia or anaesthetic , circumcision is observably painful .
It is likely that genital cutting has physical , sexual and psychological consequences too .
Some studies link involuntary male circumcision with a range of negative emotions and even post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
Some circumcised men have described their current feelings in the language of violation , torture , mutilation and sexual assault .
In view of the acute as well as long - term risks from circumcision and the legal liabilities that might arise , it is timely for health professionals and scientists to re-examine the evidence on this issue and participate in the debate about the advisability of this surgical procedure on unconsenting minors .

Background to circumcision
" To circumcise ( from the Latin , " to cut around " ) means to cut off part or all of the foreskin of a penis , permanently exposing the normally covered glans ... "
( Boyd , 1998 , p. 13 ) .
Circumcision involves the amputation of both layers of the foreskin , and is often performed on baby boys a few days after birth ( Ritter & Denniston , 1996 ) .
The inner layer of the foreskin comprises thousands of erogenous nerve endings ( Taylor , Lockwood , & Taylor , 1996 ; Cold & Taylor , 1999 ; Cold & McGrath , 1999 ) .
Moses Maimónides ( 1135 - 1204 ) , known as the " Rambam , " was a medieval Jewish rabbi , physician and philosopher who stated unequivocally that the real purpose of circumcision was to reduce sexual gratification .
According to Maimónides ( see 1963 translation , p. 609 ) ,
Similarly with regard to circumcision , one of the reasons for it is , in my opinion , the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question , so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible ...
In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting what is defective congenitally , but to perfecting what is defective morally .
The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision .
None of the activities necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed thereby , nor is procreation rendered impossible , but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are diminished .
The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable .
For if at birth this member has been made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from it , it must indubitably be weakened .
In the English speaking world , circumcision was introduced as a medical procedure in the late - nineteenth century ( Hodges , 1997 ) .
Victorian notions about the " ills of masturbation " influenced some physicians to endorse amputation of the erotogenic foreskin as " preventative therapy " since circumcised boys could not use their foreskins for masturbation ( Moscucci , 1996 ) .
Circumcision subsequently was accepted as a panacea for many conditions , including epilepsy , paralysis , malnutrition , " derangement of the digestive organs , " chorea , convulsions , hysteria , and other nervous disorders ( Gollaher , 2000 ) .
In the ensuing decades , as each claimed benefit of circumcision was disputed , another would come to take its place ( Hodges , 1997 ) .
Various national medical associations have evaluated studies on therapeutic rationales for infant circumcision under standard surgical conditions and management ( see Denniston , Hodges , & Milos , 1999 , for example ) .
However , no national medical association anywhere in the world that has studied the issue recommends routine circumcision ( American Academy of Pediatrics , 1999 ; Australasian Association of Paediatric Surgeons , 1996 ; Australian College of Paediatrics , 1996 ; British Medical Association , 1996 ; Canadian Paediatric Society , 1996 ) .
Recently , the American Medical Association ( 2000 ) has gone even further , confirming that infant circumcision is non-therapeutic .
It is now generally acknowledged that any potential medical benefits of routine circumcision are outweighed by its risks and drawbacks ( AAP , 1999 ) .
Although approximately 80 - 85 % of the world 's adult males remain genitally intact ( Lang , 1986 ; Wallerstein , 1985 ; Williams & Kapila , 1993 ) , an estimated 650 million males alive today nevertheless have been circumcised ( Hammond , 1999 ) .
In the United States alone , each year 1.2 million males are circumcised shortly after birth ( National Center for Health Statistics , 1998 ) .
In addition , the social anthropological literature on ritual circumcision in non-western cultures ( see Gollaher , 2000 ) indicates that circumcision of boys during late childhood also is commonplace .
Objections to circumcision have been articulated for a while ( e.g. , Wallerstein , 1980 ) with increasing concerns coming from the professional mental health community ( e.g. , Boyle , 2000 ; Goldman , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .
There is also mounting anxiety about issues of legal liability ( see Boyle , Svoboda , Price , & Turner , 2000 ; Richards , 1996 ; Smith , 1998 ; Somerville , 2000 ; Svoboda , Van Howe , & Dwyer , 2000 ; Van Howe , Svoboda , Dwyer , & Price , 1999 ) .
Moreover , Giannetti ( 2000 ) has pointed to psychosexual sequelae that appear to go well beyond those acknowledged in the recent American Academy of Pediatrics ( 1999 ) circumcision policy statement .
The present paper recounts many of these concerns .
Evidence for both short - and long - term manifestations of circumcision are reviewed .
Among the sequelae considered are pain , problems in sexual functioning , and emotional distress or trauma -- all factors that impact on men's psychosexual health and well - being .
Circumcision pain
One of the fundamental issues that divides opinion on the practice of circumcision regards the presence or degree of pain .
To address this issue , we turn to the concept of pain and the evidence for pain sensitivity in infants .
As defined by scientists , pain is an unpleasant sensory experience associated with tissue damage ( IASP , 1986 ) .
There is no doubt that circumcision entails observable pain and identifiable tissue damage ( see joint statement of American Academy of Pediatrics and American Pain Society ( American Academy of Pediatrics , 2001 ) .
The only matter of some interpretation is the infant 's behaviour during circumcision .
As with adults , pain in infants is expressed in stereotypic ways involving vocalisation , facial expression , body movements , and autonomic activity .
Analysing the vocalisations of 30 newborn males during circumcisions of varying levels of invasiveness , Porter , Miller , and Marshall ( 1986 ) found that the invasiveness of the procedure was positively correlated with duration of crying , more pronounced peak fundamental frequencies , reduced harmonics , and greater variability of the fundamental .
Crying extended to a day after circumcision and was interrupted by greater periods of quiet when anaesthesia was provided ( Dixon , Snyder , Holve , & Bromberger , 1984 ) .
It is also notable that adult listeners agreed on the urgency of these cries as a function of the intensity of the pain - producing stimulus .
Levine and Gordon ( 1982 ) reviewed literature on the spectrographic analysis of pain - induced vocalisations ( PIV ) in infants and found remarkable similarity with the basic features of PIV in animals .
Despite the obvious unavailability of self - report , further evidence of pain has been demonstrated through observation of the facial expressions of infants undergoing circumcision .
Regarded as the most definitive behavioural evidence of pain in the infant , it consists of a lowered brow , eyes squeezed shut , deepened nasolabial furrow , opened mouth , and a taut cupped tongue ( Grunau , Johnston , & Craig , 1990 ) .
This expression closely resembles the adult facial expression of pain , but it occurs with even greater consistency in infants undergoing painful procedures such as circumcision .
Infants also evidence considerable autonomic arousal during noxious stimulation .
Of course , this generalises to other situations such as fear and frustration too .
However , in combination with the facial and vocal evidence , such arousal is highly informative about the pain the infant is undergoing .
For example , Porter , Porges , and Marshall ( 1988 ) observed that vagal tone significantly declined during circumcision , a result which was paralleled by significant increases in pitch of the infant 's cries .
The further discovery that vagal tone prior to circumcision predicted physiological reactivity to subsequent stress leaves little doubt that circumcision is highly noxious to the infant .
With regard to motor behaviour , infants tend to be a bit more limited than adults in responding to noxious stimuli ( Tyler , 1988 ) .
This has occasionally been mistaken as an indication that infants experience less pain than adults .
However , the infant 's overall rigidity of the torso and limbs are indicative of pain ( Johnston & Strada , 1986 ) .
With increasing age and postnatal maturation of the somatosensory system , there is greater motor responsiveness to pain - producing stimuli like circumcision .
Pain pathways are well - developed late in gestation and neurochemical systems associated with pain transmission are functional ( Anand & Hickey , 1987 ) .
Many scientists ( e.g. , Field , 1995 ; Fitzgerald , 1987 ) have stated that we should now safely assume that all viable newborns feel pain .
What is more critical is how pain is modulated in infancy .
Andrews and Fitzgerald ( 1997 ) have reviewed the neurobiological evidence suggesting that the relative immaturity of the infant 's nervous system may raise excitability in the spinal cord .
Thus , the system for modulation of pain signals appears to be less developed in infants and this may render them highly susceptible to pain during procedures such as circumcision ( Fitzgerald , 1998 ) .
Moreover , cognitive coping strategies ( Fernandez , 1986 ; Fernandez & Turk , 1989 ; Maiz & Fernandez , 2000 ) and other descending cortical influences postulated as part of the gate control theory of pain ( Melzack & Wall , 1965 ) evidently are far less developed in infancy than later in life .
The pain that is apparent in circumcised infants and is intensified by their lack of coping resources can have further ramifications .
Prescott ( 1989 ) referred to the stress hormones triggered by intense pain and the adverse effects they may exert on brain development , sexual function , and behaviour .
Anand and Scalzo ( 2000 ) postulated that severe pain during infancy may permanently and irreversibly alter neurological circuitry responsible for pain perception and memory .
Hepper ( 1996 ) documented functioning memory prior to and immediately after birth .
An adverse painful perinatal event , through a process of classical conditioning , may sensitise the infant to pain later in life ( Chamberlain , 1989 , 1995 ; Field , 1995 ; Jacobson et al. , 1990 ) .
Thus , Taddio et al. ( 1997 ) found that circumcised boys displayed heightened physiological pain responses to vaccinations four to six months after circumcision suggestive of an infant analogue of post - traumatic stress disorder , as compared with genitally intact children .
Circumcision trauma
A traumatic experience is defined in DSM - IV as the direct consequence of experiencing or witnessing of serious injury or threat to physical integrity that produces intense fear , helplessness or ( in the case of children ) agitation ( American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) .
The significant pain and distress described earlier is consistent with this definition .
Moreover , the disturbance ( e.g. , physiological arousal , avoidant behaviour ) qualifies for a diagnosis of acute stress disorder if it lasts at least two days or even a diagnosis of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) if it lasts more than a month .
Circumcision without anaesthesia constitutes a severely traumatic event in a child 's life ( Lander , Brady - Freyer , Metcalfe , Nazerali , & Muttit , 1997 ; Ramos & Boyle , 2001 ; Taddio , Katz , Ilersich , & Koren , 1997 ) .
It is possible that the trauma of genital surgery might have long - lasting psychological effects ( Bigelow , 1995 ; Levy , 1945 ; Jacobson & Bygdeman , 1998 ; Anand & Scalzo , 2000 ) .
Van Howe ( 1996 , p. 431 ) reported that , " Newborn males respond to circumcision with a marked reduction in oxygenation during the procedure , a cortisol surge , decreased wakefulness , increased vagal tone , and less interactions with their environment following the procedure ... "
Rhinehart ( 1999 ) in a report of clinical cases noted that the only response available to the infant is shock , wherein the central nervous system is overwhelmed by pain , followed by numbing , paralysis , and dissociation .
Possibly , dissociation of the traumatic experience and emotional pain may be employed by the infant as a psychological defence ( Chu & Dill , 1990 ; Noyes , 1977 ; Rhinehart , 1999 ) .
While some babies have been described as being " quiet " after circumcision , Rhinehart concluded that the observed stillness most likely represents a state of dissociation or shock in response to the overwhelming pain .
Consistent with the early reports of Anna Freud ( 1952 ) , McFadyen ( 1998 ) observed psychological trauma in her son following circumcision .
This is sometimes extreme enough to impede the maternal - infant bonding ( Marshall et al. , 1982 ; Van Howe , 1996 ) .
As reasoned by Herman ( 1992 ) and Rhinehart ( 1999 ) the common factor underlying circumcision trauma is an experience of violence and powerlessness -- inflicted by other human beings .
Such an event was described in a study of 12 Turkish boys circumcised in late childhood .
Cansever ( 1965 , p. 328 ) reported that " Circumcision is perceived by the child as an aggressive attack upon his body , which damaged , mutilated , and , in some cases , totally destroyed him . "
Ritual circumcision appeared to be associated with increased aggressiveness , weakening of the ego , withdrawal , reduced functioning and adaptation , and nightmares consistent with PTSD .
Ramos and Boyle ( 2001 ) investigated the psychological effects associated with medical and ritual " operation tuli " circumcision procedures in the Philippines .
Some 1577 boys aged 11 to 16 years ( 1072 boys circumcised under medical procedures ; 505 subjected to ritual circumcision ) were surveyed to see if genital cutting led to the development of PTSD .
Interestingly , Mezey and Robbins ( 2001 ) estimated the incidence of PTSD as 1.0 % to 7.8 % in the general British population where circumcision is not very prevalent .
On the other hand , using the PTSD - I questionnaire ( Watson et al. , 1991 ) in a predominantly circumcised population , Ramos and Boyle observed an incidence of PTSD of almost 70 % among boys subjected to ritual circumcision , and 51 % among boys subjected to medical circumcision ( with local anaesthetic ) .
Long - term follow - up would be needed to gauge the extent to which PTSD persists over the lifespan of these circumcised boys .
The outcome of painful childhood trauma includes long - lasting neurophysiological and neurochemical brain changes ( Anand & Carr , 1989 ; Anand & Scalzo , 2000 ; Ciaranello , 1983 ; Taddio et al. , 1997 ; van der Kolk & Saporta , 1991 ) .
Richards , Bernal , and Brackbill ( 1976 ) found that circumcision may impact adversely on the developing brain , and that reported " gender differences " may actually arise from behavioural changes induced by infant or childhood circumcision .
Rhinehart ( 1999 ) in a report of adult clinical cases concluded that a man circumcised as a child is more likely to react with terror , rage and / or dissociation when confronted with situations interpreted as threatening .
As in any situation of post - traumatic stress , an event resembling any aspect of the original traumatic experience is more likely to provoke negative emotions such as panic , rage , violence , or dissociation .
It is therefore not surprising that PTSD may result from childhood circumcision ( Goldman , 1997 , 1999 , Menage , 1999 ; Ramos & Boyle , 2001 ) , just as it does from childhood sexual abuse and rape ( Bownes , O'Gorman , & Sayers , 1991 ; Deblinger , McLeer , & Henry , 1990 ; Duddle , 1991 ) .
Several researchers have concluded that PTSD may result from circumcision and / or from circumcision - related sequelae in later life .
For example , Rhinehart ( 1999 ) reported finding PTSD in middle - aged men who had been subjected to infant circumcision .
Circumcision involves an imbalance of power between perpetrator and victim , contains both aggressive and libidinal elements , and threatens a child 's sexual integrity by amputating part of the genitalia .
Some men circumcised in infancy or childhood without their consent have described their present feelings in the language of violation , torture , mutilation , and sexual assault ( Bigelow , 1995 ; Hammond , 1997 , 1999 ) .
Even if the psychological sequelae of circumcision do not coalesce into a formal diagnosis of PTSD , it is possible that there may be long - lasting effects on a man 's life , particularly in psychologically sensitive individuals with comorbidity factors ( cf. Mezey & Robbins , 2001 ) .
Presumably responding to their current interpretation and feelings , many circumcised men who have recognised the loss of a highly erogenous , irreplaceable part of their penis have reported long - lasting emotional suffering , grief , anxiety , and depression , and a sense of personal vulnerability ( Hammond , 1997 , 1999 ) .
Avoidance or obsessive preoccupation with such a loss , along with anger , can be difficult to reconcile for some men depending on their particular personality ( Bigelow , 1995 ; Maguire , 1998 ; van der Kolk , 1989 ) .
Emotional numbing , avoidance of the topic of circumcision , and anger are potential long - term psychological consequences of the circumcision trauma ( Bigelow , 1995 ; Bensley & Boyle , 2001 ; Boyle & Bensley , 2001 ; Gemmell & Boyle , 2001 ; Goldman , 1997 , 1999 ) .
In extreme cases , there might be aggressive , violent , and / or suicidal behaviour ( Anand & Scalzo , 2000 ; Bradley , Oliver , & Chernick , 1998 ; Jacobson et al. , 1987 ; Jacobson & Bygdeman , 1998 ) .
Circumcision and sexuality
Sigmund Freud ( 1920 ) asserted that circumcision was a substitute for castration , suggesting a possible connection between castration fears , neuroses , and circumcision .
Documented cases exist of circumcision resulting in a life - impairing level of castration anxiety ( Ozturk , 1973 ) .
More recently , Immerman and Mackey ( 1998 ) described circumcision as " low - grade neurological castration . "
They argued that the resultant glans keratinisation and neurological atrophy of sexual brain circuitry ( due to loss of sensory input to the brain 's pleasure centre ) may serve as a social control mechanism which produces a male who is less sexually excitable and therefore more amenable to social conditioning .
Indeed , for centuries , circumcision has been used as a strategy to reduce sexual gratification ( Maimónides , 1963 , p. 609 ) .
According to Saperstein ( 1980 ) , quoting Rabbi Isaac Ben Yedaiah , as well as the empirical findings of Bensley and Boyle ( 2001 ) , and O'Hara and O'Hara ( 1999 ) , heterosexual intercourse is less satisfying for both partners when the man is circumcised .
Due to the neurological injury caused by circumcision , and the resultant reduction of sensory feedback ( Immerman & Mackey , 1998 ) , it is highly likely that circumcision may promote sexual dysfunction such as premature ejaculation , and consequently , also the reduction of female sexual pleasure ( cf. Money & Davison , 1983 ) .
The possible deleterious effects on social and marital relationships ( cf. Hughes , 1990 ) may be considerable , especially in countries where most men have been circumcised .
Structural Changes
Among the structural changes circumcised men may have to live with are surgical complications such as skin tags , penile curvature due to uneven foreskin removal , pitted glans , partial glans ablation , prominent / jagged scarring , amputation neuromas , fistulas , severely damaged frenulum , meatal stenosis , and excessive keratinisation .
In addition , Immerman and Mackey ( 1998 ) and Prescott ( 1989 ) postulated that severing of erogenous sensory nerve endings in the foreskin during infancy leads to atrophy of non-stimulated neurons in the brain 's pleasure centre during the critical developmental period .
Gemmell and Boyle ( 2001 ) surveyed 162 self - selected men ( 121 circumcised ; 41 intact ) and found that circumcised men reported significantly less penile sensation as compared with genitally intact men .
Participants rated their current level of penile sensation ( on a scale from 1 to 10 ) as compared with that experienced at age 18 years ( allocated 10 out of 10 ) .
Circumcised men complained significantly more often than did genitally intact men of a progressive decline in penile sensation throughout their adult years -- presumably due to increasing keratinisation of the exposed glans and inner foreskin remnant in circumcised men .
Gemmell and Boyle also found that a significantly higher proportion of circumcised as compared with intact men reported bowing or curvature of the penis ( also reported by Lawrence , 1997 ) , shaft skin uncomfortably / painfully tight when erect , and scars / damage to the penis .
Although the frenulum was reported as an area of heightened erogenous sensitivity , in the typical circumcised male , either no frenulum remains or only a small severely damaged remnant exists .
The complex innervation of the foreskin and frenulum has been well - documented ( Cold & McGrath , 1999 ; Cold & Taylor , 1999 ; Fleiss , 1997 ; Taylor et al. , 1996 ) , and the genitally intact male has thousands of fine touch receptors and other highly erogenous nerve endings -- many of which are lost to circumcision , with an inevitable reduction in sexual sensation experienced by circumcised males ( Immerman & Mackey , 1998 ; O'Hara & O'Hara , 1999 ) .
Functional Changes
There are also serious functional consequences of circumcision .
Impaired sexual functioning was reported by 84 % of respondents in a survey of circumcised men ( Hammond , 1997 ) .
Taylor , Lockwood , and Taylor ( 1996 ) provided anatomical and histological support for these self - reports of circumcised men by documenting the irreplaceable loss of specialised erogenous mucosa through circumcision .
Further difficulties attributed to circumcision included intimacy problems ( 45 % ) and addiction / dependency problems ( 26 % ) .
Specific physical problems reported included glans insensitivity ( 55 % ) , need for excess stimulation to enable ejaculation ( 38 % ) , prominent scarring ( 29 % ) , and insufficient residual shaft skin to accommodate full , untethered erections ( 27 % ) .
Circumcised males may also be at risk of premature ejaculation , or alternatively may have to resort to prolonged thrusting during intercourse in order to stimulate sufficiently the residual erogenous penile nerve endings to trigger ejaculation ( Bensley & Boyle , 2001 ) .
They report that the unnatural dryness of their circumcised penis often makes coitus painful , resulting in chafing and / or skin abrasions ( Gemmell & Boyle , 2001 ) .
Concomitantly , O'Hara and O'Hara ( 1999 ) found that female partners reported significantly greater sexual pleasure from intercourse with genitally intact men as compared with circumcised men .
Money and Davison ( 1983 ) had previously documented a loss of stretch receptors in the prepuce and frenulum and an associated diminution in sexual response , thereby restricting a circumcised man 's ability to achieve arousal .
Consequently , erectile dysfunction may be a complication of male circumcision ( Glover , 1929 ; Ozkara , Asicioglu , Alici , Akkus , & Hattat , 1999 ; Palmer & Link , 1979 ; Stief , Thon , Djamilian , Allhoff , & Jonas , 1992 ; Stinson , 1973 ) .
Bensley and Boyle ( 2001 ) surveyed women and gay men who had previously had sexual intercourse with both genitally intact and circumcised men .
Bensley and Boyle 's samples comprised 35 women , and 42 gay men .
In addition they surveyed 83 self - selected men ( 53 circumcised ; 30 genitally intact ) who provided self - reports regarding their sexual and psychological functioning .
The overall results ( women partners and gay male partners combined ) were that circumcised partners were significantly less happy about their sexual functioning than were genitally intact partners .
In Bensley and Boyle 's ( 2001 ) study , sexual dysfunction was more often reported by circumcised men who complained either of premature ejaculation ( with little sexual sensation ) , and / or difficulty in gaining or maintaining an erection -- the two most prevalent forms of erectile dysfunction .
Reduced or insufficient neural feedback may account for circumcised men's inability to detect the moment when ejaculation is imminent .
Premature ejaculation previously has been ascribed to learning or conditioning factors .
For example , where a teenage boy is raised in an environment in which sexual pleasure is regarded as " sinful or dirty " he may have to hurry masturbation in order to avoid being " caught in the act . "
Premature ejaculation would therefore be negatively reinforced by avoiding an aversive or punitive consequence ( cf. Schwartz & Reisberg , 1991 , pp. 121-122 ) .
However , information is now emerging on the role of the prepuce in preventing premature ejaculation , wherein the foreskin serves to protect the corona of the glans penis from direct stimulation during intercourse ( Halata & Munger , 1986 ; Zwang , 1997 ) .
Overall , circumcised men expressed significantly greater dissatisfaction with their sex lives than did genitally intact men .
This result is consistent with the findings by Hammond ( 1997 , 1999 ) , and O'Hara and O'Hara ( 1999 ) , that circumcision may impede psychosexual and emotional intimacy between partners .
Altered Sexual Behaviours
Apart from reducing sexual sensation and pleasure ( Bensley & Boyle , 2001 ; Gemmell & Boyle , 2001 ; Immerman & Mackey , 1998 ; Milos & Macris , 1994 ; Money & Davison , 1983 ; O'Hara & O'Hara , 1999 ) , circumcision also leads to changes in sexual practices .
For example , Laumann , Masi , and Zuckerman ( 1997 ) reported that circumcision is associated with more elaborate sexual behaviours .
It is possible that reduced sexual sensation may impel some circumcised men to engage in more elaborate sexual practices in order to attain sexual gratification .
In regard to unsafe sex practices , Bensley and Boyle ( 2001 ) found that circumcised men were significantly less likely to use condoms than were genitally intact men .
Presumably , use of a condom reduces sexual sensation , which may be of somewhat greater concern to circumcised men ( cf. Gemmell & Boyle , 2001 ; Van Howe , 1999 ) .
Other psychological considerations in circumcised men
In Gemmell and Boyle 's ( 2001 ) survey , involuntary circumcision impacted negatively on various psychological measures .
They found that as compared with genitally intact men , circumcised men were often unhappy about being circumcised , experienced significant anger , sadness , feeling incomplete , cheated , hurt , concerned , frustrated , abnormal , and violated ( cf. Hammond , 1999 ) .
They also found that circumcised men reported lower self - esteem than did genitally intact respondents .
Rhinehart ( 1999 ) stated that psychological problems were almost universally noted by his self - selected circumcised respondents .
These included reports of a sense of personal powerlessness , fears of being overpowered and victimised , lack of trust , a sense of vulnerability to violent attack , guardedness in relationships , reluctance to have relationships with women , defensiveness , diminished sense of masculinity , feeling damaged , sense of reduced penile size or amputation , low self - esteem , shame about not " measuring up , " anger and violence towards women , irrational rage reactions , addictions and dependencies , difficulties in establishing intimate relationships , emotional numbing , a need for greater intensity in sexual experiences , decreased intimacy , decreased ability to communicate , as well as feelings of not being understood .
Hammond 's ( 1997 ) sample of circumcised men reported emotional harm ( 83 % ) , physical harm ( 82 % ) , general psychological harm ( 75 % ) , and low self - esteem ( 74 % ) .
The circumcised men frequently reported feeling mutilated ( 62 % ) , unwhole ( 61 % ) , resentful ( 60 % ) , abnormal / unnatural ( 60 % ) , that one 's human rights had been infringed ( 60 % ) , angry ( 54 % ) , frustrated ( 53 % ) , violated ( 50 % ) , inferior to genitally intact males ( 47 % ) , impeded sexually ( 43 % ) , and betrayed by one 's parents ( 34 % ) .
Similar findings emerged from a larger sample of 546 circumcised men studied by Hammond ( 1999 ) .
Anecdotal Accounts of Circumcision - Related Psychological Distress
Circumcised men have often provided anecdotal reports pertaining to their negative feelings about involuntary circumcision .
For example , one man who contacted one of the authors ( RG ) at the Circumcision Resource Center in Boston told of an indelible scene when he was four .
He was talking with a genitally intact boy who showed him his penis and explained circumcision to him .
He was shocked and ashamed at what had been done to him and thought , " Why would somebody want to do that to me ?
They just chopped it off .
It did n't make any sense to me . "
As an adult he thinks about it " every time I take a shower or urinate " ( personal communication , December , 1993 ) .
Another example of discovering the difference between being genitally intact as compared with being circumcised is the following retrospective anecdotal story also told to the same author ( RG ) :
The shock and surprise of my life came when I was in junior high school , and I was in the showers after gym ...
I wondered what was wrong with those penises that looked different than mine ...
I soon realized I had part of me removed .
I felt incomplete and very frustrated when I realized that I could never be like I was when I was born - intact .
That frustration is with me to this day .
Throughout life I have regretted my circumcision .
Daily I wish I were whole ( personal communication , October , 1992 ) .
Likewise , an Australian man recently wrote to another author ( GB ) at Bond University :
I have been disadvantaged by inferiority and non-assertiveness in the workplace and in social life so much that I recently had to go onto a disability pension for chronic anxiety / anger disorder .
My lifelong psychological distress of being circumcised definitely contributed strongly to steering me into this pattern of human interaction .
I have no spare funds to take individual legal action , and no living person to sue for my poor quality of life , but if ever a class action for damages due to circumcision is mounted , I wish to add my name to it ( personal communication , April , 2001 ) .
Many similar anecdotal stories by circumcised men telling about psychological unhappiness that they perceived to be related to involuntary circumcision have been reported , for example , by Bigelow ( 1995 ) and Goldman ( 1997 ) .
Methodological caveats
Sampling
One limitation of some of the foregoing research is that random sampling was not always enforced in subject recruitment ( e.g. , Rhinehart , 1999 ; Hammond , 1997 , 1999 ) .
This may be understandable because of the difficulties in boosting sample sizes and the fact that participants were sometimes confined to certain " captive groups . "
In any case , the result is that there may be a self - selection bias as widely noted in survey research .
Arguably , this could have led to inflation of some statistical effects of circumcision - related sequelae .
Underestimation
Conversely , it is possible that problems related to circumcision may be greater than reported .
The following speculations may explain why we do n't hear more from many circumcised men about how they may truly feel ( see Goldman , 1998 , pp. 43 - 44 ) :
The pressure to accept sociocultural assumptions regarding circumcision may prevent some men from recognising and feeling dissatisfaction .
For example , some men were told when young that circumcision was necessary for health reasons and they did not question that assertion .
In countries where circumcision is commonplace , its effects may become familiar and it is possible that these effects may be interpreted as " normal " ( Bigelow , 1995 ; Goldman , 1997 ) .
Verbal expression of preverbal feelings requires conscious awareness .
Because preverbal traumas are generally unconscious , such feelings are expressed nonverbally through behavioural , emotional , and physiological forms ( Chamberlain , 1989 ; Terr , 1988 , 1991 ; van der Kolk , 1989 ) .
Any negative emotions associated with circumcision that may emerge into the conscious psyche may be very intense and disturbing .
Repressing such emotions may serve to protect men from possible anguish .
This may be compounded by the fear of dismissal or ridicule of one 's feelings .
If negative thoughts and / or feelings do momentarily become conscious , it is likely they will be suppressed .
Privacy surrounding matters of sexuality may inhibit men from speaking out .
Nonverbal expression , lack of awareness and understanding of possible psychosexual sequelae related to circumcision , emotional repression , and fear of disclosure may help to keep circumcision feelings a secret .
It is conceivable that the effects of circumcision trauma might become chronic and deeply embedded within the unconscious psyche , making it difficult to distinguish them from personality traits or effects due to other causes .
In any case , more research is needed to address the conscious and unconscious psychological effects of circumcision on men .
Cognitive dissonance
Although in recent years cognitive dissonance theory has fallen somewhat into disrepute ( Walker , Burnham , & Borland , 1994 , p. 535 ) , the theory may still be useful in explaining certain entrenched attitudes surrounding circumcision .
Thus , the common resistance of some parents and doctors to information associating circumcision with harm invites speculation to explain it .
Generally , people have a desire for coherence and consistency in their beliefs and experiences and it is possible that this factor may contribute to some extent to the perpetuation of cognitions supportive of circumcision .
When inconsistency occurs , thereby creating cognitive dissonance , people may align their beliefs to fit their experience ( Festinger & Carlsmith , 1959 ) .
Choosing to seek or to provide parental consent and then to circumcise or to allow one 's child to be circumcised is a serious and irreversible choice .
In accordance with cognitive dissonance theory , it would be expected that once the decision has been made and the circumcision carried out , most people would tend to appreciate the chosen alternative ( circumcision ) and depreciate the rejected alternative ( leaving the child genitally intact ) --( cf. Brehm , 1956 ) .
As a result , beliefs may be adopted to conform with one 's decision to circumcise .
An example of these beliefs involving the psychological defence mechanisms of denial and rationalisation is the myth that newborn infants do not feel or remember pain .
Even though studies suggest long - lasting memory of circumcision pain -- particularly when the circumcision occurred during post - infancy childhood years ( Chamberlain , 1989 ; Hepper , 1996 ; Rhinehart , 1999 ) , some doctors who circumcise normal healthy boys may simply ignore this information ( Stang & Snellman , 1998 ) .
As well , a small proportion of doctors may proceed with the surgery on the basis of ill - informed beliefs .
Others , by invoking psychological defences , may be perceptually blind to the pain associated with circumcision -- perhaps as a result of their own circumcised status .
Inconsistency can also be reconciled by altering our beliefs .
A common misconception is that the prepuce has no useful purpose .
One circumcision advocate stated , " I believe the foreskin is a mistake of nature " ( Wiswell , 1994 ) .
We may perceive and accept only information that fits our beliefs .
Some physicians who support circumcision dismiss outright new information that conflicts with their preconceived view ( Briggs , 1985 ) .
The tendency to avoid new information increases when the discrepancy between beliefs and experience increases ( Kumpf & Gotz - Marchand , 1973 ) .
Even after learning something new , people better remember information that supports established beliefs than they remember conflicting information ( O'Sullivan & Durso , 1984 ) .
Avoidance of new information about the possible psychosexual sequelae of circumcision may lead to rigidity of thinking and a dependence on previously acquired dogma and cultural myths to counteract and subdue doubts , thereby maintaining cognitive harmony .
As Bigelow ( 1995 , pp. 105-106 ) stated .
" This effect is very detectable among parents who have elected to circumcise their son--especially since they cannot retract their choice !
These parents frequently do not want to hear anything negative about infant circumcision .... "
Future directions
Foreskin Restoration
If involuntary circumcision can bring about psychological consequences through the aftermath of trauma , then it is possible that " uncircumcision " ( Schultheiss , Truss , Stief , & Jonas , 1998 ) may go some way towards attenuating those effects .
In recent years , there has been an increasing awareness among circumcised men about the possibility of restoring a foreskin ( albeit devoid of the amputated erogenous nerve endings ) , through a process of stretching and skin expansion over some years ( Bigelow , 1995 ) .
Some men who have undergone foreskin restoration have reported discernible recovery of sexual sensation and function previously lost to circumcision , and sometimes a lessening of associated negative emotions ( Goodwin , 1990 ; Greer , Mohl , & Sheley , 1982 ; Griffiths , 2001 ; O'Hara & O'Hara , 2001 ) .
Mohl , Adams , Greer , and Sheley ( 1981 ) failed to mention that one of the main reasons for circumcised men to restore themselves genitally was the crucial loss of prepuce function during sexual activity .
Instead , they claimed that men who sought foreskin restoration were homosexually orientated with psychopathology including narcissistic and exhibitionistic body image , depression , inadequate early mothering , and egocentrism .
Yet this conclusion was based on an unrepresentative sample of only eight men .
These 20 - year old results suffer from an analysis based on what today would be considered outdated therapeutic and discriminatory social prejudices against individuals with a homosexual orientation .
Even so , Bigelow ( 1995 ) , and Griffiths ( 2001 ) reported that most men undergoing foreskin restoration are in fact heterosexual .
As Schultheiss et al. ( 1998 , p. 1996 ) stated , " Nowadays , the understanding of the psychological motivations for uncircumcision is increasing , and the problem is dealt with more seriously .... the majority of the males performing skin- stretching are heterosexual . "
Postulated psychosexual benefits resulting from foreskin restoration have been discussed by Bigelow ( 1995 ) .
Circumcision Advocacy
Even though research suggests harmful effects of circumcision ( e.g. , Denniston & Milos , 1977 ; Denniston , Hodges , & Milos , 1999 ; Cold & Taylor , 1999 ; Hammond , 1999 ; Van Howe et al. , 1999 ) , psychological factors may make it difficult for circumcision advocates to stop promoting the practice ( Goldman , 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .
Presumably , grief for the lost sexual body part and its functions , and the resultant denial of loss is important because it may explain the circumcised " adamant father " ( who unreasonably insists on the circumcision of a son in the face of contrary evidence ) as well as other manifestations of the circumcised male such as the " I'm circumcised and I 'm fine " syndrome ( Bigelow , 1995 ; Ritter & Denniston , 1996 ) .
Grief and denial in relation to involuntary circumcision may well play a role in the psychology of the circumcised male ( Parkes , 1998 ) .
Such factors may figure even more prominently among those doctors who devote their entire medical practice or a substantial portion thereof to circumcising normal healthy boys when there is no medical reason to do so ( cf. Bigelow , pp. 94-99 ) .
Some trauma victims experience a compulsion to re-enact the trauma ( van der Kolk , 1989 ) .
Circumcising infants may to some extent involve re-enacting the trauma of one 's own circumcision .
A survey of randomly selected physicians showed that circumcision was more often supported by male doctors who themselves happened to be circumcised ( Stein , Marx , Taggert , & Bass , 1982 ) .
Conclusion
The body of empirical evidence reviewed here suggests that there is severe pain at the time of circumcision and shortly thereafter in unanaesthetised boys , as well as heightened pain sensitivity for some considerable period of time afterwards .
Evidence has also started to accumulate that male circumcision may result in lifelong physical , sexual , and sometimes psychological harm as well .
A variety of forces are converging from fields as diverse as psychology , medicine , law , medical ethics , and human rights , all questioning the advisability of circumcision which originated millenia ago and was promoted in the Victorian era .
As Chamberlain ( 1998 ) pointed out , " parents are not warned that their infants will endure severe pain and will be deprived of a functional part of their sexual anatomy for life . "
Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors is now being questioned by legal and ethics scholars in an unprecedented way .
The mental health community can play an important role in the growing debate about circumcision .
We encourage closer examination of this issue and even more empirical research into the psychosexual sequelae associated with circumcision .

REPORT
" JAPANESE ONLY " SIGNS IN MISAWA , JAPAN
FOREIGNERS COMPELLED TO EXCLUDE " FOREIGNERS "
MISAWA , JAPAN , MARCH 28 , 2002
( click here to page down to May 10 , 2002 UPDATE )
( click here to page down to Dec 5 , 2003 UPDATE )
By Arudou Debito
Released April 5 , 2002
Recently I visited Misawa , Aomori Prefecture , to see friends at the local American Air Force base .
Going out for drinks on the evening of March 28 , 2002 , we discovered several cheap bars ( all you can drink for 2000 - 4000 yen an hour , hostesses ' drinks included ) a few minutes from the base 's main gate .
However , they had signs outside saying " JAPANESE ONLY " and denied us entry .
A permutation of the phenomenon seen in the Otaru Exclusionary Onsens Case , this is a consequence of Japan 's continued unwillingness to honor its 1996 international treaty obligations and pass laws against racial discrimination .
However , this time there was a new twist :
The foreign staff ( Russian , Filipina , and Chinese hostesses ) at these bars doubled as bouncers , kicking out all " foreigners " .
" Foreigners " included a naturalized Japanese showing proof of citizenship .
The following report will offer photo and eyewitness substantiation , attempt to provide insights into the mentalities behind the methods , and conclude with thoughts on why this case matters .
BACKGROUND
Misawa is a small city on the Pacific side of northern tip of Honshu .
Developed during WWII as a base for Japanese Imperial forces , it was appropriated afterwards by the US military ( official site http://www.misawa.af.mil).
According to on - base sources , around 30,000 American military personnel and their families are stationed there for two to three years , nearly doubling the 43,000 souls and 234 ( in 1999 ) foreigners who are registered Misawa residents .
Misawa Air Base also services the Japanese Self Defense Forces and domestic civilian airlines .
The local economy receives economic trappings of an international outpost : national budgetary support , on - base employment for the " natives " , and off - base patronage from the " guests " .
Otherwise , Misawa as a community keeps links with the base tenuous .
This is most visible in the isolated and depressed " White Pole Road " :
" WHITE POLE ROAD " , MISAWA , JAPAN
( all photos in this report taken by Arudou Debito )
White Pole Road is a shuttered and peeling drag right outside the main gate :
MISAWA AIR BASE MAIN GATE
Another example of Misawa 's tenuous links with the base community can be found in the bar district one block from White Pole , which deals with foreigners by shutting them out -- publicly , overtly , and unmistakably - - with " JAPANESE ONLY " signs outside the premises .
RECORD OF SYSTEMATIC EXCLUSIONS , MARCH 28 , 2002
Aside from the couple of dozen nearby bars and restaurants by the base gate which do cater to ( and are often owned by ) the foreign community , we found seven other places , listed in the phonebook as " sunakku " ( hostess bar ) , " karaoke box " , and " inshokuten " ( restaurant ) ( in other words , establishments not expressly directed towards the sex trade ) , displaying " JAPANESE ONLY " signs .
The writer of this report , a Caucasian Japanese citizen , and his American friend visited the following places with the following results :
=======================================
1 ) KING MHU
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 2 - Chome 3 - 34 , ph 0176-57-5577 )
KING MHU STOREFRONT
Within sight of the base 's main gate , King Mhu is listed in the phonebook as a " sunakku " .
We did not actually enter the establishment proper , but the sign outside said , in cryptic English :
" Please acknowledge it although it is very sorry , because only one of Japanese is asking to do the entrance store in our shop although I asked to come it to this special KING MOU . "
KING MHU SIGN
The Japanese below it is far clearer :
" Sekkaku tou Kingu Muu ni okoshi itadakimashita ga , touten de wa nihonjin no kata nomi nyuuten shite itadaite orimasu no de , taihen moushiwake gozaimasen ga , douzo goryoushou kudasai . "
or ( literally ) :
" It is a shame that you 've come all this way to King Mhu , but this store in particular will only allow entry to Japanese people .
Our deepest apologies , but we we ask for your understanding . "
=======================================
2 ) HEART BEATS
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 2 - Chome 5 - 28 , Miyabe Bldg 2 F , ph 0176-53-6732 )
HEART BEATS ' FRONT DOOR
This new " sunuakku " has a very large billboard advertising its drinks charge system :
HEART BEATS BILLBOARD AND DRINKS SPECIALS
Drinks are listed as 4000 yen per hour , all you can drink , hostesses ' drinks included .
Come as a party of six and the drinks are 3000 yen per hour .
The front door just as prominently displays the sign " JAPANESE ONLY " in two languages :
HEART BEATS EXCLUSIONARY SIGN
( Note that even though the legal drinking age in Japan is twenty , only people that are above eighteen years of age are allowed in , according to the white sign on the bottom left doorjam . )
It is even in the same font as exclusionary onsen signs in Otaru .
My friend and I went inside , only to face a Filipina ( discernable by her accent ) hostess who told us in English we were not allowed in .
I asked her why in Japanese , and she responded in Japanese that it was the manager 's policy .
I asked to see the manager .
She said he was not in .
I then got the attention of an older Japanese man tending bar , and asked him why this establishment excludes foreigners .
He gave the same response about manager 's policy and how he could lose his job if he let me in .
I then produced my Japanese passport and asked how now .
The Filipina cut in in English that their rules would only let in Japanese who were born in Japan ; I retorted in Japanese that I was not talking to her .
The bartender responded that even with a Japanese passport , I was not allowed in for it would mean his job .
I then thanked him for his time and asked him to reconsider the policy as we departed .
=======================================
3 ) PUB GLOBE
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 2 - Chome 5 - 28 , Miyabe Bldg 3 F , ph 0176-52-2416 )
PUB GLOBE LOCATION IN MIYABE BUILDING
One floor up and co-owned by HEART BEATS ( evidenced by the moonlighting Russian hostesses using the stairwell in between ) , PUB GLOBE is brand - new ( opened March 3 [ 2002 ] , it says above ) and also has a huge billboard out front with drinks specials :
GLOBE'S BILLBOARD AND DRINKS SPECIALS
The deal is the same : 4000 yen / hour , all you can drink , hostesses ' drinks included ; come as a group of six or more an get 1000 yen off the price .
It also has exactly the same JAPANESE ONLY sign :
GLOBE'S " JAPANESE ONLY " SIGN
As we went in , this time a Chinese hostess took time out from her customers to come up and refuse us in English : " No Americans allowed . "
I asked for the manager and was told he was out again .
I then asked an older Japanese bartender there for reasons why and he gave me the same song about managerial policy .
When I showed him my passport , he still refused entry .
When I asked him if he did not consider this racial discrimination , he said that he did not , but would not elaborate further on reasons why foreign - looking peoples were not allowed in .
We expressed gratitude for time spent and moved on .
=======================================
4 ) SAN ROZE
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 1 - Chome 6-17 1 F , ph 0176-52-3200 )
A " Karaoke Box Room " , San Roze uses exactly the same bilingual exclusionary sign as King Mhu - - to the letter and in the same font :
SAN ROZE'S EXCLUSIONARY SIGN
making one suspect there is a local restaurateur 's association making standardized signs ( as seen in Monbetsu , Hokkaido ) .
Passing by a Russian woman in the doorway trying to feint her way out of a proposition from a drunk Japanese client , we saw this establishment was also full of foreign women .
Our checklist of interactions as follows :
REFUSER : Filipina hostess
REACTION TO JAPANESE PASSPORT : Refused me entry regardless
REASON WHY : Manager 's rules
MANAGER'S WHEREABOUTS : Upstairs in restaurant AI NO DE - AI
MANAGER'S NAME : Sachiko
=======================================
5 ) AI NO DE -AI
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 1 - Chome 6-17 2 F , ph 0176-57-3035 )
AI NO DE - AI'S ( AND SANROSE AND ROUZE'S ) EXTERIOR
This " inshokuten " with lots of foreign staff had a notice advertising all you can drink for 2000 to 3000 yen , but no exclusionary sign out front .
Visible below :
AI NO DE - AI'S FRONT DOOR AND DRINK SPECIALS
One step in and we were out .
Q&A as follows :
REFUSER : Manager Sachiko
REACTION TO JAPANESE PASSPORT : Refused me entry regardless
REASONS WHY : Americans molest ( itazura suru ) her bar girls .
There are other bars in Misawa open to foreigners , thus foreigners can have a better time there than at her bars here .
No , my being allowed to enter her bar would not make her customers have a bad time , but naturalized Japanese or not , no people who look American are allowed in .
No , to Sachiko this is not racial discrimination .
=======================================
6 ) ROJE
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 1 - Chome 6 - 17 , 3 F , ph 0176-53-4880 )
ROJE'S FRONT DOOR ( WITH EXCLUSIONARY SIGN BEHIND THE PLANTS )
One floor up from AI NO DE - AI , this " sunakku " uses exactly the same bilingual exclusionary sign as King Mhu and San Roze :
We did not go inside , as Sachiko is also the manager there .
=======================================
7 ) CLUB SARII
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 1 - Chome 7 - 12 , ph 0176-53-1133 )
This " sunakku " full of foreign hostesses has a sign outside explaining all the charges ( 3500 yen per hour , 3000 yen per hour for more than two people , prices for karaoke , for requesting a specific hostess , etc ) in Japanese .
SARII 'S EXTERIOR AND DRINK SPECIALS
It also displays an exclusionary sign with exactly the same cryptic English as the ones above , but with no Japanese below it ( perhaps to get around paying for an official local - association - produced sign ) .
SARII 'S EXCLUSIONARY SIGN
Proceedings as follows :
REFUSER : Filipina hostess in broken Japanese
REACTION TO JAPANESE PASSPORT : Refused me entry regardless
REASONS WHY : Just folllowing orders .
If this were her bar , she would let us in .
Otherwise no dice .
Manager 's policy .
MANAGER'S WHEREABOUTS : Unknown
CONCLUSION : WHY MISAWA MATTERS
I will start by noting some differences between the Misawa and Otaru Cases .
In Otaru , businesses targeting families ( bathhouses ) reacted to allegedly unruly seaport visitors ( Russian sailors ) by putting up signs which excluded all foreigners ( see background to Otaru Case here ) .
Thus exclusionary rules affected innocents ( international residents and their families ) and spread to other cities and business sectors .
Essentially , the precedents set in Otaru adversely affected the more assimilated foreign - looking peoples in Japan .
In Misawa , however , businesses targeting pub crawlers ostensibly reacted to a local but unassimilated community ( a permanent base of Americans ) by reserving hostess bars for people who look Japanese .
These are not the family - oriented businesses at issue in Otaru .
Furthermore , one may argue that these are merely localized vigilante reactions to a military - base economy and will not spread to affect more assimilated foreigners in Japan .
However , the Misawa Case should not be ignored .
For one , the above Misawa businesses are still places where essentially anyone of legal age can drink .
They are not , ahem , the specialized prurient outlets ( soaplands , pink salons , what have you ) found elsewhere in this bar district .
The signposted excluders , like any other " sunakku " , pull in people with typical tactics : cheap drinks and appealing women .
Although I will stress here that fighting for " equal access " to Japan 's water trades is not on my personal list of priorities , I do find it ironic that places which take the trouble to explain the drinking systems outside in Japanese wo n't do the same in English using their multilingual staff .
For another , letting these signs stand unchallenged sets a bad precedent .
Seemingly localized problem or not , historically speaking , phenomena like these have encouraged other Japanese towns and business sectors facing specific cultural problems to refuse all foreigners in general .
With the rapidly internationalizing society that Japan has become , allowing the closed - minded to take the easy way out by slamming their doors is not helpful .
Essentially , the Misawa Case still boils down to an issue of racial discrimination , employing all of its assumptions .
Even without a language barrier , even when presented with material evidence of legal and cultural assimilation through naturalization ( yes , including cultural , when one considers how difficult it is to naturalize ) , the establishments maintained the canard that those who do not look Japanese can never ever be Japanese .
If " JAPANESE ONLY " was truly the sole criterion for entry , as a Japanese citizen the choice of entry should have been mine , not theirs .
Finally , spice the whole event with irony .
The refusers in every case turned out to be the foreign employees .
Personally , being denied my existence as a Japanese , in my country , and by those who have not yet earned that qualification , is quite offensive .
All this is why the Misawa Case deserves attention .
Unfortunately , I feel this will not happen .
In 2000 , after hearing from American members of the JET Program of their exclusion from a Misawa bathhouse , I notified the pertinent authorities : the US Consulate in Sapporo .
I received assurances via them from the Mayor of Misawa that exclusionary establishments do not exist .
On March 28 , 2002 , I found this to be untrue , and notified several Western and Japanese newspapers ( Asahi , Mainichi , Kyodo , etc ) and TV stations .
I got not one answer from their Aomori affiliates , which makes one assume that they feel there is no news in this event .
For its part , the Misawa Air Base command will probably not be a bad guest , since making a fuss would probably only make people wonder more strongly why the base is there at all .
Meanwhile , the bar owners can stand fast , opening new bars with exclusionary signs in defiance of international treaty -- while the Japanese government continues to refuse to pass laws which will protect all of its citizens from discrimination by physical appearance .

UPDATE TO THE MISAWA EXCLUSIONS CASE
May 10 , 2002
By Arudou Debito
BACKGROUND : In March 2002 , in Misawa City , Aomori - Ken , northern Honshu , a naturalized caucasian Japanese was refused entry to several cheap drinking establishments outside the gate of Misawa Air Base , an American military base in Japan .
Not only did these establishments display " JAPANESE ONLY " signs outside , they had their foreign hostesses refuse the Japanese citizen even after he presented his Japanese passport .
UPDATE :
I ( the person refused entry ) raised this issue with two different agencies in charge of problems like these :
1 ) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Bureau of Human Rights ( Jinken Yougobu ) , Aomori Branch , and 2 ) The American Consulate Sapporo , which has jursidiction over American affairs in Hokkaido and northern Honshu .
The responses :
----------------------------------------
1 ) On April 8 , I consulted with a Mr Narumi at the Aomori Bureau of Human Rights , at ( 017 ) 776-9024 .
It had been a full month since I had notified him of the event with no feedback , so I telephoned him yesterday , May 9 .
He indicated that the Bureau had contacted and visited each establishment in question , and heard their side of the story .
The Bureau had verbally demanded that the exclusionary signs come down , or at least have the wording changed to something like , " We refuse anyone who does not understand the drinking charge system . "
The establishments refused , so now the Bureau is considering ( kentou shiteimasu ) next steps .
I asked whether there would be anything in writing , such as a " demand for improvements " ( kaizen yousei ) , and he said that this would be considered .
For how long ?
Unclear .
I then requested that the Bureau break tradition and redouble its efforts here .
A citizen and taxpayer , I stressed that my rights under Japanese Constitution Article 14 had been violated , and I did not want the same thing to happen as had happened with the Sapporo Bureau of Human Rights ( I , recently - naturalized , had been refused entry at Otaru 's Yunohana Onsen on October 31 , 2000 , but the Sapporo BOHR ignored my written requests for assistance ) .
I said the Aomori BOHR 's minimum effort should be a " kaizen yousei " in writing ; the Asahikawa BOHR , after all , had sent one to Monbetsu , Hokkaido , protesting signs put up by 100 restaurants excluding all foreigners .
Mr Narumi said that would be considered , for how long again unclear .
----------------------------------------
2 ) On April 11 , I consulted with Consul Drew Schufletowski of the US Consulate Sapporo , at ( 011 ) 641-1115 .
He said that the USG was not legally allowed to go to bat for a Japanese citizen , and that I should take this up with the pertinent Japanese authorities .
I replied that I had done so ; moreover what I was asking for was not personal assistance , but rather for the US State Department to at least notify both the Mayor of Misawa and Misawa AB Command that the State Dept was aware of the situation , and to express hopes that a reasonable solution could be reached .
The Consul replied that it was the Sapporo Consul General 's opinion that this was , quote , " not a bilateral issue " , and " not an issue of human rights " .
No action by the US Government would be taken .
----------------------------------------
CONCLUSION
It is a disappointing situation .
It seems that wherever there are American bases , both the US and Japanese governments will tend to ignore issues which are explicitly resolved in both of their national constitutions .
I am particularly disappointed by the Americans .
With all due criticism of Misawa 's vigilante drinking establishments refusing people by skin color , it is a shame that the US Government will take no action to help clean up the mess its military helped create .
Even when it affects citizens of their host country , Japan .
Now with the Bush Administration 's unprecedented decision to " unsign " a treaty establishing an international criminal court ( Int'l Herald Tribune / Asahi Shinbun , May 7 , 2002 , Front Page , available at http://www.iht.com/search.php?id=56710, or click here for text in case this link is dead ) it seems the Americans are trying to become even less accountable for their actions in the world arena .
Maybe it 's time for US military to withdraw from Japan .

( For the record : Japanese domestic coverage ( Kyodo article in Japanese at http://www.debito.org/misawahaiseki.html#kanrenkiji) made it sound like I went down to Misawa specially to " survey " ( chousa ) these exclusionary establishments .
I did not .
I have a relative in Misawa with whom I spent more than a week .
I went to these places to drink with a friend . )
UPDATE TWO
LOSING MY US CITIZENSHIP
Yes , I gave it up .
What could have inspired such a rash act ?
A little coercion from the US State Department , in what I felt was an attempt to stop me from pursuing the matter in Misawa any further .
The procedures involved , the actual documents ( even my cancelled passport ) scanned , and the motivations are all available here

Campers trash northern Japan campsite , leave evidence behind
By Wayne Specht , Misawa bureau chief
Pacific edition , Sunday , May 5 , 2002
MISAWA AIR BASE , Japan -- Campers from the base who trashed a campsite in northern Japan left behind unmistakable evidence -- a roll of undeveloped film .
The campsite owner -- who will no longer allow Americans to stay at his camp -- developed the film and gave the pictures to base officials .
Base commander Brig .
Gen. Chip Utterback called the situation , " our very own version of America 's dumbest criminals . "
" What we carry can't be found anywhere except at the Commissary , so we have a pretty unique signature , " said Utterback in his weekly commander 's update aired on Misawa 's American Forces Network .
The campers were " posing with the booze -- the guy holding the bottle was certainly underage and holding stuff they ultimately left in the park , " Utterback said .
When they were finished , the campers left behind garbage and waste .
The result of this " ugly American incident , " the general said , is Americans are no longer welcomed at the campsite .
" That was the straw that broke the camel 's back for that campsite owner , and that 's too bad for the rest of us , " he said .
Noting that Americans in Japan are " walking and talking American flags , " he urged viewers to treat campsites in Japan " as if they were at home . "
Utterback said he is seeing an upswing in the number of complaints from off - base campsites but lauded " the vast majority of you [ who ] are great ambassadors . "
Base spokeswoman Maj .
Claudia
Foss would not say if the underage drinker seen on the film would be prosecuted nor would she name the campsite where the incident took place .

REPORT
" JAPANESE ONLY " SIGNS NATIONWIDE IN JAPAN :
PROGRESS IN AKITA
MORE OF THE SAME IN MISAWA
By Arudou Debito
December 5 , 2003
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Since mid-2002 , an exclusionary sign has been on the front door of a disco in Akita , northern Honshu .
Proclaiming " FOREIGNERS ARE NOT ADMITTED " ( http://www.debito.org/roguesgallery.html#Akita), " Honeybee " , highly popular with the city 's musical youth , thus barred all foreign custom .
In Akita for work - related reasons , Arudou Debito dropped by to see how he ( a naturalized caucasian Japanese ) would be treated , to hear the disco 's side of the story , and to ask the management to take the sign down .
Result : success .
Manager Mr Sakamoto agreed that so long as foreigners minded the rules , there would be no problem letting them in .
Arudou then translated Honeybee 's rules into English for a new sign , and removed the old sign from the front door .
It was only the second time ( in years of negotiating with exclusionary establishments ) that Arudou accomplished this after one request .
However , success would not be a recurring theme of this trip .
In Misawa , Aomori Prefecture , Arudou 's fourth visit to confirm developments ( previous trips at http://www.debito.org/misawaexclusions.html) revealed that of seven establishments ( six bars , one karaoke parlor ) warned by the Ministry of Justice in mid-2002 to remove their " JAPANESE ONLY " signs , only three had complied .
The four holdouts were all owned by the same person , who once again refused Arudou entry without explanation .
On the other hand , the owner of two former signposting bars this time granted Arudou entry , and quite profitably .
Owner also admitted his exclusionary signs were a copy of Otaru onsen signs he had seen in the newspaper , proof positive that years of negligence by Otaru City had inspired copycat discrimination elsewhere in Japan .
These cases will be grist for a future separate class - action - style multiplaintiff lawsuit against the Japanese national government ( i.e. not merely against the City of Otaru , the defendant in the current Otaru Onsens Lawsuit ( http://www.debito.org/otarulawsuit.html)).
Reason : the Sapporo High Court ( and the Supreme Court , some years from now ) will probably reaffirm the lower court 's 2002 ruling to absolve Otaru City of any responsibility , claiming the national government , not the local , was the signatory to the UN Convention on Racial Discrimination in 1995 .
Thus a new lawsuit will close the loophole , since there is no plausible deniability for the national government honoring international treaty obligations and making this discrimination illegal .
So fellow excluded peoples of Japan , join in :
The more people who get refused nationwide at exclusionary establishments and join the new lawsuit , the stronger a claim of social damage and nationwide negligence can be made in court .
More details on the suit forthcoming in 2004 .
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PART ONE : PROGRESS IN AKITA
I heard about Honeybee 's exclusionary sign through the internet .
A person working in Akita Prefecture had been excluded from there some months ago , and sent me photographs for The Rogues ' Gallery ( http://www.debito.org/roguesgallery.html), a compendium of exclusionary signs found nationwide in Japan .
While in Akita on business , I visited Honeybee on the evening of November 29 , 2003 , with a reporter from the local Akita Sakigake Shinbun .
The results in outline form follow :
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PLACE : Disco " Honeybee " ( Akita - ken Akita - shi Sannou 3-5 - 15 Phone : 018-864-1725 )
THEIR SIGN : " Foreigners are not admitted " , displayed since around mid-2002 , according to the head manager , Mr Sakamoto .
PROCEEDINGS : Walking in ( the room was dark and I was wearing Uniqlo , so it was not immediately recognizable that I was caucasian ) , the reporter and I paid the cover charge ( 1000 yen ) and parked ourselves at the counter where the manager , Mr Sakamoto , was tending bar .
I greeted him in Japanese , and , despite a look of surprise on Mr Sakamoto 's face , was soon served beers and cocktails .
Reason given for letting me in : I spoke Japanese , and was accompanied by a Japanese , which made him doubly sure that we could communicate .
If I had not been accompanied ?
Mr Sakamoto claimed my Japanese was good enough for admission anyway .
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY :
There had been trouble with foreigners bringing in cheaper drinks from outside , and standing outside the bar disturbing the neighborhood peace ( I found it a little odd how a disco booming well into the night posed less of a disturbance ) .
Since Mr Sakamoto could not caution them in English to stop loitering , foreigners would then pretend they could n't understand and continue their deeds unabated .
Mr Sakamoto also claimed that foreigners had knocked over his motorcycle and sullied his toilet ( although he admitted he had n't exactly witnessed foreigners doing this ) , as well as cause trouble with female patrons through untoward forwardness in their meat - marketing techniques ( probably true , but drunk Japanese , as any female in Japan knows , can be quite shitsukoi when in nanpa mode ) .
He saw foreigners as deliberately disruptive , and decided last year that refusing them would keep the place more appealing .
MY RESPONSE : I asked if house rules had been made clear and if the police had ever been called if admonitions were ignored .
Nix on both counts , as Mr Sakamoto said his English was not good enough to make a good list of rules , and he did n't think the situation was serious enough to warrant police involvement .
I noted that the situation had been serious enough to make him feel like excluding all foreigners in general , and that the grammar of " Foreigners are not admitted " was probably the best I had seen on any exclusionary sign so far .
How had his English gotten so good ?
Checking a dictionary , he said .
Well , how about showing the same tenacity for a set of rules in English , then ?
Answer demurred .
So I took out a pen and some paper and asked him what his rules were , and translated them on the spot for a future sign .
In no -nonsense English :
Sign for the front door :
==================================
WE PREFER NON - JAPANESE CUSTOMERS
WHO FOLLOW OUR RULES .
IF YOU DON'T , WE CALL THE POLICE .
THIS IS NOT A BLUFF
==================================
and for the interior :
==================================
" RULES
1 ) NO LOITERING OUTSIDE
( it causes neighborhood complaints )
2 ) NO BRINGING IN DRINKS FROM ELSEWHERE
( if you come here , kindly support our business )
3 ) NO CAUSING TROUBLE WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS HERE
( any complaints , you 're out )
4 ) OUR PRICES ARE OUR PRICES
Other people pay with no complaints .
Do n't like it ?
Go elsewhere , please .
ANY TROUBLE , WE CALL THE POLICE
==================================
I then translated the text back ( the Sakigake reporter , literate in English , confirmed the contents ) , and asked if those rules were in place , would he consider taking the front - door sign down ?
He said yes .
I cautioned him that to keep the peace , he would have to strengthen his enforcement techniques from now on ( as any establishment worldwide offering liquor and sexuality on tap should -- yet Honeybee does n't even have a bouncer ) .
Do n't let the rules become a bluff .
He then gave me permission to take the exclusionary sign down from the front door .
I have since added it to my collection on my office wall .
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PART TWO : MORE OF THE SAME IN MISAWA
Quick background : I have been to Misawa four times now visiting family within the ( American ) Misawa Air Base , and have been out drinking with friends on three of those occasions in cheap drinking establishments a couple of blocks from the front gate .
On each of those occasions I was refused entry to bars expressly for being " foreign " ( despite displaying my Japanese passport ) , ironically by a bevy of foreign hostesses .
In contrast to my Akita experience , few tete - a- tetes in Misawa ever resulted in managers emerging to discuss the reasons for excluding me .
One owner , an enerprising lady who would only falsely identify herself as " Sachiko " , has four separate exclusionary - signposted establishments ( " King Mhu " , " Roje " , " Ai no De - Ai " , and " San Rouze " ) -- one right in sight of the air base 's main gate .
She turned out to be downright duplicitous in her customer relations .
Full background to my March 2002 Misawa visit with photos is at http://www.debito.org/misawaexclusions.html , but in August 2003 , a ( hitherto unreported ) visit to Misawa by me revealed that more than a year later , " Sachiko " had completely ignored Ministry of Justice demands that her exclusionary signs come down .
She also , in a chance meeting at bar " Ai no De- ai " on Saturday , August 16 , 2003 , personally denied me entry , claiming that with a busy Saturday night , I should come back the next day when I could be admitted .
That turned out to be a lie , as I was refused entry yet again on August 17 , when a sparsely - populated bar on a 10:30 PM Sunday night was said to be " full " .
Even after one of her ( Filipina ) hostesses phoned her to check her previous night 's invitation , " Sachiko " never appeared to explain why her promise would not be honored .
Three other establishments , " Sally " , " Globe " , and " Heart Beats " complied with government demands to remove their signs as of November 2002 .
But a check by Arudou Debito on August 16 , 2003 , revealed they still refuse foreigners if they do not speak Japanese .
I , fortunately , would be admitted , as long as I was willing to be seated out of sight of the front door to " avoid misunderstandings " .
Nice people .
Begs the question why they would set up bars in this area in the first place ( right next to an American airbase that has been here since the end of World War II ) if they wanted to avoid foreign patronage .
----------------------------------------
That 's the background .
I went back to these places ( accompanied by a Japanese student studying these cases who came up specially from Tokyo ) yet again on December 3 , 2003 .
Here 's what happened :
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PLACE : KING MHU ( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 2 - Chome 3 - 34 , ph 0176-57-5577 )
THEIR SIGN : " Please acknowledge it although it is very sorry , because only one of Japanese is asking to do the entrance store in our shop although I asked to come it to this special KING MOU "
( The Japanese is much clearer : " Sekkaku tou kingu muu ni okoshi itadakimashita ga , touten de wa nihonjin no kata nomi nyuuten shite itadaite orimasu no de , taihen moushiwake gozaimasen ga douzo goryoushou kudasai " )
http://www.debito.org/kingmhusign.jpg
PROCEEDINGS : Although the place was deserted ( with about fifteen hostesses , mostly Thais , idling around ) , the main mama of the establishment ( aged fifty - ish , clearly in the managerial position ) came round to try and kick us out as quickly as possible .
All questions by me or by the student were rebuked with a series of " sumimasen "s .
Entreaties for a reason why and a number of displays ( and close inspections by even the foreign hostesses ) of my Japanese passport were ignored .
THEIR SIDE OF THE STORY :
There was n't one .
Main Mama ( who would not give her name ) refused to talk to me -- only to my student friend -- saying that it was not her decision to refuse me and that she was only following orders .
Main Mama did , on my student 's request , telephone the main boss ( " Sachiko " - - a name Main Mama did not recognize ) to confirm that I was not allowed in .
I asked to speak to her boss myself about this , and Main Mama told us to go to Bar " Ai no De - Ai " , where she said " Sachiko " currently was ( she even gave us a matchbook to make sure we could find the place ) .
So off we went .
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PLACE : AI NO DE -AI
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 1 - Chome 6-17 2 F , ph 0176-57-3035 )
THEIR SIGN : Is exactly the same as King Mhu's in this and the other three establishments that " Sachiko " owns , except with the name of the bar or karaoke place ( " Roje " , " Ai no De - Ai " , or " San Rouze " ) pasted in .
( http://www.debito.org/rojesign.jpg)
PROCEEDINGS : A Filipina hostess did the honors of refusing me and breaking the news that it was the manager 's day off .
A request to telephone and confirm that we had agreed to meet was eventually rebuffed with an excuse that " Sachiko " was even out of town ( though when the hostess made the call , she entered a local number ) .
No , my passport had no effect .
No , nothing could be done since these were the rules .
Need n't go on .
You get the picture .
Afterwards , my student was so shaken by this experience that she did not want to see what would happen at " Sachiko " 's other two establishments .
So we went to a place whose owner felt a greater obligation to honor his word .
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
PLACE : HEART BEATS
( Misawa - shi Chuo-chou 2 - Chome 5 - 28 , Miyabe Bldg 2 F , ph 0176-53-6732 )
I had talked with the Manager , Mr Kitakami , on August 17 , 2003 , when I went with an American friend and was refused entry .
Actually , he said , I could enter , but the airman could n't because he could n't speak Japanese .
When I asked him if he could enter on my recognaizance , he said no , because where would he draw the line ?
If one beigun got in , then five would want to get in if they had one Japanese speaker amongst them .
And then the place would be a shambles .
I thanked him then for taking his exclusionary signs down ( here and at " Globe " , one floor above ) , and said I would be back again to give him some business when I could enter without leaving a friend outside .
So that 's what my student friend and I did that December 3 , 2003 .
Mr Kitakami remembered me and let me in without hesitation , seating us in a faraway inconspicuous nook ( " just in case some Americans see you and get the idea that they can come in too " , said Mr K ) for beers and interesting conversation with some gorgeous Rumanian hostesses .
Paid 8400 yen for an hour 's privilege .
There 's got to be a cheaper way to stand up for your rights .
////////////////////////////////////////////////////
CONCLUSIONS
I 'm sure some readers by now are wondering if I am a glutton for punishment .
Why keep going back only to be refused , sometimes quite humiliatingly ( although , fortunately , not violently ) by people who simply are not interested in discussing the issues ?
Because it is all grist .
Only by cataloging situations like these in photo , audio , and eye - witness accounts will there be incontrovertible evidence :
1 ) that discrimination on the basis of race -- not culture , tradition , nationality , language barrier , whatever excuse people can fish for -- is happening in Japan , sometimes carried out by dishonest people who will on no account see reason or treat certain human beings with respect .
2 ) that these are not isolated incidents .
It is part of a nationwide trend of brazenly signposted discrimination which is relatively new , unchecked , and growing in Japan .
3 ) that all other avenues available to resolve these situations , including direct negotiation with the discriminating parties , governmental action , and social exposure , have been unsuccessfully attempted .
4 ) that for this type of discrimination , there is no legally - sanctioned recourse of action in Japan outside a courtroom to protect one 's constitutionally - guaranteed rights .
5 ) that this complete lack of legal protections against discrimination of this type is not supposed to happen in Japan under its international treaty obligations .
6 ) that the more times these exclusions happen and get catalogued , the stronger a case can be made that government action to stop this is both necessary , as well as mandatory .
7 ) that the longer this goes on , the stronger the case can be made to claim wilful negligence on the part of the Japanese government for not protecting its international residents .
Such is the result of living in the only developed country without any form of a law barring discrimination by race or national origin .
But there is a solution of sorts : the courtroom .
Because that is all we have left .
When one can answer the critics and apologists with honest claims that all that could have been done has been done , and there is no choice but to file suit against the Japanese government for not doing its job of enforcing our constitution , then people will sit up and take notice .
I will be discussing with friends and various groups in the new year about organizing a lawsuit against the government of Japan for not keeping its promises .
It signed the UN Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ( http://www.debito.org/CERD.html) in 1995 , where it promised " without delay " to make laws against racial discrimination .
Japan is clearly in violation .
Close to a decade later there is n't even a bill proposal being drafted by the bureaucrats .
This will not do , and there are plenty of people out there -- excluded from apartments , restaurants , and other businesses and facilities open to the general public solely for their skin color or international background -- who are sick of contributing to Japan without being able to spend their money and enjoy the fruits of society like anyone else .
And for those who think that suing is one of those " American predilections " , remember those multiplaintiff lawsuits filed by other victims of Japanese government negligence -- Minamata patients , Hansen 's Disease patients , etc .
A suit against the national government would be a significant and effective recourse .
It had better be .
It 's the only one we have .
So when you get refused , turn the situation to your advantage .
Make notes , photos , and hopefully other recordings of undeniable evidence that you were discriminated against on the basis of race or international background .
The statute of limitations on these things is three years , so if you have a good memory , get cracking .
There are templates for what sorts of information is necessary up at http://www.debito.org/roguesgallery.html
( even if you are not interested in being a plaintiff per se , you are welcome to contribute a photo of an exclusionary sign to the site anonymously ) .
There is a lot of stoneheaded silliness out there , and innocent people are being treated unreasonably and getting hurt .
Time to make it clear that we are not just going to let it ride anymore .

MIAMI , Sept. 8 — The Bush administration ’s Office of Cuba Broadcasting paid 10 journalists here to provide commentary on Radio and TV Martí , which transmit to Cuba government broadcasts critical of Fidel Castro , a spokesman for the office said Friday .
The group included three journalists at El Nuevo Herald , the Spanish - language sister newspaper of The Miami Herald , which fired them Thursday after learning of the relationship .
Pablo Alfonso , who reports on Cuba for El Nuevo Herald , received the largest payment , almost $ 175,000 since 2001 .
Other journalists have been found to accept money from the Bush administration , including Armstrong Williams , a commentator and talk - show host who received $ 240,000 to promote its education initiatives .
But while the Castro regime has long alleged that some Cuban - American reporters in Miami were paid by the government , the revelation on Friday , reported in The Miami Herald , was the first evidence of that .
In addition to Mr. Alfonso , the journalists who received payment include Wilfredo Cancio Isla , who writes for El Nuevo Herald and received about $ 15,000 since 2001 ; Olga Connor , a freelance reporter for the newspaper who received about $ 71,000 ; and Juan Manuel Cao , a reporter for Channel 41 who got $ 11,000 this year from TV Martí , according to The Miami Herald , which learned of the payments through a Freedom of Information Request .

The swimming bag hit the car floor with a thump and my son hit the car seat with an even bigger thump , grumbling : " What 's the point ? "
His primary school had just lost a swimming competition , largely because their head teacher had picked a team on the basis of enthusiasm rather than ability .
To paraphrase that old cliche , it was n't the winning that mattered , it was the taking part .
Well , I 'm sorry , but in the real world life is full of winners and losers .
And right now , the losers are a generation of boys who have been betrayed by an education system that no longer recognises crucial differences between the sexes .
For the story of my son's swimming competition is also the story behind recent figures showing that boys going to university are now outnumbered by girls in every subject , with 23,000 more places awarded to women than to men .
I 'd like to say the figures came as a surprise .
But both as a parent ( of a boy and two girls ) and as a writer on educational matters , I 'm sorry to say the figures are only too predictable .
The simple truth is that by the time our boys have done 12 or even 14 years in the feminised environment of today 's schools , they all ask : " What 's the point ? "
If boys are not getting into university , or not applying in the first place , it 's because they 've been turned off learning .
They 've been given a message that it 's not for them .
And that 's a tragedy for all of us .
For I do n't want my daughters growing up in a society full of alienated young men and I do n't want to live in a society which suffocates all the good aspects of masculinity .
Yet that 's exactly what is happening in our schools .
Forget all that stuff about slugs , snails and puppy dogs ' tails .
What boys are made of is this : tremendous data banks that can recall years of FA Cup ties in minute detail ; lashings of testosterone that needs constant burning off on a sports field ; and a hideous competitive streak almost as vital to them as lifeblood itself .
Harnessed in the right way , these raw ingredients can help boys make the most of their education .
But far too many of today 's schools try to stifle these instincts in favour of a feminised curriculum that benefits girls in almost every single regard .
The problems start in the classroom .
Instead of the make - or - break sprint to the exam deadline , boys have to endure stultifying coursework .
This system of continuous assessment means that anyone who can call up Google on a computer can cut and paste answers from the internet at home .
Girls , with their more patient approach to learning , thrive under such a system .
But where 's the excitement and challenge for boys ?
Exams used to be a chance for them to show off and think on their feet .
Not any more .
No wonder all too many of them fall by the wayside , and are opting out of the chance to go to university .
To put it bluntly , boys now find education boring .
It used to be said that the majority of firsts and thirds at Oxford and Cambridge went to boys , while the girls were more likely to get seconds .
Why ?
Because the boys like taking risks - ending either in glorious triumph or disaster .
The girls tend to play it safer .
And today 's curriculum is pretty risk - proof .
This is at its most obvious in science , where actual experiments with real flames and real blood have been replaced by facts on paper or video demonstrations .
The Royal Society of Chemistry has what it calls serious concerns about the decline in the teaching of practical chemistry .
But , in fact , schools have become anodyne in many other ways , too .
Essays are now so safe they can practically be marked by computer .
One of my daughters comes home with starter paragraphs and keywords for her English essays already provided .
What if you have a brilliant idea , a passionate argument or a ruthless analysis ?
Those are not encouraged because they do n't fit model essay plans .
Presentation , consistency and diligence may well be virtues , but if we are to have physicists who will think the unthinkable , politicians with radical ideas , inspired playwrights and musicians , we need to have fireworks in the curriculum , too .
It 's a teacher truism that little girls want to please and little boys want to win .
The trouble is that our whole system is geared to a strange idea of egalitarianism which has somehow been confused with fairness .
It is egalitarian to put anyone who can float in a swimming gala , but it is not fair to those who can swim and want to compete .
And it wo n't get you anywhere .
The same thing goes for school certificates .
I 've sat through many certificate assemblies in school and they 're a farce .
Those who do best , who genuinely achieve great things , get hardly any recognition because someone has decided that in the interests of egalitarianism , most certificates should go to the less able .
So there are certificates for kindness and certificates for not using bad language .
And so there should be , but it 's equally important to reward sheer excellence , too .
Boys like prizes - but only real ones .
Once they are convinced the system is rigged , they do n't want to play .
Their testosterone and its companion competitive streak need to be acknowledged .
If they 're ignored , boys get listless and they start retreating into their hoodies and terrorising the rest of us .
Eventually , they spend their time brawling , picking up ASBOs instead of A - levels .
Education experts will point out there 's a class issue here as well .
As university admission has extended to families whose children have normally gone straight to work from school , it has picked up far more working - class girls than working - class boys and that accounts for some of the statistics .
These are the very boys most likely to be alienated by today 's style of curriculum , and , with their macho culture , they are the ones most likely to slide into trouble if they leave school with no skills and little chance of a job .
For example , a disruptive boy in my son's primary class was impossible to deal with until the day his exasperated male teacher challenged him to an arm - wrestling match ( yes , it 's probably a sackable offence ) .
The boy lost , took it with good grace and became considerably better behaved .
There was a male code at work that he recognised .
The same teacher also knew when playground fights were serious and when they should just be allowed to run their course .
The women teachers , wanting a tidy playground , always stopped them .
Such macho attention - grabbing needs to be harnessed , not ignored .
Boys need sports , they need exams , competition and recognition .
You only have to look at how boys spend their spare time .
They shout themselves hoarse at football matches , they knock hell out of each other in the virtual world of the computer .
In short , they compete .
Mine does , anyway , even though he devours books , too .
It ought to go without saying that boys and girls are different .
But today 's schools are denying this basic biology .
In fact , any society needs both sexes to succeed and to be inspired by their education .
Right now , though , the lads are chucking their kit on the floor and asking : " What 's the point ? "
And , frankly , I do n't blame them .
Spurned by Apple , IBM and Freescale have stunned the technology world by announcing that PC processor technology has become boring and is a dead end .
With that in mind , the pair plan to reinvigorate their partnership around the Power processor architecture .
During a joint press conference , Freescale revealed that it has joined IBM's Power.org organization as a founding member .
That 's a neat trick , as the Power.org " ecosystem " effort was started by IBM back in 2004 .
Apparently , it just takes the right amount of co-marketing dollars to shift from laggard to founding member .
In addition , IBM and Freescale said they plan to share a common instruction set across all Power market segments , and plan to be more open with roadmaps and shared marketing efforts .
Lastly , the two vendors will zero in on advancing Linux for Power .
These moves back up an ongoing effort to put Power chips in everything from supercomputers to automobiles .
" Innovation is no longer centered around the PC , " said John Kelly , SVP of technology at IBM , during the press conference .
Such a statement serves as an obvious jab against Apple and its new chip partner , Intel .
IBM and Freescale - a spin-off of Motorola - worked as Apple 's chip suppliers until losing the company as a customer last year .
Now , the two companies have pledged not to let Intel take over other parts of the processor market , ranging from high - end servers to game consoles , and the embedded segments where Freescale works to produce hardware for networking kit , industrial equipment , media consoles and cars .
The strong Power architecture has proved troubling to Intel - a point not lost on IBM .
Big Blue has been working hard in recent years to drum up support around Power and have the product adopted in a wide range of markets .
It allows customers to build their own , proprietary add - ons to the chip , and also fosters the sharing of technology among Power supporters where applicable .
Kelly said this is a huge difference when compared to Intel , which likes to maintain total control over its popular Pentium and Xeon chips .
IBM and Freescale stressed that the really interesting work in processor design is happening away from the PC , and the two vendors have pledged to attack these " compelling " markets together . ®
Consumer price inflation hit 3.1 % in March , said the Office for National Statistics .
The ONS said its retail price inflation rate rose to 4.8 % .
Many economists consider an interest rate rise in May to be a certainty .
By late evening on Tuesday , one pound was worth $ 2.008 , having been solidly above the $ 2 mark since late morning .
The stronger pound has been good news for British visitors to the US , but has made life more difficult for exporters .
Moving up
The last time the $ 2 - level was breached was just before sterling dropped out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992 .
Analysts are now betting that the Bank of England will raise interest rates when it meets in May in an effort to slow consumer spending and price growth .
For the first time , the Bank of England governor has had to write a letter explaining why inflation has climbed .
Borrowing costs have been increased three times since August .
The key rate currently stands at 5.25 % and is widely expected to go up to 5.5 % at the Bank of England 's next meeting on 10 May .
" A May move is a certainty , " said Philip Shaw , economist at Investec .
" It opens up a strong possibility of interest rates rising beyond 5.5 % , " he added .
Higher borrowing costs act as a tax on consumers , boosting loan repayment costs , taking money out of their pockets and slowing the rate at which they spend and take on extra financing .
Further falls
Analysts said that the outlook for sterling will also depend on US economic data due later on Tuesday .
British shoppers have been flocking to New York in recent months
David Jones from CMC Markets said , " With US economic data due later in the session , further dollar downside may be seen in due course " .
It is not only sterling that is strong at the moment .
The euro is at two - year high against the dollar and a record high versus the Japanese yen .
Many traders said they were surprised that last weekend 's Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Washington did not make any comments about the weakness of either the dollar or the yen .
The truly universal simultaneous master
Harry Nelson Pillsbury , the real thing
Harry Nelson Pillsbury was born on December 5 , 1872 , in Somerville , Massachusetts .
At the age of 16 he started playing chess , and two years later was beating the best players in the city .
In April 1892 , Pillsbury played a match against World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz , who gave the 20 - year - old a pawn and move odds .
Pillsbury won 2:1 .
Soon he was challenging top players in New York .
In 1897 ( until his death ) he won the United States Chess Championships .
In 1895 the Brooklyn chess club sponsored his trip to play in the Hastings 1895 chess tournament , which he sensationally won , in spite of the fact that all the greatest players of the time were participating ( they included reigning world champion Lasker , former world champion Steinitz and challenger Mikhail Chigorin ) .
Pillsbury was famous for his blindfold skills .
He could play checkers and chess and a hand of whist simultaneously , while reciting a list of long words that had been shown to him for just a few seconds .
In 1900 he played blindfold against the 20 strongest players of the Franklin Chess Club in Philadelphia , and won with a score of +14 , =5 , –1 .
In 1902 he played 21 simultaneous games against the players in the Hannover Tournament , scoring +3 = 11 –7 .
Pillsbury before the start of a simultaneous exhibition in 1897 .
He was one of the greatest simultaneous players in history , usually taking on the strongest players in the the town or state , often in blindfold play .
Unfortunately this exceptional talent suffered from poor health , and tragically succumbed to syphilis on June 17 , 1906 , at the age of only 33 .
He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Reading , MA .

Jewish World Review April 18 , 2007 / 30 Nissan , 5767 Wanted : A culture of self - defense By Michelle Malkin
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
There 's no polite way or time to say it : American colleges and universities have become coddle industries .
Big Nanny administrators oversee speech codes , segregated dorms , politically correct academic departments and designated " safe spaces " to protect students selectively from hurtful ( conservative ) opinions  while allowing mob rule for approved leftist positions ( textbook case : Columbia University 's anti-Minuteman Project protesters ) .
Instead of teaching students to defend their beliefs , American educators shield them from vigorous intellectual debate .
Instead of encouraging autonomy , our higher institutions of learning stoke passivity and conflict - avoidance .
And as the erosion of intellectual self - defense goes , so goes the erosion of physical self - defense .
Yesterday morning , as news was breaking about the carnage at Virginia Tech , a reader e-mailed me a news story from last January .
State legislators in Virginia had attempted to pass a bill that would have eased handgun restrictions on college campuses .
Opposed by outspoken , anti-gun activists and Virginia Tech administrators , that bill failed .
Is it too early to ask : " What if ? "
What if that bill had passed ?
What if just one student in one of those classrooms had been in lawful possession of a concealed weapon for the purpose of self - defense ?
If it was n't too early for Keystone Katie Couric to be jumping all over campus security yesterday for what they woulda / coulda / shoulda done in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , and if it is n't too early for The New York Times editorial board to be publishing its knee - jerk call for more gun control , it darned well is n't too early for me to raise questions about how the unrepentant anti-gun lobbying of college officials may have put students at risk .
The back story : Virginia
Tech had punished a student for bringing a handgun to class last spring  despite the fact that the student had a valid concealed handgun permit .
The bill would have barred public universities from making " rules or regulations limiting or abridging the ability of a student who possesses a valid concealed handgun permit . . . from lawfully carrying a concealed handgun . "
After the proposal died in subcommittee , the school 's governing board reiterated its ban on students or employees carrying guns and prohibiting visitors from bringing them into campus buildings .

Late last summer , a shooting near campus prompted students to clamor again for loosening campus rules against armed self - defense .
Virginia
Tech officials turned up their noses .
In response to student Bradford Wiles 's campus newspaper op - ed piece in support of concealed carry on campus , Virginia Tech Associate Vice President Larry Hincker scoffed :
" [ I ]t is absolutely mind - boggling to see the opinions of Bradford Wiles . . . .
The editors of this page must have printed this commentary if for no other reason than malicious compliance .
Surely , they scratched their heads saying , ' I can't believe he really wants to say that . '
Wiles tells us that he did n't feel safe with the hundreds of highly trained officers armed with high powered rifles encircling the building and protecting him .
He even implies that he needed his sidearm to protect himself . . . "
The nerve !
Hincker continued : " The writer would have us believe that a university campus , with tens of thousands of young people , is safer with everyone packing heat .
Imagine the continual fear of students in that scenario .
We 've seen that fear here , and we do n't want to see it again .
. . .
Guns do n't belong in classrooms .
They never will .
Virginia
Tech has a very sound policy preventing same . "
Who 's scratching his head now , Mr. Hincker ?
Some high - handed commentators insist it 's premature or unseemly to examine the impact of school rules discouraging students from carrying arms on campus .
Pundit Andrew Sullivan complained that it was " creepy " to highlight reader e-mails calling attention to Virginia Tech 's restrictions on student self - defense  even as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence rushed to capitalize on the massacre to sign up new members and gather e-mail addresses for Million Mom March chapters .
" We are outraged by the increase in gun violence in America , especially the recent shooting at Virginia Tech , " reads the online petition .
" Add your name to the growing list of people who are saying : ' Enough Is Enough ! ' "
Enough is enough , indeed .
Enough of intellectual disarmament .
Enough of physical disarmament .
You want a safer campus ?
It begins with renewing a culture of self - defense  mind , spirit and body .
It begins with two words : Fight back .

When I was a child , I lived with my parents and two older brothers in a very rural area .
To put this in perspective to your own timeline , this was the 1980s , in which many homes were wired with cable television , a dedicated phone line , and even such modern amenities as consistent electrical power , which were all things that were absent where I grew up .
My parents were both strong believers in self - reliance , and this belief floated through every aspect of our lives .
Here are a few brief tales from those days and the lessons I learned from them .
Three Important Things I Learned from My Childhood
1 . The more you rely on things , the more helpless you are when they go away
Companies are therefore able to get away with charging you more for the things you depend on .
A regular part of our life was dealing with an absence of electricity , particularly in my early childhood .
The power would go out and the electric company could take days to fix it .
I remember more than once when I slept in the living room for warmth with my brothers and the electricity just suddenly coming on at seven in the morning , all the lights in the house flashing on and the radio coming on very loudly all of a sudden , waking us all up .
Once , we visited my mother ’s grandparents , who were still living and lived in a large city .
While we were there , the electricity turned off , and so we calmly did the things we usually do when this occurs : get out flashights and candles , warn everyone to not open the fridge for twelve hours , do a brief inventory of the pantry , and so forth .
Meanwhile , my great - grandmother ( who actually lived her childhood in a pre-electrical grid era ) was completely panicked and almost hysterical over this .
To this day , whenever I rely on a service , I make it a point to occasionally reflect on how I would survive without it , and if life without that service does n’t seem to be much of a loss , I seriously look at removing it .
The lesson here is to consider what you really need and what you really do n’t , and live life accordingly .
2 . Want free food ?
Grow and catch your own
My family was able to survive over long periods of neither parent having employment because we all knew how to grow food in our enormous garden ( multiple acres , literally ) , catch fish in abundance , hunt , do small - scale farming , and even more importantly , how to prepare the food and store it long - term even without the use of electricity .
I know how to can vegetables and meats without much effort , I can hunt for various types of wild game , I can skin and prepare for eating pretty much any type of wild game and fish , I can quickly prepare a trot line for catching a lot of fish at once , and I can forage in any local wooded area for all sorts of things that are edible ( I ’m even going to do a photo diary of this in the somewhat near future ) .
This is what I did growing up .
These skills might seem trivial to you , but it ’s easy for me to envision scenarios where all of these skills could be huge money savers and even life savers .
If someone set off a low - grade nuclear weapon over the area where you live , killing the electrical grid in a two hundred mile radius and rendering your automobiles unable to run , what would you do ?
To me , knowing what to do then is a personal finance skill .
Let ’s get more realistic – what do you do if you have no money and need to put food on the table ?
Many people would seek out a charity or maybe even steal ?
Me ?
I ’d head to the vegetable garden or , lacking that , head to the woods or to a pond .
The lesson here is to practice basic skills when you have the chance , because they come in handy when you need them most .
3 . You really do n’t need much for entertainment
When I think back to those days , almost all of the fun things we did cost nothing at all .
My most enjoyable childhood memories were all free things : building complex irrigation systems in the mud in the garden , jumping off the garage roof and learning how to roll when I hit the ground , sitting on the porch and
talking to my grandfather about
his bootlegging days , reading books from the nearest library ( my mother used to drop me off there during her shopping runs ) , and so on .
This was true for the adults as well .
My father spent his time mostly discovering ways to fish creatively with almost no equipment ( homemade trot lines , using garbage as bait ( which worked surprisingly well ) , and so forth ) and making his garden the envy of everyone around .
My mother absolutely loved to prepare and store foods that we grew , caught , and found ; now that it ’s just my mother and father living at home alone , she cans more food each year than they could ever possibly eat ( and I catch some of the overflow , actually ) .
In my early adult life , I got caught up in some very expensive entertainment , simply because I had more money than I had ever even comprehended in my life to that point .
Now that I ’m older , I realize that most of the things I really truly enjoy have very little cost – reading , preparing food , and so on .
I guess the lesson here is to appreciate hobbies and entertainment that have little expense .
Kaiser Permanente ’s $ 4 - billion effort to computerize the medical records of its 8.6 million members has encountered repeated technical problems , leading to potentially dangerous incidents such as patients listed in the wrong beds , according to Kaiser documents and current and former employees .
At times , doctors and medical staff at the nation ’s largest nonprofit health maintenance organization have n’t had access to crucial patient information , and system outages have led to delays in emergency room care , the documents show .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Saturday February 17 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 31 words Type of Material : Correction
Electronic medical records :
An article in Section A on Thursday about Kaiser Permanente ’s electronic medical records project misspelled the name of the company ’s chief executive .
It is George Halvorson , not Halverson .
Other problems have included malfunctioning bedside scanners meant to ensure that patients receive the correct medication , according to Kaiser staff .
Concerns about Kaiser ’s effort , called Health Connect , recently led the California Department of Managed Health Care to request information about the project , a first step before a possible formal investigation .

The HMO ’s problems come as it plans to expand the computerized system over the next two years to nearly three dozen more hospitals -- most in California -- where the sickest patients are treated and ensuring patient safety is most difficult .
Currently , the system is fully rolled out only in two hospitals , Baldwin Park Medical Center and South Sacramento Medical Center .
Kaiser ’s effort , one of the largest and most ambitious electronic medical records projects in the country , is seen as a possible national model .
With evidence suggesting that digitized recordkeeping can lower health costs and save lives , President Bush is pushing for every American to have an electronic medical record by 2014 .
But the glitches illustrate the difficulties a massive healthcare provider might encounter trying to implement a complex computerized system .
Kaiser officials acknowledge that Health Connect has had technical challenges but say those have been resolved and patient safety has never been compromised .
Patients should feel safe getting care at any Kaiser facility , they say .

They add that medical staff revert to paper records and established downtime procedures when the new computerized system is n’t available .
“ This is one of the largest and most ambitious efforts anywhere in the world to modernize our healthcare system , ” Kaiser Chief Executive George Halverson said .
Considering that , he said , “ it could n’t be going better . ”
Kaiser ’s size -- millions of members , 12,000 physicians , 431 medical offices and more than three dozen hospitals covering nine states -- makes trying to go paperless a Herculean effort .
Some problems are inevitable .
And Health Connect has had early successes .
During routine data analysis using its digital records two years ago , Kaiser was the first to identify problems with Merck & Co. 's arthritis drug Vioxx , which was later pulled from the market after a study showed it increased the risk of heart attack .

Because the computerized system reminds women leaving doctors ’ offices to return for their mammograms on time , the number of women receiving timely tests has increased throughout the system , Kaiser said .
Moving beyond paper
Still , Kaiser ’s recent problems do not bode well for American medical providers as they seek to automate their record - keeping , analysts say .
Nine out of 10 doctors nationwide continue to use paper records , making it difficult for providers to share patient information .
Computerized records that contain patient appointments , medical charts and electronic prescriptions have the potential to speed up the delivery of care , lower costs and reduce routine errors that are blamed for 98,000 deaths a year in the U.S. -- with 7,000 from prescription mistakes .

Computer - linked health systems also may help reveal the forces pushing up costs , make it easier to analyze the risks and benefits of prescription drugs and improve the understanding of dramatic variations in medical care and access to it .
They could reduce the nation ’s $ 1.9 - trillion healthcare bill by as much as $ 81 billion a year , according to a Rand Corp. report .
The question is how easily and safely providers can make the technological transition .
There are examples in which poorly designed electronic medical record systems may have increased errors rather than reduced them .
A 2005 study in the journal Pediatrics found that when the Children ’s Hospital of Pittsburgh installed an electronic medical system several years ago , mortality increased from 2.8 % of patients to 6.6 % .

Four years ago , Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles suspended its multimillion - dollar computerized physician order system after doctors complained it was possibly endangering patient safety and required too much work .
“ The challenges of [ building these systems ] have been way underestimated , ” said Dr. Ashish Jha , assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health , who did n’t comment on Kaiser ’s program specifically because he had n’t studied the project .
Internal Kaiser “ Availability Trend ” reports documenting the reliability of Health Connect over nine months last year found the system was available 88 % of the time some days , and less than 80 % in certain locations .
Experts say that rate is considered very low for the healthcare industry , which increasingly is aiming for systems with availability in the “ multiple nines ” or 99.99 % .

The risk of errors rises when medical staff switch procedures , like reverting to paper records .
Kaiser said its reliability statistics included all outages , even minor ones , and therefore were artificially lower than others in the industry .
A 772 - page problem report covering Feb. 27 through Nov. 5 of last year showed nearly two dozen reported instances in which Health Connect ’s unreliability may have risked patient safety .
These were discussed in notes contained in the documents that summarized medical staff ’s concerns and opinions from outside experts .
The incidents include :

* On March 14 , care for a patient at an emergency room in Baldwin Park was delayed when the system shut down for 1 hour and 19 minutes .
* On April 17 , a pharmacist at Kaiser ’s Zion Medical Center in San Diego , where the system has been partially rolled out , reported a “ potential patient safety issue ” when an order of medication for an infant in intensive care was n’t completed because the system went down for 19 minutes , forcing the staff to revert to manual processing .
* On Sept. 6 , staff at the South Sacramento hospital reported that lab orders were intermittently dropped in the system .
That forced workers to devise a patchwork solution to ensure the orders were completed until the problem was resolved , 5 hours and 29 minutes later .
By far , the biggest challenge occurred over several weeks in April and May , when much of the system was repeatedly unavailable , including once for nearly a day and another time for more than two days .

The main problem originated at Kaiser ’s primary data center in Corona , which houses Health Connect servers and backup power supplies .
Poor design of the system ’s technology infrastructure and power problems led to a series of crises , according to documents and interviews with Kaiser employees .
It was during this time that a rash of potentially risky events occurred , documents and Kaiser medical staff say .
A problem report during that time listed two events .
In one , patients at an unnamed Southern California hospital were listed in the wrong beds , potentially not getting the treatment they needed and possibly “ receiving the incorrect medications . ”
In another case , staff at the Baldwin Park Medical Center reported lab workers may have missed crucial patient requests from doctors .
Bruce Turkstra , Kaiser ’s interim chief information officer , confirmed the Corona mishap and said , “ There is no excuse for it . ”
But officials said Kaiser quickly corrected the problem by expanding its server center to another location in Los Angeles and fixed the underlying problem that led to the shutdown .

Turkstra added that the HMO had methodically researched all reported possible safety issues and , when needed , corrected the problems .
He said the system ’s availability has improved and now averages 99.2 % .
But several current and former Kaiser employees say the HMO has n’t corrected all its problems with Health Connect .
“ We were told this would be a panacea , but it ’s not that , ” said Justen Deal , a Los Angeles Kaiser project supervisor who worked on the new system .
He was placed on leave in November , after sending a critical e-mail about the project to most of the organization ’s 153,000 employees .
“ The truth is there are a lot of people inside the company who are worried the project is costing too much and is putting patients at risk , ” Deal said .

Adrienne Clements , a nurse at South Sacramento Medical Center , said parts of the new system work better than older paper records .
But she worries about several recent problems , including malfunctioning bedside scanners .
Clements said the hospital was considering replacing the machines .
Kaiser has a choppy history of trying to go digital .
In 2002 , it canceled a five - year effort to switch to electronic records , writing off $ 442 million .
Executives discovered it could n’t accommodate Kaiser ’s size .
In November , the HMO ’s then - chief information officer , J. Clifford Dodd , who arrived in 2002 largely to help implement Health Connect , left the organization .
Kaiser said the departure was n’t related to problems with Health Connect .
Health Connect also is costing a lot more than anticipated .
Its current price tag is more than double its original $ 1.8 - billion estimate , calculated in February 2003 .
Halverson said costs rose in part because Kaiser decided to add electronic medical records in all its hospitals later that year .
The board approved a $ 3.2 - billion budget in September 2003 .
But officials can’t fully explain why the budget figure they cite now is $ 800 million higher .

Nonetheless , the added costs come just as Kaiser faces myriad other financial pressures .
That has forced it to make wide - ranging cuts , which have been felt by Health Connect , employees said .
Kaiser recently demanded and received a rate cut from its technology vendors , and some IT employees took as long as a week off without pay .
Some current and former employees worry that such cuts may add to Health Connect ’s problems .
“ This is the worst [ technology ] project I have seen in my 25 years in the business , ” said Andrew Brewer , a systems analyst for Kaiser who worked on the project for two years before voluntarily leaving the HMO last week .
Brewer said the recent cuts saddled him and his colleagues with too much work and have led to employees ’ being asked to take on tasks they have n’t been trained for .

After visiting the 24 hour Apple store , I made my way down to Times Square and shot a bunch of night photos in the sub - freezing weather .
The streets were practially empty and at times it felt like I had the place all to myself .
Over the years the lights of Times Square seems to be getting brighter and the ads spreading to more city blocks .
Sometimes I really miss the grungy , neon version of Times Square from Midnight Cowboy and Taxi Driver .

The only permanent residents in the manicured , multigabled ranch east of Atlanta were illegal .
No , not that kind .
They were little green creatures of the cannabis family – in short , marijuana plants .
Raids on 40 houses in 12 suburban Georgia counties over the past two weeks are one recent sign of what police say is a national trend in marijuana marketing : growing the illicit crop year - round indoors , using suburban homes as " grow - houses . "
Grow - houses – a spacious incarnation of the old grow - room – have proliferated like suburban - garden gnomes , as antidrug squads have chased growers off remote mountainsides and out of cornfields .
In these basements , lights hum with thousands of watts across a sea of plants lodged in a hydroponic soup of nutrients .
Upstairs , there 's usually no furniture , police say , except a cot , a chair , and a rabbit - ear TV .
" It 's the most impressive thing I 've seen in 20 years of law enforcement , " says Lt. Jody Thomas of the Fayette County Drug Taskforce .
Police say the ' burbs give growers a degree of solace and safety , protected by suburbia 's premium on privacy and even a 2001 US Supreme Court ruling that prevents law officers from aiming heat - sensing equipment at homes unless they first obtain search warrants .
The trend also signals that " production is moving closer to consumption " – a path that leads straight to the suburbs , says Jon Gettman , editor of the Bulletin of Cannabis Reform in Lovettsville , Va. , which promotes legalizing marijuana for medicinal use .
Alarm about suburban pot -growing is rising , and some worry that efforts to eradicate crops grown outdoors are driving the illicit industry to become more entrenched in middle - class America , a la Showtime 's hit TV show " Weeds , " about a suburban mom who sells pot .
" This is horrifying , " says Sue Rusche , president of National Families in Action , which works to help children and teens resist drug use .
In the early 1980s , 80 percent of marijuana on US streets was imported , mostly from Mexico , according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) , which works to stop arrests of marijuana smokers .
Today , 40 percent of the supply is grown domestically – about half of it indoors under high - wattage lights that turn dank basements into sweltering hothouses .
While outdoor growing is risky and the results inconsistent , indoor growing , which began 30 years ago , has become a science , as amateur botanists produce potent varieties in controlled environments .
Experts say it was only a matter of time before syndicates began applying basic black - market principles : higher potency and consistent yields equal more profit .
" It 's Adam Smith 101 , " says Allen St. Pierre , executive director of NORML in Washington .
" In a world of prohibition , if you can grow it in your little suburban home and cure it properly , it goes right to the top of the market and you see an incredible level of profit that all the other dealers do n't enjoy . "
Here 's how it worked , according to Fayette County 's Lieutenant Thomas :
A wealthy buyer tied to a group of Cuban nationals in Miami bought homes in the endless suburbs of metro Atlanta .
So as not to raise suspicion , growers illegally cut into public utilities such as water and electricity .
Fences would go up in the backyards , and basement windows would be blacked over .
" Baby sitters " would arrive late at night in pickup trucks , often talking on cellphones .
Sometimes they would live in the homes on cots .
Harvested at 90 - day intervals , the cured " buds " fetched as much as $ 6,000 a pound in New York City , where most of the suburban Atlanta crop was shipped .
Police say a single house could yield more than $ 1 million in profit a year .
Others say the figure is probably lower because authorities often overestimate per-plant yields .
Georgia has lagged behind in indoor busts , with just one last year .
The US government eradicates some 3.5 million marijuana plants each year , mostly outdoors , according to the Drug Enforcement Administration .
Of some 800,000 marijuana - related arrests in 2005 , 90,000 were for trafficking or growing , according to the FBI .
The bureau does not further break out its numbers , but experts say growers by far make up the fewest number of arrests .
" We would never have found it without this tip from Florida , " says Thomas , referring to a similar series of busts of the same organization in the Miami area earlier this year .
" It 's so extravagant , yet it has some amount of legitimacy .
There 's often a car parked in the yard , but no traffic in and out , no buyers . "
Growers may have had several reasons for setting up shop in subdivisions like Summit Chase here in Snellville .
A key one , though , is the privacy ethos .
Darrell Lamb , a local high schooler , says the smell of pot would " slap me across the face " as he and some friends shot arrows in the nearby woods .
But he never called the police .
Pat Edwards , who lives across the street , says privacy and anonymity trumped suspicion of the " unfriendly " men who tended the house at 2851 Creekwood Drive , but who evidently did not live there .
" Nobody really speaks to each other on this street , and that 's how we all like it , " she says .
" Maybe these guys sensed that . "
Still , people talk .
Pre-bust , the biggest gossip in the neighborhood was how the house at 2851 Creekwood fetched one of the highest sales prices in the subdivision , $ 219,000 .
Post - bust , speculation centered on whether it would affect property values .
Closing up a yard sale across the street , Ms. Edwards struck a pragmatic note as she looks to leave the city for her childhood home in south Georgia .
" Maybe they want to buy my house , " she jokes .
" I 've got a big basement . "
My book on Security Engineering is now available online for free download here .
I have two main reasons .
First , I want to reach the widest possible audience , especially among poor students .
Second , I am a pragmatic libertarian on free culture and free software issues ; I believe many publishers ( especially of music and software ) are too defensive of copyright .
I do n’t expect to lose money by making this book available for free : more people will read it , and those of you who find it useful will hopefully buy a copy .
After all , a proper book is half the size and weight of 300 - odd sheets of laser - printed paper in a ring binder .
I ’d been discussing this with my publishers for a while .
They have been persuaded by the experience of authors like David MacKay , who found that putting his excellent book on coding theory online actually helped its sales .
So book publishers are now learning that freedom and profit are not really in conflict ; how long will it take the music industry ?
WASHINGTON , April 6 —
If the Democratic ascendance on Capitol Hill was supposed to usher in dark days for Republicans , it is hard to tell from talking to moderate ones like Mike Ferguson , who represents a suburban district in central New Jersey .
As the new Democrat - led House rushed to complete its business before adjourning for spring break this week , Representative Ferguson was marveling at the many bills that had been passed in Congress ’s first 100 days , including one that would make it easier for unions to organize and another that would increase the minimum wage .
“ Under the Republican majority , those bills would have never gotten to the floor , ” he explained before heading back to his district .
“ Now they have been brought to the floor , and I ’ve voted for them . ”
Mr. Ferguson ’s enthusiasm captures a peculiar political reality in the Capitol : many Republicans from swing districts in the Northeast are finding that life under Democratic rule has its advantages .
Which Con are you going to this year ?
GenCon ?
Origins ?
Dundracon ?
How about Ziggurat Con ?
The latter is brand new this year , and is being held at Camp Adder / Tallil Airbase on June 9 .
In Iraq .
When President Bush ordered troops to Iraq , he probably never imagined that he would be ultimately be responsible for what very well could be the very first D&D convention / game day ever held in a war zone .
Ziggurat Con , being held June 9 from 1200 to 2100 hours at Camp Adder / Tallil Airbase , is open to all allied military personnel and civilian contractors in Iraq .
" Here in Iraq , we do many things on the different Forward Operating Bases to help keep our spirits up , " said SPC David Amberson , the Con 's organizer .
" Here at Camp Adder / Tallil Airbase , we have lots of sports activities -- baseball , football , dodgeball , kickball -- and we work with many marathons across the US like the Boston Marathon .
This is a great way to improve morale among the troops , but what about those who prefer Role - Playing Games ? "
The Con 's historical landmark " mascot " -- the Ziggurat that gives the Con its name -- can be found on the post , and hails from the ancient city of Ur. Nearby is the house where it is believed that Abraham ( a large figure in the Bible , the Koran and the Torah ) was born .
Cool digs for a Con -- if not for the fact that there 's a war going on .
Amberson , however , emphasized the need for soldiers to relax and kick back with enjoyable activities from time to time .
" There is a deeper sense of camaraderie in a war zone than you see back home , " said Amberson , who is a supply soldier with Alpha Company , 86th Signal Battalion .
" You eat with these people , work with them on a daily basis , and can even share a tent with the same people .
When work is over for the day , we can sit back , relax , drink our favorite sodas , eat our favorite snacks , and play a bit of D&D .
This helps us relax in a very stressful environment .
We found a place where we can go somewhere far away from the IED 's , mortar attacks , and gunfire , without ever leaving the safety of our camp .
The next step was only logical . "
Miss Joy Brown , an employee with KBR who works with MWR ( the army 's Morale Welfare & Recreation Department ) has graciously allowed service members to use part of the Community Activity Center to hold the Game Day .
The Ping Pong room will be set up for RPGs ( Role - Playing Games , not to be confused with the rocket propelled grenades which share the same acronym ) , and the DVD Movie room will be playing Anime Movies all day in support of the event .
" Miss Brown has expressed her support of the soldiers who are planning this event , and who keep her in the loop , " said Amberson .
" In many events , MWR does the running around , trying to get supplies and support ; however , in this case , it is the service members themselves who are contacting the publishers and manufacturers .
This makes it a real event for the service members , by the service members . "
The largest problem with running a Con in Iraq , of course , is that there are no local stores or game publishers , and few game books on the post .
Even dice are in short supply , with many soldiers breaking the unwritten taboo held by many gamers and ( gasp ! ) sharing dice .
Thankfully , many game publishers have also lent their support , and have agreed to supply game products to help the Con along .
aethereal FORGE , Sovereign Press , Final Redoubt Press , Goodman Games , Paizo Publishing and Steve Jackson Games are among those that have thrown in their support for the convention .
But Amberson indicated that the soldiers could definitely use more .
" This convention is currently in drastic need of prizes and giveaways for the troops , " he said .
" Everything donated will go directly to the troops , or to MWR to use as loaner books for the soldiers . "

In a recent study , mathematician George Sparling of the University of Pittsburgh examines a fundamental question pondered since the time of Pythagoras , and still vexing scientists today : what is the nature of space and time ?
After analyzing different perspectives , Sparling offers an alternative idea : space - time may have six dimensions , with the extra two being time - like .
Sparling ’s paper , which was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A , lays the groundwork for his theory .
He explains how spatial dimensions contain positive signs ( e.g. , Pythagoras ’ 3D space is expressed as the sum of the squares of the intervals in three directions , x , y , and z ) .
Minkowski ’s time - like dimension , on the other hand , combines these three dimensions with the square of time displacement , which contains an overall negative sign .
“ In three dimensions , the formula reads s2 = x2 + y2 + z2 , ” Sparling explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ Our standard spacetime has four dimensions , but the formula has a critical minus sign : s2 = x2 + y2 + z2 - t2 .
The Lithuanian Hermann Minkowski invented this idea , which was published just six weeks before he died .
Indeed , [ Sir Roger ]
Penrose , for one , says that special relativity was not a finished theory until Minkowski 's famous Raum und Zeit [ ‘ Space and Time ’ ] paper . ”
Up until now , Sparling explains , most theories concerning extra dimensions have dealt with space - like rather than time - like dimensions , which results in a “ hyperbolic ” rather than an “ ultra - hyperbolic ” geometry .
However , Sparling notes that there are no a priori arguments for a hyperbolic geometry , and he looks into the possibility of a “ spinorial ” theory of physics , where six dimensions of space - time arise naturally .
“ In general dimensions , we say that the space - time is hyperbolic if there is only one minus sign in the formula for s2 , ” he said .
“ So , for example , in the ten dimensions of superstring theory , there are nine spatial dimensions with plus signs and one minus sign .
Only in that situation is there a clear - cut distinction between the future and the past . ”
Cartan ’s triality symbol links two twistor space and space - time .

“ In my case , I am led to the conclusion that the ordinary four dimensional space - time extends naturally into six dimensions : the four dimensional space is hyperbolic as usual , but in the surrounding space there are equal numbers ( 3 each ) of space and time dimensions , so the formula for s2 reads something like s2 = x2 + y2 + z2 - t2 - u2 - v2 , where u and v represent the new time variables .
I call this structure a ( 3 , 3 ) - structure ( mathematicians call it ultra-hyperbolic ) . ”
Space - Time is Spinorial
Sparling ’s spinorial theory is based on Einstein ’s general relativity and Elie Cartan ’s triality concept , which can link space - time with two twistor spaces .
Twistor spaces are mathematical spaces used to understand geometrical objects in space - time landscapes .
Sparling explains spinors in the following way :
“ In physics , the idea of a spinor stems from the finding that spectral lines of atoms seem to behave as if the angular momentum of the particles radiating photons was in half - integral units of the quantized spin ( whose size is determined by Planck 's constant ) .
This was fully explained by Dirac 's famous theory of the electron , which led him to successfully predict the existence of the positron . ”
Some spinorial particles include the electron , muon , tau , proton , neutron , quarks , neutrinos , and all their anti-particles , which are called fermions and have half - integer spins .
There are also non-spinorial particles , called bosons , such as the photon , graviton , pion , mesons , the W and Z bosons , the Higgs , ( if it exists ) and so on , which have an integer spin , Sparling explains .
“ The key difference between spinors and non-spinors is their behavior under rotations : typically , non-spinorial ( integer - spin ) particles return to their initial value under a 360 - degree ( or 2π - radian ) rotation ; however , the spinorial ( half - integer - spin ) fermions actually change sign under a 360 - degree rotation , requiring a full 720 - degree rotation to get back to their initial values .
This is completely foreign to our naive idea of how rotations work , and yet it is a basic part of reality .
“ Consider this analogy : if you take a plate and hold it in one hand horizontally whilst twisting it under your arm backwards through 360 degrees , your arm ends up in the air after one rotation , and it needs another 360 degree rotation to get it back to the beginning , ” he said .
Twistors , then , are a special kind of spinor first introduced by Penrose ( Sparling was a PhD student of Penrose ) .
In Sparling ’s theory , the two twistor spaces are each six - dimensional , forcing space - time to also have six dimensions , in accordance with Cartan ’s unifying triality .
Because the twistor spaces ’ geometry is ultra- hyperbolic , the extra dimensions are time - like .
“ My work has three six - dimensional spaces which at one level are on an equal footing and which are bound together by a new transform , which I call the Xi-transform , ” Sparling said .
“ Two of these spaces can be understood at the space - time level as twisters .
Then the third space can be given a space - time interpretation , but only if we have two extra dimensions : so it is the requirement of symmetry between the spinor spaces and the space - time that dictates that the extra dimensions be there . ”
A Harmonious Concinnity
While the concepts of twistor theory and spinors have been previously investigated as an alternative to space - time , Sparling explains how his new proposal is slightly different because it ’s not a complete replacement of space - time .
Rather , the guiding principle of his idea is that of a harmonious combination of three entities , or a “ trinity . ”
Each part of the theory reinforces the other parts .
“ If one accepts that there are these three spaces [ space - time and two twistor spaces ] that are central to my theory , one looks for a theory which unifies them ; this would be the ‘ concinnity ’ , ” he explained .
“ An indicator that there might be such a theory comes from the theory of Jordan algebras , which naturally unifies the three spaces into a twenty - seven dimensional whole , called an exceptional Jordan algebra . ”
Sparling ’s student Philip Tillman and ex-students Dana Mihai , Devendra Kapadia and Suresh Maran also played a significant role related to this work .
“ A second indicator is that there are two radically different descriptions of massless particles , such as the photon : the standard one uses Fourier analysis in space - time and another uses twistor theory and sheaf cohomology , ” he added .
“ The mathematical formalisms used in these two different descriptions are so different that it is simply amazing that they are describing the same basic physics .
The concinnity would provide an explanation for this .
This would then unify twistor theory , space - time theory and string theory — this is very tentative , however .
“ A very interesting aspect is that Newton fought strongly against the idea of the trinity ( in a religious context ) , ” Sparling noted .
“ It is ironic that I am invoking that very same idea in the context of gravity : perhaps Newton saw that the concept could be used in physics , but because he could not think of such a use he rebelled strongly against it ( of course , I have no evidence for this ! ) . ”
Although the theory is not definitive , Sparling explains that several major ideas in current physics would likely play a role ( such as condensed matter physics , category theory , non-commutative geometry , string theory , and the structure of superfluids ) .
Such connections might also point the direction to a unified theory , though currently speculative .
“ My work can be seen as a strong antidote to the present air of pessimism surrounding modern fundamental physics , ” Sparling said .
“ As is well - known , string theory has been roundly criticized for its lack of predictive power .
String theorists have been reduced to an absurd reliance on the anthropic principle , for example .
Here I have a clear - cut prediction , which goes against the common wisdom , which gives experimenters a target to go for : first find the extra dimensions , then decide their signature ( a very tough homework assignment ! ) .
Of course I could be proved wrong , but the effort to decide is surely worthwhile .
“ Actually , in the area of philosophy , I am in opposition to string theory , ” he said .
“ It is a top down theory : dream up something that works in some high dimension and then try to finagle some way of reducing to fit in with the lower - dimensional theory .
My approach is bottom up : take the existing four - dimensional theory seriously and try to build up from it .
This is very tough to do .
Hopefully my ideas work .
Note that my work only constitutes a possible beginning at a more inclusive theory . ”
Sparling continues to explore the ideas of this 6 - D time - like spinorial theory of space - time , with support from a workshop at the BIRS Institute in Banff , Canada , and ideas from philosophers including Alexander Afriat , Steve Awodey , Jonathan Bain and Rita Marija Malikonyte - Mockus .
He predicts that experimental investigations in the near future — such as the Large Hadron Collider — might uncover the extra dimensions .

TOKYO – The secret behind Japan 's plunging birth rate ?
A record 39.7 per cent of Japanese citizens ages 16 - 49 have not had sex for more than a month – up five percentage points from two years ago – according to a survey published this week by the Japan Family Planning Association .
Among married couples , the rate was only slightly lower , at 34.6 per cent .
" This is very bad news for the country 's birth rate , and something the government needs to look into urgently , " said Dr. Kunio Kitamura , the family planning association 's director .
The survey comes amid concerns over Japan 's faltering birthrate , which fell in 2005 to a record low of 1.26 births in an average woman 's lifetime .
The decline has stoked fears of impeding tax revenue shortfalls and labour shortages .
" The situation is dismal , " Kitamura said .
" My research shows that if you do n't have sex for a month , you probably wo n't for a year . "
Kitamura partly blamed stress from busy working lives .
A decline in physical communication skills in an increasingly web - based society was also a factor , he said .
The association said it handed out survey forms to 2,713 randomly selected people , and received responses from 636 men and 773 women in November 2006 .
It gave no margin of error .
In a similar poll taken two years ago , 35 per cent reported having no sex for a month .
Japan came last in a 29 - country study of sexual satisfaction published by the University of Chicago last year , with a mere 25.7 per cent of lovers expressing satisfaction in bed .
The country was also in last place among 41 countries in a 2005 poll by condom manufacturer Durex , with people having sex just 45 times a year compared to a global average of 103 .
BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat and 1xtra's TXU asked 25,000 people , mostly aged 17 to 34 , how they felt about their bodies .
Almost half the women surveyed said they had skipped a meal to lose weight , while 8 % had made themselves sick .
Eating disorder experts said it was " sad but not surprising " that young people felt and acted in such ways .
It 's so important for people to develop a healthy perception of their bodies
Beating Eating Disorders spokeswoman
The survey found two thirds of those who are size 14 also thought they were overweight or fat .
Even with the celebrity emphasis on being size zero ( UK size four ) , fewer than one in a hundred of those surveyed said they were that size .
Given the choice of ultra-skinny , thin and curvaceous , both men and women rated a curvy Martine McCutcheon as having the best body .
Half of the women questioned said there was " lots they would change " about their bodies - and more than 10 % " hated " what they looked like .
Plastic surgery
Many people said they were trying to change their looks .
More than 20 % of female respondents said that they were on a diet , compared with fewer than 10 % of men .
And more than 50 % of female respondents said they would consider having plastic surgery , compared with less than a quarter of men .
Breast enlargement was the most popular operation for women , while liposuction was the next most popular .
Liposuction and nose jobs were the most common choices for men .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Girls are constantly told by the media that they only have value if they have a slim body

More than half of girls aged 12 to 16 felt that their body image either stops them from getting a boyfriend or from relaxing in a relationship .
Male view
Young men also appear to feel the pressure to look good .
About 20 % of those in their early 20s said that they have taken protein supplements in a bid to help themselves bulk up , compared with 11 % of over 35s .
Marilyn Monroe would be trying to diet herself to a size zero if she was on the cinema screen now , which is such a shame
Deanne Jade
Psychologist
And when asked to rate photos of differently shaped male bodies , almost 80 % of men and 65 % of women favoured a very muscular physique .
Deanne Jade , a psychologist specialising in eating and body image issues , said the problems started with the emergence of thin models , such as Twiggy , in the 1960s .
" I think that was the start of a progression towards increasingly thinner role models .
Marilyn Monroe would be trying to diet herself to a size zero if she was on the cinema screen now , which is such a shame . "
Dr Terry Apter , a psychologist at Cambridge University , said : " This does signal a great dissatisfaction with the body , a concentration on the body and a sense that there 's some ideal which they should reach .
" And they seem to think that if they were just a bit better physically , their lives would be better which is very harmful . "
A spokeswoman for Beating Eating Disorders , formerly the Eating Disorders Association , said there were an estimated 1.1 million people in the UK with eating disorders .
She said : " It is sad to read such statistics but not that surprising for us as we receive many calls from the age group mentioned and a lot younger .
" Research says that typical age of onset for an eating disorder is 14 to 25 .
Young people are affected by many issues at this present time with issues such as exams , bullying , family pressures .
" It 's so important for people to develop a healthy perception of their bodies and to raise their self esteem and to develop positive ways of coping with the difficulties that life can bring . "

The Features of DocBookWiki
DocBookWiki can display DocBook documents online .
Different from the other applications , which convert a DocBook document into HTML first , in order to display it online , DocBookWiki converts it on the fly , so that the format for saving the document will still be XML ( DocBook ) .
In order to do this efficiently , DocBookWiki splits it first into chunks , according to chapters , sections etc .
It can also display a list of books , and for each book it can support multiple languages ( translations ) .
When the reader is reading a certain section of a book and he changes the language , he will see the same section in the selected language .
DocBookWiki can also be used to edit a DocBook document online , from the web .
Editing is done one section at a time , so the editor selects first the section that he wants to edit , and then edits it .
He can edit it in several modes : text ( like wiki ) , xml ( the original format ) , html , latex , texi , etc. , whichever is more suitable for him .
The changes , however , are always saved in the XML ( DocBook ) format .
Authentication of the editors ( with username , password ) can be enabled as well , if necessary .
Also , different editing permissions can be assigned to editors .
It allows the viewers of a document to download the document in other formats , like PDF , RTF , Plain HTML , LaTeX , PS , etc. which can be generated automatically from the DocBook format .
DocBookWiki will also try to keep a history of all the modifications made to the document , by keeping the document chunks in CVS , and so keeping track of all the changes .
The features of DocBookWiki can be summarized like this :
Can display a DocBook document online .
Can display several documents at once ( a list of books ) .
Can display each of them in several languages .
Allows to edit a certain section of a certain book in a certain language .
Editing can be done in several modes , like text , html , xml , texi , latex etc .
The basic format is always DocBook ( XML ) , no matter how it is displayed or edited .
Each document ( in each language ) can be converted automatically into other formats ( like PDF , RTF , LaTeX , etc. ) for downloading .
All the history of modifications is kept ( in CVS ) and any previous versions of a document can be recovered ( by tag or by date ) by the admin of the site .
Authentication of editors can be enabled and admin can assign different access rights and permissions to the editors .
In short , DocBookWiki will be like a wikiwiki which saves the content in XML ( DocBook ) format .

A futuristic - looking robot suit that has its own mechanical " limbs " may help paralyzed patients walk again .
The robotic exosuit , called HAL for “ Hybrid Assistive Limb , " was originally developed in Japan , but has now been tested on paralyzed patients at the Center for Neurorobotic Movement Training in Bochum , Germany .
When a person wants to move , the brain sends a signal through the spinal cord and the nerves that surround it , to a muscle in a body part such as a leg or an arm .
However , in paralyzed patients , these spinal nerve structures are damaged , and the muscles operate with signals that are too weak to reach the leg or the arm .
This is why these patients cannot walk or move certain body parts .
[ Super - Intelligent Machines : 7 Robotic Futures ]
But the HAL robot suit can actually pick up these weakened signals through sensors that are attached to a patient 's skin , and can set its motors , located in the pelvic and knee - joint regions , in motion .
This effectively connects the robotic suit to the patient 's nervous system and helps the individual to regain some mobility .
" This exoskeleton robot suit differs from other exoskeleton systems in its unique and successful neuronal control directly by the patient , " said Dr. Thomas Schildhauer , medical director at the Bergmannsheil , a university hospital in Bochum .
" [ T ] he patient is in ' direct control ' of the robot and is not passively moved by the robotic exoskeletal system . "
The robot suit is already being used at the Bergmannsheil by paraplegic , quadriplegic , stroke and muscular dystrophy patients in controlled trials , he said .
( Paraplegic patients can move their arms , hands and fingers , whereas quadriplegic patients have limited movement or no movement from the neck down . )
" In some subgroups of spinal cord injury patients the application is already very successful , whereas the other patient groups are still under formal investigation , " Schildhauer told Live Science .
Schildhauer was surprised by " the amount of functional gain in some subgroups of chronic spinal cord injury patients , " he said .
For instance , a wheelchair - bound patient may be able to walk short distances with the support of a walking frame after training with the exosuit five times a week for three months , the researchers said .
The Bergmannsheil is the only hospital in Germany where the robot suit has been used .
Similar suits have been tested in about 200 geriatric rehab centers in Japan .
The HAL was developed by Dr. Yoshiyuki Sankai , a professor in the Graduate School of Systems and Information Engineering at the University of Tsukuba in Japan .
Sankai also founded Cyberdyne Inc. ( from " cybernics " — an interdisciplinary research field that incorporates cybernetics and other disciplines ) , a company that produces the HAL .
Sankai designed the robot " for the benefits of humankind in the field of medicine , caregiving , welfare , labor , heavy works , entertainment and so on , " according to Cyberdyne 's website .
Sankai has said in the past that he aims to create new technologies that will benefit people and not serve to destroy them .
For instance , he reportedly rejected offers from the U.S. Department of Defense and the government of South Korea to develop robots for military use .
Research describing the application of the robot suit in paralyzed patients was published in April in the Spine Journal .

Quantum computer set up .
Image credit : Mark Tame .
Finding a way to build a quantum computer that works more efficiently than a classical computer has been the holy grail of quantum information processing for more than a decade .
“ There is quite a strong competition at the moment to realize these protocols , ” Mark Tame tells PhysOrg.com .
The latest experiment performed as a collaboration by a Queen ’s University theoretical group and an experimental group in Vienna has “ allowed us to pick up the pace ” of quantum computing .
The joint project ’s experiment is reported in Physical Review Letters in an article titled , “ Experimental Realization of Deutsch ’s Algorithm in a One - Way Quantum Computer . ”
“ This is the first implementation of Deutsch ’s Algorithm for cluster states in quantum computing , ” Tame explains .
Tame along with members of the Queen ’s group in Belfast , including Mauro Paternostro and Myungshik Kim joined a group from the University of Vienna , including Robert Prevedel , Pascal Böhi , and Anton Zeilinger ( who is also associated with the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information at the Austrian Academy of Sciences ) to perform this experiment .
“ When performing a quantum algorithm , ” says Tame , “ the standard approach is based on logical gates that are applied in a network similar to classical computing . ”
Tame points out that this method of quantum computing is not practical or efficient .
“ Our quantum computer model uses cluster states , which are highly entangled multi-partite quantum states . ”
The Irish and Austrian group ’s quantum computer makes use of four entangled photons in a cluster state .
Tame explains how it works :
“ Our setup is completely based on light , where quantum information is encoded on each photon .
The information is in the polarization of each photon , horizontal or vertical , and superpositions in between .
An ultra-violet laser pumps a crystal and produces an entangled pair of photons in one direction .
The laser beam then hits a mirror and bounces back to form another pair of entangled photons on its second passage through the crystal .
These four photons are then made to interact at beamsplitters to form the entangled cluster state resource on which we perform the quantum computation . ”
Next ,
Tame says , come the calculations .
“ We perform Deutsch ’s Algorithm as a sequence of the measurements .
When you measure in a specific basis , you can manipulate the quantum information in the photons using their shared entanglement . ”
He continues with an illustration related to classical computing : “ You can think of the cluster state as the ‘ hardware ’ , and the measurements as the ‘ software ’ . ”
Now that the groups in Belfast and Vienna have proved that Deutsch ’s Algorithm works for a cluster - based quantum computer , the next step is to apply it to larger systems .
“ Right now it ’s really just a proof of principle , ” explains Tame .
“ We ’ve shown it can be done , but we need to build larger cluster states and perform more useful computations . ”
Tame admits that this next step is where it gets trickier .
“ Quantum systems like this can be influenced by small fluctuations in the environment .
It can be difficult to get accurate computations using larger resources . ”
He says that noise resistant protocols need to be developed in order to maintain the coherence of the quantum information .
“ There ’s not a lot of noise in the lab during the implementation of experiments on small numbers of qubits .
But as we increase this number there are physical and technological concerns that need to be solved .
This is a key issue . ”
And does
Tame have any idea how to solve some of these issues ?
“ We have some schemes at the moment .
It ’s a work in progress . ”
He pauses .
“ But for now it ’s exciting to have this proof that quantum computing can be efficiently performed with Deutsch ’s Algorithm . ”

Jack , John and Joe are talking about games .
Jack has played a new game .
He likes it .
He tells John and Joe , who , knowing Jack 's reputation for giving games a fair , balanced review , and that their tastes and his are often similar , decide that it 's a game they should try .
So , based on Jack 's recommendation , they buy the game , as do several other people who have been listening in .
These kinds of conversations are the stuff of legend in the advertising community .
Getting a consumer so excited about your product that he 'll tell others to buy it is essentially free advertising , and the most effective form besides .
Marketers call it " buzz , " and they track it as religiously as brokers follow the stock ticker .
They even try to create it , by sending trained salespeople , or " shills " into places where normal people congregate in order to get those normal people talking about their product .
These days , the tactic has moved online .
Jack , John and Joe are all members of an internet community forum .
Their conversation is not taking place in one workplace , but several ; each of them is typing his part of the conversation onto his computer and posting it on the forum .
Each message is then read by more people in other workplaces , some of whom live across the globe .
John and Joe visit the site during their off - hours , or from their desks , when they should be working .
Jack , however , actually is working when visiting the site .
His job is to post messages to internet forums frequented by people like John and Joe , and to convince them to buy products represented by his employers .
Jack is an internet shill .
Jack is what is called an " Online Guerilla Marketer , " or " OGM , " and his name is n't Jack .
He 's agreed to speak to The Escapist on the condition that we not identify him .
Like an undercover cop or secret agent , Jack 's effectiveness at his job depends on his ability to remain anonymous .
He 'll often spend days , even weeks , infiltrating a community to earn the trust of its members before he strikes - inserting a recommendation in the right place , at the right time to generate interest in the products he represents .
A typical day for Jack starts with checking " to make sure I have n't been discovered , " he says .
" I check logs and IP pings , and I revisit forums and posts I recently made for comments .
I return to the threads , chat rooms or other places and respond to posts I have already made .
I then go through and talk like a normal poster would - commenting on other subjects , talking about politics , throwing in some wood into a flame war , etc. - pretty much just to fool anyone that might be suspicious of my activities to show them that I 'm a ' real ' person and not some corporate shill .
" I have to flow along with the community and react to the changes which will change the way I post .
The point is to completely blend in with the community , whether it is a place normally visited by 15 - year - old suburban males who like rap and videogames , or a stay - at - home wife community that supports each other 's problems with their husbands and diapers .
My personalities range from a 10 - year - old girl to a 78 - year - old man and across different ethnicities , stereotypes and ages . "
Jack has been living the life of a corporate - sponsored internet secret - agent for " about four years , employed by two different companies , " he says .
In that time he 's used his clandestine tactics and marketing know - how to shill " about 20 products - mostly videogames , websites , computer hardware and a few other small products . "
He declines to name names for fear of damaging his reputation in the industry and those of the companies he 's represented .
Because , in spite of how good he is at his job , in spite of how many companies employ his services - and those of people like him - OGMs are often looked upon as pariahs by the very people to whom they are trying to connect .
At a time when most consumers are becoming more and more media savvy , the OGM is viewed by many advertising firms as a weapon of last resort and by the denizens of the internet forums the OGM is tasked to infiltrate as a threat to the very existence of the internet community itself .

Girls typically outdo boys at school - and now they 're leading the field in a particularly worrying way .
They make far more effective bullies than the boys , a study has found .
While boys display their physical strength , girls use psychological warfare to dominate their victims .
Do you think girls are worse bullies than boys ?
Tell us in the reader comments below
And that can leave lifelong emotional scars .
Being bullied as a girl can lead to difficulty in building relationships , over - protectiveness of their own children and even falling victim to workplace bullying .
The findings are the result of a study by educational psychologist Dr Valerie Besag , who filmed a group of 11 - year - olds in their final year of primary school in the North - East of England over 16 months at a lunchtime club .
" Basically , it 's all about jealousy , " she said .
" Female bullying is worse than male bullying because it is more personal , more psychological and much more emotionally destructive .
" Those scars are much more difficult to heal than cuts and bruises . "
The power of the so - called queen bee over other girls was the subject of the popular 2004 film Mean Girls , starring Lindsay Lohan .
The film saw girls being ranked from the ' skanky sluts ' at the bottom of the pile to the ' plastics ' at the top - the attractive cheerleaders who dated all the most popular boys .
Dr Besag 's study , part of the research for her book , Understanding Girls ' Friendships , Fights And Feuds , found that such insidious nastiness was not so far removed from reality .
She discovered that while girls rarely resort to violence , they can subtly eat away at the confidence of a victim and leave her isolated .
She said boys begin to use physical power to assert themselves by eight or nine , which later becomes the kind of behaviour seen in pub brawls .
" Men want to display in front of an audience , throughout life they are continually reasserting their dominance , " she said .
" Girls do it through friendship and manipulating friendships . "
She compared female friendships to the relationship between lovers who know all the minute details of each other 's lives - which can then be used as powerful weapons of gossip .
Appearance is all important ; a girl who is humiliated and called ' fatso ' goes on a diet and is then called ' stickpin ' .
" Girls just move the goal posts , " she said .
" They go right to the Achilles heel , it 's personal and they make sure you are socially ostracised . "
A Home Office study of girls aged 12 to 16 found that about a third had been bullied .
On average , some 16 bullying victims a year commit suicide .
Michele Elliott , director of Kidscape , said : " The impact of verbal bullying and all the emotional baggage that goes with it is much more damaging in the long term than a punch . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Home sales posted their sharpest drop in 18 years in March , a real estate group said Tuesday , as problems in the subprime mortgage sector pushed sales well below what economists had forecast .
Sales of existing homes fell 8.4 percent to an annual rate of 6.12 million in March from February 's 6.68 million rate , the National Association of Realtors said .
It was the biggest one - month drop since January 1989 .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast sales would fall to an annual rate of 6.45 million in March .
David Lereah , the Realtors ' chief economist , said that bad weather earlier in the year may have cut down on sales that closed in March .
But he acknowledged a hit from tighter lending standards in the subprime mortgage sector , which most likely made it more difficult for buyers without topflight credit to get financing to buy a home .
" We may be seeing some losses as a result of the subprime fallout , " he said in a statement .
" It 's too early to measure a significant impact from tighter lending standards , which should moderately dampen activity . "
Still , Lereah said low mortgage rates and reduced prices from sellers wary of the soft market should help sales to gradually improve during the second half of this year .
He said weak sales are " masking improved fundamentals in the housing market . "
But Phillip Neuhart , an economist with Wachovia , said it 's clear that potential home buyers are being spooked by the continued bad news about home sales and prices , as well as problems in subprime mortgages .
He pointed out that housing worries were one of the factors in the drop in the Conference Board 's consumer confidence index , also released Tuesday .
" It 's a headwind to their confidence , even if it 's not yet a headwind to their pocket book , " he said .
" Even if they 're not trying to sell their house or getting hammered with problems with a subprime mortgage , consumers can't ignore the headlines . "
Neuhart pointed out that the Conference Board 's question asking if consumers intend to buy a home in the next six months , found only 2.7 saying they are looking to buy in the April survey , which is down more than 20 percent from the 3.4 percent who were looking to buy only two months earlier .
" It 's a market a lot of consumers are frightened to enter , " he said .
And he said reports from home builders of a weak start to the spring home selling season suggest that the pace of sales will continue to fall through at least mid-year .
There were sharp drops in sales in every region of the country last month as the annual sales pace slowed to the weakest level since June 2003 , before the record sale and building boom that began that year .
The weakness in sales came despite the continued slide in home prices , which had been helping to lift sales in some previous reports .
The median home price slipped 0.3 percent to $ 217,000 from a year earlier , the group said .
It was the eighth straight month that measure has fallen and the ninth decline in the last 10 months .
Before the current housing price slump , it had been 11 years since the group had reported a year - over - year decline in median prices .
Half of homes sell for more and half sell for less .
Earlier this month the trade group projected that 2007 would be the first year to show a decline in the nearly 40 years that it has tracked prices .
And the weakness in home prices , coupled with recent gains in the stock market , is making people less eager to buy into the market that had once been seen as a much safer investment .
" It 's just not nearly as tempting a market to buy a home , " said Neuhart .
Since the housing boom went bust last year , sales and prices have gotten hammered by a glut of homes on the market .
While home inventories shrank 1.6 percent last month from February and are now down about 3 percent from the record highs hit last July , they 're still up 17 percent from a year ago .
Even with that recent dip , the weaker sales mean that it would still take 7.3 months to work off the supply of houses on the market , up from 6.8 months in February .
A year ago there was only a 5.6 month supply of homes available for sale .
The reading does not include new home sales , which will be reported by the Census Bureau on Wednesday .
That sector has also been battered by the glut of homes on the market and the problems in subprime mortgages .
Earlier this month , No. 2 home builder D.R. Horton ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) reported a 37 percent drop in the number of new homes it sold in the latest quarter , citing continued weakness in prices and saying the typical start to the spring home buying season has n't begun .
While Horton is expected to still report a profit for the period , No. 3 builder Pulte Homes ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) reported a loss in its latest quarter as did No. 4 Centex ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and New Jersey - based Hovnanian Enterprises ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
No. 1 home builder Lennar ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and No. 5 KB Home ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) both reported losses in their quarters ending in November , although both returned to an operating profit in the next quarter .
The CEO of KB Home said earlier this month that he expects the housing slump to get worse .

Bible - based criticism of evolution , once limited to Protestant fundamentalists in the United States , has become an issue in France now that Pope Benedict and some leading Catholic theologians have criticized the neo-Darwinist view of creation .
An Islamist publisher in Turkey mass - mailed a lavishly illustrated Muslim creationist book to schools across France recently , prompting the Education Ministry to proscribe the volume and question the way the story of life is taught here .
The Bible and the Koran say God directly created the world and everything in it .
In Christianity , fundamentalists believe this literally but the largest denomination , Catholicism , and most mainline Protestant churches read it more symbolically .
This literalism led Christian fundamentalists to reject the theory of evolution elaborated in the 19th century by Charles Darwin , the foundation stone of modern biology .
Muslim scholars also dispute evolution but have not made this a major issue .
“ There is a growing distrust of science in public opinion , especially among the young , and that worries us , ” said Philippe Deterre , a research biologist and Catholic priest who organized a colloquium on creationism for scientists at the weekend .
“ There are many issues that go beyond strictly scientific or strictly theological explanations , ” he said at the colloquium in this university town southwest of Paris .
Deterre ’s Blaise Pascal Network promotes understanding between science and religion .
Barred from teaching creationism in U.S. public schools , some conservative Christians now advocate the “ intelligent design ” argument that some forms of life are too complex to have simply evolved .
Scientists call this creationism in disguise .
These American concerns caught notice in Europe after Vienna Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn , a confidant of Pope Benedict , attacked neo-Darwinist theories in 2005 in what seemed to be a move to ally the Catholic Church with “ intelligent design . ”
GROWING ISSUES IN FRANCE
These theoretical debates became a pressing issue in France last month when schools unexpectedly received free copies of an “ Atlas of Creation ” by Turkish Islamist Harun Yahya that blames Darwinism for everything from terrorism to Nazism .
Herve Le Guyader , a University of Paris biology professor who advised the Education Ministry on the Atlas , said high school biology teachers needed more training now to respond to the increasingly open challenges to the theory of evolution .
“ It ’s often taught in a simplistic way , ” he said .
“ We have to give them the philosophical arguments they need to respond . ”
Paleontologist Marc Godinot said creationists and their critics drew overblown conclusions from a theory that explains how life developed but not how it was created .
The ultimate origin of life is not a question science can answer , he said .
Creationists reject evolution because some scientists say the role of chance in it proves that life has no final meaning .
“ We have to decode this , but that ’s a job for philosophers and theologians , ” Godinot said .
“ Creation is actually a big mystery . ”
Jacques Arnould , a Catholic priest who works at France ’s National Center for Space Research , said Christians in Europe should not look down with bemusement at creationists abroad .
“ They are believers , as we are , ” the Dominican theologian told the meeting of about 100 , mostly Catholic scientists with a few Muslims as well .
“ There are Christian , Muslim and Jewish approaches that we have to respect . ”
Arnould said the question of life ’s purpose arose naturally in biology class but science could not answer it .
Instead of offering simple creationism , he said , theologians should develop views that respect modern science and faith in a divine purpose .
He said Catholic thinkers should update “ natural theology , ” the teachings of Saint Thomas Aquinas ( 1225 -1274 ) that married philosophy and science in a view that dominated European thought until the 18th - century Enlightenment divorced the two fields .
“ Natural theology was based on the knowledge of the time , ” said Arnould .
“ That knowledge keeps changing , so natural theology has to change too . ”
At a SXSW panel called " Reinventing Payment Models for Digital Music , " Cambridge - educated economist - turned - music - manager ( Pink Floyd , The Clash , Ian Dury And The Blockheads , Billy Bragg )
Peter Jenner put a figure on how much each music fan who buys music would have to pay for access to every song ever recorded while maintaining or increasing music sales .
He said that $ 50 per year from every person who listens to music would " meet or exceed the current over the counter sales of the music industry at a far lower cost , " but that because of deeply - entrenched flaws in the outmoded business models used by the labels that have evolved over the years , we 're unlikely ever to see such a system put in place – despite the fact that it would increase profits while allowing people far greater access to music .

How I Cracked the Golem Script by Jeremy Brown
I 'm currently a web applications programmer at Biola University , my alma mater .
I have an MA in Applied Linguistics .
My wife and I are starting the process of transitioning to Bible translation work .
I do n't have much experience with decipherment - I probably did some easy examples when I was a kid , and I did do a short paper on the history of encrypting texts when I was getting my MA .
When I was an undergrad , I took 4 semesters of Biblical Hebrew .
That , I think , is what helped me the most in discovering the solution to this puzzle .
I was surfing the Net when I noticed a link to Omniglot , which mentioned the $ 100 contest and linked to the Golem site .
" Half of man 's wisdom is knowing where it ends . "
I decided I should give it a try .
There was a Rosetta Stone , which I thought gave me a chance of success .
Trying to decode something without a plaintext correlated with it could be orders of magnitude harder , and I do n't think I would have gotten far if it were n't for the English text .
I read the forums , and saw the bit from the book about " May and her dad spelled it backwards , it still does n't fit " .
My first key decision was to solve right to left .
Several of these things made me think the writing direction might be right - to - left , not English 's left - to - right :
1. Hebrew was mentioned in the " making of the Script " section
2. Hebrew & the Script were used together on the cover
3 . The " spelled it backwards " bit from the book
4 . The fact that the Script looks Hebrewesque to me
So I started trying to solve the cipher by working right to left .
This was fairly easy for me to do , because of my experiences with Hebrew .
I counted up all the characters and saw that there were several more than the English characters .
I was n't counting spaces in the English text .
" Half of man 's wisdom is knowing where it ends . "
I thought the English text might be some kind of a clue .
I had a number of ideas :
1 . Is some of the text at the end junk text ?
2 . Do the arrowlike charcters > , < and .> change the direction of the text ?
3 . Do the | and || characters have some kind of function like punctuation ?
4 . Is half of the message written one way , and half the other way ?
I started looking for repeating patterns .
I circled some sets of characters that I thought might be digraphs or trigraphs .
Later on , my guesses proved to be wrong except for ><.
The little scroll which is posted in the forums , and the " reverse " of the scroll text , confirmed that >< was one character , and not two .
My second key achievement was to correctly guess the letter i .
The characters with lines over them reminded me of the vowels in Hebrew , which are lines and dots that go over and under characters to provide the vowel sound .
I looked and saw that the most frequent vowel in the English text was i , with 4 occurrences , and the most frequent " overlined " character also had 4 occurrences .
I tried that out , and the i's in English read left - to - right seemed to match the relative positions in the text as the overlined character in the Script .
None of the other characters with lines over them seemed to match the relative position of a vowel in the English text , though , so I decided the lines by themselves were n't relevant .
" Half of man 's wisdom is knowing where it ends . "
My third key decision was to compare character counts in English and Script .
I tried counting other frequent characters in the English text : s - 4 , n - 4 , i - 4 , e - 3 , o - 3 , w - 3 , m - 2 , d - 2 , h - 2 .
I noticed that one character repeated itself surrounding a single character in the Script : the sequence : >< > ><.
I looked for a similar sequence in the English text and found the " ere " in " where " , so I thought I could possibly identify >< with e .
The only problem was that e also occurs as the fourth character to the end in English , but >< only occurs third to the end in Script .
It also made sense that the little " word of creation " scroll in the forum might have a couple of e's in it , since it needed some vowels .
Based on the character count and on the relative positions in the two texts ( mirrored positions though , since they read opposite directions ) , I was able to correctly guess the assignment for i , n , s , d , w and a . " e " was also correctly assigned .
At that point I had something like this :
dsen ???i?e?e?wn?win???ism?d?is?wnsma???????a
I had some of the letters in the same general area ( reversed ) as in the English text .
But the words were switched around .
Somewhere in here , it dawned on me what was happening : the Script was written right - to - left , but each word in that order was scrambled up some .
After I looked at it a while , the answer finally dawned on me .
In a way , the text is written half one way and half the other .
The message is read right - to - left , but each pair of characters is read left - to - right !
I started drawing lines between the letters I knew :
ds | en | ?? | ?i | ?e | ?e | ?w | n? | wi | n? | ?? | is | m ? | d? | is | ?w | ns | ma | ?? | ?? | ?? | ?a
When read right - to - left , but in every segment left - to - right , the above line can be transliterated to read like normal English , that is left - to - right :
?a??????mans?wisd?m?is??n?win??w?e?e?i??ends
Probably if I had done a transformation like the one above on paper , instead of just in my head , I could have seen the remaining issues easier .
At this point it was pretty easy to identify o and f and the g in knowing .
The first line below shows the original , the second line is in English order .
ds | en | ?? | ?i | ?e | r e | ?w | ng | wi | no | ?? | is | m ? | do | is | ?w | ns | ma | f ? | ?o | ?f | ?a
?a?f?of?mans?wisdom?is??nowing?w r e?e?i??ends
I had scribbled in an r between the two e's ( marked in red above ) , and because of that I misidentified h .
I eventually realized that the r was really the h , and then I was able to make :
ha?f?of?mansw?isdom?is??nowing?where?i??ends
Only later I realized that the Script character that looks like a lowercase r was a " space " .
At that time I thought it was a " null " character , a placeholder to keep two letters from two different words from the same two - character segment .
I started putting X's in those spaces .
Half X of X mans X wisdom X is X knowing X where X it X ends
I was excited at this point that I had managed to figure it out .
This was after 3 hours of work .
Next I started working on applying the code to the new text .
The first line , " Wisdom has built her house " , went pretty easily .
I came across the first new characters at b and u in the word built .
I made a correspondence chart at the bottom of the page , and wrote the unknown Script and English letters over on the side .
The next line was harder .
There were several characters I did n't know , and could n't guess right away .
So after I 'd written down all the characters I knew , I started on line 3 , where I figured out p and c in " A prudent man conceals knowledge . "
My wife was going to bed , so I went in to show her how it was going , and that I had figured it out .
I showed her how the code worked , and she decided to stay up and help me plug the English letters in above the Script .
I told her since she was helping , I 'd split the loot with her if I won .
When it came to the line " ?e horse is prepared for ?e bat?le " , I realized that there was a single character in Script that stood for th in English .
And the weird character after t in " bat?le " proved to be a double - letter character : it stood for the double of whatever letter came before it , in this case a t , giving the word " battle " .
My wife identified the characters for y and v while I was busy writing down the English - order texts we 'd already done .
And she realized that the r character was a " space " , not a placeholder .
With the thrill of victory pulsing through my veins , I sent an email to Greg , and hoped someone had n't beaten me to the solution .
The entire time to solve was probably 4 1/2 hours of continuous work .
The next day , I got an email from Greg , confirming my success .
And it sounds like there is still more fun to be had !
Thanks ,
Greg , for this fun opportunity .
I look forward to reading Golem !
Mr Boyd is accused of stealing bras , knickers and stockings
Robert Boyd , 45 , from Broadlands in Carrickfergus , is accused of holding up staff at the Orchid shop in Belfast disguised in a wig , hat and glasses .
He told the court he had been involved in a role - playing game at the time , and his character was an elf named Beho .
He denies robbery but says he may have blurred reality and fantasy .
He also said it " could be right " that Beho had intended to rob the shop - although he told the jury he could not remember what was going through his mind at the time .
Japanese sword
He told defence counsel Anthony Cinnamond that within his small social circle he had been participating in a game known as Shadowrun .
The game was set in the future and the assumed characters were criminals , he said .
He told the court his character was a shaman , or magical elf , who carried a small Japanese sword as a weapon .
Mr Boyd , who said he visits a psychiatrist regularly , conceded that he " seemed to have blurred that line between reality and fantasy " .
" I can't believe that I personally did that ... and I deeply regret that .
" If I had sought some help I would 've avoided that in its entirety . "
Prosecutors claim that Mr Boyd knew " perfectly well " what he was doing on the day of the robbery and was " using this memory loss scenario to avoid answering very difficult questions " .
The lab technician , from Broadlands in Carrickfergus , denies one charge of robbery .
He is accused of stealing two sets of bras , knickers , suspender belts and stockings from the shop on Lisburn Road on 14 December , 2005 .
The case continues .

An episode of sci - fi cult show Star Trek , which predicts Irish reunification by 2024 , looks set to cause controversy at this year 's Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival in Belfast .
In the episode entitled ' The High Ground ' , which some Trekkie somewhere no doubts knows by heart , Dr Beverly Crusher while helping the wounded victims of a terrorist attack on " a non-aligned planet " is taken hostage .
The crew get in trouble while helping the wounded
In his musings about what happened to the Starship Enterprise 's chief medical officer , android Data says that Ireland would be reunified in 2024 as a result of a successful terrorist campaign .
Due to what no doubt many people will still consider to be sensitive content , the episode has never been shown on terrestrial TV in UK or in the Republic of Ireland and initial airings on Sky One were edited .
However , Sean Kelly , director of the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival , hopes its screening will attract " die hard Trekkies , and people of every political persuasion and none " .
" We 're not showing it in a partisan way , and we certainly do n't want it to be seen as any kind of propaganda .
We 're showing it because of the issues it raises in relation to censorship , " he said .
" It dates from 1990 , a time when songs , including one by the Pogues , were being banned and republican politicians ' voices being dubbed by actors .
" It 's hard to believe that but both the BBC and RTE refused to show it and it still has n't been shown on terrestrial TV in the UK or Ireland . "
The Star Trek : The Next Generation writers predicted Irish re-unification
He added that in addition to this " particular slice of sci- fi " , this year 's Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival promised " a hugely eclectic line - up which would satisfy most tastes " .

Radia Perlman may be the mother of the Internet , but Bruce Schnier is the mutha of the Internet .
Microsoft is effectively smuggling through a price hike for Windows Vista - by making the entry - level version so poor that no - one will want to use it .
So says Jim Wong , senior veep at Acer , the world 's number four PC maker , who told UK hack Jon Honeyball : " The new [ Vista ] experience you hear of , if you get Basic , you wo n't feel it at all .
There 's no [ Aero ] graphics , no Media Center , no remote control . "
Wong notes that the Premium Version of Vista is 10 per cent more expensive than XP Home .
This will increase PC build costs by 1 - 2 per cent , which the PC makers will have to soak up , he says .
But Acer has high hopes for the PC market next year , and Vista will play its part in fuelling sales , chairman JT
Wang told reporters attending the company 's 30th birthday this week .
His optimism is shared by other PC builders , which are racing to buy components for Vista - capable PCs .
This has created a supply shortage in the last couple of weeks for CPUs , DRAM , chipsets and lithium batteries , according to EMSNow .
JT
Wang is doing his bit to help out : he has been spotted at American vendors drumming up supplies for Acer , the electronics trade magazine reports . ®
Ruby on Rails 1.0 までは AWDwR 本を読んで使い方が解ってる人も多いと思うのですが、1.1 以降でどんな詳細な機能が加わったのかはあまり知られてません。
そのために ActiveSupport の CHANGELOG を淡々と読んでまとめてみました。間違ってる可能性もあるのでそういう箇所があったらご指摘下さい。
Add CachingTools :: HashCaching to simplify the creation of nested , autofilling hashes .
[ Nicholas Seckar ] CachingTools :: HashCaching という Hash を利用したシンプルなキャッシュ機能のモジュールが加わりました。このモジュールを利用したいクラスで extend して hash_cache : methodname とすると、そのメソッドが呼び出された時に結果が自動で methodname + cache * 1とい う Hash のインスタンス変数_に格納されます。そのため一度 obj.methodname( ' foo ' , ' bar ' ) と メソッドを呼び出した場合、 obj.methodname_cache[' foo ' ] [ ' bar ' ] に自動で結果が格納されています。
Added option to String # camelize to generate lower - cased camel case by passing in :lower , like " super_man " .camelidze ( : lower ) # => " superMan " [ DHH ] 先頭は cemel 化せずに それ以降を camel 化するための引数 : lower が追加されました。たぶ ん
RJS Template内部でよく使うために追加なのでしょう。 >> ' foo_bar'.camelize ( : lower ) => " fooBar "

It was a heck of a party and everyone was invited , from the executive vice president to the janitorial staff .
There was champagne , shrimp , cake , and even a string quartet .
There were door prizes , balloons , and all sorts of bank - branded knickknacks being given away .
And it was all for good reason : the bank had just completed its high - tech , sixty - five story downtown corporate headquarters , and it was the tallest building within a three - hundred mile radius .
Virtually no expense was spared for the bank 's skyscraper : a renowned architect was commissioned to design the building , skilled artisans adorned the corridors with marble statues , acoustical consultants made sure the lobby had just the right echo , and , most importantly , the world 's foremost security firm was brought in to lock things down tighter than Fort Knox .
It was considered less of a building and more of a work of art .
The pinnacle of this creation was the high - tech sliding doors used throughout the building ; this was the first time that StarTrek - esque doors were used on such a large scale .
Everyone thought the doors were incredibly cool .
Oh , and they were .
Upon entering a secure area ( that is , anywhere except the lobby ) , one simply waved his RFID - enabled access card across the sensor and the doors slid open almost instantly .
When leaving an area , motion detectors automatically opened up the doors .
The only thing that was missing was the cool " whoosh " noise and an access panel that could be shot with a phaser to permanently seal or , depending on the plot , automatically open the door .
Despite that flaw , the doors just felt secure .
That is , until one of G.R.G.'s colleagues had an idea .
He grabbed one of those bank - branded folding yardsticks from the freebie table and headed on over to one of the security doors .
He slipped the yardstick right through where the sliding doors met and the motion detector promptly noticed the yardstick and opened the door .
He had unfettered access to the entire building thanks to a free folding yardstick .
Immediately following the party , the bank announced that they would delay the opening " due to an unforeseen delay . "
When G.R.G. returned the following week , he noticed that the doors -- all 650 throughout the building -- were hastily retrofitted with poorly - cut metal flanges to cover up the small slit between the doors .
Looks like it's back to relying on phasers to breach the security .
Our world is numbered .
Books have ISBNs and products have barcodes .
Cars have VINs , even people have social security numbers .
Numbers help us reference items unambiguously .
“ John Smith ” may be many people , but Social Security Number 123-45-6789 refers to one person exactly .
A GUID ( globally unique identifier ) is a bigger , badder version of this type of ID number .
You may see the term UUID tossed about ( universally unique identifier ) , a nitpicky word for those whose numbers are unique not only within the globe , but throughout the entire universe .
Any way you title it , GUIDs or UUIDs are just big , gigantic ID numbers .
The Problem With Counting
“ We do n’t need no stinkin ’ GUIDs , ” you may be thinking between gulps of Top Ramen , “ I ’ll just use regular numbers and start counting up from 1 . ”
Sure , it sounds easy .
Just start with ISBN # 1 and add one for each new book .
But problems arise :
Who does the counting ?
A central authority ?
Who handles simultaneous requests and eliminates duplicates ?
Can IDs be shared between products ?
Is Social Security Number 1 different from ISBN 1 ?
Can people guess what the next ID will be ?
How many IDs have been issued ?
The problem with counting is that we want to create ID numbers without the management headache .
GUIDs to the Rescue
GUIDs are large , enormous numbers that are nearly guaranteed to be unique .
They are usually 128 bits long and look like this in hexadecimal :
30dd879c-ee2f-11db-8314-0800200c9a66
The format is a well - defined sequence of 32 hex digits grouped into chunks of 8-4-4-4- 12 .
This gives us 2^128 or about 10^38 numbers .
Here ’s the thinking behind GUIDs :
If you pick a huge random number ( 39 digits long ) , it ’s really unlikely that someone will pick the same one .
GUIDs are not tied to a product .
A GUID can be used for people , cars , files , webpages , colors , anything .
With regular registration numbers , you start counting at 1 and numbers can overlap .
Social Security Number 123-45-6789 is different from ISBN 123456789 which is different from barcode 123456789 .
This is n’t an issue with GUIDs .
It ’s up to the person reading the GUID to figure out the context of the GUID .
There are so many GUIDs that you can use them to number everything and not run out .
GUIDs give you a unique serial number that can be used on any item in the universe .
The Great GUID Shortage
When learning about GUIDs , it feels like 39 measly digits are n’t enough .
Wo n’t we run out if people get GUID - crazy , assigning them for everything from their pets to their favorite bubble gum flavor ?
Let ’s see .
Think about how big the Internet is : Google has billions of web pages in its index .
Let ’s call it a trillion ( 10 ^ 12 ) for kicks .
Think about every wikipedia article , every news item on CNN , every product in Amazon , every blog post from any author .
We can assign a GUID for each of these documents .
Now let ’s say everyone on Earth gets their own copy of the internet , to keep track of their stuff .
Even crazier , let ’s say each person gets their own copy of the internet every second .
How long can we go on ?
Over a billion years .
Let me say that again .
Each person gets a personal copy of the internet , every second , for a billion years .
It ’s a mind - boggling amount of items , and it ’s hard to get our heads around it .
Trust me , we wo n’t run out of GUIDs anytime soon .
And if we do ?
We ’ll start using GUIDs with more digits .
Using GUIDs
If you want to create GUIDs , try the
There are several ways to create GUIDs ( RFC 4122 describes the conventions ) , but you want to avoid that mess and use a library .
The general types of GUIDs are :
Random : Just use the system ’s random - number generator to create a 128 - bit number .
Just use the system ’s random - number generator to create a 128 - bit number .
Time - based : Create a GUID based on the current time .
Create a GUID based on the current time .
Hardware - based : Make a GUID with certain portions based on hardware features , such as the MAC address of a network card .
This is n’t great because the GUID is n’t “ anonymous ” and can be partially traced to the machine that created it .
Make a GUID with certain portions based on hardware features , such as the MAC address of a network card .
This is n’t great because the GUID is n’t “ anonymous ” and can be partially traced to the machine that created it .
Content - based ( MD5 or SHA - 1 hash of data ) : Create a GUID based on a hash of the file contents .
Files with the same contents will get the same GUID .
You can also seed the hash with a unique namespace ( like your URL ) .
You can mix - and - match techniques above .
If you want duplicate files to have the same GUID , then use GUIDs based on the contents .
If you want GUIDs to be unique , even if the contents are the same , then create them randomly or with a combination of file contents and a random number .
GUID Examples
Here ’s a few things you can do with GUIDs :
Unique primary key in databases .
This lets database items created on separate machines be merged later without conflict , and without the need for a central server to manage IDs .
Unique filename for uploaded files .
If each version of the file gets its own GUID , you can set a long cache expiration time .
Unique name for resources ( del.icio.us URL for instacalc : http://del.icio.us/url/6c5ff0ed608e75724df94a52b05dd6a8)
Allow vendors to create and register unique IDs without contacting a central authority ( like class IDs in COM )
The Tradeoffs with GUIDs
Like most things in life , GUIDs have benefits and drawbacks .
Weigh the features to see if they make sense :
Pros :
No central authority :
You avoid the need for management , but ca n’t keep track of what ’s been assigned .
A compromise is to generate GUIDs internally and then hand them out .

A compromise is to generate GUIDs internally and then hand them out .
Easily combined :
You can merge sets of GUIDs from different data sources with a microscopic chance of conflict .
Cons :
Appear random : Users cannot easily guess the ID for an object they do n’t know .
This is good for security , difficult for debugging .
Users cannot easily guess the ID for an object they do n’t know .
This is good for security , difficult for debugging .
GUID overhead : GUIDs are an example of the time - space tradeoff .
You save time in merging but have to use space to store the large ( 16 - byte ) GUID .
It may not make sense to have a 16 - byte GUID keeping track of a 4 - byte item in your database .
GUIDs are not a GUARantee
There ’s one giant caveat for GUIDs : collisions are still possible .
First , the birthday paradox shows us the chance of a collision as GUIDs are used .
It ’s very , very unlikely that GUIDs will collide , but as more are assigned , there are fewer left to choose from .
Second , a malicious user could try hijacking GUIDs that he knows will be used ( assuming the user can assign their own GUIDs ) , or resubmitting different content to a previous GUID ( submitting file A under the hash of file B ) .
If you are writing software , program defensively and detect cases where the GUID already exists .
Give the user an error or even better , recover , create a new GUID on the server side and try again .
GUIDs are great , but they are n’t a magic bullet .
As always , we ’re never done learning .

If you live near Boulder / Fort Collins , Colorado , find yourself a copy of this month 's Illiterate Magazine -- there 's a swell interview with me near the back .
Item # 3 - Johnny Hart , the creator of B.C. , died about two weeks ago .
I did n't mention it at the time , but what nobody seemed to notice is that Brant Parker -- his collaborator on The Wizard of Id -- died , last week .
Both ( which has been helmed by Parker 's son since 1997 ) andwill continue to run in papers ; in the latter case we will soon be treated to that magic synergy that occurs when lame gag writers combine with " a database of imagery from past years of the strip .
" Reducing any hand - drawn comic strip to a mindless cut - and - paste job is bad in itself , but especially when the mind behind the strip was so distinctive .
Not that I always agreed withor even particularly enjoyed it -- in fact I would n't miss it at all if it disappeared -- but to think that the strip can just seamlessly continue is insulting both to the original artist and to the other creators who 're denied a shot at the paper because of it .
And , of course , if the strip is so independent of the personal vision of a singular creator that it CAN continue seamlessly even without his hand at the wheel , well , that 's all the more reason that it should n't .

In an era when applications are moving into the web browser , the maker of the world 's most popular open - source e-mail client wants you to stay on the desktop .
Later this month , Mozilla will release Thunderbird 2 , the latest version of its cross- platform e-mail application .
The current version , 1.5 , has almost 50 million users worldwide and has been translated into 35 languages .
Built on the same technology as Mozilla 's Firefox browser , it is loved by many for its advanced filtering features and junk - mail - battling tools , an integrated RSS news reader and the ability to customize with tons of add - ons .
But with popular web - based e-mail services from Google , Microsoft and Yahoo , which just announced that it will offer unlimited storage , the need for a desktop e-mail client seems to be fading .
So we asked Scott MacGregor , Thunderbird 's lead engineer , why anyone needs Thunderbird these days , and he had a pretty good answer .
He also talked about Mozilla 's open - source development model and told us what new features to expect when Thunderbird 2 becomes available .
Wired News :
With seemingly every aspect of our data moving toward online apps and away from the traditional desktop model , why is Mozilla still interested in a desktop e-mail client ?
Scott MacGregor :
We believe the Thunderbird experience is better for moderate to heavy e-mail use .
It 's much easier to process incoming mail – anyone who 's had to use web mail on vacation to deal with dozens of e-mails can testify to how tedious it can be .
WN : What advantages does Thunderbird offer that a web - based app like Gmail does n't ?
MacGregor : Some users want to have their data local for privacy and control .
Furthermore , you can integrate data from different applications on the desktop in ways that you can't do with web - based solutions , unless you stick to web solutions from a single provider .
For example , you can use your Outlook address book with Thunderbird .
We 'd like to continue to expand the kinds of data you can share between Thunderbird and other apps ( both web and desktop applications ) .
WN : Speaking of which , Thunderbird 2 has some new integrated web - mail functionality .
How does that work ?
MacGregor : A lot of users want to check their web - mail accounts using a desktop client , but they do n't know all the information necessary to connect .
For instance , with Gmail you need to know the server names in addition to your login information .
We wanted to make the process easier for users , so we 've provided Gmail integration using just an e-mail address .
All the user has to do is enter their e-mail address and password and Thunderbird will figure out the server details for them .
For the Mac version , we 've provided the same one - step integration with .
Mac .
We plan to add more web - mail services and even ISP providers in future releases .
In the meantime , it 's possible for developers to write extensions for other popular web e-mail providers .
WN : Mozilla touts the " open- source security " model as one of Thunderbird 's strengths .
Why is open - source security better than a proprietary solution ?
MacGregor :
One of the great things about open source is that you have the entire community , thousands of users , looking to find flaws and vulnerabilities in Thunderbird .
And when they do , we have what I call the security SWAT team – people who are always watching for reports of vulnerabilities and helping to patch them .
The open - source model allows us to find problems faster , correct them faster and get updates out to users .
WN : What are some of the key features in the new version of Thunderbird ?
MacGregor : People still get too much e-mail to easily sort , so we 've focused on ways to better manage your inbox .
The new mail alerts feature makes it easy to see new mail without having to stop what you 're doing and change applications .
( Editor 's note :
This feature is only available in Windows and Linux versions of Thunderbird . )
We 've built a number of security features into Thunderbird , like phishing protection .
When you view a message , Thunderbird analyzes all the URLs in it to see if they might be trying to trick the user .
Thunderbird displays a warning at the top of the message when it thinks something malicious is going on .
If the user clicks the links anyway , Thunderbird then pops up a warning dialog .
If you 're using Firefox as your browser , you really have two lines of defense since Firefox also has built in phishing protection .
We 've also added full support for Windows Vista .
We 're excited about the creative extensions our community is going to be able to develop with Thunderbird 2 .
We 've really seen an explosive growth of people and companies building add - ons for Thunderbird , so we 've tried to make it easier for those developers by improving the add - on framework .
WN : Have many developers updated their add - ons at this point or should the average user wait a little while ?
MacGregor :
It will take a while for Thunderbird 2.0 to propagate out .
Most of the add - on developers wait until RC1 ( the first release candidate , when the application has been fully beta tested ) , when they know the code wo n't be changing much and then they update their add - ons .
WN : Mac users have been clamoring for support for the Address Book app in OS X .
Is that part of the Thunderbird road map ?
MacGregor :
We 're very close to having integration support for Address Book and that will be part of the next release .
WN : What are Thunderbird 's plans for the future ?
MacGregor :
We 'll start collecting feedback from users once the new version is released and then we 'll sit down as a community and figure out what we 're going to do .
We get most of our feature suggestions from user feedback .
The popularity of tagging on popular websites like Flickr led people to overwhelmingly want to apply that to e-mail .
So tagging support is one of the key new features .

Even the most hackneyed of Hollywood schlockmeisters would n't dare to reuse a plot so often .
Iraq .
Katrina .
The story is always the same .
It starts with some vaguely formed plan that , while it may be packed in words we usually think of as good ( freedom , democracy , etc. ) lacks any real substance or detail .
Said plan is then executed with blind arrogance , and a stiff - necked insistence that reality must be ignored until it can be made to conform with the goals .
And while the rest of the world is forced to smash its nose against the fantasy , those in charge bumble on with the confidence that their vision is so innately superior that they can act as they will .
No one executes this script like Paul Wolfowitz .
As the chief architect of Iraq policy , Wolfowitz was " certain we will be greeted as liberators . "
His plan called for us to march along flower - strewn streets wearing crowns of laurel leaves , watch as Iraqi 's renamed their capital Georgebushdad , and ride the tidal wave of freedom that would sweep the Middle East .
Funny thing is , that 's still the plan .
One of the core concepts of any neocon fantasy is that if at first you fail , just keep putting more people in harm 's way until the bad guys tire of killing them .
100,000 U.S. casualties , maybe a million dead Iraqis .
Then comes the flowers , just you wait and see .
After failing upward into the leadership of the World Bank , Wolfowitz launched a crusade against corruption .
He felt so strongly about the need to fight corruption that he moved on his own to suspend World Bank assistance to several countries because of his dissatisfaction with their anti-corruption efforts .
Stamping out corruption is an admirable goal , but then so is bringing peace and democracy to the Middle East .
Anyone can have admirable goals , it 's the execution that counts .
When it comes to executing his stamp out corruption campaign , Wolfowitz did n't seem to consider that the only action available to the World Bank was holding up the money .
In other words , he was saying to the bad guys " until you stop skimming off some of the money , I 'll stop giving you the money . "
The Republic of Congo , in West Central Africa , is among the countries where corruption allegations have prompted Wolfowitz to try to block international assistance .
Nearly 70 percent of the population in the former French colony subsists on less than $ 1 per day .
You might notice one or two tiny logical problems with this .
First , the people in these countries were astoundingly poor and badly in need of the money , whether or not some " strong men " were making off with much of it .
Second , the strong men who had demonstrated their lack of concern for their starving populace by stealing the money in the first place , saw little reason to cooperate with a deal cutting them off from their source of iPods and plasma screens ( and in the case of the Congo , those in charge were already collecting billions on oil deals , so it was n't as if they were suffering along with their people ) .
Still , it was important that the bank take on corruption .
There were many governments in and out of the area willing to help , and organizations ready to champion the cause .
With strong cooperation from other agencies and nations who had options outside the " starve them till the leaders agree to be good " approach , it could have been a major turning point .
Unfortunately , Wolfowitz demonstrated the same concerns for others ' opinions that he displayed in planning those parties in Iraq .
In the process , however , Wolfowitz angered key European governments .
He also alienated many staff members who felt he was acting arbitrarily and disregarding the views of development professionals with many years of World Bank experience ...
" The World Bank is a development institution , not an anti-corruption institution , " says Dennis de Tray , who left the bank in 2006 after more than 20 years directing programs from Indonesia to Latin America .
" It 's not a police force , and it 's not a keeper of moral standards .
The bank 's approach to corruption needs to be seen through a development lens .
Corruption is just one of many constraints that developing countries face . "
With all of this , Wolfowitz was actually making a lot more progress toward fighting corruption at the World Bank than he had toward getting a street named after him in Baghdad .
But , when you 've created a huge amount of disruption and dislike within an organization , it 's probably a good thing if you do n't demonstrate that final part of the neocon plotline , the part where you show no rules apply when it comes to you .
Paul D. Wolfowitz ’s tenure as president of the World Bank was thrown into turmoil on Thursday by the disclosure that he had helped arrange a pay raise for his companion at the time of her transfer from the bank to the State Department , where she remained on the bank payroll .
Having secured for his girlfriend a job at the State Department where the World Bank treated her to a $ 193,000 tax free salary ( which is , by the way , greater than that of Condoleezza Rice ) , Wolfowitz 's credentials as a fighter of corruption are now on par with Kim Jung Il 's bona fides for pushing democracy .
He 's followed the neocon script to the letter .
Launch a quixotic but laudable - sounding quest , disregard how your actions may be harming the people you are supposedly helping , and demonstrate your disdain for the rules as they apply to yourself .
Truly , nobody does it better .
But there 's one part of the plot that Wolfowitz may not get to test .
That lather - rinse - repeat cycle where you sacrifice tens of thousands to prove that 1 = 2 .
Paul Wolfowitz 's future as president of the World Bank was in jeopardy on Friday after the bank 's board issued a damaging finding of facts on his role in the Shaha Riza affair and pledged to " move expeditiously to reach a conclusion on possible actions to take . "
While Bush bullied the World Bank into accepting Wolfowitz as their leader , the comb - licker in chief may not be able to hold his position after giving his opponents such ammunition .
After all , we 're not talking about hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dying because of his policies there , or tens of thousands of Africans starving for his ideals at the bank .
This is paying for sex .
This is something important .
The sun was not yet up yesterday , and members of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign team were confronted with the kind of attack that most infuriates them : one questioning the character of Mrs. Clinton and her husband .
To make matters worse , it came from David Geffen , the Hollywood executive who was once a big supporter of the Clintons but has since turned on them and is now backing Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination .
What followed was a remarkably caustic exchange between the Clinton and Obama campaigns that highlighted the sensitivity in the Clinton camp to Mr. Obama ’s rapid rise as a rival and his positioning as a fresh face unburdened by the baggage borne by Mrs. Clinton , the junior senator from New York .
The Clinton camp seemed also to be sending a warning to mudslinging critics that they would be dealt with fiercely .
It began with a column in The New York Times by Maureen Dowd , in which Mr. Geffen said the Clintons lie “ with such ease , it ’s troubling ” and that the Clinton political operation “ is going to be very unpleasant and unattractive and effective . ”
Mr. Geffen called Mr. Clinton a “ reckless guy ” who had not changed in the last six years , and suggested that Mrs. Clinton was too scripted .

Today I was looking at the screenshots of IntelliJ Idea 6 when something suddenly struck me .
Intellij UI looks far better than Eclipse !
I realized that in fact that the Eclipse UI looks far ugly than the UI of most of the programs I use .
Since I use Eclipse as my everyday IDE , I just switched to it and tried to make out what is it about eclipse that makes it look so ugly .
Hmmm ...
I thought for a second , maybe it 's the icons .
But no , the icons are pretty modern with all the gradients and stuff you would expect of any modern app .
Then ?
Suddenly I realised what it was !
The default Windows Xp UI !!
Eclipse uses the SWT java lib which gives it the look of the native UI which in turn is not too good to look at while Intellij uses a custom Swing skin .
But then I thought , hey I am on windows .
If the windows UI was so ugly then why do n't I find all the other apps ugly too ?
That is when I started noticing this .
How many programs of everday use * really * use the Windows native UI ?
Lets take a look .
First lets see the programs running in my system tray - Guess what , NONE of the above programs use the native Windows look and feel !!!
Then I look at my Quick Launch bar which is to the side of the Start Button .
Here I just keep ( instead of the ' Show Desktop ' button ) NO windows native UI in these either !
Now I really start thinking .
Here are some of the most commonly used programs which * do n't * use native windows look and feel - Actually NONE of MS programs have the native windows look and feel .
Talk about following what you preach !
Anyway continuing with our list - And of course a lot more .
In fact after noticing this I tried to see what programs that I frequently use on my computer * do * have the native look , and here is what I found - So the next time you find that a UI is ugly , do n't blame the programmers , they were just following the MS guidelines for Windows apps :)

Google is making a bid to build a San Francisco - wide free wifi network , according to company officials .
The company today filed documents in response to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ’s request for information for the city wide network .
Google ’s WiFi plans were first reported by Business 2.0 magazine as part of the GoogleNet article .
The company says if its bid is approved , then it is willing to start the work on the network within weeks .
Google officials say San Francisco residents ( and visitors ) will enjoy a free 300 kilobits per second , always on connection anywhere in the city .
As part of its proposal , the company says it will be offering wholesale access to other service providers , who will offer higher throughput connections to their customers .
Google says it plans to use its own authentication services .
( That explains the Google WiFi VPN client to some extent ) .
The company is going to use San Diego - based WFI , a cellular network builder company to build out the WiFi network .
The company proposes to build a network using third party hardware .
Google officials say , its free WiFi plans are restricted only to San Francisco .
The company does offer free wifi access in Mountain View and New York ’s Bryant Park .
“ San Francisco will be a true test bed for location based services and applications , ” says Chris Sacca , principal of new business development at Google .
While the initial use of location - based services might be limited to more - focussed and targeted advertising , the potential of location - based services is immense , officials said .
Sacca pointed out that the network bid was in line with Google ’s thinking on delivering answers anytime anywhere to anyone , and looking beyond a desktop PC .
When asked if this puts the company in direct conflict with incumbents like SBC and Comcast , Sacca replied , “ I think a few months ago , we might have thought that , but we have talked to them and it seems the thinking is evolving amongst other last mile providers . ”
I wonder how it impacts others who want to get involved with the muniwireless space ?
The Google Talk implications on a free network are quite far reaching , if you ask me , but then that ’s just me .

I 'm going to take another dive here into the Qi type system to give an idea of the expressive power possible in it .
Qi has a fully Turing capable type system and that means that we should be able to express truths about natural numbers directly in the form of types .
The computation of the truth will happen at compile time !
For the purposes of this exercise , we will define " truth " as having matched to type " has_truth " and we will define falsehood as having raised a type_error or returning _|_ as represented by an infinite loop .
We will start by encoding the Peano axioms into a Qi type .
We will represent the natural numbers and truth as Qi Types .
Then we will define the basic rules of arithmetic and describe the basics of everybody 's favorite commutative semigroup .
Finally , we will discuss falsehood and how Qi handles it , along with infinite loops , blown stacks , and some other real world programming issues .
As a quick refresher for those of you not well versed in sequent notation , you can think of them as saying " If the top parts have these types , THEN the bottom construction is valid for the labeled type . "
Or alternatively , you can think of them as saying , " If we have a type that looks like one on the bottom , AND if we can take the components of it and prove them of types on the top , THEN we can type the bottom element as labeled . "
Now I 'm not so certain my explanation helps ... For Peano 's first axiom , let us define the natural numbers as 0 and its successors labeled as [ suc X ] where X is a natural number .
We include 0 as a convenience here , but it would be possible to define the type without it .
We also include the sixth axiom here , namely the idea of successors which are represented as nested lists .
Taking his second axiom , let us ensure that every natural number is equal to itself .
Note that this imports the notion of lexical equivalence from Qi into our type theory , but as = will always return , we can be assured that it is not going to cause any indefinite delay in the type theory .
And it is in equality that we wish to test for truthhood , so we will need to define the type " has_truth " here .
In effect , we are saying that equal things " have truth . "
Alternatively , I could have named the type is_equals .
Read it however you like .
Peano 's third axiom will end up causing no end to our headaches inside the Qi type system while giving us our expressiveness at the same time .
It says A = B iff B = A.We can drop the forth axiom due to us using a 2 sided system .
Then using the fifth we find that if a = b is true and b is a natural number then a is a natural number .
Given that A = B is true and B is a natural number , we can prove A is a natural number .
Having already listed the sixth earlier , we turn to the seventh Peano axiom , the equality of successors .
This axiom , unlike the third axiom , really simplifies the job that the type checker has to do .
I like the seventh Axiom .
It 's not like that mean , mean third axiom .
It makes me wonder how much math do you have to do in order to find some of Peano 's axiom 's more " friendly " than others .
I see a Psych 101 experiment there .
* grin*With the setup I used , we have no way of returning " not " so we have trouble with Peano 's eighth axiom .
It is sufficient to point out that we have imported the equality operator from Qi for which this property holds .
So Axiom 2's code is our key here .
And for this code , we can obviously leave out the ninth .
On to the group operator +... We define a new type of number that is the result of addition .
Now we can create the zero - to - identity rule which states that nothing changes when we add 0 to other numbers .
Now we must create the plus - to - successor rule that allows us to define addition over other numbers .
We state that a +
Sb = S ( a + b ) .
Note that here we actually use an assignment to a variable to introduce a new equation .
The best way of thinking of this equation is from the bottom up .
If we are trying to find out the truth of an equation with a plus in it which does NOT have a zero , then we must find a new equation C that has one of our numbers subtracted by one , and take the successor of THAT .
The real trick is to notice that C is a completely new construction created by our type system .
The top part of the equation acts as a hypothetical that the proof checker then tries to solve .
Peano 's beloved seventh rule helps us find computable theorems even with an automated prover .
So what do we get for all this ?
We get a type that can perform numerical computations at compile time !
Lets try 0 = 0So far , that went swimmingly !
Lets try something harder .
S( 0 + 1 ) = 2 .
That worked great !
We can see the proof tool using Peano 's seventh like it was born to formalize !
( Being a lambda calculus , it was .
* grin * ) Lets take on 3 + 2 = 5 This gives us has_truth in 1081 inferences .
The type checker does 5 = 3 + 2 in 363 steps .
I mentioned that I 'd wrap up on some real world issues .
Since the type checker can insert any rule it needs to and search for ways to make the theorems work , we have a Turing complete type system .
And this means that some things will never complete their type checking .
So we have to explicitly deal with the _|_ type in some manner to get sensible behaviour out of the system .
For example , let us take Peano 's eighth axiom of zero != [ suc zero ] .
If we ask this type theory about [ zero = [ suc zero ] ] : has_truth , it will have to either fail or return _|_. Unfortunately for us , the need for Peano 's third axiom dooms us to get a _|_ style value back from the type checker , i.e. it never completes .
This particular example is an area where the Qi type checker should probably understand that calling the same definition that you just called and failed to type before is a mistake .
But any automated system will only recognize a small subset of these sorts of errors , so Qi's failure to type_error here is forgivable in these pathological types .
So typing can blow the stack , ( as in this case ) , or it can fail to type raising a type_error .
Either of these we can use as falsehoods .
If we wanted to extend the system further , we could encode negation into the system and have the ability to return True , False or a _|_ style answer .
I hope this sheds some light into the Qi type system .
There 's a lot more you can do with it obviously .
Hopefully you enjoyed the article and hopefully I can find time to post more .
Best wishes ,

Before getting to that though , what 's at stake ?
The revelation that Digg could be trivially manipulated did not cause the site to be overrun with bogus stories all at once -- most of the links on the front page still look interesting .
Newitz said that her story , which was deliberately chosen to be as lame as possible , got buried by users soon after it hit the front page , which is how Digg cleans spam stories out of the system .
However , she also said that in the time that the story was on the front page , the story got about 35,000 hits , whereupon her server crashed and the traffic was thereafter divided with two other mirror sites ; presumably if the server had stayed up , she would have gotten about 100,000 hits , all for an initial expenditure of $ 100 , which is orders of magnitude cheaper than buying advertising any other way .
( If she had done the same thing with a good story instead of a deliberately lame one , presumably the traffic gains resulting from word - of - mouth and repeat visitors would have been even higher . )
As long as the benefits outweigh the cost , more and more unscrupulous users are likely to pay for such services , and since the service provided by User / Submitter is easy to copy , probably similar services will spring up to drive the price down even further .
If nothing changes , then eventually sites like Digg and reddit will be flooded with nothing but paid stories .
Most of the stories on the front page will probably still be interesting ( why would you pay to promote a link , unless it was good enough to draw repeat visitors and get the most value for your money ? ) , but everybody who did n't pay for votes would eventually get crowded out .
One Good Samaritan , Jim Messenger , managed to shut down one Digg manipulation service called Spike The Vote , by buying it out ( for a paltry $ 1,275 - they must have wanted to get out fast ) and then turning over to Digg .
He warned people that the moral was :
Do n't sign up for Digg manipulation services , since Digg might get your information from them and then you 'll be banned .
Actually , I think the moral is simpler : if you 're going to try anything like that , do it from a throwaway account that you do n't care about losing if you get caught .
( Or , only sign up with manipulation services which publish a privacy policy promising never to share your information , especially not with sites like Digg .
Then if Digg buys them out , then the site has violated their privacy policy and Digg as the new owner inherits the liability for that , so you can sue them , right ? )
But as the idea spreads , it will probably become impractical to play whack - a- mole by shutting down manipulation services as they keep springing up .
Any time the cost of providing a service ( clicking on a few buttons ) is small compared to the benefits of receiving the service ( 100,000 hits in 24 hours ) , a market will exist for it one way or another , whether you 're talking about drug - smuggling , prostitution , or selling Digg votes .
However , I think there 's a way to fix it , and here it is .
Have you ever seen people put a link in their profile to their HotOrNot picture , saying " Go here and vote me a 10 ! ! " ?
Similar to the people who send links to their friends and say , " I just posted this , please Digg this for me ! "
The difference is that on HotOrNot , it does n't work .
On HotOrNot , you can cast votes for a picture in one of two ways .
The first way is to go directly to the URL for someone 's picture ; the second way is to load the front page , where a random picture from the database is selected at random , and vote for whatever picture comes up .
The catch is that the votes that you cast by going directly to someone 's picture , are simply ignored in calculating the average score for that photo .
The only votes that are counted are the votes cast for random pictures displayed on the front page .
So if you want to manipulate the voting for your own photo , you 'd have to load the front page hundreds of thousands of times waiting for your own picture to come up repeatedly , which is hard to do without being detected .
To enable an algorithm like this on Digg and reddit , the sites could present users with a sidebar box that displays random stories from the pool of recent submissions .
( reddit already has a serendipity feature that users can use to select a random story from the available pool , which could be leveraged for this purpose . )
Once a story has collected , say , 100 votes -- or whatever number is considered sufficient to provide a representative random sample of how the story appeals to people -- then on that basis the story can either be buried or promoted to the top , where it would be seen by , say , 100,000 people .
The elegance of this system is that bad content would only be seen by 100 people on average before it 's buried , whereas good content would be seen by all the 100,000 people who view it on the front page , so the average user sees 1,000 pieces of good content for every 1 piece of crap .
Even if 75 % of users ignore the random story box completely , that just means you have to display it to 400 users instead of 100 before you have enough data points for a good random sample .
I suggested essentially the same algorithm for how an open - source search engine could work without being vulnerable to gaming even by those who understood all of its inner workings .
The main difference , of course , is that Digg and reddit actually exist now .
Digg declined to comment on the possible merits of such an algorithm ; reddit 's Steve Huffman said that the idea sounded interesting , although even if the idea got full buy - in , naturally any proposed change would take a long time to bring to fruition .
But it seems that an algorithm similar to this one would be the only way to prevent cheating on sites like Digg that sort content based on user votes .
So it 's ironic that HotOrNot , the only site I know of that is using a variation of this algorithm and hence is probably the most secure against cheating , is also the one where cheating is least likely to be a problem .
Getting a high placement on Digg might enable you to make some money , but getting a highly rated picture on HotOrNot is n't going to make you rich ( unless it helps you meet a millionaire who is using the site to find his third wife ) .
Also , making HotOrNot meritocratic does n't give people an incentive to improve the " content " that they submit , because up to the limits of what can be done with hair and wardrobe , you can't make yourself that much more attractive .
With Digg and reddit , on the other hand , I might work harder at submitting a good story , if I knew that it worked in a perfectly meritocratic fashion that pushed good stories right to the top .
If you do this , you do n't need any of the other countermeasures listed in Annalee Newitz 's follow - up piece " Herding the Mob " , such as analyzing user account history for suspicious behavior .
As long as most users in the system are legitimate , most of the users in your random sample will be legitimate as well , and their voting will be representative of what most of the community would think .
A story could also get a high score within a specific sub-area of the site like the sports page , but kept off of the main site front page , if the story got a high score from a random sampling of sports - oriented users but a low score from a sample of everyone else .
You could even sub - divide the topical areas further , down to a level of granularity like " Would Barack Obama make a good president ? "
A site called Helium is currently trying something like this -- users can submit essays on subjects like " Racial inequality or oppression :
Do they truly exist in todays society ? " , and vote on how to rank other essays against each other .
The voting works on the random selection principle that I 'm advocating here -- users are presented with a pair of randomly chosen essays from a given category ( not necessarily the same category for which you submitted an essay ) and told to vote for the better one , so there 's no way to tell all your friends to go to the link for your essay and give it a high rating .
The main limitation though is that while the votes can push you to the top of a particular sub-category , that wo n't cause your article to " break out " and get to the front page of the site -- Helium says that those front - page articles are chosen at random by employees from the among those articles that are highly rated within their narrow category , so just being good is not enough .
And if you want to write something that does n't fit into any existing categories , you have to create a new category for your essay like I did , which will then be a category containing one essay that nobody else ever sees .
Perhaps both of these limitations could be overcome by adding the option to rate randomly selected essays on a scale of 1 to 10 -- thus providing a way to rate essays that exist alone in their own category , and also a way to find the best essays across the entire site , rated against each other .
If Digg or reddit adopts a model that uses the random - voter - selection method , then there 's the issue of how to handle the votes cast by users under the current system -- the ones who go to a story link and click " digg it " , which is what makes the existing system vulnerable to gaming .
Digg could do what HotOrNot does , and just ignore those votes outright , but users would probably view this as deceptive .
Perhaps
Digg could say that votes cast by self - selected users ( the ones who go straight to the story link ) are counted along with votes from randomly - selected users , unless the average of the self - selected votes is significantly different from the average from the randomly - selected votes , in which case the self - selected votes are ignored .
Hopefully this would satisfy most users and preserve the " community " feel of the site , and only a spoilsport would point out that counting the self - selected votes only if they agree with the randomly - selected votes , is exactly the same thing as ignoring the self - selected votes entirely .
I asked the owner of User / Submitter what he thought about this .
He was willing to talk with surprising candor ( except about things like his real name ) and spoke as if he'd like nothing better than for Digg to make changes to their service that would block his system from working .
To both Annalee Newitz and me , he said , " We find it interesting that Digg still allows anybody to view any user 's diggs .
By way of this ' feature , ' User / Submitter is able to verify that our users actually digg the stories they 're given .
Without this feature , Digg users are given complete digging privacy , and User / Submitter cannot exist . "
Some have expressed skepticism that the Digg cheaters really want Digg to fix the problem .
But as a security tester , I can understand that mentality .
If you report a problem , and a company does n't fix it , eventually you get tempted to publicize the problem to draw attention to it .
And if they still do n't fix it , and it's a fairly benign security hole that merely enables some pranksters to get some undeserved attention , why not build a service around exploiting the hole , if will highlight the problem and encourage it to get fixed ?
So I 'm going to go out on a limb and say the U/S guy sincerely wants Digg to be more secure .
However I disagree with him about his proposed fix , that of hiding a user 's digg history .
First of all , it wo n't stop anyone who creates a multitude of accounts all under their control -- you can use
Tor to make it appear that you 're coming from many different IP addresses , and build up a history of " legitimate " votes before using your votes to push sites deliberately .
( Be sure to use different browsers , or vary your User - Agent header if you know how to do that , so that a series of votes from identical browser types does n't give you away . )
If your service does work by paying other users to cast votes , then you could still audit whether they 're casting their votes honestly -- for example , create a test story , use 5 sockpuppet accounts to digg it 5 times , then tell your confederate to digg it .
If the number of diggs does n't go up to 6 , then you know they 're not honoring their end of the deal , and kick them out of the system .
As long as most confederates think there might be some chance of getting caught if they do n't play along , most of them would probably cast the votes that they were paid for , since it costs them nothing to do so and they would n't want to jeopardize their stream of easy money .
I asked the owner of User / Submitter if his service could defeat the random - sampling algorithm I described .
" It would slow down our service , " he answered , " but certainly would n't eliminate it because eventually a U / S User will have an opportunity to vote on a U/ S Submission by way of chance . "
But I do n't see how this would beat the algorithm -- some U/S voters would still get to vote on the story , but as long as there are far more legitimate voters than U/S voters , then a random sampling will almost always contain far more legitimate voters .
The U/S owner also said , " Randomized voting privileges would be unnecessarily confusing , frustrating , and fragmenting .
Not to forget : unfair and undemocratic . "
Well , you could keep it from being " confusing " or " frustrating " by keeping the existing interface ( with the possible addition of a randomly - selected - story box ) , so that the only changes would be in how the votes are handled under the hood .
" Fragmenting " ?
If anything , it seems to me that the existing Digg / reddit algorithms would be more fragmenting , keeping users within their existing communities of friend who vote for each others ' stories ; a random - selection box would give stories with " crossover appeal " a greater chance of success , bringing them to the attention of users who might otherwise never have seen them .
As for " unfair and undemocratic " , presumably this is a reaction to the fact that the votes of 100 users decide what everyone else sees .
But it 's already the case with Digg that the votes of a small number of users decide what content becomes popular .
At least with a random sample of users , it would be the case that the vast majority of the time , the voting outcome would be the same as it would have been if the entire site had voted , due to the magic of representative sampling .
So , I 'm putting this suggestion out there for the same reason that Jim Messenger bought out Spike The Vote -- because I do n't want sites like Digg and reddit to be manipulated by the abusers .
In fact , if they used this algorithm , they would become more meritocratic than they are now , because the systems would strictly favor the highest - rated content , instead of content written by people who have informal networks of friends who can all go digg their stories for them .
If I were to design the user rating system to make it cheat - proof , these are the exact details of what I would do :
Wherever they decide to post the " random story sampling " box ( on the front page , or on a link off to a separate page , etc. ) , have it work so that as soon as new stories are submitted , they can be rotated into that box and displayed to a random set of users , until it 's reached its total of 100 votes or however many are required to get a random sample .
You can have " shutout voting " to kill off stories early that are obvious spam or otherwise really useless , without going through the full 100 votes .
( For example , if 90 % of the first 10 votes are negative , then stop collecting votes . )
This decreases the number of users " inconvenienced " by really obvious spam and other garbage .
For someone to submit content that gets rotated into that voting process , have them submit a Turing test ( read numbers off of a graphic and type them in ) , or something similar .
This prevents spammers from submitting spam content over and over just to have it viewed by those initial 10 voters .
If they have to type in a number each time , it 's not worth it .
to have it viewed by those initial 10 voters .
If they have to type in a number each time , it 's not worth it .
When users give votes to a story , give them the option to say why they voted the way that they did .
( This is especially valuable if they 're giving negative votes , then the submitter would know what to improve . )
Personally I think the comments would be more valuable if each user can't see other users ' comments , at the time they submit their own comments ; this prevents the " me too " effect where everybody echoes the first two commenters .
( When I ask for independent comments from people , and they almost all say the same thing without seeing each other 's comments , that 's when I know they have a point ! )
users ' comments , at the time they submit their own comments ; this prevents the " me too " effect where everybody echoes the first two commenters .
( When I ask for independent comments from people , and they almost all say the same thing seeing each other 's comments , that 's when I know they have a point ! )
To prevent an attacker from having their own username hit the random - voting page over and over in hopes of voting up their own content , make sure that each user account is only allowed to vote on a given piece of content once ( even if they found the content through the random - story page ) .
Require a Turing test for new user signups .
This would prevent an attacker from registering a huge number of accounts just to hit the random voting page with different users over and over , in hopes getting to vote on their own submitted content eventually .
Then after running this system for a while , look through some collected data to determine if the system could be more efficient .
For example , do you really need a sample of 100 votes every time ?
Suppose you determine that in 99 % of cases , you get the same result just from tabulating the first 50 votes , as you would have gotten from tabulating all 100 votes .
Then you could modify the system to collect only the first 50 votes , and then make a decision .
Suggestions for improvement ?
Flaws ( hopefully not fatal ) ?
Everyone who cares about keeping community sites like Digg free from abuse , and who wants to create a path for the best content to rise to the top , let 's put our heads together and see what we can think of .
The above is intended merely as a jumping - off point , and although I 've worked it over and I can't see any specific points to improve efficiency , that 's probably just because I 've been looking at it too long .
And if you Digg this story for me I 'll give you 1,000 times as much cash as I gave my Mom last Mother 's Day .
EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
Pid’Jin and Fredo celebrate their victory , and Pid’Jin makes a field trip to voice his triumphant announcement .
Using Perl to Enable the Disabled
We use Perl for all kinds of things .
Web development , data munging , system administration , even bioinformatics ; most of us have used Perl for one of these situations .
A few people use Perl for building end - user applications with graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) .
And as far as I know , only two people in this world use Perl to make life easier for the disabled : Jon Bjornstad and I .
Some people think the way we use Perl is something special , but my story will show you that I just did what any other father , capable of writing software , would do for his child .
The Past
In 1995 my eldest daughter , Krista , was born .
She came way too early , after a pregnancy of only 27.5 weeks .
That premature birth resulted in numerous complications during the first three months of her life .
Luckily she survived , but getting pneumonia three times when you ca n’t even breath on your own causes serious asphyxiation , which in turn resulted in severe brain damage .
A few months after she left the hospital it became clear that the brain damage had caused a spastic quadriplegia .
As Krista grew older , it became more and more clear what she could , and could n’t do .
Being a spastic means you ca n’t move the muscles in your body the way you want them to .
Some people can’t walk , but can do everything else .
In Krista ’s case , she can’t walk , she ca n’t sit , she ca n’t use her hands to grab anything , even keeping her head up is difficult .
Speaking is using the muscles in your mouth and throat , so you can imagine that speaking is almost out of the question for her .
By the end of the year 2000 , Krista went to a special school in Rotterdam .
But going to school without being able to speak or without being able to write down what you want to say is hard , not only for the teacher , but also for the student .
We had to find a way to let Krista communicate .
Together with Krista ’s speech pathologist and orthopedist we started looking for devices she could use to communicate with the outside world .
These devices should enable her to choose between symbols , so a word or a sentence could be pronounced .
A number of devices were tested , but all of them either required some action with her hands or feet that she was n’t able to perform , or gave her too little choices of words .
Then we looked into available communications software , so she could use an adapted input device ( in her case a headrest with built - in switches ) to control an application .
Indeed there was software available that could have been used , but the best match was a program that automatically scanned through symbols on her screen and when the desired symbol was highlighted , she had to move her head to select it .
Timing was the issue here .
If moving your head to the left or right is really hard to do anyway , it ’s hardly possible to take that action at the desired moment .
pVoice
We had to do something .
There was no suitable device or software application available .
I thought it through and suggested I could try to write a simple application myself .
It would be based on the idea of the best match we had found ( the automatic scanning software ) , but this software would have no automatic scanning .
Instead , moving to the right with your head would mean “ Go to the next item , ” and moving to the left would mean “ Select the highlighted item . ”
That would mean that she would need a lot of time to get to the desired word , but it ’s better to be slow than not able to select the right words at all .
The symbols would have to be put in categories , so there would be some logic in the vocabulary she ’d have on her PC .
She started out with categories like “ Family , ” containing photos of some members of the family , “ School , ” containing several activities at school , and “ Care , ” which contained things like “ going to the bathroom , ” “ taking a shower , ” and other phrases like that .
By the end of January 2001 I started programming .
In Perl . Maybe Perl is n’t the most logical choice for writing GUI applications for disabled people , but Perl is my language of choice .
And it turned out to be very suitable for this job !
Using
Tk I quickly set up a nice looking interface .
Win32::Sound ( and on Linux the Play command ) enabled me to “ pronounce ” the prerecorded words .
Within two weeks time I had a first version of pVoice , as I called this application ( and since everyone asks me what the ‘ p ’ stands for : ‘ p ’ is for Perl ) .
Krista started trying the application and was delighted .
Finally she had a way to say what was on her mind !
Of course in the very beginning she did n’t have much of a vocabulary .
The primary idea was to let her learn how to use it .
But every week or two we added more symbols or photos and extended her vocabulary .
By the end of April 2001 I posted the code of this first pVoice version on PerlMonks and set up a web page for people to download it if they could use it .
The response was overwhelming .
Everyone loved the idea and suggestions to improve the code or to add features came rolling in .
Krista ’s therapists were also enthusiastic and asked for new features too .
Unfortunately the original pVoice was nothing more than a quick hack to get things going .
It was not designed to add all the features people were asking for .
So I decided I had to rewrite the whole thing .
This time it had to be a well - designed application .
I wanted to use wxPerl for the GUI instead of the ( in my eyes ) ugly Motif look of Tk , I wanted to use a speech synthesizer instead of prerecorded .wav files , and most importantly , I wanted to make it easier to use .
The original application was not easy to install and modifying the vocabulary was based on the idea you knew your way around in the operating system of your choice : you had to put files in the right directories yourself and modify text files by hand .
For programmers this is an easy task , but for end users this turns out to be quite difficult .
It took me until the summer of 2002 before I started working on the next pVoice release .
For almost a year I had n’t worked on it at all because of some things that happened in my personal life .
Since Krista was learning to read and write and had no way of expressing what she could write herself , I decided not to start with rewriting pVoice immediately , but with building pType .
pType would allow her to select single letters on her screen to form words in a text entry field at the bottom of her screen and – if desired – to pronounce that for her .
pType was my tryout for what pVoice 2.0 would come to be : it used wxPerl , Microsoft Agent for speech synthesis , and was more user - friendly .
In October 2002 , pType was ready and I could finally start working on pVoice 2.0 .
While copying and pasting lots of the code I wrote for pType , I set up pVoice to be as modular as possible .
I also tried to make the design extensible , so I would be able to add features in the future – even features I had n’t already thought of .
In March this year it finally was time to release pVoice 2.0 .
It was easy to install : it was compiled into a standalone executable using PerlApp and by using InnoSetup I created a nice looking installer for it .
The application looked more attractive because I used wxPerl , which gives your application the look - and - feel of the operating system it runs on .
It was user friendly because the user did n’t have to modify any files to use the application : all modifications and additions to the vocabulary could be done within the application using easy - to - understand dialog windows .
I was quite satisfied with the result , although I already knew I had some features to add in future releases .
The Present
At this moment , rewriting the online help file is the last step before I can release pVoice 2.1 .
That version will have support for all Microsoft SAPI 4 compatible speech engines , better internationalization support , the possibility to have an unlimited depth of categories within categories ( until pVoice 2.0 you had only one level of categories with words and sentences ) , the possibility to define the number of rows and columns with images yourself , and numerous small improvements .
Almost all of these improvements and feature additions are suggested by people who tried pVoice 2.0 themselves .
And that ’s great news , because it means that people who need this kind of software are discovering Open Source alternatives for the extremely expensive commercial applications .
Many people have asked me how many users pVoice has .
That ’s a question I ca n’t answer .
How do you measure the use of Open Source software ?
Since Jan. 1 , 2003 , approximately 400 people have downloaded pVoice .
On the other hand , the mailing lists have some 50 subscribers .
How many people are actually using pVoice then ?
I could n’t say .
The Future
I ’m hoping to achieve an increase in the number of users in the next 12 months .
The Perl Foundation ( TPF ) has offered me one of its grants , to be used for promotion of pVoice .
With the money I ’ll be travelling to OSCON next year and hope to speak there about pVoice .
While I ’m in Portland I ’ll try to get other speaking engagements in the area to try to convince people that they do n’t always need to spend so much money on commercial software for disabled people , but that there are alternatives like SueCenter and pVoice .
Shortly after I heard about the TPF grant , I also heard that I ’ll be receiving a large donation from someone ( who wishes to remain anonymous ) , that I can also use for promotion of pVoice or for other purposes like costs I might have to add features to pVoice .
Still , a lot can be improved on pVoice itself .
I want to make it more useful for people with other disabilities than my daughter ’s , I would like to have more translations of the program ( currently I have Dutch and English , and helpful people offered to translate it into German , Spanish , French , and Swedish already ) , I want to support more Text To Speech technologies than Microsoft ’s Speech API ( like Festival ) , and I would like to find the time to make the pVoice platform independent again , because currently it only runs on Windows .
I hope to write other pVoice - like programs like pHouse , which will be based upon efforts of the MisterHouse project , to be able to control appliances in and around the house , but the main thing I need for that is time .
And with a full - time job , time is limited .
Maybe , after reading all of this , you ’ll think , “ How can I help ? ” .
Well , there are several things you could do .
First of all , if you know anyone who works with disabled people , tell them about pVoice .
Apart from SueCenter , pVoice is the only Open Source project I know of in this area .
Lots of people who need this kind of software ca n’t get their insurance to pay for the software and would have to pay a lot of money .
With pVoice they have a free alternative .
Of course , you could also help with the development .
Since pVoice is not tied to any specific natural language , you could help by translating pVoice into your native tongue .
Since the time I can spend on pVoice is limited , it would be nice to have more developers on pVoice in general .
More information on pVoice is available from the web site .
The United States Mint , concerned that rising metal prices could lead to widespread recycling of pennies and nickels , has banned melting or exporting them .
The Mint is also testing dozens of cheaper alternative metal compositions in the expectation that Congress will mandate a change when it meets in the new year .
According to calculations by the Mint , the metal value of pennies , which are made of copper - coated zinc , is now more than one cent .
The metal value of 5 - cent coins , made from a copper - nickel blend , is up to 7 cents .
Adding in the costs of manufacturing means the Mint now spends 1.73 cents for every penny and 8.74 cents for every nickel it makes .
Until 1982 , pennies were made of 95 percent copper .
The commodity metal value of one of those coins , which still make up a large percentage of the pennies in circulation , is 2.13 cents , according to the Mint .
The announcement of the Vista delays has sparked a new round of debates about what ’s going on at Microsoft .
The mailbox has been full of questions for me on the subject – so here ’s some insights from a former employee ( ’94-2003 ) and manager in the Windows division .
For sanity – I ’m an independent and this is not an apology , rant nor inside scoup .
Instead it ’s commentary from a management author on what ’s been said and what ’s going on .

The USW signed an agreement this week signaling its intent to merge with two international unions to create the world 's largest union , representing more than 3.4 million active and retired members .
" The time for global unionism has arrived , " said Leo Gerard , president of the Pittsburgh - based United Steelworkers .
" We need cross - border organizing strategies to protect workers against the mobility of capital that knows no borders . "
The two international unions -- Amicus , which represents about 1 million active British workers , and the 800,000 - member Transport & General Workers Union representing active British and Irish workers -- already had voted to merge .
The agreement signed Wednesday in Ottawa , Canada , allows for the formation of a merger exploration committee , with the goal of merging all three unions within a year .
Labor must mirror Capital in organization strategy ; this is reminiscent of the CIO organization in the mid-1930s and could similarly revolutionize organization .
When unions started organizing by industry rather than craft , union density rose dramatically .
Are you ready for another spike ?
What does union density mean for democrats ?
Among other things , union membership is one of the best demographic indicators of democratic voting !
Unions also provide an organizational framework for reaching out to voters effectively .
http://blog.aflcio.org/...
Some important questions remain :
Will they be able to iron out their differences ?
Where will headquarters be ?
Will they be able to intergrate organizations effectively ?
I 've seen union " mergers " that did very little to change the underlying structures .
Most importantly , if the merger is successful , will they be able to take their organizing to india ? to china ?
will they be willing to wildcat and scrap like they did in the early 30s , before the Wagner Act passed ?
You cannot just create an international organization , you 've got to take the fight pan-national !
The Weinstein Company and Warner Bros .
Pictures announced today that they will join forces to distribute the first all - CG - animated movie in the long and phenomenally successful history of the “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ” franchise .
The announcement was made today by Jeff Robinov , President of Production , Warner Bros .
Pictures , and Harvey Weinstein of The Weinstein Company .
The as - yet - untitled picture will be released early in 2007 .
The movie will be directed by Kevin Munroe from his own screenplay , developed in consultation with Turtles co-creator Peter Laird .
The film will be produced by Thomas K. Gray and Galen Walker .
The executive producers are Francis Kao , Peter Laird , Gary Richardson and Frederick U. Fierst .
Worldwide merchandising rights for the movie will be exclusively represented by 4 Kids Entertainment , Inc .
The two studios acquired the worldwide movie distribution rights from Imagi Animation Studios , who had obtained the production and distribution rights from the Mirage Group , which owns , nurtures and manages the “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ” property .
The new CG - animated , PG - rated movie will derive its tone from the original comic - book series and will be slightly grittier than the previous live - action pictures .
The animation will be created in Imagi ’s state - of - the art facility in Hong Kong .
The “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ” motion picture history began in the early 1990s , with three live - action films that grossed a cumulative total of more than $ 256 million domestically , adding to the entertainment phenomenon that spawned games , toys , costumes and a virtual Turtles industry .
In 2003 the Turtles returned to television after a five - year hiatus , now appearing on Cartoon Network and 4 Kids TV on Fox in the United States and on major TV channels around the world .
Additionally , the entertainment re-launch of the “ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ” has generated hundreds of millions of dollars of worldwide retail sales of new licensed products , including an entirely new range of toys from longtime licensee Playmates Toys .
“ We are very happy to have obtained the rights to this new ‘ Ninja Turtles ’ movie , ” said Robinov .
“ We think that a new generation of kids will love discovering the Turtles , especially supported by the enthusiasm of fans of the original movies , comic books and TV shows . ”
“ Re-introducing the ‘ Ninja Turtles ’ in an animated movie will enable the filmmakers to fully realize the adventure and humor of the property , ” said Weinstein .
“ We believe that there is a global audience for the Turtles and we ’re thrilled to be bringing them to their fans , old and new . ”
Imagi USA ’s President and CEO , Tom Gray , said , “ The Weinstein Company and Warner Bros .
Pictures are ideal partners in this venture , and I am extremely pleased to be working with them .
Their marketing and distribution expertise will bring the Turtles to a whole new generation of fans . ”

FOR his fall show the artist Tom Friedman planted two dozen characteristically demented sculptures throughout the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills .
He set a giant Excedrin box , made from dozens of cut - up Excedrin boxes , on the floor near the entrance .
He placed three identically crumpled wads of paper on a shelf .
And he affixed to the ceiling a bunch of colorful papier - mâché balloons , which magically appeared to float despite their weight .
Their strings were held together not by a hand but by a pair of men ’s briefs suspended in midair .
It was Mr. Friedman ’s first outing with Gagosian after years of showing at the much humbler Feature Gallery in New York , and the exhibition sold out , with works priced up to $ 500,000 .
But most of the buyers did not see the installation .
They did not personally see the pieces at all .
Gagosian sold out the show before it opened , in large part through a flurry of e-mail messages and digital images .
When asked at the opening if the show had really sold out in three days , Deborah McLeod , the gallery ’s director , replied , “ More like three minutes . ”
It ’s another sign of the acceleration of the contemporary art market :
New works , even in the six - figure range , are selling by digital image alone .
For the Friedman show , Gagosian set up a private section on its
Web site , accessible only by a password sent via e-mail message to select collectors .
More typically , gallery directors send off e-mail messages with JPEGs — a format for digitally storing and transmitting images — to potential clients .
A popular runner 's device that combines
Nike shoes with an iPod to track a workout could also be used by criminals to track a person 's whereabouts .
In fact , the hack is so easy and sneaky that someone might already be doing it and no one would know .
The device , called Nike +iPod , employs a small computer chip in the shoe that beams data to a receiver attached to an iPod Nano .
Some 450,000 of the $ 29 devices have been sold .
But the signal can be tracked up to 60 feet away , a group of computer science students has found .
They built a simple device [ image ] for less than $ 300 that hacks into the runner 's gear .
" It is easy for someone to use the Nike + iPod as a tracking device , " says Scott Saponas , an avid runner and doctoral student in computer science at the University of Washington .
" It 's an example of how new gadgetry can erode our personal privacy . "
Coupled with GoogleMaps , the potentially nefarious device — no bigger than a matchbox — could be used to track a person leaving their home , alerting a thief to the best time to do the obvious , Saponas and his colleagues warn .
Or a stalker could hide receivers near a home , a gym or other locations to closely monitor the target 's movements .
Hiding multiple devices on a college campus could result in a network that would report the data to a computer in a dorm room via a common campus - wide wireless network , Saponas points out .
To computer geeks , the scheme is all basic stuff .
The researchers say an electronics hobbyist as young as a middle - schooler with modest computer knowledge and the ability to solder could easily build one of these in a weekend .
" Because it 's a passive listening technology , we do n't know if there are other people already doing this , " Saponas told LiveScience .
Protection is fairly simple : Just switch the device off .
It is sold with the power on , and most users never bother to turn it off , the researchers say .
They add that the Nike + iPod kit could have been made more secure if it used standard techniques from modern cryptography .
" There 's a bigger issue here , " said Yoshi Kohno , senior author on the paper the group has posted to its web site .
" When people buy a toaster , they know it 's probably not going to blow up when they plug it in .
But when they buy a consumer device like the Nike + iPod kit , they have no idea whether the device might enable someone to violate their privacy .
We need to change that . "
“ The war we fight today is more than a military conflict , ” said President Bush to the American Legion .
“ It is the decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century . ”
But if the ideology of our enemy is “ Islamofascism , ” what is the ideology of George W. Bush ?
According to James Montanye , writing in The Independent Review , it is “ democratic fundamentalism . ”
Montanye borrows Joseph Schumpeter ’s depiction of Marxism to describe it .
Like Marxism , he writes , democratic fundamentalism “ presents , first , a system of ultimate ends that embody the meaning of life and are absolute standards by which to judge events and actions ; and , secondly , a guide to those ends which implies a plan of salvation and the indication of the evil from which mankind , or a chosen section of mankind , is to be saved .
It belongs to that subgroup [ of ‘ isms ’ ] which promises paradise this side of the grave . ”
Ideology is substitute religion , and Bush ’s beliefs were on display in his address to the Legion , where he painted the “ decisive ideological struggle of the 21st century ” in terms of good and evil .
“ On the one side are those who believe in the values of freedom the right of all people to speak , and worship , and live in liberty .
And on the other side are those driven by the values of tyranny and extremism , the right of a self - appointed few to impose their fanatical views on all the rest . ”
Casting one ’s cause in such terms can be effective in wartime .
In his Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural , Lincoln converted a war to crush Southern secession into a crusade to end slavery and save democracy on earth .
Wilson recast a European war of imperial powers as a ” war to end war ” and “ make the world safe for democracy . ” FDR and Churchill in the Atlantic Charter talked of securing “ the Four Freedoms , ” but were soon colluding to hand over Eastern Europe to the worst tyrant and mass murderer of the 20th century .
The peril of ideology is that it rarely comports with reality and is contradicted by history , thus leading inevitably to disillusionment and tragedy .
Consider but a few of the assertions in Bush ’s address .
Said Bush , we know by “ history and logic ” that “ promoting democracy is the surest way to build security . ”
But history and logic teach , rather , what George Washington taught :
The best way to preserve peace is to be prepared for war and to stay out of wars that are none of the nation ’s business .
“ Democracies do n’t attack each other or threaten the peace , ” said Bush .
How does he then explain the War of 1812 , when we went to war against Britain , when she was standing up to Napoleon ?
What about the War Between the States ?
Were not the seceding states democratic ?
What about the Boer War , begun by the Brits ?
What about World War I , fought between the world ’s democracies , which also happened to be empires ruling subject peoples ?
In May 1901 , a 26 - year - old Tory member of Parliament rose to issue a prophetic warning : “ Democracy is more vindictive than Cabinets .
The wars of peoples will be more terrible than the wars of kings . ”
Considering the war that came in 1914 and the vindictive peace it produced , giving us Lenin , Stalin , Mussolini , and Hitler , was not Churchill more right than Bush ?
“ Governments accountable to the people focus on building roads and schools  not weapons of mass destruction , ” said Bush .
But is it not the democracies 
Israel , India , Britain , France , the United States  that possess a preponderance of nuclear weapons ?
Are they all disarming ?
Were not the Western nations first to invent and use poison gas and atom bombs ?
Insisting it is the lack of freedom that fuels terrorism , Bush declares , “ Young people who have a say in their future are less likely to search for meaning in extremism . ”
Tell it to Mussolini and the Blackshirts .
Tell it to the Nazis , who loathed the free republic of Weimar , as did the communists .
“ Citizens who can join a peaceful political party are less likely to join a terrorist organization . ”
But the West has been plagued by terrorists since the anarchists .
The Baader - Meinhoff Gang in Germany , the Red Brigades in Italy , the Puerto Ricans who tried to kill Harry Truman , and the London subway bombers were all raised in freedom .
“ Dissidents with the freedom to protest around the clock , ” said the president , “ are less likely to blow themselves up at rush hour . ”
But Hamas and Islamic Jihad resort to suicide bombing because they think it a far more effective way to overthrow Israeli rule than marching with signs .
What Bush passed over in his speech is that it is the autocratic regimes in Cairo , Riyadh , and Amman that hold back the pent - up animosity toward America and Israel , and free elections that have advanced Hamas , Hezbollah , the Muslim Brotherhood , and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power .
In Iraq , we see the inevitable tragedy of ideology , of allowing some intellectual construct , not rooted in reality , to take control of the minds of men .
Does Visual Studio Rot the Mind ?
Ruminations on the Psychology and Aesthetics of Coding
By Charles Petzold
A Talk Delivered at the NYC .NET Developer ’s Group ,
October 20 , 2005
Abstract : Visual Studio can be one of the programmer 's best friends , but over the years it has become increasingly pushy , domineering , and suffering from unsettling control issues .
Should we just surrender to Visual Studio 's insistence on writing our code for us ?
Or is Visual Studio sapping our programming intelligence rather than augmenting it ?
This talk dissects the code generated by Visual Studio ; analyzes the appalling programming practices it perpetuates ; rhapsodizes about the joys , frustrations , and satisfactions of unassisted coding ; and speculates about the radical changes that Avalon will bring .
I do n’t speak to user groups or developer groups very often , partially because of a bad experience I had a number of years ago .
In 1991 , the Boston Computer Society invited me to speak on the subject of Windows programming .
Since I had written a book on Windows programming — the 2nd edition of Programming Windows had been published just the previous year — I figured I did n’t really need to talk about that .
Anybody who wanted to learn Windows programming could simply buy the book and read it in the privacy of their homes .
Instead , I decided to talk about something that people could not read about in my book .
This was a subject that interested me at the time , which was how Microsoft first developed Windows , and how Microsoft and IBM then got involved in the development of OS / 2 , how Microsoft had convinced IBM to go graphical in the windowing environment , and how IBM decided they wanted to develop an entirely new API , and then how the success of Windows led to the eventual split between Microsoft and IBM .
Well , people went berserk .
I suppose they had been expecting me to tell them everything they needed to know about Windows programming in the space of a few hours , and that ’s certainly not what I was interested in doing .
That was a very traumatic experience for me , and since that time , I have been reticent about speaking before groups like this .
This is a .NET developer ’s group .
I have written four books on .NET programming — the fourth is due out on November 2nd — and anybody who wants to read them is free to do so .
I am now in the process of writing a book on the Windows Presentation Foundation ( formerly code - named Avalon ) but could n’t at this time really tell you a whole lot that ’s useful .
Computers in the Movies
I recently re-watched what I believe to be the first Hollywood movie to deal with computers in a major way .
This is the movie Desk Set .
It ’s 1957 , and Katherine Hepburn supervises three other women in the research department of the Federal Broadcasting Company .
Whenever somebody has a question requiring research , they call up on the phone , and Hepburn and her team get to work on the answer .
Enter Spencer Tracy , a self - described Methods Engineer and the inventor of an “ electronic brain ” called the Electro - Magnetic Memory and Research Arithmetical Calculator or EMERAC — “ Emmy ” for short .
Well , naturally , everybody in the research department assumes they ’re going to be fired , just like what happened in payroll when an “ electronic brain ” was installed there .
Although it ’s expressed here as a nervous humor , this plot line reflected a real anxiety at the time .
Of course , workers did n’t really think that an entire computer was necessary to do their job .
No , people instead joked that they were going to be replaced by a single button .
Emmy the “ electronic brain ” turns out to be quite a sophisticated computer .
It understands natural language questions typed from a keyboard , and prints the answers on a teletypewriter .
Of course , the computer can’t match the cool professionalism of Katherine Hepburn and her staff , and when confronted with a tough question , it reacts in ways we ’re all familiar with from subsequent movie computers :
It makes funny noises , smoke starts pouring out , and it begins spitting Hollerith cards all over the office .
It must have been funny at the time , even for people who knew that computers do n’t break down that way in real life .
I have been programming pretty steadily for about 30 years now , and only once have I seen a computer fail in a way I ’d classify as “ interesting . ”
1
Meanwhile , the “ electronic brain ” installed in payroll starts printing pink slips for everybody in the company .
As we all know , once computers take over , they no longer need humans .
But , as you may anticipate , the human staff is then allowed to come to the rescue and display its superiority over the machine .
Because Desk Set is a Hollywood romantic comedy , and perhaps because IBM supplied all the hardware for the film , human and machine are reconciled at the end .
The computer ’s role is clarified .
It exists merely to assist the humans in their research needs .
The idea of computers trying to “ take over ” their human creators has been replayed in dozens of movies ever since .
Sometimes the computers take a leap into a level of intelligence and consciousness their designers had not anticipated , or perhaps they suffer the computer version of a “ nervous breakdown , ” or they ’re simply too damn logical for their own good .
Sometimes the computer goes so haywire that it does something that no sane human would ever dream of doing — such as starting a war .
Just a few examples2 : 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) .
Good computer ; bad choices .
Colossus : the Forbin Project ( 1970 ) .
American super - computer demands to be connected to Russian super - computer , with expected consequences .
As the movie ’s tag line put it , “ We built a super computer with a mind of its own and now we must fight it for the world ! ”

Ira Levin ’s novel
This Perfect Day from 1970 is n’t a movie of course , but it should be .
A computer runs the world and a few brave souls conspire to defeat it , only to discover … well , this is an Ira Levin novel so it ’s best that you be a little surprised .
This Perfect Day .
Check it out .
Many of the human vs. computer themes show up in WarGames ( 1983 ) , and even this past summer , Hollywood squeezed out a little cinematic turd called Stealth , which my favorite newspaper The Onion hailed as “ the most chilling look at artificial intelligence run amok since Short Circuit 2 . ”
4
Of course , it ’s easy today to see how ridiculous this stuff is .
For example , we have erected a vast network of computers around the world , and it has yet to exhibit the slightest degree of intrinsic intelligence .
It ’s fairly easy to imagine the whole thing collapsing , or getting infected with some virus , but not so easy to imagine it deviously turning against us .
What the Internet seems to do best is make commonly available enormously vast resources of mis-information that we never knew existed .
In thinking about how computers and people interact , I find some older , pre-computer , movies to be more relevant — the ones where people who work with machines and automated processes become subservient to the rhythm of the machine .
I ’m thinking of Fritz Lang ’s Metropolis ( 1927 ) , where an odd feedback system requires people to run the machines by responding to their commands .
The opening scenes of Charlie Chaplin ’s Modern Times ( 1936 ) are still very funny , and let ’s not forget the famous episode of I Love Lucy called “ Job Switching ” ( 1952 ) , the one where Lucy gets a job at the candy factory .
Although these scenes are often played for laughs , they seem to reflect our fear of being forced into a dehumanizing relationship with a machine that imposes its jerky digital rhythm on our normally analogue souls .
These encounters leave an imprint on both minds and our bodies .
In I Am a Fugitive from a Slave Gang ( 1932 ) , a convict who is set free from the chain gang walks away still shuffling his feet as if his ankles are still bound with the chains .
Similarly , four years later in Modern Times , Chaplin walks home from work with his arms still twitching in the rhythm of the machine .
Technological Addictions
When using our computers , something a little different happens .
Of course , we may get repetitive stress disorders from the keyboard or mouse , but software does n’t affect our bodies as much as our minds , and even then in subtle ways .
Some observers of our digital lives have noticed the way in which certain applications cause a user to think in very rigid prescribed ways , and these are not good .
One of the biggest offenders , of course , is PowerPoint .
Start putting what you want to communicate in PowerPoint slides , and everything you want to say is ordered into half a dozen bullet items .
The critiques of technology we see in the movies seem to use metaphors of power or slavery .
I think there ’s a more proper metaphor for our relationships with much of modern consumer technology , however , and that metaphor is addiction .
It is very common for us to say about a piece of consumer technology that “ we did n’t know how much we needed it until we had it , ” and much of this technology seems targeted not to satisfy a particular need , but to get us hooked on something else we never knew we needed ; not to make our lives better , but to tempt us with another designer drug .
“ I ca n’t live without my ___________ ” and you can fill in the blank .
This week , I think , it ’s the video iPod .
Even useful items like cell phones seem to fit this model .
Was the cell phone was n’t invented to fill a particular need ?
I ’m not sure .
It probably was n’t the case of someone sitting on M14 bus thinking “ I ’m bored .
I wish I could call up my friends from this bus . ”
It was partially invented because it was possible to do it , and there was a trust that people eventually would not be able to live without them .
Once we get the taste , we ’re hooked .
I often wish that email had never been invented , but there ’s just no way I can get rid of it .
So , day after day , several times a day , I dutifully delete 99 % of the emails I receive , and when I ’m not able to get at my email for a few days , I ’ll leave the machine at home running to pick it up every 10 minutes so I do n’t overflow some capacity somewhere , and just the other day I caught myself wondering who will clean out my Inbox after I ’m dead .
We see computer technologies going through a life cycle where they turn from beneficial to evil .
I recently installed something from a Microsoft site that dutifully gave me instructions about clicking the yellow bar at the top of Internet Explorer — the yellow bar that is now protecting us from popups and other bad stuff coming through — so I could bypass the normal protection against the installation of Active X controls .
The instructions go on to tell you to ignore all the warnings Windows will then provide about installing this Active X control , because this particular one , unlike all the others , actually does a good thing .
The Nuisance of Information at Your Fingertips
Sometime in the early 1990s , Microsoft came up with the slogan “ Information at your Fingertips . ”
It sounds pretty good in theory , and today we basically have a whole lot of information at our fingertips , what with Google and Wikipedia and the Internet Movie Database and other useful sites .
But information too has become an addiction .
I do n’t know what it ’s like at your house , but we ca n’t even watch a simple rerun of Friends without one of us saying “ Who ’s that actress playing Joey ’s girlfriend ?
She looks familiar . ”
We then click the Info button on the remote to get the title of the particular episode , and then go to tvtome.com or epguides.com to learn the identity of the actress , and then perhaps to Internet Movie Database to see a list of the movies , TV shows , and guest appearances she ’s done , and perhaps for one of the movies we ’ll say “ I always wanted to see that movie ” and so we add it to our NetFlix queue .
Of course , we can do all this without actually leaving the couch .
Why else would we need WiFi in a 400 square foot studio apartment ?
Now I know that five or ten years from now we ’ll be able to perform this entire operation entirely from the cable remote , which may actually be a computer remote , including pausing the episode of Friends to download the movie in which the actress playing Joey ’s girlfriend appears , and watch it on demand , and then go back to the episode of Friends we were watching if we so desire .
And I might be more thrilled at this prospect if I thought it would make us better , happier , nicer human beings .
But that ’s not immediately obvious to me .
And I sincerely hope that in five or ten years from now , we ’re not still watching reruns of Friends .
Although we here in this room are computer users and we are thus stuck with the same annoyances , distractions , and addictions as all computer users , we are also developers and programmers , and for us , the computing experience should be intrinsically different .
Programming is the most empowering thing we can do on a computer , and that ’s what we do .
We write the code that makes the whole world sing .
And yet , if all of us in this room are .NET developers , then we are also undoubtedly Visual Studio users .
I suspect some of us have been playing around with betas of Visual Studio 2005 , and awaiting its official release at DevConnections in Las Vegas in a few weeks .
Life without Visual Studio is unimaginable , and yet , no less than PowerPoint , Visual Studio causes us to do our jobs in various predefined ways , and I , for one , would be much happier if Visual Studio did much less than what it does .
Certain features in Visual Studio are supposed to make us more productive , and yet for me , they seem to denigrate and degrade the programming experience .
API Proliferation
Twenty years ago , in November 1985 , Windows 1.0 debuted with approximately 400 documented function calls .
5
Ten years later , Windows 95 had well over a thousand .
6
Today we are ready for the official release of the .NET Framework 2.0 .
Tabulating only MSCORLIB.DLL and those assemblies that begin with word System , we have over 5,000 public classes that include over 45,000 public methods and 15,000 public properties , not counting those methods and properties that are inherited and not overridden .
A book that simply listed the names , return values , and arguments of these methods and properties , one per line , would be about a thousand pages long .
If you wrote each of those 60,000 properties and methods on a 3 - by - 5 index card with a little description of what it did , you ’d have a stack that totaled 40 feet .
7
These 60,000 cards , laid out end to end — the five inch end , not the three inch end — can encircle Central Park ( almost ) , and I hear this will actually be a public art project next summer .
Can any one programmer master 60,000 methods and properties ?
I think not .
One solution , of course , is specialization .
I myself have specialized .
This evening I hope no one will ask me questions about web forms or ASP .NET or SQL Server because those are n’t my specialty .
I do Windows Forms , and my language is C# .
IntelliSense
Visual Studio has attempted to alleviate the problem of class , method , and property proliferation with a feature called IntelliSense .
IntelliSense indeed puts information at our fingertips , if you think of your fingertips figuratively as that place on the screen where the keyboard caret is .
Like other addictive technologies , I have a love / hate relationship with IntelliSense , and the more I despise it , the more I use it , and the more I use it , the more disgusted I am at how addicted I ’ve gotten , and the more addicted I get , the more I wish it had never been invented .
Just in case you ’ve been out of the trenches for awhile , IntelliSense is a culmination of some past attempts at code completion technologies .
If you type an object name and a period , for example , you ’ll get a little scrollable dropdown menu with a list of all the public methods , properties , and events for that class , and when you choose a method name and type a left parenthesis , you ’ll get the various overloads with arguments , and a little tooltip describing what the method does .
IntelliSense is considered by some to be the most important programming innovation since caffeine .
It works especially well with .NET because Visual Studio can use reflection to obtain all the information it needs from the actual DLLs you ’ve specified as references .
In fact , IntelliSense has become the first warning sign that you have n’t properly included a DLL reference or a using directive at the top of your code .
You start typing and IntelliSense comes up with nothing .
You know immediately something is wrong .
And yet , IntelliSense is also dictating the way we program .
For example , for many years programmers have debated whether it ’s best to code in a top - down manner , where you basically start with the overall structure of the program and then eventually code the more detailed routines at the bottom ; or , alternatively , the bottom - up approach , where you start with the low - level functions and then proceed upwards .
Some languages , such as classical Pascal , basically impose a bottom - up approach , but other languages do not .
Well , the debate is now over .
In order to get IntelliSense to work correctly , bottom - up programming is best .
IntelliSense wants every class , every method , every property , every field , every method parameter , every local variable properly defined before you refer to it .
If that ’s not the case , then IntelliSense will try to correct what you ’re typing by using something that has been defined , and which is probably just plain wrong .
For example , suppose you ’re typing some code and you decide you need a variable named id , and instead of defining it first , you start typing a statement that begins with id and a space .
I always type a space between my variable and the equals sign .
Because id is not defined anywhere , IntelliSense will find something that begins with those two letters that is syntactically correct in accordance with the references , namespaces , and context of your code .
In my particular case , IntelliSense decided that I really wanted to define a variable of interface type IDataGridColumnStyleEditingNotificationService , an interface I ’ve never had occasion to use .
On the plus side , if you really need to define an object of type IDataGridColumnStyleEditingNotificationService , all you need do is type id and a space .
If that ’s wrong , you can eliminate IntelliSense ’s proposed code and go back to what you originally typed with the Undo key combination Ctrl - Z .
I wish I could slap its hand and say “ No , ” but Ctrl - Z is the only thing that works .
Who could ever have guess that Ctrl - Z would become one of the most important keystrokes in using modern Windows applications ?
Ctrl - Z works in Microsoft Word as well , when Word is overly aggressive about fixing your typing .
But the implication here is staggering .
To get IntelliSense to work right , not only must you code in a bottom - up structure , but within each method or property , you must also write you code linearly from beginning to end — just as if you were using that old DOS line editor , EDLIN .
You must define all variables before you use them .
No more skipping around in your code .
It ’s not that IntelliSense is teaching us to program like a machine ; it ’s just that IntelliSense would be much happier if we did .
And I think it ’s making us dumber .
Instead of finding out exactly the method I need , or instead of trying to remember an elusive property name , I find myself scrolling through the possibilities that IntelliSense provides , looking for a familiar name , or at least something that seems like it might do the job .
I do n’t need to remember anything any more .
IntelliSense will remember it for me .
Besides , I justify to myself , I may not want those 60,000 methods and properties cluttering up my mind .
My overall mental health will undoubtedly be better without them , but at the same time I ’m prevented from ever achieving a fluid coding style because the coding is not coming entirely from my head .
My coding has become a constant dialog with IntelliSense .
So I do n’t think IntelliSense is helping us become better programmers .
The real objective is for us to become faster programmers , which also means that it ’s cheapening our labor .
Of course , I could always just turn it off .
And go cold turkey ?
I do n’t think so !
IntelliSense is a technology that is inevitable .
If Microsoft had n’t done it , somebody else would have .
Human beings have never been inclined to refrain from pursuing certain technologies because they may have unfortunate repercussions .
Generated Code
Not only does Visual Studio try to complete code we ’re typing , but for many years now , Visual Studio has wanted to generate code for us .
If we select a new project type of Windows Application , for example , and give it a name and location on a local drive , Visual Studio generates sufficient code so that this project is immediately compilable and runable .
Somehow , we have been persuaded that this is the proper way to program .
I do n’t know why .
Personally , I find starting a program with an empty source code file to be very enjoyable .
I like typing the preliminaries and then the main function or the Main method .
The time when I can really use some help is not when I ’m starting a program , but when I ’m trying to finish it .
Where is Visual Studio then ?
Let ’s go into Visual Studio 2005 in our imaginations and create a C# Windows Forms program — a project of type Windows Application — and let ’s examine the code .
First , we see that Visual Studio has hooked up our program to a bunch of dynamic link libraries it thinks we will need .
It has created references not only to the System , System .
Drawing , and System .
Windows .
Forms assemblies that are required of any non-trivial Windows Forms application , but also System .
Data , System .
Deployment , and System .
Xml , regardless whether your program needs these DLLs or not .
These extra references do n’t do any real harm except if someone else examines the program — perhaps to make some changes after the original programmer has moved on — and assumes that the application requires these references .
Now there ’s confusion , because references to DLLs exist that the program really does n’t need .
Among other files , Visual Studio creates a file named Form1.cs that it graciously allows you the programmer to modify .
This is the source code file where the event handlers go for controls on the main form .
We see a bunch of using directives at the top with the namespaces the program needs .
The normal namespaces for Windows Forms programs are System , System .
Drawing , and System .
Windows .
Forms , but Visual Studio also includes System .
Collections .
Generic , System.ComponentModel , System .
Data , and System .
Text , some of which are useful to be sure , but if the program does n’t actually use any of the classes in these namespaces , they ’re just distracting noise .
Visual Studio also encloses all the code it generates in a namespace that is given the same name as the project name .
Of course , I understand entirely the value of having a namespace for DLLs , but why have a namespace for applications ?
I have given this much thought , and I can’t figure it out .
I ’ve been talking about code , but when you create a new Windows Forms project , Visual Studio does n’t put any of the source code files in front of your face .
Instead , it puts a design view of a form which you are then expected to start interactively populating with controls .
Visual Studio also creates a file named Form1 .
Designer.cs , and in some beta versions of Visual Studio 2005 , this file was n’t even listed among the project files by default .
This is the file in which Visual Studio inserts generated code when you design your form .
Visual Studio really does n’t want you messing around with this file , and for good reason .
Visual Studio is expecting this generated code to be in a certain format , and if you mess with it , it may not be able to read it back in the next time you open the project .
The Origins of the Designer
Of course , the interactive design of forms is one of the major features of Visual Studio .
It may help to contrast the Visual Studio designer with the way Windows programming was done 20 years ago when Windows 1.0 was first released — 20 years ago next month , to be precise .
I do n’t want to bore everybody with war stories about Windows 1.0 programming , but basically you did most of your programming outside of Windows on the DOS command line .
You edited your source code with your favorite editor — mine was a word processor of the era called WordStar — and then you ’d compile and link on the command line , and run your application in Windows by typing Win followed by the name of your EXE file .
You ’d test out your program in Windows and then exit Windows back to DOS and reload the source code in your editor .
It was not possible to do much program development inside Windows except to run the Windows - based Icon Editor that helped you make icons , cursors , and small bitmaps .
To define the layout of menus and dialog boxes , you created a text resource script .
In this file you ’d type templates for the menus and dialog boxes in a particular defined format .
For dialog boxes , you ’d basically list the controls you wanted in the dialog box .
The syntax was n’t too bad , for example , the keyword BUTTON followed by the text that appeared in the button , the button ’s location in the dialog box , and its width and height .
Because Windows could run under systems of different display resolutions , these sizes and locations were in a special dialog box coordinate system , where horizontal units were equivalent to ¼ the width of the default system font , and vertical units were 1/8 the height of the font .
These resource scripts were actually considered an enormous time saver .
If you did n’t have the resource script , you ’d have to create the menu and dialog boxes in code , and that was a particularly onerous job .
And the syntax of the resource script was so clean and simple that it remains to this day the most concise way of defining menus and dialog boxes that I have ever seen .
There was only one little problem :
All those controls in your dialog boxes had to be positioned and sized correctly with numbers you had to figure out .
Sometimes it would help to start with a piece of graph paper and do a hand mockup of the dialog box .
Otherwise , it was pretty much a matter of trial and error , back and forth , load up Windows , invoke the dialog box , see how crappy it looked , exit Windows , reload the resource script , and eventually you ’d fine tune those sizes and locations until it looked right .
Sometime in 1986 or so , beta versions of a Dialog Editor emerged from Microsoft .
I found out about it by lurking on a bulletin board called the Windows Developers Roundtable on the information service GEnie , the General Electric Network for Information Exchange .
The Dialog Editor was a Windows program that let you interactively design your dialog boxes by moving controls around , and would then output the dialog template in the correct format .
I eventually wrote an article about it for the very first issue of Microsoft Systems Journal in October 1986 .
The article had the title “ Latest Dialog Editor Speeds Windows Application Development ” .
But for the Windows programs that I later wrote for MSJ , and for those in the first edition of Programming Windows , I could n’t use this Dialog Editor .
I could n’t use it for the simple reason that the output of the Dialog Editor was ugly .
Let me explain what I mean by that , and why it ’s a problem .
People who write code for publication have some extra burdens that most programmers need not worry about .
The code we write has to be concise but not to the point where it ’s obscure .
It should be nicely formatted and easy to read .
There should be plenty of white space .
It should be airy .
It ca n’t have superfluous variables or unused functions .
It has to compile without warning messages .
Moreover , code published in books is limited to line lengths of about 80 characters , sometimes a little more , sometimes less .
Magazines sometimes impose even more severe limits , depending how much power the art department has in the political structure of the magazine staff .
Microsoft Systems Journal was an interesting case .
Although M SJ was originally supposed to be strictly a Windows - programming magazine — they later chickened out and made it for DOS programming as well — it was laid out entirely on Macs and the art department ruled .
Art people love very narrow text columns , and I remember MSJ going to extra-narrow columns at about the same time that the OS / 2 Presentation Manager was introducing function calls like GpiQueryModelTransformMatrix .
Under these criteria , the Dialog Editor generated ugly and unusable output .
It did n’t even generate BUTTON , LABEL , and LISTBOX statements like a normal human being .
Instead , it spit out everything as general - purpose CONTROL statements followed by class names .
These lines had lots of superfluous information .
All the parameters were included , although many of them were default values .
These lines were way over 80 characters .
People have to read this stuff , and the Dialog Editor output was unreadable .
Moreover , if somebody is trying to reproduce the dialog box on their own , it does n’t make any sense to show the output from the Dialog Editor .
When I was working on the first edition of Programming Windows in 1987 , sometimes I ’d use the Dialog Editor and then manually convert the output to something a human being might write .
But mostly I just got skilled at designing dialog boxes by hand .
Of course , a Dialog Editor is certainly a piece of “ inevitable technology . ”
It ’s so obvious that it must be created , and in principle , I ca n’t summon up any arguments against it .
It ’s what it evolved into that really bothers me .
Interactive Design
Most of the really innovative interactive design stuff found its first expressions in the Windows - based versions of Visual Basic , and here ’s where I started becoming nervous about where Windows programming was headed .
Not only could you move a button onto your form , and interactively position and size it just the way you wanted , but if you clicked on the button , Visual Basic would generate an event handler for you and let you type in the code .
This bothered me because Visual Basic was treating a program not as a complete coherent document , but as little snippets of code attached to visual objects .
That ’s not what a program is .
That ’s not what the compiler sees .
How did one then get a sense of the complete program ?
It baffled me .
Eventually , the interactive design stuff found its way into development with C++ and the Microsoft Foundation Classes , and there , I truly believe , code generation was used to hide a lot of really hairy MFC support that nobody wanted to talk about .
For an author who writes programming books , all this stuff presents a quandary .
How do you write a programming tutorial ?
Do you focus on using Visual Studio to develop applications ?
Frankly , I found it very hard to write sentences like “ Now drag the button object from the tool box to your dialog box ” and still feel like I was teaching programming .
I never wrote about C++ and MFC , partially because MFC seemed like a light wrapper on the Windows API and barely object oriented at all .
I continued to revise later editions of Programming Windows under the assumption that its readers were programmers like me who preferred to write their own code from scratch .
Bye , Bye , Resource Script
I first started looking at beta .
NET 1.0 and Windows Forms in the summer of 2000 , and it was clearly more object oriented than MFC could ever be .
I liked it .
I was also intrigued that the resource script had entirely disappeared .
You created and assembled controls on dialog boxes — now subsumed under the more global term of “ forms ” — right there in your code .
Of course , even in Windows 1.0 , you could create controls in code , and the first edition of Programming Windows has some examples .
But it just was n’t very pleasant , because every control creation involved a call to the 11 - argument CreateWindow function .
But creating controls in code in Windows Forms was a snap .
What ’s nice about creating and manipulating controls in code is that you ’re creating and manipulating them in code .
Suppose you want a column of ten equally - spaced buttons of the same size displaying Color names .
In a program , you can actually store those ten Color values in one place .
It ’s called an array .
There ’s also an excellent way to create and position these ten buttons .
It ’s called a for loop .
This is programming .
But Visual Studio does n’t want you to use arrays or loops to create and position these buttons .
It wants you to use the designer , and it wants to generate the code for you and hide it away where you ca n’t see it .
Almost twenty years after the first Dialog Editor , Visual Studio is now the culprit that generates ugly code and warns you not to mess with it .
If you do try to read this code , it ’s not that easy because every class and structure is preceded by a full namespace :
System.Windows.Forms.Button button1 = new System. Windows.Forms.Button ( ) ;
Of course , we know why Visual Studio needs to do this .
In theory , it ’s possible for you to add to the Visual Studio toolbox another control named Button from another DLL with another namespace , and there must be a way to differentiate them .
As Visual Studio is generating code based on the controls you select , it gives the controls standard names , such as button1 , button2 , button3 , label1 , label2 , label3 , textBox1 , textBox2 , textBox3 .
Of course , Visual Studio lets you change that variable name .
You change the Name property of the control , and that becomes not only the Name property of the button object , but also the button variable name .
Do programmers actually do this ?
I ’m sure some do , but I ’m also sure many do not .
How do I know ?
Take a look at some of the sample code that comes out of Microsoft .
There you ’ll see button1 , button2 , button3 , label1 , label2 , label3 , etc .
Any yet , everyone agrees that one of the most important elements of writing self - documenting code is giving your variables and objects meaningful names .
If Visual Studio really wanted you to write good code , every time you dragged a control onto your form , an annoying dialog would pop up saying “ Type in a meaningful name for this control . ”
But Visual Studio is not interested in having you write good code .
It wants you to write code fast .
While I ’m on the subject of variable names , I should say something good about Visual Studio .
Visual Studio 2005 has a totally splendid variable - renaming facility .
You know how sometimes you really want to rename a variable to be more in tune with its actual function in the program but you ’re afraid to because of possible side effects of search - and - replace ?
Well , this new variable - renaming avoids all that , and it will also tell you if you ’re renaming something to an existing name .
I hope people take advantage of this to rename their controls to something other than the Visual Studio defaults .
Overused Fields
Another problem with Visual Studio ’s generated code is that every control is made a field of the class in which it is created .
This is a hideous programming practice , and it really bothers me that programmers may be looking at the code generated by Visual Studio to learn proper programming technique , and this is what they see .
In the pre-object oriented days of C programming , we had local variables and global variables , variables inside of functions , and variables outside of functions .
One objective of good programming in C was in keeping the number of global variables to a minimum .
Because any global variable could be modified by any function , it was easier to get the sense of a program if there simply were n’t very many of them — if functions communicated among themselves strictly through arguments and return values .
Sometimes , however , C programmers got a little , let ’s say , sleepy , and made a lot of variables global that did n’t really need to be , because it was just easier that way .
Rather than add an extra argument to a function , why not just store it as a global ?
Global variables are basically gone in object - oriented programming , except that fields are now the new global variables , and they can be abused just as badly .
One basic principle of object - oriented programming is hiding data .
This is generally meant to apply between classes .
Classes should n’t expose everything they have .
They should have as small a public interface as possible , and other classes should know only what they need to know .
But the principle of data hiding is just as important inside a class .
Methods should have limited access to the data that other methods are using .
In general , variables should be made local to a method unless there ’s a specific reason why they need to be accessed from some other method .
When you create an object using the new operator , the amount of storage allocated from the heap for the object must be sufficient to accommodate all the fields defined in the class you ’re creating the object from and all the ancestor classes .
The fields basically define the size of the object in memory .
I know that we ’re long past the point of worrying about every byte of storage , but when you look at the fields you ’ve defined in your class , you should be asking yourself :
Does all this stuff really need to be stored with each object in the heap ?
Or have I successfully restricted the fields to that information necessary to maintain the object ?
Someone told me that he likes to store objects as fields because he ’s afraid the .NET garbage collector will snag everything that ’s not nailed down into a proper field definition .
After years of defining very few fields in .NET , I can tell you this is not a problem .
The .NET garbage collector will only delete objects that are no longer referenced anywhere in the program .
If you can still access an object in some way , it is not eligible for garbage collection .
In theory , no child control created as part of a form needs to be stored as a field because the parent — generally a form — stores all its child controls in the collection named Controls , and you can reference each control by indexing the Controls property using and integer or the text Name property you assigned to it when creating the control .
And here again you ’re in much better shape if your controls have meaningful names and not button1 , button2 , button3 , label1 , label2 , label3 …
Whether a particular object is defined as a field or a local variable is something that we as programmers should be thinking about with every object we create .
A label that has the same text during the entire duration of the form can easily be local .
For a label whose text is set from an event handler of some other control , it ’s probably most convenient to store as a field .
It ’s as simple as that .
But Visual Studio does n’t want you to think about that .
Visual Studio wants everything stored as a field .
Visual Studio Demystified
Even if Visual Studio generated immaculate code , there would still be a problem .
As Visual Studio is generating code , it is also erecting walls between that code and the programmer .
Visual Studio is implying that this is the only way you can write a modern Windows or web program because there are certain aspects of modern programming that only it knows about .
And Visual Studio adds to this impression by including boilerplate code that contains stuff that has never really been adequately discussed in the tutorials or documentation that Microsoft provides .
It becomes imperative to me , as a teacher of Windows Forms programming and Avalon programming , to deliberately go in the opposite direction .
I feel I need to demystify what Visual Studio is doing and demonstrate how you can develop these applications by writing your own code , and even , if you want , compiling this code on the command line totally outside of Visual Studio .
In my Windows Forms books , I tell the reader not to choose Windows Application when starting a new Windows Forms project , but to choose the Empty Project option instead .
The Empty Project does n’t create anything except a project file .
All references and all code has to be explicitly added .
Am I performing a service by showing programmers how to write code in a way that is diametrically opposed to the features built into the tool that they ’re using ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe this is wrong , but I ca n’t see any alternative .
Dynamic Layout
I ’ve been talking about the release of Visual Studio 2005 next month .
Along with Visual Studio is also the .NET Framework 2.0 , with some significant enhancements to Windows Forms , including a very strong commitment to “ dynamic layout ” ( sometimes also known as “ automatic layout ” ) .
Dynamic layout is also a significant part of the design philosophy of Avalon .
Dynamic layout is an example how Web standards have now influenced standalone client Windows programming .
We have learned from HTML that it ’s not necessary to put every single object on the screen with precise pixel coordinates .
We have learned that it ’s possible for a layout manager built into our browsers to flow text and graphics down the page , or to organize content in a table or frames .
HTML has also provided a good case study in illustrating some ways not to implement these things , so these ways can be avoided .
Basically , when using dynamic layout in Windows Forms , the actual location and size of controls is n’t decided until run time .
When the form is displayed , the layout manager takes into account the size of the controls , the size of the container , and lays out the controls appropriately .
Also , as controls have become more complex , they have become more difficult to use in predefined layouts .
How big should a particular control be ?
Perhaps that can only be known at run time .
It ’s much better if the program does not impose a size on the control , but rather that the control determines its own size at run time , and to have that size taken into account during layout .
Now obviously this is more complex , because a layout manager has to interrogate the controls and determine how large they want to be , and then attempt to accommodate them all within an area of screen real estate .
But this is built into the classes of Windows Forms 2.0 .
The FlowLayoutPanel and the TableLayoutPanel together with the SplitContainer and the Dock property provide a full array of tools for dynamic layout .
You can basically design entire forms and dialog boxes largely without using pixel coordinates or sizes .
There are some exceptions , to be sure .
You ’ll probably want to set widths of combo boxes to specific sizes based on average character widths .
But for the most part , this stuff works .
In my new book I have a whole chapter on dynamic layout that concludes with code that duplicates the standard FontDialog with a TableLayoutPanel , and I come pretty close .
We now have the proper tools in the form of classes to render the Visual Studio forms designer obsolete .
Unfortunately , nobody has told Visual Studio about this new age .
Visual Studio definitely supports layout based on FlowLayoutPanel and TableLayoutPanel , of course , but you have to know about these things and explicitly put them on your form before you start populating the form with controls .
Inexplicably , Visual Studio still stores pixel coordinates and sizes in your source code even though they are irrelevant in these cases
Avalon and XAML
Some people have assumed that with the planned introduction of Avalon next year — now properly called the Windows Presentation Foundation — that Windows Forms is already obsolete .
But the more I look at Avalon , the less I believe that to be the case .
Certainly Avalon has the power and breadth to support large applications , and a graphics system that will bring 3D capability to the average programmer .
But Avalon is currently missing some amenities we take for granted , such as standard File Open , File Close , and Font dialogs , a split panel , and it has nothing approaching the new and totally astonishing DataGridView control in Windows Forms 2.0 .
Whether these things get into Avalon before it ’s released , I do n’t know .
But Windows
Forms may still be the best bet for quickly constructing forms - based applications for in - house corporate use .
Avalon , as I mentioned , also has a strong commitment to dynamic layout .
In Windows Forms , doing layout with pixels locations and sizes is basically the default .
You need to specifically create a FlowLayoutPanel or TableLayoutPanel to dispense with pixels .
In Avalon , working with pixel coordinates is not the default .
For each window or page , you have to pick a particular layout model , and the one where you specify pixels — a descendent of Panel named Canvas — is certainly being deemphasized as a choice .
And even if you do go with Canvas , you ’re not really working in units of pixels .
You ’re using something oddly called “ device - independent pixels , ” which is a coordinate system based on units of 1/96th of an inch , which is a one - to - one map with today ’s default video display settings , but lets us achieve device independence with non-default settings .
But that ’s not the half of it .
When you put together your windows and dialogs in Avalon , you can do it either in code or in XML .
Microsoft has come up with an entire page description language called XAML , the Extensible Application Markup Language , pronounced “ zammel . ”
In a proper Avalon program , the XAML is supposed to contain all the layout stuff , and the programming code ties it all together , mostly with event handlers .
I was at first skeptical of this invention called XAML .
I had liked the Windows Forms approach of doing everything in code , and now something like a resource script — but obviously much more sophisticated — was being reintroduced into Windows programming .
I gradually became persuaded , however , and now I like it .
One thing that the Avalon architects are trying to do is let programmers and designers work around common files .
Not every software project requires people who design the screens and dialog boxes , but large ones do , and in the past the designers did mockups with graphical tools and used bitmaps to show the programmers what they wanted .
With Avalon they can use design tools that create and edit XAML , and the programmers can use this same XAML as source code in creating the executables .
Another reason I was persuaded in this :
As we get more into dynamic layout , a form becomes a hierarchy of different types of panels and controls .
You might start with a DockPanel and put menus and toolbars at the top of a window and a status bar at the bottom , and then inside you put a Grid panel , and then perhaps within some of the cells of the grid you have a StackPanel , and so forth .
This hierarchy of panels and controls has an analogue in the XAML as a nesting of elements .
If the XAML is indented in a standard way , you can see the hierarchy right there in the file .
I also have much less of a problem with a visual designer generating XAML than generating C# code .
As we ’ve seen , Visual Studio does n’t even want you to look at the C# code it generates , and for good reason .
But XML is different .
It was a design point of XML that it can be created and edited by either human or machine , and it should n’t matter at all which is which .
As long as the XML is left in a syntactically and semantically correct state — and there is no middle ground — it should n’t matter who edits it and in what order .
If I ’m going to be putting XAML in a book , it does n’t matter if I wrote it or Visual Studio wrote it , because it should basically be the same .
And , for someone who wants to recreate the layout of panels and controls in Visual Studio , the XAML serves as a clear guide in illustrating the hierarchy .
Will there be a designer built into Visual Studio that works entirely with XAML and lets me write my own C# code ?
I do n’t know yet .
It certainly makes sense .
I am also hoping that developers eventually achieve a good balance between XAML and code .
The Avalon architects are so proud of XAML — and rightfully so — that they tend to use it for everything .
I saw an Avalon clock application that somebody at Microsoft wrote .
It actually set the time once in code and used Avalon animation entirely implemented in XAML to keep the clock going .
It was very , very cool , except that the 12 tick marks of the clock were implemented in 12 virtually identical chunks of XAML .
The only thing that would have appalled me more was seeing 60 tick marks implemented 60 identical chunks of XAML .
I do n’t know what rule you go by , but for me it ’s always been simple : “ Three or more : Use a for . ”
This is why we have loops .
This is why we are programmers .
The Pure Pleasures of Pure Coding
A couple months ago — perhaps as an antidote to all this highfalutin Windows Forms and Avalon programming I ’ve been doing — I started coding in C again .
Just a little bit .
A magazine I read — the British weekly New Scientist — runs a tiny regular feature called “ Enigma , ” which presents a little math puzzle .
Here ’s a particularly short one from this past June : “ What is the largest integer whose digits are all different ( and do not include 0 ) that is divisible by each of its individual digits ? ” 8
If you solve one of the Enigma problems , you can send in your solution , and one is chosen at random on a particular date , and if yours is picked you get 15 pounds and a mention in the magazine .
These Enigma problems have actually annoyed me for years because they always seemed solvable by writing a short program and testing out the possibilities , and for some reason that seemed absurd to me .
A few months ago I decided it might actually be interesting solving the problems with code , and then posting the programs and solutions on my web site the day after the deadline , but about a week before the answer appears in print .
I decided to use plain old ANSI C , and to edit the source code in Notepad — which has no IntelliSense and no sense of any other kind — and to compile on the command line using both the Microsoft C compiler and the Gnu C compiler .
What ’s appealing about this project is that I do n’t have to look anything up .
I ’ve been coding in C for 20 years .
It was my favorite language before C# came along .
This stuff is just pure algorithmic coding with simple text output .
It ’s all content .
I also discovered is that the problems do require some thought before you code them up .
Very often , the total number of combinations is prohibitive .
You really have to whittle them down .
You do n’t want to write a program that runs for a week before getting to the printf statement .
For example , take the problem I quoted : “ What is the largest integer whose digits are all different ( and do not include 0 ) that is divisible by each of its individual digits ? ”
It really helps to realize that this integer cannot contain the digit 5 if it also contains any even digit , because then the number would be divisible by 10 , and the last digit would be 0 , which is n’t allowed .
So , the number we ’re looking for probably does n’t include 5 .
That immediately reduces the possibilities by an order of magnitude .
Even after this preliminary process , there ’s still coding to do , but there ’s no APIs , there ’s no classes , there ’s no properties , there ’s no forms , there ’s no controls , there ’s no event handlers , and there ’s definitely no Visual Studio .
It ’s just me and the code , and for awhile , I feel like a real programmer again .

Back to the Et cetera page .
Back to Home
There have been quite some comments on the Iceweasel case all over the planets , and I saw several assertions , especially from the MozillaÂ® camp , that I , as the Firefox Â ® co-maintainer , the xulrunner maintainer , and ( soon ) Seamonkeyâ „ ¢ iceape co-maintainer , have to rectify .
They broke the –enable - official - branding flag Half - true .
We just replaced Bon Echo / Deer Park with FirefoxÂ ® at the appropriate places in the build tree so that we could have FirefoxÂ® with the “ unbranded ” logo instead of the official logo , as Gervase Markham gave us authorization for .
You ’re still free to enable the official branding , except that since the logos and stuff are non-free , we removed the other - licenses / branding / directory from the original tarball , thus yes , the flag is half broken .
FirefoxÂ® logos being subject to trademarks , Debian thinks they are not free .
Trademark and copyright are different things .
MozillaÂ® has unnecessarily given a non -free license to “ clarify ” the trademark situation , but that is not required .
To make it clear : Debian thinks the logos are not free because they are not free .
Period .
Debian isnâ€™t properly collaborating with MozillaÂ® , sending unusable 100000 - lines patches for validation just before releases ( as seen on Lucas Nussbaum ’s blog )
Let me take the firefox_2.0~rc1+dfsg-1.diff.gz file , strip the debian directory from it ( it only contains maintainer scripts , our set of icons and some debian specific searchplugins ) , and strip the configure diff that is generated by autoconf due to some changes in configure .in… that ’s exactly 2654 lines of diff .
Very far from the 100000 - lines patches they are claiming .
The Mozilla people talked about Debian - specific changes that changed frozen APIs , breaking extensions ( from Lucas ’s blog again ) .
So , let ’s dig into our firefox_2.0~rc1+dfsg-1.diff.gz :
Changes to disable application upgrade ( we want that to happen through apt - get ) and change some other default preferences ,
Changes to fix “ make distclean ” so that it really cleans the build directory ,
Change not to build the “ mangle ” utility ,
Change not to call netstat to generate entropy , which is useless on linux ,
Changes to make FirefoxÂ® build and work on architectures such as hppa , mips , mips64 , m68 k , ia64 , sparc64 , alpha , and arm , which the MozillaÂ® guys do n’t seem to care much for ,
Change to add a preference directory so that users can put their set of customized preferences in /etc / firefox / pref ,
Change to allow to build flat chrome without the zip utility ,
Change to allow to use system library for myspell , instead of statically linking the bundled one ,
Changes to allow to build s390 binaries on s390 x host with s390 toolchain ( same applies with x86 binaries on amd64 host with x86 toolchain ) ,
Changes to work around bugs with the hidden visibility pragma on gcc ,
Changes to make the pango backend actually build correctly ,
Changes to avoid some error messages while trying to create Makefiles from inexistant Makefile .in’s ,
Change to install in /usr / lib / firefox instead of /usr / lib / firefox - x.y ,
Change not to build useless chromelist .
txt files ,
Changes to make helper applications with parameters work ,
Changes to allow builds against GTK 2.8 ,
Changes to work around an Xrender bug ,
Changes to make the Gecko / yymmdddd string taken from preferences instead of being half - hard - coded ( you could change it with preferences , but it would still be set to the hard - coded value at start time ; and you could change it again with preferences … ) ,
Change to allow mice extra buttons to act as something else than a left button ,
Change to allow to build with - Wl , –as - needed to avoid linking against a whole lot of useless libraries , without losing the link on libxpcom .
so which is required by some extensions ’ components ,
Changes not to shlibsign the NSS modules at build time , since we ’re stripping the binaries afterwards , thus breaking the signature .
We do build the signatures later , within the maintainer scripts .
That ’s not that many changes , and most of them were taken from either some MozillaÂ® CVS trunk or the MozillaÂ® Bugzillaâ „¢ .
And most of those that were not taken from there have been sent , except those that really do n’t make much sense outside Debian .
So , where are these frozen API changes ?
And we ’re not properly collaborating , huh ?
The MozillaÂ® project started by coming to a ( admittedly uneasy ) agreement with Debian for use of the name , but the Debian version diverged even further from the official version , so the permission was revoked .
( from comments on Matthew Garrett ’s blog )
That one is really interesting , because between the time we got this understanding with Gervase and now , we are actually less diverging from the official version than by then .
The main difference by that time was the extensions manager , which , in Debian , needed a lot of changes to actually act as it should , especially with globally installed extensions .
I ’m not saying the Debian one was perfect , it also had its own problems , but that was a whole lot less than the blatant crap that was the official one , obviously written for Windows without any thoughts for unix , and especially linux distributions .
The only main difference now , between the official FirefoxÂ ® and ours , is that our build has the pango backend enabled , which we chose over the Xft backend for several reasons I wo n’t explain here .
The others differences are that we use system libraries where possible , instead of the bundled libpng , libjpeg , libtiff , libmyspell and libcairo .
We also build a flat chrome , instead of having everything in . jar files .
Now , a little bit about differences the MozillaÂ® guys do n’t seem to care about while they really should : distributions build the MozillaÂ® products with gcc 4.x , while the official binaries are built with gcc 3.4 , as well as the extensions distributed on addons.mozilla.org .
Fortunately , not a lot of extensions make use of binary components , and not a lot are linked against the standard C++ library , but when that happens ( like with colorzilla ) , you get a component linked against libstdc ++5 to load on a Firefox Â ® that is linked against libstdc ++6 .
You are lucky if that setup does n’t crash .
Little extra from comments in Lucas ’s blog :
Is it possible for the Debian Firefox maintainers to create an installer package for contrib which will install the vanilla FireFox from Mozillaâ€™s site .
How great would it be to have a package for one architecture instead of 12 , and with a dependency on libstdc ++5 , that almost no other package uses any more .
Update : Debian is going to replace FirefoxÂ® with a GNU fork called Iceweasel Half - true .
For the etch release , Iceweasel will only be FirefoxÂ® with a different branding .
We are taking the Iceweasel name because it was already know as a possible alternative name for FirefoxÂ ® when the trademark concerns have been raised more than 2 years ago ( thanks Nathanael Nerode for this nice name , by the way ) .
It appears that the GNU guys decided to start a fork with this name … that ’s quite unfortunate , actually .
Anyways , the plan is to get in touch with them to see what we can do together , but with the etch release approaching , we ca n’t and wo n’t do more than a rename for the moment .
Update 2 : We ( MozillaÂ® ) presently have working relationships with most of the major Linux distributions , including Red Hat , Novell , and Ubuntu ( As seen in several posts from people of the MozillaÂ® Corporation or Foundation )
Very interesting .
Ubuntu uses the same set of patches as Debian , with some more of their own , and even releases beta software in their official releases .
But when it ’s Ubuntu , it ’s fine .
Sorry , I forgot Debian is lame , and DDs are frustrated fanatic integrists , on top of being bloody fanatic assholes .
Update 3 : Added some precisions about other differences with the official binaries , and a small patch I somehow forgot .
firefox , xulrunner
Both comments and pings are currently closed .
In 1994 , the world learned that the Intel Pentium chip had a bug .
In certain cases it gave the wrong answer when calculating floating - point division .
These cases were rare , only 1 in 9 billion divisions , and typically only resulted in errors past the 8th decimal place .
What did Intel do about this ?
Well , there was denial at first , and then dismissal of the problem as being trivial and unimportant .
But eventually they saw the light and offered a no-questions - asked replacement policy for defective processors .
No doubt this was expensive for Intel , but this preserved their good name and reputation .
It could have been different .
For example , they could have simply kept the bug .
They could have preserved that bug in future versions of the Pentium for backwards compatibility , arguing that there was some software out there that may have worked around the original defect , and for Intel to fix the bug now would only break the software that worked around the bug .
This is a dangerous line of reasoning .
What bug ca n’t be excused by that argument ?
Intel could have further decided to turn their bug into a standard , and get it blessed by a standards development organization and maybe even ISO .
“ It ’s not a bug , it ’s a standard ” .
But Intel is not Microsoft , so they do n’t have quite the audacity to turn a bug into a standard , which is what Microsoft is attempting to do by declaring in Office Open XML ( OOXML ) that the the year 1900 should be treated as a leap year , in contradiction of the Gregorian Calendar which has been in use almost 500 years .
( Years divisible by 100 are leap years only if they are also divisible by 400 )
By mandating the perpetuation of this bug , we are asking for trouble .
Date libraries in modern programming languages like C , C++ , Java , Python , Ruby all calculate dates correctly according to the Gregorian Calendar .
So any interpretation of dates in OOXML files in these languages will be off by one day unless the author of the software adds their own workaround to their code to account for Excel ’s bug .
Certainly some will make the “ correction ” properly , at their own expense .
But many will not , perhaps because they did not see it deep within the 6,000 page specification .
There is something I call the “ Chernobyl Design Pattern ” , where you take your worst bug , the ugliest part of your code , the part that is so bad , so radioactive that no one can touch it without getting killed , and you make it private and inaccessible , and then put a new interface around it , essentially entomb it in concrete so that no one can get close to it .
In other words , if you ca n’t fix it , at least contain the damage , prevent it from spreading .
Microsoft has taken another approach here .
Instead of containment , they are propagating the bug even further .
We need to think beyond Excel and think as well of other applications that work with OOXML data , and other applications that work with those apps and so on , the entire network of data dependencies .
The mere existence of this bug in a standard will lead to buggy implementations , poor interoperability , and general chaos around dates .
The fallout of this bug should have been contained within the source code of Excel .
For this to leak out , into a specification , then a standard and then into other implementations , contradicting both the civil calendar and every other tool that deals with dates , will pollute the entire ecosystem .
This is bad news .
Just say no .
Good feedback is rare .
It can take a long time to find people who know how to provide useful criticism , instead of simply telling you what ’s “ wrong ” with you or whatever you ’ve made .
A good critic spends as much energy describing what something is , as well as what it is n’t .
Good criticism of a work in progress serves one purpose : to give the creator of the work more perspective and help them make their next set of choices .
Bad criticism uses the opportunity provided by someone else ’s work to make the critic feel smart , superior or better about themselves : things that have nothing to do with helping the recipient of the critique ( Or in the case of movie reviews , the reader of the critique ) .
Given the difficulty of creative work , it would seem that giving and receiving useful feedback should be an important part of what designers , writers , programmers and others are taught to do .
This essay attempts to serve that purpose .
Assumptions bad critics make
There are four fundamental assumptions bad critics make :
There is one universal and objective measure of how good and bad anything is .
That the critic is in sole possession of the skill for making these measurements .
Anyone that does n’t possess this skill ( including the creator of the work ) is an idiot and should be ridiculed .
That valid criticism can and should always be resolved .
Let ’s work with these one at a time .
First , the idea of objective measures runs against everything we know about the history of man-made things .
To objectively measure how good and bad anything is would require not only that the universe is objective , but that the people in it are objective .
There is no film , book , software , website , or album that is universally liked by everyone ( including those who have the word critic in their job title ) .
Some people may be more informed or knowledgeable than others , but this does n’t make their opinions objective .
More important perhaps is the idea of measurement .
To measure how good or bad something requires knowledge about the intent of what the thing is trying to do .
If you show me a frying pan that you ’ve made , and I criticize it for not playing MP3 files , there ’s a mismatch of intention in what we ’re trying to measure and evaluate .
Unless the intention of the work is clear to everyone “ I want to make omelets ” , good criticism is impossible .
There are an infinite number of intentions and goals in the universe , and if two people can’t agree on what the creator ’s intentions are , real communication is impossible .
It might be fair to say that the intentions of a work should be transparent in the work itself :
A toaster oven should look vaguely like something that can receive slices of bread .
But in the case where the intentions are n’t clear , critics have a choice : they can trust the creator and invest more energy trying to sort out what the intentions are , or they can assume the worst about those intentions and begin criticizing what they do n’t understand .
Second , believing that one person has sole possession of good perspective is a contradiction in terms .
Good perspective by definition means the recognition of how many alternatively valuable perspectives there are on any matter .
Two smart knowledgeable people might both love the design of a new gadget , or a recently U.S. released action film , but for entirely different and non-overlapping reasons .
Good criticism generally comes with some degree of humility and respect for the possibility of other equally valid points of view .
The better the critic , the more holistic their sense of how their own perspectives and tastes fit into the diverse pool of informed opinion of others .
Third , respect and ridicule do n’t mix well .
To offer good criticism must be an act of respect : an act of communication with the intention of helping the other person do better work , or understand their work better .
If you are shaping sentences and remarks to be snide , snarky , or sarcastic , the intention of being helpful is unlikely to be served ( Unless you know the recipient of the criticisms well enough to be comfortable razzing or joking with them about their work ) .
It ’s entirely possible to offer criticism , commentary and advice without any negative energy attached : it ’s just so rare that we see it done properly that most of us do n’t realize it ’s possible , much less more effective .
Lastly , finding a valid criticism does n’t mean that it can be fixed or is worth fixing .
In many situations responding to one kind of criticism will just make the design or the work vulnerable to another kind of criticism .
A film or essay that is dark and brooding could be made lighter and funnier , but then another critic could say “ it was n’t dark and brooding enough ” .
And in some cases , fixing a particular problem will cause other problems that are worse .
Until the creator explores the alternatives presented by feedback , it ’s impossible to know whether responding to a piece of criticism is possible , much less desirable .
Collectively , this means that criticizing and giving feedback should be a thoughtful activity .
If you ’re flippant , arrogant , dismissive , curt or annoyed while giving feedback , you ’re probably making one of the four assumptions above and not giving very good criticism .
How to give critical feedback
The verb criticize , once a neutral word somewhere between praise and censure , is now mainly used in a negative sense .
To say “ He criticized me for being so friendly ” generally means something different and less positive than “ He made me think about the possible effects of being so friendly ” .
crit•i•cal ( adj . )
1. Inclined to judge severely and find fault .
2. Characterized by careful , exact evaluation and judgment : a critical reading .
Now I ’m not saying that finding fault is n’t useful .
On the contrary , it ’s very important .
It ’s just that of equal importance in understanding the value of a design , algorithm , script , or film is to know what is n’t broken , or god forbid , what ’s actually done brilliantly .
What you want to do when you are offering criticism is to live up to the second definition listed above : Careful evaluation and judgment .
To do this you need to do the following :
Before you speak , know the goals :
What problem is the work trying to solve ?
What are the goals ?
If you do n’t know the intention of the work it ’s very difficult to offer careful evaluation and judgment .
Remember the frying pan ?
If I do n’t know what the creator is trying to achieve , how can I possibly offer any commentary that ’s of value ?
Now it should be the creator ’s job to inform me of what they ’re trying to do , or tell me that they think it should be self - evident in the work , but if they do n’t there ’s not much harm in me asking “ What are you trying to accomplish here ? ” , and it will save everyone much time and grief .
If the problem is at the level of intention , discussion will ensue at that level instead of trying ( and failing ) to sort out intentions at the level of specific design choices .

Good and bad , is not the same as what you like or do n’t like .
You must shatter the idea that anything you like is good , and anything you do n’t is bad .
If you ca n’t separate your personal preferences from more abstract analysis of a kind of work , then you will rarely provide much useful feedback : criticism is not about you .
It ’s about the work you are viewing and the person that made it .
Your personal preferences only get in the way of providing the work ( and its maker or possible consumers ) with useful information .
Learn to see the good and respectable attributes in work you do not like : they are there if you let yourself see them .
For example : a good film review should evaluate the film ’s merits somewhat independently from the reviewer ’s personal tastes .
It should be possible to read a review about a film the reviewer did n’t like , but be inclined to see it anyway based on the observations he made about it ’s content , style , and form .

Talk as much about what it is , as what it is n’t .
While it can be more efficient to focus on problems and what ’s broken , rather than what ’s good and working , if the creator ca n’t see both , there ’s not much hope of their next choices being good ones .
Make sure you spend as much energy helping them to see and keep the strong parts of what they ’ve done as you help them see the weaker and more questionable parts .

Try the PNP sandwich ( positive negative positive ) : I do n’t like this idea much , but I think it can be a good one ( see what I did there ? ) for dealing with people sensitive or new to receiving criticism .
The idea is simple : find a way to alternate your feedback .
Find something positive , then find something negative , then find another positive thing .
It ’s an easy way to develop trust and help people become comfortable with hearing other people ’s opinion .
I do n’t like it because it has a touchy - feely vibe and it can lead to pretension and insincerity .
However I have seen it work as a way to get strangers to warm up to each other , and eventually grow out of this little pattern of behavior .
Receiving critical feedback
It ’s much harder to receive criticism than to give it .
By the time most people make it through college there have been so many bad experiences with receiving feedback , especially on creative work , that they tend to avoid it or ignore it .
Nothing can be worse : feedback is essential to developing ideas , and if the project involves a team in any way , the dialog and communication that falls out of feedback is essential .
Anyone that makes anything must find ways to not only obtain feedback , but to master the skills of milking it for all it ’s worth .
Shut up .
Just shut up and listen .
Creators often fall into the trap of speaking for their work , trying to use words to defend things that should be in the design .
This is a form of denial :
The work has to speak for itself .
Even if only for a few minutes , let the prototype or draft be its own thing , and stand on its own .
If you respond right away to ( or perhaps interrupt ) every point made in a critique , you ca n’t possibly be thinking about what ’s being said to you .
Thinking takes time .
Try to talk as little as possible , and let the time be used for critique , not for defense .
If you do n’t trust the people critiquing you to be fair , that ’s a problem best solved by defining sound ground rules ( See below ) , or by investing more in finding better critique partners .

Ask clarifying questions .
Again , avoid filling the conversation with defensive chatter .
Instead , respond to questions by trying to sort out any ambiguities or points you do n’t agree with by getting whoever is critiquing to restate their point .
“ When you say the style in my design is sloppy , do you mean that the lines are n’t sharp , or that the composition is n’t balanced quite right ?
Can you show me exactly what you mean ? ”
By asking clarifying questions you allow yourself time to decide if you agree with the criticism or not by working with the other person to understand their point / question better .
It makes the critique into a dialog , which is what it should be , and not a courtroom trial .

Refer back to the goals .
If you ’re not getting what you want from the critique , provide some goals for the work that you ’re trying to achieve .
If you ’re working on a project this should be easy : the goals for a given design should derive from the project goals .
Ask whoever is giving you feedback to do so in terms of those goals or your derivations of them .
Then whenever the conversation goes astray , you can refer back to the goals and set things in a useful direction again .

The goal of criticism is not to learn every nuance about a design ’s weaknesses : its to know enough about a design so that the designer can make it better .
If you agree with a criticism , but do n’t see a path to improvement , ask for one .
Turn the question back around on the person who made the comment .
“ Good point .
So do you see anything I can do to improve on that ? ”
Often they wo n’t have anything to say : critiquing is not the same as creating .
But by asking the question you do move the conversation forward into thinking about future action , instead of staying stuck in criticism mode .
Ground Rules
Take control of your feedback process .
Feedback is not something that happens to you : it should be something you make happen .
If you wait for feedback to come to you , it tends to be less positive and supportive than if you seek it out .
If you walk into someone ’s office and say “ hey , can I have 5 minutes of your time to look at something ? ” you are taking control .
You put yourself in the driver ’s seat of the process , and can frame and shape the criticism you get however you want .
But if you wait and wait and wait until deadlines approach , you have less and less control over how feedback will be given to you .
It will have more edge to it and will tend to serve others more than serve you .

Pick your partners .
Who do you get the best feedback from ?
It ’s probably not the person who loves everything you do .
If you do n’t think you get good feedback from anyone , part of the problem might be you have n’t taken control of the process .
Be more specific about what kinds of criticism you need , and go to people and ask for it .
If you find a good source , cherish it , and reward them for it .
Much of what a good mentor does is provide good , consistent , honest feedback .
If you can get this from a peer or a manager find ways to cultivate and reward it .
Look for people outside of your company or organization that might be willing to form a peer review group : meet once a week / month over coffee and show each other your work .

Strive to hear it all , informally and early .
The sooner you hear a question or criticism of something you ’ve created , the greater your ability to do something about it before it ’s finished .
If there is any kind of formal review or feedback process ( e.g. a spec review or group critique ) make it your job to find out what opinions there are of what you ’re doing well before it happens .
This can be as simple as going to door to door and showing sketches , and asking for a few quick comments .
Give yourself the opportunity to benefit early from other perspectives and think things through .
But do know how much feedback you can handle : you do n’t want your work driven by other people ’s opinions , but you do want to give yourself the opportunity to benefit from them .

Bush digs in on the war and other issues
President Bush is set to veto the $ 124 billion wartime funding bill this week in a bitter dispute with Congress over the direction of the war in Iraq – a veto that appears part of an emerging White House strategy to hold a tough line against Democrats on a number of issues , not just the war .
In recent weeks , the embattled president has also refused to fire or force the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales over his role in the sacking of eight U.S. attorneys last year .
Bush has also ruled out allowing House and Senate Democrats to publicly question White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove and other top aides about their involvement in the firings .
And the Justice Department has declined to turn over some documents sought by congressional investigators ,

White House lawyers have also played tough in response to a congressional investigation of Republican National Committee e-mail accounts used by dozens of White House aides , telling two House committees that it wants the RNC to turn over any documents from those accounts first to the White House counsel ’s office , suggesting that an executive - privilege claim may be invoked .
Additionally , Bush infuriated Senate Democrats by using a recess appointment early this month to install Republican fundraiser Sam Fox as the ambassador to Belgium .
Fox helped fund the “ Swift Boats ” ads against Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass . ) during the 2004 presidential campaign .
Bush had actually withdrawn
Fox ’s nomination before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted on it , further fueling Democratic ire once the recess appointment was made public .

On his signature education issue , Bush is a refusing as well to consider major changes to the 2002 " No Child Left Behind " law as Congress debates it reauthorization .
While there is bipartisan congressional support for some changes , Bush has warned that he will not accept any proposal , that in his view , weakens the law .
The White House notes , however , the administration has reached out to Democratic congressional leaders on two other major issues – energy and immigration – and are hopeful that agreements can eventually be forged .
On Iraq , though , the White House has signaled that there is very little room to negotiate with Democratic leaders on additional funding for the war .
Bush has refused to even consider setting a withdrawal deadline , or non-binding “ goal , ” for pulling U.S. troops out of Iraq .
Rather , Bush wants a " clean " bill that places no restrictions on his ability to conduct the war .
The administration is now rejecting any formal connection between “ benchmarks ” for measuring the political , economic and security progress made by the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Malaki and continued U.S. involvement in Iraq .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Sunday that any linkage between benchmarks and continued U.S. funding for the war or a withdrawal timetable , was unacceptable , potentially cutting off one area where agreement could be reached with Democratic opponents of the war .
'' That 's the problem with having so - called consequences , '' Rice said on ABC ’s “ This Week . ”
'' To begin now to tie our own hands -- and to say ' We must do this if they do n't do that , ' ” she said , “ does n't allow us the flexibility and creativity that we need to move this forward . ”
Rice also indicated she was not going to respond to a subpoena from House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , who is investigating 2003 claims that Saddam Hussein had sought uranium from Niger .
Rice said she has answered Waxman ’s requests for information on the matter in previous letters to him and had addressed it when she was confirmed two years ago .
“ This is a White House issue , and I was national security adviser , ” Rice said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation , ” referring to her job in the first Bush term .
“ That means I was at the time an adviser to the president , and there 's a constitutional issue here that the White House will have to handle . ”
In his remarks on the war lately , Vice President Dick Cheney has been even harsher , calling Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) “ uninformed ” and his declaration that the war is lost “ unfortunate and misleading . ”
While the tough rhetoric and repeated veto threats are not in itself a sign that compromise with Democrats is unachievable , Bush ’s combative posture in recent weeks has not gone unnoticed on Capitol Hill by either party .
“ This is a clearly a sign that Bush is reacting to conservatives who think the White House has had a ‘ kick me ’ sign on its back ” since the Democrats ’ victory in the November elections , said a Senate GOP leadership aide .
The aide pointed to an April 9 article by conservative columnist William Kristol in The Weekly Standard , which first used the “ kick me ” reference , as a rallying point for conservatives , who in turn urged the White House to be more combative in its relationship with congressional Democrats .
“ Democrats have been in an ‘ investigate - and - attack mode , ’ and the White House is reacting to that , ” the aide suggested .
Democrats , however , believe that Bush ’s actions demonstrate the White House is in a full defensive mode and incapable of addressing the problems facing the country , including the war .
Democrats have openly begun to use a “ bunker ” analogy to describe Bush ’s view of the world , including Capitol Hill .
Reid himself compared Bush to former President Richard Nixon , saying that Bush is acting like Nixon did during the height of the Watergate crisis .
“ This just shows how isolated the president and his White House are on every major issue , ” said Reid ’s spokesman , Jim Manley .
“ They are increasingly out of touch with the American people on every important issue . ”
White House officials , however , believe that Bush has sought compromise with Democrats , citing several areas where they say he has reached out , only to find Democrats unwilling to negotiate or reach agreement with him .
“ First of all , the Democrats do n't have the votes to override the president 's veto ( of the wartime funding bill ) , so why should the burden be on him initially to compromise ? ” said Deputy White House Press Secretary Dana Perino .
“ Plus , it was the president who reached out to the leadership to invite them down [ to the White House ] 10 days ago and again for this coming Wednesday .
So , there will be progress , the money will get to the troops , and that will be because the elected leaders of this country are going to make it so . ”
Perino was referring to Wednesday 's White House meeting between Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , and senior GOP lawmakers , which will be the second time in two weeks the Democratic leaders have met with Bush at the White House , though this time , it will come after Bush has vetoed the Iraq spending bill .
Reid and Pelosi have declined to discuss their strategy for completing a second bill after the president ’s expected veto , preferring instead to highlight Bush 's veto and use that action to spur further debate over the president 's policies in Iraq and what it means for this country .
Perino also said Bush has tried to accommodate the Democrats as they investigate the U.S. attorney firings , only to be rebuffed .
“ As for the attorney general , I do n't see where there needs to be a compromise on our end , ” she said .
“ Remember , it was the president who directed the Justice Department to be fully responsive to the Congress .
With hours of collective testimony and thousands of pages of documents turned over , it has been .
As for requests to talk to White House staff , remember that [ Bush ] did n't have to offer any interviews [ with Gonzales and other Justice Department officials ] or documents at all , but we did .
They have chosen not to take us up on the offer . ”
Among other things , this week I ’ve been working on the new office design with our architect , Roy Leone [ flash site ] .
One of the problems with our cool office here on 8th Avenue is that we outgrew it too quickly .
The construction of the second half of the office cost us $ 100 per square foot of which the landlord only paid $ 30 .
All of that money went into walls , desks , bookshelves , and a fishtank which we ’ll use for about two years and then abandon .
There ’s a good chance that the next tenant will have their own ideas about workspace and demolish everything we did .
All in all , it ’s a big waste of money and environmentally unsound .
Worse , when you spend money on construction like this , it ’s not really deductable .
Here ’s an example .
Let ’s say your revenue is $ 100 .
Your expenses were $ 80 , leaving you with a profit of $ 20 .
Now , let ’s say you spend that $ 20 on office construction ( what the IRS calls “ leasehold improvements . ” )
It ’s not deductible yet .
You have $ 0 in the bank , but the IRS thinks you made a $ 20 profit .
Now you have to pay the corporate income tax ( 35 % federal plus 11 % or so for New York ) on the $ 20 even though you do n’t have the $ 20 .
[ Technicality : when you move out , you can deduct it all , and you can depreciate it at a rate of approximately 1/39th the amount per year , so you could really deduct fifty cents of the $ 20 . ]
We ’re going to need a much bigger space now : on the order of 15,000 square feet .
To build that much office space could cost a couple of million dollars .
With the lack of deductability , your bank account goes down by three million dollars .
The landlord will pay a fraction of that , but not enough to make it affordable .
There ’s a loophole .
Office furniture can be depreciated much faster than leasehold improvements , over 7 years .
So for $ 20 of office furniture you can deduct about $ 3 a year : better than nothing .
Even better , office furniture is a real asset , so you can lease it .
Now you ’re not out any cash , just a convenient monthly payment , which is 100 % deductable .
This is why companies build cubicle farms instead of walls , even though the dollar cost is comparable .
I think I ’ve got a good workaround .
We ’re looking into manufactured walls .
They ’re reusable , recyclable , environmentally friendly , you can take them with you when you move , and you can finance the purchase .
A reader who works for Haworth emailed me to suggest their Enclose walls system ( illustration at right ) .
I visited their New York showroom and they look great , so we ’re working on figuring out a totally standard set of parts we can order from Haworth for each private office to create the same extremely nice diagonal offices that we ’ve built in the past out of drywall , metal studs , and acrylic .

Internet censorship is spreading rapidly , being practised by about two dozen countries and applied to a far wider range of online information and applications , according to research by a transatlantic group of academics .
The warning comes a week after a Turkish court ordered the blocking of YouTube to silence offensive comments about Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , the founder of modern Turkey , marking the most visible attack yet on a website that has been widely adopted around the world .
A recent six - month investigation into whether 40 countries use censorship shows the practice is spreading , with new countries learning from experienced practitioners such as China and benefiting from technological improvements .
OpenNet Initiative , a project by Harvard Law School and the universities of Toronto , Cambridge and Oxford , repeatedly tried to call up specific websites from 1,000 international news and other sites in the countries concerned , and a selection of local - language sites .
The research found a trend towards censorship or , as John Palfrey , executive director of Harvard Law School ’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society , said , “ a big trend in the reverse direction ” , with many countries recently starting to adopt forms of online censorship .
Ronald Deibert , associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto , said 10 countries had become “ pervasive blockers ” , regularly preventing their citizens seeing a range of online material .
These included China , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Tunisia , Burma and Uzbekistan .
New censorship techniques include the periodic barring of complete applications , such as China ’s block on Wikipedia or Pakistan ’s ban on Google ’s blogging service , and the use of more advanced technologies such as “ keyword filtering ” , which is used to track down material by identifying sensitive words .
Methods such as these are being copied as countries new to censorship learn from those with more experience .
“ There ’s a growing awareness of best practice – or rather , worst practice , ” Mr Deibert said .
Ken Berman , head of technology for the US state department arm that broadcasts Voice of America , said some countries were learning from China , which has the most experience in internet censorship , with Zimbabwe appearing to use the same technology .
While internet censors are learning to apply new technologies to expand their efforts , activists wanting to circumvent the controls are using the latest internet methods to advantage .
World 's most expensive cities
Moscow surpasses Tokyo as priciest metropolis .
Asuncion , on the other hand , is still a big bargain .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The vodka may be cheap , but according to the latest cost - of - living survey from Mercer Consulting , Moscow now ranks as the world 's most expensive city , edging out Tokyo , which held the No. 1 spot for four straight years .
Moscow ranked No. 4 last year , but rose through the ranks for a few reasons , according to Mercer senior consultant Rebecca Powers .
The currencies of Tokyo , Osaka and London -- the top 3 cities last year -- fell relative to the dollar , while the Russian ruble remained fairly stable .
Plus , Powers added , the price of housing for expatriates in Moscow has risen considerably in the past 12 months .
Top 10 most expensive cities 1 . Moscow 2 . Seoul 3 . Tokyo 4 . Hong Kong 5 . London 6 . Osaka 7 . Geneva 8 . Copenhagen 9 . Zurich 10 .
Oslo , New York ( tied ) Source : �Mercer Consulting
The weakened yen places Tokyo in the No. 3 spot , just behind Seoul , while Osaka fell to No. 6 .
London , meanwhile , still makes a pricey showing at No. 5 , making it the second most expensive city in Europe behind Moscow .
It 's followed by Geneva , which ranks No. 7 worldwide .
" For many companies it can now be more expensive to send employees to work in Russia or Korea than places like Japan or Switzerland , which are often perceived to be more costly , " Powers said in a statement .
The survey uses New York City , ranked No. 10 , as its cost base -- scoring it at 100 .
Then it compares the prices of more than 200 items , including housing , household goods , food , entertainment and transportation in 144 cities around the globe .
Mercer found that Moscow costs 24 percent more than Gotham , while Asuncion , the perennial last - place finisher , costs about 56 percent less than life in the five boroughs .
In the United States , the most expensive cities are New York , Los Angeles ( No.29 worldwide ) , San Francisco ( No. 34 ) and Chicago ( No. 38 ) .
In Latin America , Sao Paulo ( also ranked No. 34 ) and Rio de Janeiro have the highest cost of living , while in in Asia , the most expensive cities are Seoul , Tokyo and Hong Kong ( No. 4 ) .
Eastern European cities like Budapest ( No. 65 ) and Prague ( No. 50 ) that do n't use the euro dropped in the rankings from last year as local currencies fell against the dollar .
Sydney at No. 19 remains the costliest city in Australasia , far ahead of Melbourne ( No. 74 ) and Brisbane ( No. 99 ) .
The cheapest cities in the world are Paraguay 's Asuncion , Zimbabwe 's Harare , Buenos Aires , Manila , Pakistan 's Karachi , India 's Bangalore and Uruguay 's Montevideo .
To give a sense of just what life costs in various cities , Mercer priced out the cost of a two - bedroom unfurnished apartment , a cup of coffee served , a fast food meal and an international paper .
In Moscow , the apartment will run you $ 3,000 , the coffee $ 5.27 , the paper $ 3.40 , and the burger with fries $ 3.87 .
By contrast , Buenos Aires provides a better deal price - wise , to say nothing of warmer temperatures .
You can nab the apartment for $ 999 , the coffee for $ 1.47 , the paper for $ 4.55 and the happy meal for $ 2.77 .

I 've recently been involved in an exchange with Mike Huben in the comments section of an earlier post to this blog , having to do with global warming , hurricanes , and Chris Landsea 's pulling out of the IPCC — the group that does the " official " reports on world climate — a few years ago .
Interested people may want to look at our exchange and at the web pages cited .
There is a more general issue that such disputes raise :
How , in controversies where most of us do not know enough to form independent opinions , one should decide who to believe .
One way is to look at the incentives various people have to express the views they do .
Let me start with the case of nanotech — specifically , whether it presents dangers that call for government regulation .
I 've been involved , at least peripherally , for a long time and know some of the people at the Foresight Institute , the group that pushed the idea of nanotech for many years before it became suddenly fashionable .
One thing I know about them is that that their general political biases are libertarian .
Hence when I observe them expressing serious concerns about the dangers of unregulated nanotech , I am inclined to take it seriously .
They may be wrong , but they are n't believing it because they want to believe it .
Mike Huben , if I understand him correctly , wants to view criticism of evidence for global warming as the work of sinister interest groups , in particular energy companies .
I suspect that to some degree he is right ; clearly that are industries that will be injured if countries adopt the sorts of policies recommended by those concerned with the threat of global warming , and I expect such industries do their best to push arguments that it is in their interest to push .
On the other hand , a scientist such as Landsea , who apparently wrote a good deal of the relevant part of the previous IPCC report , has no such incentive — unless Mike can point to evidence that he is being secretly funded by the oil companies , which nobody seems to be claiming .
It 's hard to see any likely reason for his actions other than the belief that the scientific work of himself and others was being misrepresented in order to push a political agenda .
And the followup articles — the ones Mike found and pointed out to the rest of us — suggest that in fact Landsea 's view of the subject was correct and that his protest was one factor in pushing the IPCC , in its most recent report , to give a mostly accurate account of the current consensus .
Their summary account reported that there was no clear evidence of a trend to more hurricanes .
One of the authors of the relevant part of the report , decrying misrepresentations in the media , wrote that :
" We concluded that the question of whether there was a greenhouse - cyclone link was pretty much a toss of a coin at the present state of the science , with just a slight leaning towards the likelihood of such a link .
" My current conclusion , looking over what I can see of the opinions of people who do n't have an obvious axe to grind in either direction , is that global warming is probably real , is probably but not certainly anthropogenic , is probably not going to have large effects on size and frequency of hurricanes and is probably not going to have large effects on sea level .
It is a real problem but not , on current evidence , an impending catastrophe .
Mike , and many other people , see it as a much bigger problem than I do .
My reason for distrusting their conclusions is the same as Mike 's reason for distrusting the conclusions of global warming sceptics :
On the whole and with , I am sure , some exceptions , they appear to me to be believing what they want to believe .
I see it that way because : 1. Governments , and people in government , seek power for obvious reasons .
Over the past fifty years the intellectual justification for the large expansion in government power from about 1930 - 1970 has largely collapsed .
The belief that capitalism is inherently unstable and inefficient and must be fixed with large elements of governmental intervention and central planning is no longer taken very seriously by either the general public or economists .
Environmentalism in general and global warming in particular provide new arguments for expanded government power , new taxes , and the like .
That does not mean , of course , that those arguments are wrong , but it does mean that there are a lot of people who have an incentive to support them whether wrong or right .
That seems to me consistent with what I observe — what is probably a real problem being extensively exaggerated for political reasons , with a predicted sea level rise of up to 80 cm over 93 years being reported in terms of massive flooding around the world , converting the World Trade Center Site into an aquarium in the piece I commented on in my earlier post .
2 . Global warming provides arguments for things that a lot of people , mostly left of center , want to do anyway — shift lifestyles away from automobiles towards mass transit , reduce consumption of depletable resources , and the like .
Environmentalism is in part a real argument , in part a religion , in part an aesthetic ; the second and third parts make people too willing to accept the first .
Which gets me to Mike 's various queries about why I choose to align myself with the forces of evil and ignorance by expressing skepticism about the horrors likely to arise from global warming .
Simply put , I am skeptical of conclusions that appear to go well beyond the scientific evidence , pushed by people who have reasons to want other people to believe them .
Living can get pretty tiresome .
