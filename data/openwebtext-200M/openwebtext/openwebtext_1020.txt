After all , it means you still have a job .
Many people have been looking for work for month and even years , so knowing you still have a desk to sit at for your company is just about worth the price you might pay .
My brother spent almost 5 months unemployed for the second time in 2 years , and I am sure he would have preferred a little more work for the same pay in this economy .
However , CNN / Money is phrasing it as “ Layoff survivors are now stuck with more responsibilities and additional stress – for the same old salary “ , turning what might be seen as a positive into a negative .

They are writing about the extra workload , the negative attitude it may cause on the job , and the stagnant pay … while completely ignoring the fact that in the worst economy in 70 years , these people still have a job at all .
If it really is that bad , I suggest they quit and try to find another gig ; it ’s not that easy out there to find good jobs , but more power to you if you think you can make the jump .
While the article briefly mentions one positive of this trend , that you can learn new skills because you are taking on more work while at work , there really are a few while we all struggle through these times :
1 . You still have a job at all .
2 . You get to keep your health care if your company offers it .
3 . You can learn more skills , as they mentioned .
4 . Your resume stays current and will not have long lapses of unemployment .
5 . Your entire life does n’t get disrupted by a lack of income .
Yes , companies need to do their best to take care of their employees in both good and bad times , as otherwise you will have miserable ( or no ) employees to do the work necessary .
But I do think that in these times , taking on a little extra work for the same pay you made before is a much better alternative to losing your job altogether – and I think this article misses that point entirely .
What do you guys think ?
What are your thoughts on this ?
Agree ?
Disagree ?
Let ’s discuss !
" I hope she remains -- let me be real clear -- a part of the Republican Party , " Huckabee told FOX News .
" I 'm a little concerned when I hear her say that she may sort of branch out and go third party or go independent .
That would be a big mistake because we need to rebuild the Republican Party , not abandon it . "
“ Does it sound campy to say I love gay men ? ” asks Meghan McCain , sipping an iced tea at the nouveau - chic Hotel Palomar in Washington , D.C. ’s Dupont Circle .
Campy or not , the lovesick McCain has been ubiquitous this year , sallying forth on late - night TV -- Larry King Live , The Colbert Report , The Rachel Maddow Show -- to scold the Republican establishment for its social conservatism and stump for gay marriage .
“ If two people fall in love , they should have the option to get married just like I can , ” she told Stephen Colbert , pointing out the inherent hypocrisy of a party that believes in keeping government out of people ’s private lives -- except when those people are gay men and women .
... Like her father , Meghan McCain is n’t shy -- a fact she ’s quick to point out .
“ I think I ’m a lot like my dad , ” she says .
“ We ’re the same person . ”
Most noticeably , both McCains have a preternatural ability to piss off their fellow Republicans , an asset they wear on their sleeves .
Within weeks of starting a regular column for The Daily Beast , McCain flexed her newfound muscle by attacking the GOP ’s queen of mean , Ann Coulter -- “ watching her is sometimes like watching a train wreck , ” she wrote -- and dissing fellow GOP Twitterer Karl Rove , whom she branded a “ Twitter Creep . ”
Easy targets perhaps , but it was a smart way to position herself on the opposite side of the aisle .
“ I ’d be flattered to be considered the anti–Ann Coulter , the anti–Rush Limbaugh , ” she says .
... “ Homophobia is the last socially accepted prejudice , ” McCain says , repeating it for emphasis .
So it ’s only natural that she also views the fight for gay equality as “ my generation ’s civil rights movement . ”
At a time when California can constitutionally ban gay marriage and the current presidential administration -- having vowed so much -- has yet to fulfill its promises , it ’s hard not to be won over by this bubbly optimist .
“ In general , I do n’t get a good response from the conservative movement , ” she admits , unfazed .
“ But there are a lot of people who have said , ‘ I ’m Republican and I ’m pro–gay marriage .
Thank you for showing that you do n’t have to be anti–gay marriage to be a Republican . ’ ”
Well , the McCain I 'm referring to is Meghan and the GOP left her ; she just does n't know it .
Palin is n't Todd -- who was never really a Republican anyway , just an anti-American secessionist slob and a member of the Alaska Independence Party -- but Sarah , who claims she 's willing to campaign for anyone , regardless of political party , reactionary enough to support the failed policy agenda that makes up her narrow world view .
Let 's look at her first since Huckabee , her main rival for the yahoo vote that make up so much of the base of the GOP left behinds , was mouthing off about her yesterday .
Huck was on GOP - TV pushing the self - serving meme that Palin is going to become an independent , clearly intending to smear her with his fake southern fried concern .
Just as a new poll starts circulating that shows only a third , or a little less than a third of Republicans think Palin is qualified to be president -- far more than Democrats or independents --
Huckabee is trying to drive silver spike into the heart of her presidential aspirations , a move that would benefit Willard Romney , whose VP nominee Huckabee is hoping to be .
As for McCain 's sometimes befuddled - sounding daughter Meghan ... she 's become something of ato the self righteous dullards of the right - wing blogosphere who pounce on her every statement as proof that John McCain should never have been nominated to run for president .
Today they 're mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore because she called Joe the Plumber a dumbass and said she loves gay men .
Her rabidly fascist cousin Stacy takes the opportunity to go on a vicious homophobic diatribe -- click the link above -- insulting her every which way imaginable and proving for anyone who cares to give his hateful blatherings a second look that he fears and detests women , particularly women who disagree with his extremist and primitivist way of responding to the world .
So what brought on this week 's hysterical outpouring of loathing from the far right for poor Meghan ?
James Kirchick 's rambling interview with McCain in the new issue of To drooling misogynist Stacy McCain and his fellow hate - filled neanderthals this makes her a desperate and pathetic " fag hag " and a " fish . "

BEFORE YOU COMMENT ABOUT IT , this was made before the Dispenser was upgradeable and before the Mini Sentry existed , so those are not included .
I do n't have any plans on reworking this to add them in .---------------Holy... cow .
When I saw 700 + messages , I knew something was up .
A Daily Deviation ?
Never would have imagined .
I was freaking out .
Thank you and thank you to everybody who favorited and commented , and of course , ` armaina for featuring it .
I was on my way to bed and I had to stay up and read all the comments .---------------This is what started the whole Team Fortress 2 strategy RPG thing that ended up getting abandoned .
This started only for fun ; I felt like pixeling and I decided on an isometric TF2 Sentry Gun , and then it snowballed into the whole set of Engineer buildings , and then I talked to ~ Shaddox - Lynx - XVII about making a game , and it grew into this whole concept of a TF2 turn - based strategy game , so I managed to squeeze out base sprites for six other classes before burning out .

The 10 Most Influential Canadian Musicians
Today is Canada Day , the national holiday of North America ’s other , more icy power state , and to mark the event I thought it would be fun to write a feature piece .
Now , I ’m not Canadian , nor I have any connection what so ever with the maple state , however some of my most beloved artists hail from there , so I guess this has to count for something , right ?
Bellow you can browse through a list of the ten most influential Canadian musicians that through out their careers ’ span have shaped and directed countless artists and musical genres that followed in their footsteps .
10 . D.O.A .
The Vancouver punk band D.O.A. ( Dead on Arrival ) is not only one of the most influential Canadian bands , but also one of the most memorable punk acts in the world .
Convinced anarchists and activists D.O.A. were responsible for coining the term and genre hardcore , which has now seen countless mutations across the hundreds of bands who have adopted the style .
Their most important work is at the same time one of their earliest , in the form of D.O.A. ’s 1981 LP “ Hardcore ’ 81 . ”
The album is simply one hell of a ride , just like any other punk rock aficionado will tell you .
Currently , the band is still active , having released last year a new , though not so well received , album titled “ Northern Avengers ” and touring through out the world .
9. Alanis Morissette
The winner of countless Grammy and Juno Awards , the Canadian beauty with a voice of gold Alanis Morissette has had her music reach the ears of millions of people around the world .
A sparkling talent since her teens , Alanis is a true ambassador of Canadian music and a pillar for the contemporary alt - rock / pop scene .
Her most notable album is the 1995 “ Jagged Little Pill ” which moved well over 30 million copies and contains classic hits such as “ Perfect ” or “ Ironic . ”
Her latest album released was the 2008 “ Flavors of Entanglement , ” which ranked # 37 in our top 50 albums of ’08 list .
8. Celine Dion
One of the most successful pop artists in history with more than 200 million records sold , Celine Dion has one of the most widely recognized female voices in the world .
Hate her or love her , she ’s one of Canada ’s most prized gems and no one in their right minds can possible deny her incredible talent .
Before reaching her career ’s peak with the 1997 “ Let ’s Talk About Love , ” which included the soundtrack for the blockbuster Titanic , “ My Heart Will Go On , ” she also gained worldwide commercial and critical recognition thanks to her 1993 “ The Colour of My Love ” and the 1996 “ Falling Into You . ”
7. The Tragically Hip
Hailing from Kingston , Ontorio , The Tragically Hip or just The Hip is one of the most loved bands in Canada , having earned numerous awards and # 1 positions in the Canadian Music Charts .
Referred to many as the Canadian R.E.M. , because of the similarities in style and frontmen vocal range , The Hip is not so well known outside of Canada like some of its fellow country men musicians , however the band ’s uncanny passion and incredible live performances have managed to win countless hearts .
6 . The Band
When looking back at The Band ‘s rich and packed with value discography , it ’s really hard for the word influential not to come in mind .
Initially having been Bob Dylan ’s back up band , while they were still playing under the name of The Hawks , The Band shattered a lot of perceptions people had over music , especially country music .
Their debut , and at the same time most important , album “ Music from Big Pink ” caused nothing less then a revolution .
5. Joni Mitchell
Joni Mitchell was one of the key players in the late ’ 60s - ’70s folk movement scene , establishing herself as a talented singer / songwriters .
Her 1971 confessional album “ Blue ” broke every chart that year and there is n’t virtually any list compiled by any respectable music magazine that does n’t mention it .
Joni Mitchell – a well of inspiration !
4. The Guess Who
Hailing from Winnipeg , Manitoba , The Guess
Who were the first ever Canadian rock band to have a # 1 single in the American Billboard Chart with their explosive , timeless “ American Woman . ”
Back in the ’70s they were basically synonymous with the term “ Canadian Rock ” and even got to play at the Nixon White House .
Their masterful combination of hard - rock with roots jazz made them one of history most sought at acts and earned the band millions of fans and records sold .
3. Rush
Alongside Genesis , Yes , Jethro Tull , Yes or Van Der Graaf Generator , the Torontonians of Rush were part of the progressive rock apex from the ’ 70s , to mid ’ 80s .
Like many progressive bands from their time , Rush tackled many genres , from heavy metal to hard rock to synth pop , and they rocked the house regardless of what they played .
2. Leonard Cohen
Poet , singer / songwriter , novelist , a true artist in all the word ’s right , Leonard Cohen undoubtedly belongs to the “ highest and most influential echelon of songwriters , ” as described by Lou Reed .
Although the Montreal wordsmith ’s lyrics were somewhat darker , Cohen ’s wit and charm made every song of his shine like a star .
He ’s also one of the most covered artists , with thousands of renditions of Cohen ’s songs having been performed by countless artists such as Nick Cave , Johnny Cash , Willie Nelson , Judy Collins and many more .
Also , as a sign of his impressive influence , he ’s songs have been covered in over 32 tribute records recorded in other languages .
For the last 15 years , Leonard Cohen has been pretty elusive , only releasing some new material from to time , but with no live appearances whatsoever – until last year that is , when he embarked on a massive tour which continues to present day .
1. Neil Young
Although he approached a diverse array of genres through out his career , Neil Young will always be remembered for his folk - esque acoustic guitar that made him a living legend .
He ’s a distinct lyricist and singer , but maybe above all he’s an incredible showman and performer , delivering some of the best live concerts in history .
Just by making quick rundown over his discography one can easily see how immensely talented he is , with 33 studio albums released and countless number one singles under his belt .
Again , A LIVING LEGEND !
BONUS – honorable mentions
Apparently ABC television did n't get the memo that they 're supposed to censor supporters of a second stimulus , as Paul Krugman alleged yesterday .
Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK ) CEO Warren Buffett was on Good Morning America ( still about as mainstream as you can get ) , and he threw his name on the list of those supporting , yes , a second stimulus .
Buffett has repeatedly said that there seeing no evidence of greenshoots or an uptick in business .
The best part is what he said about the first stimulus : " Our first stimulus bill ... was sort of like taking half a tablet of Viagra and having also a bunch of candy mixed in . "
Good Morning America , indeed !

Computer makers that do n't install Green Dam face possible penalties A California company is considering legal action to prevent computers being shipped to China with what it says is stolen internet blocking software .
Solid Oak said it found pieces of its CyberSitter programme in China 's Green Dam Youth Escort screening software .
China has mandated that all new PCs contain filters to protect children from offensive material on the net .
The Chinese firm that made Green Dam , Jinhui Computer System Engineering Inc , denies any wrongdoing .
But Solid Oak's Brian Milburn said " We 're contacting Dell , HP and others to stop compromised material being shipped . "
" If China had gotten hold of free pirated copies of Microsoft 's Windows and told Dell and HP to put this on all computers you ship , you would hear a loud outcry .
China has a very loose interpretation of what is intellectual property , " said Mr Milburn .
He told the BBC that as far as he was aware , the compromised software containing code from CyberSitter has already been installed on 9 million computers in China .
The Chinese government has required that all new computers made or shipped by 1 July have Green Dam pre-installed .
The government 's controls over what its citizens can see online is often referred to as the " Great Firewall of China . "
Review Mr Millburn , whose company is based in Santa Barbara , said US computer manufacturers were being put in the middle of a row not of their making .
The system reportedly blocks legitimate as well as banned content " It 's not their fault and I do n't want to sound like that .
They are stuck in the middle .
I want to do the right thing and maybe it will give them an opportunity to get out of distributing machines with this software . "
Critics say the software will be used to prevent China 's 250 million internet users from searching for politically sensitive information .
Green Dam filters words and images as well as web addresses .
" While the justification may be pitched as protecting children and mostly concerning pornography , once the architecture is set up it can be used for broader purposes , such as the filtering of political ideas , " Professor Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard 's Berkman Centre told the BBC last week .
A report by the OpenNet Initiative has found that Green Dam can monitor activities outside of web browsing and can terminate applications .
Dell , the world 's second biggest PC seller , said no machines had been shipped containing Green Dam .
" We are aware of the policy from China and along with the rest of the industry are reviewing it , " said spokesman David Frink .
It has been estimated that in the next two years China 's PC market will be the world 's largest with 50 million units shipped annually by 2012 .
" Honest mistake " Solid Oak 's founder Mr Milburn said he was first alerted there was a problem on Friday when he received an email from someone claiming to be from the Chinese Communist Party .
Cybersitter is aimed at helping parents control what their children see online " At first I thought it was a prank and did n't pay much attention to it , " Mr Milburn told the BBC .
" One of our employees researched it and came back to me and said I might want to look at it more closely .
We then found actual proprietary code from CyberSitter within the Green Dam programme that is only available in an encrypted format .
" I spent a good deal of the weekend with another engineer trying to find if it was an honest mistake .
But someone made a 100 % conscious effort to do this .
This is not some accident , " stated Mr Milburn .
A report by the University of Michigan has also accused the Chinese vendor of using material from Solid Oak Software 's product .
Added to that the study found serious vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to hijack PCs running the Chinese software .
China 's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has ordered the problem be fixed .
Legal action
The Chinese company that made the filtering software told China Daily that it has been wrongly accused .
Every new computer in China will have the software installed " That 's impossible .
We did n't steal their programming code , " said Bryan Zhang of Jinhui Computer System Engineering Inc .
Mr Milburn said even though legal action against the Chinese developer is one thing he is looking at , he is not sure it will be worth the effort .
" We are just a little company and trying to take on China is an impossible task .
We do n't want to turn into a litigation company . "
Mr Milburn said Solid Oak will also file a complaint with the FBI 's Computer Crime Task Force .
Online surveys conducted by some of China 's most popular web portals like sina.com and shou.com showed that four out of five netizens will not use the Green Dam software or have it installed .

FYI : Based on apparently better information , I 've added a " recorrection " to my " clarification " of Howie 's post regarding the ruling by the High Court of the state of Delhi decriminalizing homosexuality .
Along with most of the Western media , I seem to have gotten it wrong .
Even though the Delhi court has jurisdiction only over the state of Delhi , it appears that the appeals court 's ruling does have force throughout the country until either ( a ) a court of equal jurisdiction disagrees or ( b ) the Indian Supreme Court overrules it .
The case seems destined for the Supreme Court , but based on this information , for now the Delhi court 's ruling has effect throughout the country .

Editor ’s Note :
In this column animation critic Joe Strike gives us our first review of Monsters vs. Aliens .
A few weeks back Jeffrey K came to town to hype his latest , first - in - 3D animated feature Monsters vs. Aliens .
Did you know ( Jeffrey does ) 3D is the third revolution in motion pictures , right after the introduction of sound , then color ?
Neither did I ; in fact the film seemed more like the old paddleball in your face routine – which is literally how it begins .
OK , I enjoy a meta - gag as much as the next guy , but after JK talked up what they were gonna do with the technology , I expected more than visual quotes .
( And yes , the 3D was very cool - looking all the way through . )
Speaking of which , MvA is a return to DreamWorks ’ ‘ look how many pop-culture gags we can stuff into this thing ’ philosophy .
( And after the emotionally honest storytelling of Kung - Fu Panda , I was so disappointed . )
Thus a top - secret UFO sighting is referred to as a “ Code Nimoy , ” and later on the order is given to “ destroy all monsters ” ( the tile of one of those old Japanese monster - fests ) .
When President Stephen Colbert ( who ’s much funnier on his own show ) greets the aliens via a 5 - note keyboard riff – it ’s ( ha ha ha , yawwn ) the Close Encounters motif – but the ensuing hilarity is even more hilarityous when he switches into a rockin’ rendition of Beverly Hills Cop ‘s Axel F theme .
( And they even managed to squeeze in John Williams ’ E.T. along the way . )
Come to think of it , it felt like those visual quotes far outnumbered the pop-cult references : Reese Witherspoon ’s meteor - induced growth into ‘ Ginormica ’ put a reverse spin on The Incredible Shrinking Man while simultaneously referencing Attack of the 50 - Foot Woman ; her expansion within the confines of a church = Wonderland ’s Alice undergoing the same experience inside the White Rabbit ’s house ; her hand reaching , upside - down , directly into the audience , a lift from Hitchcock ’s 3D Dial M for Murder ; Reese ’s desperate hanging onto the edge of a San Francisco building : Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo ; an attack on ( the film ’s strangely redesigned version of ) the Golden Gate Bridge : Harryhausen ’s
It Came From Beneath the Sea ; blob monster B.O.B. oozing out of a doorway , just like the star of the 1950 ’s sci-fier The Blob …
I guess I ca n’t blame the filmmakers if they ’re as big a bunch of fanboys as I am , but the poke - in - the - ribs , ‘ you know what we ’re quoting ’ routine gets tiresome after a while .
Even so , there were plenty of laugh lines in the film that the audience enjoyed ; the TV news film critic sitting next to me guffawed at Reese ’s sleazy TV anchor - boyfriend ’s remark that his audience expects “ news , sports , weather and heartwarming fluff pieces . ”
Okay , not every DreamWorks movie can be a Panda or even a Shrek I ( where the pop- culture gags were fresh ) but to me it felt like they were n’t even trying .
The ‘ growth ’ ( there I go again ! ) of Reese and her fellow monsters into emotionally committed friends was strictly by the numbers .
And when the military rewards her with a reunion with her family , why do her monster pals tag along , other than to stuff some ‘ monsters freak out her family ’ gags into the movie ?
Throwing something illogical into the script just to keep things moving – even in an anything - goes fantasy film – does a lot to unsuspend my suspension of disbelief .
Joe is an occasional animation scripter and freelance NYC writer covering animation and sci-fi / fantasy entertainment .
His work has appeared in the NY Daily News , Newsday , the New York Press and , as they used to say on Rocky and Bullwinkle , ‘ a host of others . ’
He is a regular contributor to the animation industry website awn.com , but it ’s much easier to visit joestrike .com to see what he ’s been up to lately .
Nothing could be more benign and pleasant than chocolate truffles–but in the confections of Stephen J. Shanabrook , sweet treats turn into gruesome mementos of contemporary life .
The candies you see above were cast from the fatal wounds of anonymous cadavers .
According to Eat Me Daily , Shanabrook says the truffles skate “ very close to the edge , the forbidden place for artists . ”
Shanabrook , who worked in a chocolate factory as a kid , was n’t done there .
Here ’s a casting that purports to be of the remnants of a suicide bomber :
And here ’s a pair of choirboys , waterboarded with chocolate , which feature in a current art exhibition in New York , which ends on August 8 :
Presumably , this stuff is meant for collecting and not consumption –Shanabrook ’s gotta make money , after all .
But that ’s a shame , because if eaten , they ’d be a couple notches more interesting , and a bit farther removed from mere shock art .
Enjoying a sweet which harks to the world ’s most troubling problems is a good metaphor for blithe consumerism and blithe self - absorption , no ?

Water
Is the Most Abundant Compound on Earth
One of the most interesting water facts is that water is the most precious resource on our planet .
Life , including human , animal and plant , could not continue without it .
Luckily , it is the most abundant compound on Earth .
It is also the most abundant compound in all living things , including humans .
The human body is made up of 60 % water , and the brain is 75 % water .
Strangely , a jellyfish and a cucumber are each made up of 95 % water .
The Average American Family Uses 400 Gallons of Water Per Day
This is a staggering number when you learn that water facts recommend that the average adult need only take in a gallon of water each day in order to survive .
In one year , the average American family will use over 100,000 gallons of water , between drinking , cooking , bathing , cleaning and outdoor uses .
Close to 400 billion gallons of water are used each day in the United States .
For a family of four , nearly 7,000 gallons of water are required to grow one day ’s worth of food .
Drinking Too Much Water Can Be Fatal
Water intoxication is a potentially fatal disturbance that is caused by consuming too much water during a short time .
The normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside safe limits when too much water floods the system .
Infants are prone to water intoxication , as are athletes and even competitive eaters .
Symptoms of this condition include changes in behavior , confusion , irritability , and drowsiness .
Occasionally there is difficulty breathing , muscle weakness and pain or twitching .
The brain may swell which can interfere with the central nervous system , resulting in seizure , brain damage , coma or even death .

Unsafe Water Kills 200 Children Each Hour
Most people around the world have access to clean drinking water .
But in poorer and less developed countries , finding water that is clean enough to drink can be an issue .
Water pollution and low - quality water in these countries can lead to dangerous bacteria , diseases , and viruses such as E Coli and Cryptosporidium .
Water can also be sparse in some environments , and if the body goes too long without water , dehydration can set in , which can eventually lead to death .
Your Drinking Water Is Ancient Earth is referred to as a closed system , meaning that the elements available today are the same that were available thousands of years ago .
Therefore , the same amount of water that was on the planet during ancient time periods is the same amount of water that ’s present today .
There is less available water though , due to contamination and an increase in the need for water , due to technology and population growth .
Water
Is a Financial Burden
A staggering 260 billion dollars is the estimated annual economic loss from poor water and sanitation in developing countries .
One of the more shocking water facts is that if just one - third of the amount of money spent by the world on bottled water in a year was put towards installing sanitation centers in poor areas throughout the world , the issue of unclean and dangerous water could be solved .
Bottled Water
Is Costly A bottle of water that costs you a dollar at a store is more expensive than you might think .
A half - liter water bottle can be refilled 1,740 times with tap water for the same price .
Some estimates put bottled water at a resell point of 2,900 times its actual cost .
If tap water were to cost the same as bottled water , the average monthly water bill would be nearly $ 9,000 .
The United States alone spends over 20 billion dollars on bottled water each year .
Water Can Cause Wars Between 3000 BC and 2012 , 265 incidences of water conflict were been recorded .
Many historians predict that the next large world war will be fought over water , as sources predict that by 2025 more than half of the world could be experiencing water shortages .
While there have not been wars that were fought only about water , there have been conflicts regarding rivers and other bodies of water as country borders , and over the ownership and use of rivers , lakes , and streams .
It ’s Easy To Save Water
If everyone in the United States flushed the toilet just once less per day , the water saved would fill up a lake that was one mile long , one mile wide and four feet deep .
If everyone in the United States used just one less gallon of water in the shower each day , 85 billion gallons of water would be saved each year .
In addition , by regularly checking for leaks , water waste can be avoided .
Households leak more than 1 trillion gallons of water a year .
That ’s enough water to provide 11 million homes with their annual water needs .

Water Goes Through Quite a Cycle
On average , in a 100 - year period , a water molecule spends 98 years in the ocean , 20 months as ice , 2 weeks in lakes and rivers and less than a week in the atmosphere .
One drop of water sure can get around !
It is estimated that if a molecule stays in the atmosphere for long enough , it will travel around the entire globe in 6 months .
Water Exists
On Other Planets Scientists believe that water is a very frequent substance throughout this and other galaxies because hydrogen and oxygen , the two elements that make up a molecule of water , are the most abundant elements found in space .
Scientists do not know why there is more water on Earth than anywhere else that has been discovered yet .
When the water has been found on other planets , it is usually in the form of ice .
Hot Water Freezes Faster Than Cold Water
Many have heard how hot water can freeze faster than cold water but the truth behind this situation is much more complicated .
Yes , if you put one bucket of hot water and one bucket of cold water in a freezer , the hot will freeze first .
The reasoning is n’t exactly known by scientists but some theories revolve around super - cooling , evaporation , convection , and effects of dissolved gases .
The truth is that while hot water freezer first , cold water freezes faster .
Hot water forms ice at a higher temperature than cold water but cold water takes less time to form ice .
Water Is More Than Liquid , Solid and Gas Fascinating water facts tell us there are actually 5 different phases of liquid water and 14 different phrases of ice – and scientists believe that there are even more yet to be discovered .
After water freezes , if you continue to cool it to a temperate of - 184 degrees Fahrenheit , it becomes thick like molasses .
At - 211 degrees Fahrenheit , it is classified as glassy water , which is solid with no crystal structure .
Boiling Water Turns Instantly to Snow
If the temperature difference is large enough between a pot of boiling water and the outside temperature , the water will instantly turn to snow once thrown in the air .
This is a dangerous experiment though , so you need to understand why it works .
When it ’s very cold , there is little water vapor in the air .
Boiling water has a lot of vapor nearby , hence the steam it emits .
Cold air is very dense , leaving very little room for water molecules in it .
When you bombard it with the hot water and vapor , it does n’t have enough room for everything , and the vapor is forced out , clinging to particles in the air , creating snowflakes .
Water Might Travel the World …or Stay Put A water molecule tends to always remain a water molecule .
The molecules enter the atmosphere and travel with the clouds , dropping as rain and then draining into rivers or other bodies of water .
They make their way through soil or other environmental matter before being evaporated again up into the atmosphere .
A water molecule that is at the bottom of the ocean or deep within a glacier , however , may not move for tens of thousands of years .
It ’s all about location .

On the far shore of a brackish lagoon , white Brahmin cows stoop to drink .
Behind them , over a muddy embankment , palm trees frame a row of abandoned shelters on a sandy beach .
Just two weeks ago , this was a Tamil Tiger stronghold .
A few miles south , hundreds of Tamil rebels are making a final , desperate stand in Sri Lanka 's 26 - year civil war .
Held there , as pawns in the military endgame , are tens of thousands of ethnic - Tamil civilians .
Short on food and water , and pounded by artillery shells , their plight has triggered international concern but no halt in the fighting .
Instead , a final assault seems imminent .
On Apr. 30 , one day after rejecting calls by British and French envoys for a cease - fire , President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in a speech that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) had five or six days left to surrender .
Similar deadlines have come and gone before .
But an aid worker in Vavuniya , where refugee camps are overflowing with newcomers from the war zone , says military officials had told her last week to expect another 50,000 arrivals by midweek .
That number is at the low end of the UN 's estimate of remaining civilians trapped by the two warring sides .
Army commanders leading a tightly scripted media tour of recently captured areas gave a more cautious assessment .
Victory would be in " a couple of weeks , at the most , " General Jagath Dias told reporters .
World 's ' largest hostage rescue mission ?'
As the fighting has shrunk to a narrow strip of rebel - held land , currently less than three square miles , Sri Lanka 's military has framed its offensive against the LTTE as the world 's " largest hostage rescue mission . "
On Friday , it air - dropped leaflets into the area that urged Tamil civilians to seek sanctuary in the cleared areas .
That 's what happened here on Apr. 20 .
Overnight , Army commandos crossed the shallow lagoon and captured the LTTE 's defensive embankment .
The next morning , watched by spy drones , huge crowds of ragged men , women and children streamed out on foot .
By 10 a.m. , 5,000 had crossed into government - held territory .
At 10 p.m. , the number rose to 35,000 , in addition to those who escaped north along the sands .
In total , 115,000 civilians escaped this way , the military says .
Commanders say that if they can penetrate the final LTTE redoubt , the remainder of the trapped civilians can flee , leaving the rebels to surrender or die .
More than 3,000 have surrendered so far .
The military insists that no bystanders are harmed in the rescue efforts .
" We continue this operation with the aim of not causing any casualties to civilians , " Gen .
Dias said .
A recent internal UN report , however , estimates that nearly 6,500 civilians had died in the war zone prior to the Apr. 20 outflow .
On Saturday , medical officials in the LTTE - held area told the BBC and other news agencies that scores had died during two days of government shelling that hit a makeshift hospital .
The government denied the claim .
War crimes by both sides ?
It has also pushed back against leaked UN satellite data that appeared to show recent aerial bombardment of civilian areas .
The release of the satellite images , which Sri Lankan officials say are inconclusive , appear to be part of an internal UN row over how far to expose what some UN officials are calling war crimes by both sides .
Human rights groups and other observers warn that any final offensive would spell disaster for those caught in the crossfire .
A repeat of the Apr. 20 exodus is complicated by the area 's topography and the ruthlessness of the LTTE , which is killing anyone caught escaping by boat or land , says another aid worker in direct contact with civilians there .
Ramani Hariharan , a retired Army colonel who was an intelligence chief during India 's 1987 - 1990 peacekeeping operation in Sri Lanka , says it would be almost impossible to distinguish civilians from fighters in the densely packed area .
" It 's not a neat operation .
It 's going to be messy .
Messy operations lead to casualties , " he says .
Dire conditions for trapped civilians
In the war zone , conditions are increasingly dire as thousands of families huddle in trenches in fear of incoming shells .
Most only eat one in three days , says the second aid worker .
Last week , the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) , the only foreign relief agency present , delivered by boat 30 tons of food aid , the first to arrive since early April .
" The fighting is going on .
The food is arriving .
Do you leave your trench to get food for your family ?
Do you take the risk ?
These are tough choices , " says Sophie Romanens , a spokesperson for the ICRC .
On the road to the town of Putumattalan , the war 's toll is writ large in the empty , burnt - out villages ringed by fallow fields .
Only military patrols and distant explosions break the silence of a land seemingly scoured of humanity .
Near the front line a line of red buses await the next exodus of war refugees .
Since Thursday , none have come out .
Outside a makeshift clinic , Army Private P.O. Athula recalls fierce fire fights for control of this area .
Many of the LTTE combatants are children , he says .
Three out of four are young women , he estimates .
If possible , he says it 's better to capture and try to rehabilitate these fighters , who are forced to join the LTTE .
" If they are children , " he says , " I try not to kill them . "

I could fill out a calendar with all of these " important " events and not have an empty week .
Which means I 'm buying gifts all over the fucking place .
THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT .

Very young kids are stupid and are easily impressed by any gift that is made of 100 % high fructose corn syrup .

But gifts for adults ?
No , no .
Fuck that .
If you 're over the age of 22 , you do n't deserve gifts for your birthday .
Ever .
Maybe you get one of those annoying group dinners where everyone splits the fucking bill except for you .
And then one rich asshole at the table fucks up the cost average for everyone else by ordering the 15 lb. lobster .
But a gift ?
That I have to wrap ?
Fuck you in the pants .
I knew chicks in New York who always threw themselves birthday parties , expecting everyone to bring them a present .
Eat shit , honey .
You 'll get nothing and like it .
You should n't need gifts as you get older .
There comes a point in life when gifts stop being useful .
I have enough shit laying around .
I do n't fucking need more of it .
The only gift I could ever possibly want is money .
Unfortunately , I do n't know enough Italians , so I never get it as a present .
I get shirts .
Oooh , loogit !
Something I have to dry clean !
The older you get , the more expensive life becomes .
You have to pay for housing , and food , and diapers , and life insurance , and all kinds of other god awful shit .
There 's NEVER enough money to cover it all , yet there remains this societal burden where we have to get people cards and gifts for shit that is irrelevant TO ME .
Oh , your kid just got confirmed ?
Bully for him .
I 'm glad he 's officially a righteous Christian fuckwit now .
But I 'm not going to bestow a gift on the kid for it .
You know what his gift is ?
Jesus ' love .
Suck on that .
It 's reached the point now where Mrs. Drew and I are forced to buy so many gifts for other people that we never bother to get shit for each other .

Intel has officially appealed the hefty � 1 billion + fine levied against it in May by the European Union after a years - long antitrust investigation .
In doing so , the chipmaker made what appears to be an unusual argument : that the EU has violated Intel 's human rights by assessing such a large fine .
Unlike the United States , where the Department of Justice often files lawsuits in the course of its inquiries , a European Union antitrust investigation is administrative in nature .
The European Commission 's Directorate General for Competition investigates and issues a finding once it has gathered sufficient data .
The end result is often a very large fine , such as the �500 million Microsoft was forced to pay .
The gist of the human - rights - violation argument is that multimillion - euro fines should only be issued by criminal courts , not as a result of an administrative proceeding .
" There is no doubt that antitrust proceedings are criminal in nature , " Arianna Andreangeli , a lecturer in law at the Liverpool Law School told the Wall Street Journal , citing their " deterrent and punitive " nature .
While not making the exact details of its appeal known , an Intel spokesperson did confirm that the company has raised the issue with the EU .
The Wall Street Journal notes that other European companies have cited human rights violations in their appeals , including Schindler Holding and Saint - Gobain Glass France SA .
In its over - 500 - page decision , European Commission ruled that Intel violated EU antitrust law by providing OEMs volume rebates that prevented rival AMD from expanding its market share .
Intel was also found to have paid one PC manufacturer to delay the release of AMD - powered desktops and a retailer to keep its shelves AMD - free .
Although a handful of companies have raised the human rights issue , none of them have yet succeeded in convincing the Court of First Instance that their rights were violated as a result of the antitrust investigations and rulings .
The Court will rule on Intel 's appeal some time in 2010 .

Very few Christians understand that the Biblical festivals in the Torah contain extraordinary evidence for the Christian faith .
You see , for centuries before Jesus ever came to this earth , God had His people celebrate festivals which were themselves prophecies of important events which were to take place hundreds of years later .
In this article , we will examine three examples of this .
Three times every year the Lord had His people go up to Jerusalem to celebrate a festival : Passover ( Pesach ) , Pentecost ( Shavout ) and The Feast of Tabernacles ( Sukkot ) .
Now why did God have His people go to Jerusalem every year ?
It was because the prophetic fulfillment of each of these festivals was to occur in Jerusalem and the surrounding areas .
First of all , let us take a look at the Festival of Passover .
For centuries and centuries before the coming of the Messiah , God had His people go to Jerusalem and celebrate a festival which involved the sacrifice of a lamb .
Now , most Christians understand that Christ was our Passover lamb .
But it goes much deeper than that .
You see , during the very first Passover meal , God had His people put the blood of the lamb on their doorposts .
Why the doorposts ?
It was prophetic .
What are most doorposts made out of , even today ?
Wood .
And where does wood come from ?
From a tree .
So during that very first Passover , God ’s message to the people of Israel was that the blood of the lamb on the tree covered them from the wrath of God .
Does that sound familiar ?
It should .
It is the message of the cross .
The blood of the Lamb on the tree ( the cross ) covered us from the wrath of God .
And when did Jesus die ?
On the eve of Passover , just as the Passover lambs were being slaughtered .
So , each year God had His people go to the exact place where the Messiah would die , at the exact time of the year that the Messiah would die , and He had them celebrate a festival that was an amazing prophetic representation of the sacrifice that the Messiah would make on the cross .
Can you think of any other religion that has something like this ?
No , you can ’t , because there are n’t any .
There is only one true God and He given us all the evidence that we would ever need to find Him .
Secondly , let us take a look at the Feast of Pentecost .
Pentecost was the time when the people of Israel commemorated the giving of the Torah .
Once again , the Lord had His people go up to Jerusalem each and every year at a specific time .
Did the Lord do this just to be bothersome ?
No .
It was prophetic .
For what happened in Jerusalem on that exact day shortly after the Lord Jesus left this earth ?
That was the day we read about in Acts chapter 2 when the Lord poured out the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and they spoke in other tongues .
So , for centuries and centuries , God had His people gather at the exact place where the Holy Spirit would be poured out , on the exact day when the Holy Spirit would be poured out , and He had them celebrate a festival that not only remembered the giving of the Torah , but also looked forward to the giving of the Holy Spirit .
You see , God always does the “ big things ” on His festival days .
After Jesus died and rose again , many probably wondered if the festival days were still going to have the same significance .
Well , God answered that in a big way .
On the very FIRST festival day after the ascension of Jesus , God chose to pour out His Holy Spirit on the apostles .
That was not by accident .
By doing this , God sent a very strong message that His festivals still mattered .
Lastly , let us take a look at the Feast of Tabernacles .
The Feast of Tabernacles was the 3rd time each year that God had His people travel up to the city of Jerusalem .
It was an 8 day festival where God had the people of Israel live in humble shelters or “ booths ” for 8 days .
Now why in the world would God have His people do that ?
Once again , it was prophetic .
You see , Jesus was NOT born on December 25th .
In fact , there is nothing special about December 25th in the Scriptures at all .
Rather , most Bible scholars understand that Jesus was almost certainly born during the fall .
In the gospel of Luke there are clues that we can use to calculate the approximate time that Jesus was born .
Starting with calculating the time of the year when John the Baptist ’s father served in the Temple , we can come up with a Scriptural timeline that ends in the birth of Christ .
The following video will break down all of the specific details for you :
Now , it must be noted that it cannot be proven with 100 percent certainty using the Scriptures that Jesus was born on the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles , but that seems to be the most logical conclusion when you consider all of the facts .
You see , as noted earlier , God always does the “ big things ” on his high holy days .
If Jesus was born on the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles ( which is a High Sabbath ) , then He would have been circumsized on the 8th day of the Feast of Tabernacles ( which is also a High Sabbath ) .
In addition , it would better explain why there was no room for Mary and Jospeh to stay anywhere .
Bethlehem is only about 5 miles from Jerusalem , so the entire area around Jerusalem would have been absolutely packed with visitors who had come in for the festival .
But perhaps the biggest clue is the festival itself .
You see , during the Feast of Tabernacles , God had His people live in humble temporary shelters which perfectly foreshadowed how His Son would come into the world some day .
In essence , God had His people go up to Jerusalem ( which is about five miles from Bethlehem ) every year , at the exact time when His Son would be born and He had them live in humble temporary shelters ( “ manger scenes ” if you will ) in order to foreshadow the circumstances of the birth of the Messiah .
Are you beginning to grasp the wonderful prophetic details contained in the Biblical festivals of the Torah ?
God had His people go up to Jerusalem three times each year because one day
He was going to prophetically fulfill each of those three holidays during those exact times in that exact area of the world .
What other God is able to do something like that ?
Praise God for the wonderful things that He has given to us in the Scriptures !
As you read the rest of this blog , hopefully you will begin to see that there is overwhelming evidence that Christianity is true .

Some ousted season 8 American Idol top 36 semi-finalists -- including Felicia Barton , Kendall Beard , and Ju'Not Joyner -- participated in an online chat with the Idol website AI Now today .
And during his frank online conversation with fans , Ju'Not came right out and said that the TV talent show is in fact rigged , and that its contracts are unfair to contestants .
" It 's a fixed thing if I ever saw one , " he boldly declared -- much to the shock of many naive chatters , who responded with capslocked interjections and frowny - faced emoticons .
It was hardly the first time that AmIdol had been accused of wrongdoing .
A book loosely based on anonymous former Idol employees ' experiences with the show , Stage 46 , made similar allegations last year .
But few detractors have ever been as brutally honest as Ju'Not was today .
Ju'Not -- who by his own account was labeled a " troublemaker " by Idol producers for questioning the contract ( which he dubbed a " slavetract " ) that all auditioners are required by Fox / 19 to sign , and was allegedly told by Idol bigwig Ken Warwick , " You 're not going to ruin my show " -- explained that he wanted to set the record straight today .
He stated that he wanted to reveal " truth of Idol " because " Idol ai n't all it is cracked up to be ... It 's certainly not the fairytale most think it is . "
Ju'Not claimed he was cut from the competition , and not invited back for the Wild Card round ( a shock to many viewers wowed by his memorable " Hey There Delilah " performance ) because of his concerns regarding the fairness of the Idol contract .
" They pay for our lawyers to negotiate against their lawyer ( which is BS ) , " he said .
" They make us COLLECTIVELY choose the lawyer , then they act like it 's in our best interest .
Craziest stuff I 've ever seen .
I have a son to feed .
I HAD to ask questions and know what I was signing .
Plus I write my own songs and I needed to know details ... Some folks were like , ' Just shut up and sign on the dotted line . '
I know better than that ... I was n't complaining ... I was asking basic legal questions .
There 's a huge difference between the two . "
He continued : " I definitely believed that affected my time on the show .
They did n't like the fact that I would n't sign ' just anything ' and that other contestants were coming asking me questions .
So I think they ousted me the first chance they could get ...
Even if I did n't get in on votes ... how did I not get picked for the Wild Card show when I received comments from the ' judges ' that were better than most of the contestants who were picked for the Wild Card show ? "
Ju'Not also theorized that he was not selected for the top 13 because he refused to let the show 's producers exploit his sympathetic " back story " of being from " the hood . "
Said Ju'Not : " They wanted me to put that out to the world and expose my personal business for ratings .
I would n't do it . "
While Ju'Not made it clear he believes Kris Allen is indeed talented and deserved to win this season , he also maintained that Kris 's victory was fixed .
" The producers know who they want and they slant it to reflect that .
They fix it in a way that makes you surprised but it 's still manipulated , " he typed .
" Think about it ... ADAM , ADAM , ADAM , then ... Kris .... SURPRISE SMITHCHES !!!!
" What I mean is that people think AI is a talent show , " he elaborated .
" No .
It 's a reality show with writers !!
We 're all actors .
All these shows have writers that guide the public opinion .
The Hills , Real World .
All of them . "
He even bluntly questioned the validity of the public 's votes , saying , " Do you think a billion - dollar enterprise is subject to the whim of the public ? "
Naturally , while some chat participants applauded Ju'Not 's frankness , others questioned his motives , since few other Idol contestants have come forth with such accusations .
Ju'Not explained : " No one else is complaining because a lot of the contestants do n't understand how this business works .
They 've never had record deals or seen a record contract ... I have .
So I knew what questions to ask .
It 's kinda like ignorance is bliss .
Some contestants may have thought it was just cool to be on TV , but this is my career .
I take this thing VERY seriously ... Very few people spoke up .
They saw me as the ringleader .
I 'm not naming names .
Because I have nothing against the other Idols . "
So , was Ju'Not speaking the truth ?
If so , then he is to be commended for his bravery .
But it 's possible he was just trying to drum up publicity for the " hot " new album he 's self - releasing this winter , in which case he 's a typical showbiz opportunist .
Or maybe he 's just a bitter reject , desperately angling for a 16th minute of fame and dreaming of what might have been .
All of this is up for debate .
But there is no debate that Ju'Not is , as he worded it today , " a straight - up person . "
He definitely went there .
One of the major problems with doctors who are treating cancer patients today are , they know virtually nothing about nutrition and the reason being they are not taught nutrition .

The Prince of Wales has resigned as patron of Britain 's most venerable heritage society after a heated falling - out over his conservative architectural views , The Independent has learnt .
Prince Charles quit as patron of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings , which William Morris founded in 1877 , after it rejected a foreword he had written for a handbook on the restoration of old houses .
The Prince forcefully took the view in the piece that old houses should always be restored in their original style , while the society , despite its title , is committed to employing the best of modern architecture and design in restoration projects .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
When it asked for the foreword to be amended , it was rebuffed and told it was all or nothing .
It chose to reject the piece , issuing a virtually unprecedented snub to the Royal Family .
The Prince , taking the view that he was being censored , responded by ending his association with the society .
The embarrassing rift took place several months ago but has until now been kept entirely confidential .
Yesterday , the society 's secretary Philip Venning confirmed that the Prince had quit over the issue of his rejected comments .
The Prince 's office also confirmed that his five - year association with the society had come to an end .
The row will further reinforce the image of Prince Charles as a dyed - in - the - wool conservative in architectural matters , a view which was given wide currency last month when he intervened to secure the abandonment of a £ 1bn high - tech development at central London 's Chelsea Barracks site by the leading modernist architect Richard Rogers .
An infuriated Lord Rogers accused the Prince of " an abuse of power " and of acting unconstitutionally .
In the dispute with the society , the Prince 's rejected foreword was intended for The Old House Handbook , a guide to repairing and caring for old buildings written in association with the society by two of Britain 's leading architectural commentators , Roger Hunt and Marianne Suhr .
Hunt is a well known architectural journalist , while Suhr is a chartered surveyor , writer , and expert on historic buildings who co-presented the television series Restoration alongside Ptolemy Dean and Griff Rhys Jones .
Mr Venning said the Prince had agreed to write the foreword at the request of Hunt and Suhr and although the society was happy with most of his comments , there was one section which " could not be squared " with its views and with what the book was saying about new design in connection with the restoration and extension of historic buildings .
The Prince felt the issue of " honesty " in conservation – using design and materials of your own time , to which the society is committed – had been used too often to justify unsatisfactory alterations and ugly additions .
The society asked the Prince 's office for the passage to be amended , but its request was refused .
As a result , Mr Venning , in consultation with his executive committee , rejected the foreword and wrote another one himself .
Shortly afterwards , the Prince 's five - year tenure as the society 's patron was up for renewal and he decided not to continue in the position , ending his relationship with the society .
Asked if he regretted the Prince 's departure , Mr Venning said : " The fact is , we agree with so much of what he says , but on the issue of new design there are occasions when we disagree , and we wo n't disguise the fact .
We were pleased he was our patron . "
The Prince of Wales took over as the society 's patron after the death of his grandmother , Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother , who had been patron since 1977 .
The society has yet to appoint a new patron .
The ' grandaddy ' of conservation groups
Founded by the socialist architect , designer and writer William Morris , the SPAB is the world 's oldest environment campaigning group , the " grandaddy " of all conservation organisations , preceding the National Trust , for example , by nearly 20 years ( the Trust 's founder Octavia Hill was a SPAB member ) .
Over its 132 years of existence it has been supported by many of Britain 's leading cultural figures , from Burne - Jones and Ruskin in Victorian times to John Betjeman in the 20th century and more recently , by figures such as Griff Rhys Jones , Jeanette Winterson and Bill Bryson .

So much for the ongoing secrecy of the nation ’s independent central banking system .
A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 75 % of Americans favor auditing the Federal Reserve and making the results available to the public .
This is great momentum .
People are n’t buying Bernanke ’s nonsense .
But then , why should they ?
He has been consistently wrong on everything he said :
The new , opposite video is a compilation of the 2005 – 2007 prognostications of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
In it , Bernanke is shown to have been just as embarrassingly wrong as Schiff was uncannily right .
Could their differences in economic understanding have anything to do with this remarkable dichotomy ?
I have transcribed most of the video , and offer my own comments interspersed with it .
July 2005
INTERVIEWER : Ben , there ’s been a lot of talk about a housing bubble , particularly , you know [ inaudible ] from all sorts of places .
Can you give us your view as to whether or not there is a housing bubble out there ?
BERNANKE : Well , unquestionably , housing prices are up quite a bit ; I think it ’s important to note that fundamentals are also very strong .
We ’ve got a growing economy , jobs , incomes .
We ’ve got very low mortgage rates .
We ’ve got demographics supporting housing growth .
We ’ve got restricted supply in some places .
So it ’s certainly understandable that prices would go up some .
I do n’t know whether prices are exactly where they should be , but I think it ’s fair to say that much of what ’s happened is supported by the strength of the economy .
This is not only wrong in hindsight ; it ’s a complete misunderstanding of the issue .
Bernanke said that the housing boom was fine because it was supported by , among other things , growth in jobs , incomes , and in the economy in general .
But that very growth itself was supported by the housing boom !
For example , most of the job growth was in the housing sector .
Witness Bernanke ’s amazing levitating economy : its housing sector is held up by economic growth , which is held up by its housing sector .
And it ’s just as ridiculous that he denied the existence of a housing bubble by pointing to low mortgage rates .
The low rates were a chief cause of the housing bubble , and were a direct result of his actions as Federal Reserve chairman .
July 2005
INTERVIEWER :
Tell me , what is the worst - case scenario ?
Sir , we have so many economists coming on our air and saying , “ Oh , this is a bubble , and it ’s going to burst , and this is going to be a real issue for the economy . ”
Some say it could even cause a recession at some point .
What is the worst - case scenario , if in fact we were to see prices come down substantially across the country ?
BERNANKE : Well , I guess I do n’t buy your premise .
It ’s a pretty unlikely possibility .
We ’ve never had a decline in house prices on a nationwide basis .
So what I think is more likely is that house prices will slow , maybe stabilize : might slow consumption spending a bit .
I do n’t think it ’s going to drive the economy too far from its full employment path , though .
As Peter Schiff pointed out in his speech “ Why the Meltdown Should Have Surprised No One , ” while it is true that up until the housing crash , house prices had n’t gone down on a nationwide basis , it ’s also true that they had never risen so precipitously before either .
Bernanke ’s argument is akin to getting someone drunk for the first time , putting them in a car , and then saying , “ He ’ll be fine ; he ’s never been in a car accident before . ”
That interview continued :
INTERVIEWER :
So would you agree with Alan Greenspan ’s comments recently that we ’ve got some areas of that country that are seeing froth , not necessarily a national situation , but certainly froth in some areas ?
BERNANKE :
You can see some types of speculation : investors turning over condos quickly .
Those sorts of things you see in some local areas .
I ’m hopeful — I ’m confident , in fact , that the bank regulators will pay close attention to the kinds of loans that are being made , and make sure that underwriting is done right .
But I do think this is mostly a localized problem , and not something that ’s going to affect the national economy .
Bernanke ’s
Fed itself created the false signals that led to vast disruptions in the housing market .
Speculators try to see through those disruptions and anticipate how prices will change as valuation mistakes are corrected in order to profit from them .
In fact , their speculation is part of the correction process .
If their speculation is on the mark , it speeds up the price - correction process .
If it ’s wrong , then the consequences are on their heads .
Speculation is nothing but high - uncertainty entrepreneurship ; and entrepreneurship is how optimal prices are found and markets clear .
It was the Fed under Bernanke himself , and his predecessor Alan Greenspan , that created the price disruption and high uncertainty that made speculation profitable in the first place .
November 2006
BERNANKE :
This scenario envisions that consumer spending , supported by rising incomes and the recent decline in energy prices , will continue to grow near its trend rate and that the drag on the economy from the [ inaudible ] housing sector will gradually diminish .
The motor vehicles sector may already be showing signs of strengthening .
After having cut production significantly in recent months , in response to the rise in inventory of unsold vehicles , automakers appear to have boosted the assembly rate a bit in November , and they have scheduled further increases for December .
The effects of the housing correction on real economic activity are likely to persist into next year , as I ’ve already noted .
But the rate of decline in home construction should slow as the inventory of unsold new homes is gradually worked down .
Here we have the Keynesian fallacy ( which I have written about here ) that consumer spending , in and of itself , creates general increases in wealth .
And note the irony in Bernanke applauding the boost in automotive production : the products accumulated during that boost turned out just to be more malinvestment to be liquidated or bailed out when Chrysler and GM collapsed .
February 2007
BERNANKE : We expect moderate growth going forward .
We believe that if the housing sector begins to stabilize , and if some of the inventory corrections still going on in manufacturing begin to be completed , that there ’s a reasonable possibility that we ’ll see some strengthening in the economy sometime during the middle of the new year .
Our assessment is that there ’s not much indication at this point that subprime mortgage issues have spread into the broader mortgage market , which still seems to be healthy .
And the lending side of that still seems to be healthy .
For Bernanke , healthy lending is the same thing as “ a lot of lending . ”
This dovetails with his statement in the first interview , hailing low mortgage rates as a self - evidently good thing .
He has no conception of an equilibrium interest rate determined by society ’s average time preference , so bubbles will always surprise him .
For more on this calamitous gap in Bernanke ’s understanding , see “ Manipulating the Interest Rate : a Recipe for Disaster ” by Thorsten Polleit .
July 2007
BERNANKE :
The pace of home sales seems likely to remain sluggish for a time , partly as a result of some tightening in lending standards , and the recent increase in mortgage interest rates .
Sales should ultimately be supported by growth in income and employment , as well as by mortgage rates that , despite the recent increase , remain fairly low relative to historical norms .
However , even if demand stabilizes as we expect , the pace of construction will probably fall somewhat further , as builders work down the stocks of unsold new homes .
Thus , declines in residential construction will likely continue to weigh on economic growth in coming quarters , although the magnitude of the drag on growth should diminish over time .
The global economy continues to be strong , supported by solid economic growth abroad .
U.S. exports should expand further in coming quarters .
Overall , the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007 , with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy ’s underlying trend .
Strengthening in 2008 ?
Perhaps the biggest confirmation ever of Rockwell ’s Law : always believe the opposite of what government officials tell you .
Bernanke ’s own words , in light of how the crisis developed , are a testament to much more than his own personal failings as a forecaster and policy maker .
They demonstrate the complete inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics in its present state , devoid as it is of the essential insights of the Austrian School .
They also reveal the folly of the very idea of giving a single man and his institution the power to centrally plan the most important price in the economy : the rate of interest .
Make no mistake : the present economic crisis was brought on by central planning .
It is unsettling to think that the fellow in the new video who so badly misread an economy on the brink is arguably the most powerful central planner in the world .
But even the most powerful and sequestered bureaucrat is not completely invulnerable .
The Federal Reserve Transparency
Act and the End the Fed movement have ruffled the Fed ’s feathers enough that Bernanke actually felt the need to address the public in a “ townhall forum ” to be broadcast on the News Hour .
According to NPR ,
after the forum was over , a Fed employee passed out souvenirs , an unintended metaphor perhaps for what some fear Bernanke ’s aggressive policies may eventually do to the currency : shredded cash .
The Fed employee , who apparently suffers from a defective sense of irony , was even recorded saying , “ Here , you want money ? ” and , “ Here ’s some free shred folks , thanks for coming by , we appreciate it , ”
No , no , thank you and your boss , Mr. Fed employee .
Within the space of days , we ’ve been provided , courtesy of the Fed itself , with footage that perfectly distills the complete failure of Fed forecasting and planning , and audio that encapsulates splendidly the only thing that the Fed actually accomplishes : the destruction of money .
Until its trees started dying , the Colorado ski resort town of Breckenridge stayed out of the business of telling residents how to defend their homes against wildfire .
But with trees ravaged by a mountain pine beetle epidemic that has left large rust - tinged swaths of forest vulnerable to a catastrophic fire , town officials decided this year they had to act .
Breckenridge , with a population of 3,500 , recently passed an ordinance requiring residents to thin vegetation around their homes -- creating “ defensible space ” in firefighting lingo -- a move authorities say could help stanch a spreading blaze and aid firefighters in protecting homes .
But the new law has infuriated many residents , who call it an encroachment on their rights and demand its repeal .

“ This country has always been based on the idea of private property ownership .
It ’s a sacred thing .
The town ’s ordinance pretty well tramples on that , ” said Ed Nolan , 65 , whose home is surrounded by 37 trees that firefighters say should go .
“ If cutting these trees saves my life or my wife ’s life or a firefighter ’s life , then it ’s worth it , ” countered John Quigley , 59 , who has hired a crew to thin some of the 185 trees on his land .
California long has required residents in wildfire - prone areas to trim vegetation , and Nevada lawmakers recently approved a similar law for homes in the Tahoe Basin , but other Western states have generally skirted such directives , instead employing public education campaigns to coax residents into doing so .
In recent years , many Colorado counties began requiring homeowners in new developments to create defensible space before building permits are issued .
But there ’s nothing authorities can do to compel them to maintain the clearance after they receive their permits , said Kevin Klein , director of the Colorado Division of Fire Safety .

Breckenridge ’s tactic could signal a newly aggressive approach , he said , one that other communities may adopt as Colorado grapples with an infestation that has destroyed thousands of acres of trees and that fire officials fear will contribute to a conflagration .
“ It ’s a pretty dramatic shift from what we ’ve been doing , ” said Breckenridge Councilman Jeffrey Bergeron .
Surrounded by the White River National Forest , Breckenridge for years has focused more on making hillside homes blend in with their environs by encouraging landscaping around homes , Councilman Dave Rossi said .
Then came the beetles .
When the town passed a law requiring residents to cut down infected trees , Rossi said few residents objected .
Advertisement
But fire officials thought such measures were n’t enough .
Too many homes were surrounded by brush and trees , said Gary Green , chief of the Red , White and Blue Fire District .
Some residents regarded the proposal to require defensible space as necessary to protect the community .
Relying on volunteers is n’t enough , Quigley said .
“ If you do it and your three adjoining neighbors do n’t do it , you have n’t accomplished anything , ” he said .
But others have objected to the mandate , citing the expense of removing healthy trees and shrubs and lowered property values .
“ I now have trees that protect the master bedroom from a view of road , ” Nolan said .
“ I ’m going to pay to lessen the value of my property by taking out these trees . ”

Opponents are circulating a petition seeking to compel the council to repeal the ordinance or put the matter on the ballot .
They say they ’ve collected more than the 330 signatures needed to qualify such a measure .
The opponents also contend there ’s scant evidence that the town ’s approach would be effective against a massive blaze , a criticism the fire chief disputes .
They have found a sympathetic ear in Rossi , one of two council members who voted against the ordinance .
Though Rossi believes residents should trim vegetation , he questions how effective the strategy can be in one town if neighboring communities do n’t take the same approach .
Advertisement
“ I ’m not sure it gets us where we need to be , ” said Rossi , noting that the town has not taken other important steps , such as requiring fire - resistant roofing materials .
But Bergeron , who was among five council members who supported the ordinance , rejects the argument that the town has overstepped its bounds .
“ I sympathize with people who do n’t want to cut trees .
I ’m a tree hugger , ” he said .
“ But what I do n’t buy is the argument that the government ca n’t tell me what to do on my property even if it saves lives and the property of my neighbors . ”
There was a rumor / news story that was quickly debunked that Michael “ Can we make an explosion explode ? ”
Bay was retiring from the action film genre and moving on to other pursuits .
Whether there was an ounce of truth to the story or not , does n’t concern me .
Explosions as an art form and story telling medium , on the other hand , do .
[ If you dig this comic , check out THE BOOK ! ]
What other genre ’s should “ Splode ‘ Em Up ” Bay take a crack at ?
How would the movie ’s play out ?
Let 's follow one minor injury ( mine ) through the American health care system , shall we ?
It started in September 2007 , when I fell out of a tow truck .
I fell out of a tow truck after a long , hard week at work because while I was
driving home from New Jersey across the Betsy Ross bridge , a tire blew out .
My auto club sent out a crew but they could n't change the tire - it needed a special tool , one I did n't have .
( Used car . )
So I trudge back to the police station at the foot of the bridge , where someone was nice enough to let me use their phone .
( Dead cell battery !
Oh lucky day ! )
But then the red - faced shift commander came in and started screaming at me : " GET .
THAT .
CAR .
OFF .
MY .
BRIDGE !! "
He also yelled at me for " tying up our line " and insisted I fork up $ 300 to get my car towed off the bridge .
I 'd just started the job after several months of unemployment and was broke .
I told him ; he did n't care .
I finally made another call and got my auto club to authorize a purchase order to get me towed .
It was a Very Big Truck , a shiny black tractor - trailer with a flatbed .
We unloaded the car at my mechanic's , and the driver dropped me off in front of my house .
Did I mention the truck was black , and that it was late at night and dark outside ?
Because here 's where I tried to step out of the truck onto one of the decks ( black , with no reflective safety strip ) and dropped three feet to the sidewalk , onto my ankle .
Much crying and a trip to the emergency room later , I discovered another little oddity of the American Way of Insurance :
Since the accident involved a vehicle , all treatment had to go through my no - fault car insurance until it was tapped out .
The local hospital did an x-ray and told me it was a minor sprain .
After three months of physical therapy , it was n't getting better .
The physical therapist told me she thought maybe I 'd chipped a bone and it was tearing at the ligament .
" You should get an MRI , " she said .
This , as they say , is where the fun begins .
So I went to my doctor , who tried to order an MRI .
It kept getting rejected .
Finally , I found out why :
Since the original treatment was paid by my car insurance , they did n't know I 'd already had physical therapy .
So then we had to go back and forth with the car insurance to get them to send the records .
It was just about this time that my insurance carrier announced they were severing the agreement with my university - affiliated practice in a dispute with the hospital over reinbursement rates - and I had to find another doctor .
You guessed it .
Back to start !
( I know ; I 'm bored with this story , too .
But I want people to understand how many hoops we 're jumping through under the present system . )
I got all that paperwork in when my former employer notified me we 'd switched insurance plans - and I had to start all over again .
Finally , almost two months ago , I finally got in to see a top - ranked orthopedist .
He told me I was fine .
I kind of got in his face and said , " Look , I 'm unemployed , I 'm paying for COBRA and I 'm running out of money .
I need to know what 's wrong so I can take care of it while I still have insurance . "
His response ?
" I 'm 99.9 % sure you just have some residual swelling and I can fix that with cortisone . "
Against my better judgment , I let him .
In the follow - up visit , I told him it still hurt when I walked ; he told me to take Motrin and scheduled another followup .
About a week after the shot , I was on the couch watching TV ( did I mention the 30 or so pounds I put on from not being able to walk ? ) and turned my foot to one side .
I was hit with excruciating pain , like severe labor cramps in my ankle .
Then I felt a sudden pop , and the pain was gone .
I called the doctor 's service and described the pain , asked if there was anything I should do and was it okay to walk on it ? "
I got a one - word response from the office clerk who called back : " Yes . "
Yes what ?
I asked .
She did n't know , she just knew " Doctor said yes . "
At this point , I insisted on an MRI .
( Yet another $ 50 copay ! )
At this point , I did n't trust the doctor and spent some hours pouring over on - line MRI images , comparing them to mine .
It looked like I had a damaged ligament and a fracture , but I had to wait for the official verdict .
This past Wednesday was my appointment .
( Let me mention here that this practice is run like a high - speed assembly line . )
The doctor finally comes in and tells me the ankle " looks fine , I told you the cortisone would fix your problem . "
I frown : " The MRIs did n't show anything ? "
" What MRIs ?
I was looking at your x-rays . "
So now he goes back and looks at the MRIs , comes back in the room and says , " The MRIs do show a fracture and a ruptured ligament . "
He wants me to wear a brace and go back to physical therapy .
" I do n't understand , " I said .
" How is the ligament going to heal if the broken bone is still rubbing against it ? "
( And do n't think I have n't realized there 's a very good chance the cortisone shot is what finally ruptured the ligament . )
And that 's when he walked out of the room and did n't come back .
So I came home and made an appointment at Penn to get a second opinion .
That 's what happens in our present system . , when decisions are made based on profit and insurance instead of your health .
Multiply that process by hundreds of thousands , maybe even millions .
This is the mess that Congress tells us we want to keep .
By the way , feel free to send this link along to your congress critters !
Louvish is at his best in discussing how Laurel and Hardy , unlike most of the great silent - film comedians , had no trouble making the transition to sound .
Physical comedy , which had once seemed safe , even dreamlike , suddenly became painful when the sounds of the whacks and bonks were alarmingly present .
Laurel and Hardy 's films cleverly exaggerated the noise to cartoon level .
A blow on the head became a reverberating gong , repeated in an echo chamber -- a comfortable laugh rather than an alienating shock .
Comedy duos have always been popular with moviegoers .
The most successful ones pair two men who supply whatever is missing in their partners .
There 's a calculating one ( Bud Abbott ) and a naïve one ( Lou Costello ) , or there 's a handsome one who sings and gets the girl ( Dean Martin ) and a homely one who falls down and gets the audience ( Jerry Lewis ) .
Laurel and Hardy provide this contrast in visual appearance -- big versus small , fat Ollie versus skinny Stan -- but they were never compensating for each other by dividing up the assignment .
Both were masters of enacting carefully controlled violence through brilliant physical comedy .
They are a pair of equals , more like Bob Hope and Bing Crosby , a temporary team in six '' Road ' ' pictures .
Hope and Crosby were both big stars who could sing , dance , get laughs and play romance -- a wised - up , sophisticated variation on Laurel and Hardy .
Bing and Bob , like Stan and Ollie , could stand alone , but where Stan and Ollie usually worked together against hostile forces , Bing and Bob often competed against each other -- the Magic Johnson and Larry Bird of comedy duos .
Today , Laurel and Hardy do not receive the same adoration and scholarly attention given to Buster Keaton , Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd .
After a brief flurry of interest during the 1970's , they have more or less been returned to the shelf labeled '' fan favorites . ''
It is said that no one loves them but the public , and it is true that they are not especially witty , emblematic or even sympathetic .
They are just funny , very funny .
The ' ' boys , '' as their fans lovingly call them , are incompetent .
Since they are no good at anything , they might as well take on the job of moving a piano across the Alps -- they do in '' Swiss Miss ' ' ( 1938 ) .
Over the years , they delivered washing machines ( and pianos ) to hilltop homes , tried to run a dancing school , changed into each other 's pants on top of a skyscraper girder , got howling drunk more than once , joined the Foreign Legion and fueled a pie-throwing Armageddon that all other pie-throwings must be judged by .
They have been body snatchers , air - raid wardens , process servers , chimney sweeps and street musicians ( accordion and bassoon , playing '' In the Good Old Summertime ' ' during a snowstorm ) .
Everything Laurel and Hardy try goes wrong , but they never give up , seeming not to grasp the concept of failure .
Their very incompetence becomes their most useful weapon for destroying the middle - class smugness that greets their efforts .
The assault on the bourgeoisie is not uncommon in American comedy , but the boys , holding on to their hats , attack it with unparalleled passion , inviting the audience to join in and approve .
Thus , they are not only our surrogates but also our best role models .
No matter what befalls them -- and I have not mentioned the truly frightening women they often encounter -- they find new and fabulous ways to retaliate .
My favorite is the egg placed under the victim 's chin , after which the coup de grâce is delivered by snapping the chin rapidly down onto his chest .
Watching this is like listening to Mozart .

You ca n’t understand literature without understanding the minds that read it , and vice versa ( Image : Belknap Press )
LIKE all the best stories , this one has a pleasing symmetry .
It is a book in two parts , each illuminating the other .
On one side stands evolutionary theory and its attempts to explain human nature .
On the other is story itself , represented by two great works of fiction : Homer ’s Odyssey and Dr Seuss ’s Horton Hears a Who !
Brian Boyd ’s thesis is that current literary criticism …
The other night , during our usual bout of being completely unable to think of anything to do , Emmy suggested , “ Let ’s draw Bill Cosby . ”
So we each immediately went to work , unaware of what the other was doing .
When we were finished , we exchanged Cosbies at the same time .
Here is what my Cosby looked like :
And here is Emmy ’s Cosby :
Of course we were both shocked .
Two Cosbies , drawn independently of each other , had turned out to be almost identical !
Had we tapped into some collective Cosby consciousness ?
We decided to run an experiment .
We formed our hypothesis : if we got several people to draw pictures of Bill Cosby , without seeing what each other drew , the majority of them would involve Cosby in a wacky sweater with Jell - o pudding .
With that we ( by which I mean you ) got to work .
Now of course , science is unpredictable .
As it turns out , our hypothesis was incorrect .
Out of a total of 190 Cosbies , only 8 had both a sweater and Jell - o pudding .
Baffling , right ?
That ’s only 4.2 % !
What a shock !
Here is the scientific data we collected :
Cosbies wearing sweaters : 52 ( out of 190 )
Cosbies with a Jell - O Product : 21
Cosbies spouting gibberish : 10
Cosbies with sweaters and Jell-o : 8
Cosbies with sweaters spouting gibberish : 4
Cosbies with sweaters and Jell - o and gibberish : 0 , can you believe it ?
Cosbies that confused us : 19
Cosbies facing left with hands clasped which were clearly based on the first Google Image Search result for “ Cosby ” : 15
Here is a scientific - looking pie chart to show we mean business :
So that ’s that !
All of the entires have been unscreened and are now available for viewing .
Please check them out , because some of them are really excellently done .
Thank you to everyone who participated .
Every time I bake a batch of Peppery Bacon and Cheddar Scones – these magical clusters of heat , tang and smoke – Jeff and I have the same conversation : what makes them scones instead of biscuits ?
I mean , you definitely would n’t serve these with jam and clotted cream .
These would not be the scone of choice for the pinkies - up crowd .
However , scones and biscuits are more similar than you might think .
Both can be sweet or savory , triangular or round .
Both can contain cream or buttermilk or the same fats , including lard .
Both are crusty with soft interiors .
Even the mixing methods are the same .
So , what ’s the real difference ?
It ’s in the ratios .
Biscuits tend to have a ratio of 3:1:2 ( 3 parts flour , 1 part fat , 2 parts liquid ) , while scones usually have a ratio of 3:1:1 .
That seemingly slight difference is why biscuits are flaky and chewy , and scones are more spongy and crumbly .
Since this recipe has a fluctuating amount of liquid ( 3/4 to 1 1/2 cups , depending on the weather ) , it could go either way .
Use the minimum amount of liquid , and you ’ll have scones .
Use the max , and you ’ll have biscuits .
Either way , they make an appearance at our house once a week .
I make a half - batch and skip the rolling pin in favor of patting down the dough and getting the scones into the oven .
Each one brings a lot of personality to the plate , so you can eat them as - is and be perfectly satisfied , or you can split them and fill them with 1 - egg omelets , sandwich meat or sliced tomatoes .
Just make sure to eat them with your pinkies up .
The true story of Operation Market Garden , the Allies attempt , in September 1944 , to hasten the end of World War II by driving through Belgium and Holland into Germany .
The idea was for U.S. airborne divisions to take the towns of Eindhoven and Nijmegen and a British airborne division , reinforced by a Polish airborne brigade , to take the town of Arnhem .
They would be reinforced , in due course and in turn , by the British XXX Corps , land - based and driving up from the British lines in the south .
The key to the operation was the bridges , as if the Germans held or blew them , the paratroopers could not be relieved .
Faulty intelligence , Allied high command hubris , and stubborn German resistance would ensure that Arnhem was a bridge too far .

There ’s nothing quite like a movie monster .
No , we are not talking about Liz Hurley , Catherine Zeta Jones or Rosie O’Donnell , we are talking about hideous creatures that thrive on the weak and the unholy scent of death .
Again , we are not talking about Liz Hurley , Catherine Zeta Jones or Rosie O’Donnell .
Anyway , a good movie monster can add real bite ( literally ) to even the most mundane films .
They can shock , terrify and even inspire highly - profitable marketing spin - offs .
We just ca n’t get enough of them .
But why ?
Is it because we are so sick of being at the top of the food chain ?
Are we really that bored ?
Or is just because we take great pleasure in watching a predator outwit its prey ?
Truth is , how the hell should we know ?
Who do you think I am , David frigging Attenborough ?
Anyway , in our latest excuse to write some random list , we have decided to expose the monsters with a little more bite .
The creatures which really make the feature .
And no we are not talking horror icons like Dracula , Freddie , Jason or Michael Myers , or just beastly humans like Hannibal .
We are talking horrible , slavering beasts with a taste for human flesh .
And no , we are still not talking about Liz Hurley , Catherine Zeta Jones or Rosie O’Donnell .
Enjoy !

“ You must learn how to be lucid in all your actions ;
that is , you must not only be aware of the time , the place , and the circumstances ,
in which the action takes place , but also of yourself , the player , of your body
and what is happening at any moment .
It is not only a question of seeing things as they are , but of seeing yourself at the same time ,
and the reactions that take place within you .
In other words , you absorb the whole thing within you and you become complete ” .

On a business trip a few weeks back , I hit it off with a very charming colleague from my organization .
We were both in town to work an event and had never met previously .
We met right before the event and immediately hit it off .
Since both of us were stuck in this boring town for the night , we agreed to get together for drinks or dinner that evening .
Well , I let her choose the spot and she of course chose a VERY expensive and kinda - romantic foodie joint downtown .
We met up , had a great time , ate a fantastic meal , drank a few glasses of wine and really hit if off .
We split the check .
I had a mix - up with my hotel that night and was trying to find another place to stay , so she recommended where she was staying .
After dinner we left in separate cars for the hotel .
I got lost trying to find the place and eventually found my way there to check - in when my colleague came down to see me in the lobby .
We chatted some more and she suggested we eat breakfast together .
She also told me her room number and said she will be up there all night working if I wanted some company .
It was about 1 am at that point .
I , like a dumbass , did n’t think much of it and promptly went to sleep in my room .
My colleague did n’t show for breakfast the next day and I did n’t give the encounter much thought until today when I realized I may have inadvertently led her on .
I never mentioned I was in a relationship and I ’m kind of flirty by nature .
But I do n’t remember making overtly romantic gestures .
I ’m asking this because I ’ve been in a relationship for over 4 years now and , prior to that , I did n’t date much .
I was ( still am ? ) kinda clueless about human relations in general .
So what do you think ?
Was that a date ?
Was I leading this nice girl along ?
I ’m concerned that I may have inadvertently gone out on a date recently .
Please advise .
NASA Debuts the Entire 2008 Hurricane Season in New On-line Video
Rob Gutro
Goddard Space Flight Center
Imagine watching all of the tropical depressions , storms and hurricanes of 2008 as they formed in the Atlantic Ocean Basin and either faded at sea or made landfall .
Thanks to NASA technology and satellite data coupled with data from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) operated satellite , you can see the tracks of storms from Arthur to Paloma from birth to death .
There were 17 tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Hurricane Season , which includes the North Atlantic Ocean , Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico .
Sixteen of the storms were strong enough to be named , and only one stayed a tropical depression .
The movie displays the infrared cloud imagery from the geosynchronous weather satellites , principally NOAA 's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite ( GOES ) - 12 .
The original cloud imagery was remapped and enhanced to display cloudtop texture .
The GOES cloud images were overlaid on a true - color background map previously created from the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) instrument on NASA 's Terra satellite .
The movie , which can be found on NASA 's Hurricane Web page ( www.nasa.gov/hurricane), or on the NASA GOES web page , is television production - quality .
" These are large , high - resolution , colorful animations , made for use or editing by professional documentary producers or for anyone interested in hurricanes , " said Dr. Dennis Chesters , GOES Project Scientist at the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md . The movie depicts the entire 2008 hurricane season based on six months of GOES imagery at 30 minute intervals from May 1 to November 18 , 2008 .
Each " frame " has a date and time stamp with the times in Universal Coordinated Time ( UTC ) .
There are 2 versions of the movie available : a 720 p and 1080 p HD - TV digital animation .
There 's also a " highlights " movie that features the middle of the hurricane season from July 2 to September 14 .
The shortened " Highlights " movie from Bertha to Ike , July 2 - Sept. 14 can be found here -- >
Highlights " Most versions are overlaid with hurricane names and storm tracks , with the tracks represented by dots whose size and color represent NOAA 's hurricane Category 1 to 5 ( on the Saffir - Simpson Scale ) , " Dr. Chesters said .
" Some movies have captions summarizing each storm in a sidebar .
Movies without named tracks are useful for forecasters and researchers who want to see the regional meteorology without visual distractions .
" All of the movies in various formats labeled or unlabeled , large or small , are also on - line and downloadable at the GOES page for " Hurricane Alley 2008 " The NASA GOES Project office plans to make a movie of the 2009 season .

Looming El Nino sets up gloomy forecast
News analysis South - east Australians can expect little relief from below average rainfall according to climate experts .
The latest forecast from the National Climate Centre in Melbourne says the chances of an El Niño weather pattern developing are twice as strong as normal .
Ans in a potential double - blow , a weather system in the Indian Ocean that research shows has a strong correlation with severe bushfires in the region may also be emerging .
Another year of poor rainfall could also be devastating for the already stressed Murray - Darling river basin .
Telltale signs
Dr David Jones , head of climate analysis at the National Climate Centre says modelling shows the precursors to an El Niño are all tracking in the right direction .
During a typical El Niño event the surface temperature of the Pacific 's equatorial waters are at least 0.8 °C warmer than normal , he says .
They are now half a degree warmer than average .
Jones also points to weakening trade winds and a drop in the Southern Oscillation Index , which tracks air pressure differences between Tahiti and Darwin , as further evidence El Niño is on its way .
He says there is also evidence that the Indian Ocean Dipole ( IOD ) , which plays a strong role in delivering rainfall to Australia , is trending positive .
In its negative phase , the IOD brings cool water to the west coast of Australia and warm water to the north , resulting in increased evaporation into the atmosphere and rain - bearing air sweeping over the continent .
A positive IOD occurs when the western side of the Indian Ocean off Africa and India is warmer than the eastern waters near Sumatra .
As a result , less rainfall travels to Australia , in particular Victoria .
Jones says the indications are Victoria will get no relief from 13 years of drought , with 1996 the last year the state recorded above - average rainfall .
" Soil moisture across Victoria is at record - breaking lows , " he says .
" It 's not been this dry for a very long time . "
Stressful time
Professor Matthew England , director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales says the combination of an El Niño and positive IOD will put great stress on the south - east corner of Australia .
" If a full - blown positive Indian Ocean dipole materialises and that is accompanied by an El Niño this could give rise to a very dry winter and spring over south - eastern Australia , " he says .
England says another year of below average rainfall would not only increase fire risk in Victoria , it also increases the " challenge of keeping the Murray - Daring Basin viable " .
" It puts stress on the ecosystem , it puts stress on the farming community . "
However England says the Indian Ocean Dipole does not peak until the spring months of September , October and November .
" It would be very early for the Indian Ocean Dipole to be showing its true colours for the coming seasons , " he says .
Dr Tim Cowan , a research with CSIRO Marine and Atmosphere Research , says in terms of rainfall an El Niño " would n't be the best thing to get right now " .
Cowan and colleague Dr Wenju Cai , also of the CSIRO , have found the combination of an El Niño and positive IOD increases the risk of a major bushfire season developing .
" El Niño on its own does n't increase the risk , but the IOD tends to push the climatic conditions into a higher bushfire risk . "
In their most recent study they found 11 of 16 major bushfires in Victoria since 1950 had been preceded by a positive IOD .
Degree of impact
Cowan supports
England 's view that it is too early to begin making predictions about the IOD .
However their research shows under climate change there is a trend toward more positive IODs .
Jones says although the bureau has improved its predictive capacity , there is no way of telling how the El Niño will impact on Australia .
" The 2006 El Niño was reasonably weak yet it had a severe impact … across southern Australia and in the Murray Darling Basin , " he says .
England agrees and says although the ability to predict these events is improving , it is harder to know their impact .
" The atmosphere has a degree of chaos to it .
It 's a very complex system to forecast … we 've all heard the anecdote of the butterfly wing that flaps over South America creating a cyclone north of Australia .
The atmosphere has a capacity to surprise and not all El Niños are the same . "
A powerful 7.8 - magnitude earthquake struck off the south - west coast of New Zealand , prompting a brief tsunami warning but causing little damage .
The tremor struck around the tip of New Zealand 's South Island , generating warnings of a low - level tsunami .
People in coastal areas were for a time advised to move to higher ground .
New Zealand said the quake , west of Invercargill , measured 7.8 magnitude , and a second quake about 20 minutes later measured 6.1 .
New Zealand 's Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences initially recorded the first quake at 6.6 magnitude , before upgrading it .
The initial tremor struck 5 km ( 3 miles ) below ground in the remote Fiordland region at 2122 ( 0922 GMT ) , said the government institute , though US experts said it was much deeper .
' Cracks in buildings '
New Zealand issued a tsunami warning for a string of its coastal towns and cities , but later cancelled it .

History of deadly earthquakes
How earthquakes happen Animated guide : Tsunamis Australia also scrapped its alert , but had said a tsunami was detected in the Tasman Sea heading towards the country 's south - east coast .
The warning was downgraded to a " small boat alert " after about an hour , although officials had earlier been concerned it could bring coastal flooding .
The tremor lasted at least a minute and was felt as a rolling motion across New Zealand 's South Island , according to reports .
Local media said the quake caused minor cracks in some buildings and sent stock tumbling from supermarket shelves .
People ran from restaurants in Queenstown as buildings shook , reports New Zealand 's Herald newspaper .
Power and phone lines were severed in some places .
" The whole house was moving , the door was moving in the doorframe , and the fence posts were moving , " Invercargill resident Simon Wilson told Radio New Zealand .
Another Invercargill householder said his wife and their three young children huddled under the dining table during the quake , reported the New Zealand Press Association .
New Zealand records more than 14,000 earthquakes a year , but only about 150 are felt by residents and fewer than 10 annually cause damage .

The report provided previously undisclosed details about the legal and operational schisms that dogged the program in its five years of existence .
The 38 - page document released Friday was an unclassified version .
The bulk of the findings remain classified in separate reports from each of the five inspectors general , who represent the Justice Department , the N.S.A , the C.I.A. , the Defense Department and the Office of National Intelligence .
Image John
Yoo in 2001 issued an endorsement of warrantless wiretapping from the Justice Departments office of legal counsel .
Credit ... Susan Walsh / Associated Press
The inquiry included interviews with about 200 government and private - sector personnel , but a number of key players  including David Addington , a top aide to Mr. Cheney ; George J. Tenet , the former C.I.A. director ; John Ashcroft , the former attorney general ; and John Yoo , a Justice Department lawyer who endorsed the wiretapping program  declined to be interviewed .
Congressional Democrats who had been critics of the program said they found the report ’s conclusions disturbing .
“ While former Bush administration officials continue to argue that their policies made the country safer , ” said Senator Ron Wyden , Democrat of Oregon , “ I believe this report shows that their obsession with secrecy and their refusal to accept oversight was actually harmful to U.S. national security , not to mention the privacy rights of law - abiding Americans . ”
A statement from Dennis Blair , the current director of national intelligence , said he was committed to “ seeing that all surveillance activities protect U.S. national security and comply with the laws of the United States . ”
Among other findings , the report concluded that Alberto R. Gonzales , as attorney general , provided “ confusing , inaccurate ” statements about N.S.A. surveillance activities to lawmakers in 2007 , but did not “ intend to mislead Congress . ”
Mr. Gonzales had said that a dispute between the White House and Justice Department lawyers in 2004 did not relate to the wiretapping program but rather to “ other ” intelligence activities .
The report states that at the same time Mr. Bush authorized the warrantless wiretapping operation , he also signed off on other surveillance programs that the government has never publicly acknowledged .
While the report does not identify them , current and former officials say that those programs included data mining of e-mail messages of Americans .
That was apparently what Mr. Gonzales was referring to in his Congressional testimony .
OMG ... There 's something on the wing ... There 's something on the wing !!!

Sarah Palin is the bright red thread in the dull grey fabric of the Republican Party .
She is charismatic , quirky , melodramatic , and fervently anti-choice , anti-gay , and anti-Obama .
But there 's one thing she 'll never be — the GOP nominee for President in 2012 .
Palin has the most intense grassroots base of any potential candidate , in the true - believing core of the party .
And that 's worth quite a lot .
But in Congress and in state houses across the country , Republicans worry that she 's unelectable , and could take them down to defeat with her .
She says she may campaign for conservative Democrats next year ; she 'll have plenty of time since a host of Republican hopefuls have announced that they do n't want her help .
Why ?
Her stumbling exit from the Alaska governor 's office reinforced an all but indelible impression of incoherence and incompetence .
A new CBS poll shows that only 22 percent of Americans say Palin has the capacity to be president .
Only 33 percent of Republicans say she does .
This is even bleaker than the verdict rendered before the 2008 election , when an anemic 37 percent of voters thought Palin was up to the job .
As former Reagan speechmeister Peggy Noonan acidly observed in The Wall Street Journal , Palin makes Republicans look like the " stupid party . "
So Palin 's fundamental problem is n't the mainstream media , it 's the mainstream electorate .
Paradoxically , according to the CBS poll , many Americans see Palin as she sees herself — a victim of a media mauling .
But that 's largely a reaction to the blogosphere 's wave of unsubstantiated allegations about her family 's personal lives .
The penumbra of sympathy does n't extend to her qualifications for the presidency .
Her only chance for a doomed nomination is an insurgent campaign against the GOP establishment in a fractured field of candidates .
Barry Goldwater did it in 1964 .
The circumstances are even similar .
His legions , too , were fired by a sense of grievance against " sensation - seeking columnists and commentators , " a phrase that elicited a deafening roar from Goldwater 's convention floor .
The party establishment , convinced that the election was unwinnable anyway , ultimately resigned itself to defeat .
Palin could raise tens of millions of dollars from the grassroots .
But that wo n't be enough .
Even Obama needed a massive influx of high dollar contributions to compete successfully .
It 's nearly certain that the GOP 's big money poobahs wo n't fund a Palin race , not least because they fear that her nomination would decimate Republicans at every level .
And even if she somehow raised the money , Palin would be stymied by another obstacle .
Republicans nominate by primogeniture ; they pick the next person in line .
So it was with Nixon in 1968 , and later Reagan .
So it was with both Bushes , and with Bob Dole in between .
So it was with John McCain .
They were each front - runners who were supposed to get the nod .
Despite perilous moments in their primary campaigns — and a virtual collapse in McCain 's case — they all eventually did .
In presidential politics , Republicans are an orderly party ; they 're unlikely ever to be comfortable with the spontaneous , erratic performance of Sarah Palin .
They also have a nominee - in - waiting — Mitt Romney .
The religious right has grown accustomed to his Mormonism .
Some conservatives distrust his contorted conversion to their political creed , but who else have they got ?
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford and Nevada Sen. John Ensign have become casualties of concupiscence .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal flunked his audition .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty is uninspiring .
So is Romney perhaps , but he will be lavishly funded and he starts from the pole position .
Even if Republicans choose to go down a road of certain defeat , Newt Gingrich would be a more likely bet than Palin .
He is unacceptable to mainstream voters , but less so than Palin — and he 's significantly more acceptable to party leaders and fundraisers .
Conceivably , Palin could exploit the relative advantage of her low expectations .
What if she went on " Meet the Press " and turned in an able , if not stellar , performance ?
Some veterans of the McCain campaign say she 's all but unbriefable , but it seems worth a try .
Otherwise , she looks increasingly like a reincarnation of Dan Quayle .
Her image may already be stuck in amber — or Arctic ice — leaving her beyond the pale for the vast majority of voters .
She may rush onto the lucrative lecture circuit , make a run for 2012 , excite her base and excoriate the commentators .
I strongly favor her nomination .
But she 's not next in the Republican order , and she lacks the skill or discipline required to cut in line .
After all the noise and crowds — when the spotlights finally dim and this curious melodrama ends — Sarah Palin will be left with little more than northern exposure .
After all that federal aid , a resurgent Goldman Sachs is on course to dole out bonuses that could rival the record paydays of the heady bull - market years .
Goldman … announced that it had earmarked $ 11.4 billion so far this year to compensate its workers .
At that rate , Goldman employees could , on average , earn roughly $ 770,000 each this year .

We did it .
Bottom of the ninth , down by three , bases loaded , and we cranked another grand slam to the moon .
They may have shot Lennon , but nothing can kill the Beatles .
I admit things looked bleak for a minute there .
We had to convert to a bank holding company and were forced to accept a taxpayer bailout .
It felt un -American .
Terribly unbanksmanly .
But we accepted the money , knowing that we could magically weave it into a much larger mountain of money .
We had a few hard months there , did n’t we ?
They regulated our corporate jet so that we could no longer use it to fly from hole to hole on the green .
Dave had to drain his money pool to half capacity .
I stopped injecting gold into my blood .
They do n’t call it a recession for nothing .
One day , we ’ll look back on the year we received only five - figure bonuses and laugh .
Wanting to celebrate our renewed success is natural , but it ’s important that we do n’t go crazy here .
Remember , ten per cent of the non -bank country is unemployed , and even those who are working have “ real ” jobs , where payment is proportional to the creation of a “ product ” or a “ service . ”
Those poor bastards .
So I ask that , in celebrating our raping of the stock market , we show restraint in the following ways :
Please limit high - fives and chest bumps to a dozen a day .
Do n’t wear your crowns , except around the office .
Stop paying for things in Monopoly money — I understand it is the same as real money to us , but there have been some complaints .
For now , let ’s take down the giant scoreboard that reads “ Main Street : zero .
Wall Street : a billion gazillion bajillion . ”
Furthermore , to avoid drawing criticism from the press , this year the bonuses , expected to be comically large , will be distributed in blood diamonds , which can be easily concealed in a briefcase so it looks like we ’re working .
I ’d like to thank everyone who made this possible — for a second time .
Respect to President Obama for keeping us in the green .
Thanks to the big guy upstairs ( me ) .
And let ’s not forget all the ordinary Americans , who , for some unfathomable reason , have refused to put us behind bars .
We are literally taking money out of their wallets .
Seriously , with these returns we are making Madoff look like a little kid with his hand caught in the cookie jar .
Amateur !
Yours in money ,

WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The Treasury Department is scrapping plans to hire a cartoonist to lighten the mood of its employees who manage the nation 's $ 1.2 trillion debt , after a senator questioned its merits .
The cartoonist would have been hired by Treasury 's Bureau of Public Debt , which accounts for borrowed federal spending , at a time Congress is embroiled in a debate about increased government spending .
" Our training staff felt that at a time when employees are working extra hours , it might have been helpful , " said Kim Treat , a spokesman for the bureau .
But the effort was canceled because it had become " more of a distraction than an opportunity , " he said .
President Obama has launched his Class Warfare Health Policy Initiative .
Economists , many Caregivers , and non-Socialists are understandably aghast at the proposal to spend over a trillion dollars , tax the “ rich ” at 45 % , and let loose a system of bureaucracy - controlled health care services .
But we need to do more than yell “ NO ! ”
We need to acknowledge the problems that do exist ; propose solutions that address the problem ; and do so within a context that has broad political support from the ideological ' middle ' of the country .
With that in mind , I suggest the following parameters :
1 ) First , we must acknowledge that there * is* a problem in terms of affordable access to health care for many Americans .
With 10 % of the Labor Force out of work ( and youth , stay - at - home parents , part - time workers , the disabled , many immigrants and the homeless are NOT included in the figure ) , estimates range from 30 to 50 million Americans living without health insurance .
That means somewhere between 10 % and 15 % of Americans .
2 ) It has been demonstrated that those with a lack of access to health care delay treatment until their conditions require critical ( and far more costly ) attention .
This adds to the expenses Providers incur ( and often absorb ) and the strain on existing government programs ( and thus , increase cost to taxpayers ) .
3 ) We must agree that compassion and the political climate both dictate that a , “ hell , tough on them ! ” approach is not an acceptable response .
4 ) Having said that , the solutions must address the problem .
At my office ( an Academic institution ) , one often hears people singing the praises of a Single Payer System .
They frame the problem as the ' lack of a single payer system . '
However , this response falls apart when weighed rationally .
If 85 % of Americans had affordable access to supermarket food , and 15 % were lacking basic nutrition , we would never suggest that all 100 % of the country have access to free food at the supermarket , with the bill sent to The Government .
We all know intuitively that the result would be a run on food , a shortage of goods in the supermarket , wasted resources , and a broke country .
And yet , that is precisely what the Single Payer Cheerleaders want for health care .
If the problem is access for 15 % of Americans , than the solution is a way to find access for 15 % of Americans .
5 ) Insurance is both a blessing and a curse : it allows people to access health care ( the blessing ) , but also permits non-emergency situations to crowd hospitals and ER rooms with unncessary service , as consumers receive thousands of dollars worth of treatment for a small copay of $ 10 , $ 25 , or $ 50 .
True Health Care Reform must acknowledge objective , observable economic realities and not be bases on some hand - holding kumbaya approach to human nature .
6 ) The provision of care must be centered on the Doctor - Patient relationship , NOT on insurers ' profits or government bureaucracies “ one- sized - fits - all ” approach of form and process and procedure and approval .
7 ) We must acknowldge that the American health care system is the best in the world , bar none .
Those who point to Canada forget that there is not a single modern machine in Canada capable of removing kidney stones .
Those who trumpet Britain forget that Britain has closed 40 % of her hospital beds since the 1940 NHS was enacted .
Those who point to Scandinavia forget that it is the American doctors who win the Noebel prizes , the American researchers who have made all the modern major medical breakthroughs in the last century , and it is America that attracts doctors from all over the world .
So ..in a nutshell : we need a system that helps those without affordable access to gain that access , in a way that protects and enhances the doctor - patient relationship , lowers costs to consumers and providers , and continues to support a profitable – and successful – health industry .
With all of those as ' context , ' here are my 5 Proposals :
1 ) Permit community groups to form for the purpose of buying health insurance .
Sounds simple , is n't it ?
But it 's illegal .
Individuals can * not , * under existing law , form ' groups ' whose primary purpose is purchasing insurance .
( Groups may form for business or fraternalh purposes , and then choose to buy insurance as an incidental benefit , but they can not form for no other reason than to buy insurance ) .
End this prohibition , let the market dictate rates , let competition ensue , and there will be no need for a Federal Government - related Insurance Bureaucracy .
Take it one step further : end State Monopolies on insurers .
The Federal Government ( not States ) has the authority to regulate Interstate Commerce , and since people may have an accident * anywhere * and request their insurer to cover it , this is clearly federal jurisdiction .
Blow open the lid on Insurer Competition .
2 ) Enact Tort and Medical Malpractice Reform NOW .
It was reported 5 years ago that an OB - GYN doctor in Massachusetts has to deliver EIGHTY - FIVE babies just to cover his malpractice insurance premiums for a year .
Worse , 5 % of doctors are responsible for 95 % of malpractice claims , raising all doctor 's and hopistal 's premiums .
Limit Malpractice Awards , raise the negligence standards ( so hospitals dont need to run unnecessary tests ) , and relieve the 95 % of decent doctors from paying the premiums of the 5 % convicted of malpractice .
3 ) Eliminate the FDA 's requirements that drugs be safe AND EFFICACIOUS .
Currently , the FDA requires that pharmaceutical companies prove that their drugs meet two tests : they must prove safe , and they must be ' efficacious , ' that is , they must be proven to cure the condition they claim to address in virtually 100 % of patients .
This is a costly and unnecessary test :
Many people react differntly to different substances .
The Peanut Butter that fed me through high school will kill someone with an allergy .
Let * Doctors * decide what to prescribe , with the understanding that the idiosyncracies of individuals means that results WILL be different with different drugs .
A drug that doesnt work , will not be prescribed .
On the other hand , if a doctor determines that medical marajuana is more efficacious and cost - effective than morphine , so be it .
Eliminate tiered coverage that allows Insurers to cease to cover necessary , but expensive , pharmaceuticals .
4 ) Engage in Multi-national agreements with other nations to accept their pharmaceuticals .
The refusal of the US FDA to permit the importation of Canadian pharmaceuticals is insane .
An individual can come to the US from France , or Britain , or Mali , or India , and providing only a driver 's license from their own nation , get behind the wheel of a 6,000 pound rental car and take off minutes after landing – even if they do n't speak English or have never driven on the right side of the road .
And yet , if a pharmaceutical company goes through hundreds of thousands of tests in Germany , or Britain , or Canada , the results are not considered ' valid ' in the US .
Now , realistically , which is more dangerous : the driver , or a drug produced in Canada ?
5 ) Permit every American to have a Medical Savings Account .
Currently , Government workers and some self - employed people can utilize a Medical Savings Account which permits them to cover medical costs using a credit - card - like card .
These citizens have a certain amount of money deducted from their paychecks , and go into an account for medical expenses : prescription drugs , eyeglasses , dental work , and even over the counter remedies .
These deductions are pre-tax , meaning it lowers the person 's gross income , lowering their tax and even possibly dropping them into a lower tax bracket .
Better yet , these workers can ' borrow ' against future deductions if they incur expenses early in the year at no interest expense .
If government workers are allowed these accounts , why not ALL Americans ?
These proposals will not solve all of our problems , but they will go a long way to providing access for those who do not have it , lowering costs for everybody , and enhancing the doctor - patient relationship .
The very best American media companies are being used as propaganda mouthpieces for fossil fuel lobbyists and big oil companies .
I love The New York Times .
I grew up reading The New Yorker magazine .
I always digg the Harpers index .
I think National Geographic is pretty much the coolest club on the planet .
But I wo n’t be reading any of these fine publications until they stop taking money from lobbyists and PR firms that are determined to thwart necessary reforms of American energy policy .
The sad truth is that the finest American newspapers and magazines are serving as disinformation platforms for a massive social media campaign being launched by an energy industry that is refusing to change its destructive ways .
This onslaught of cutting - edge , highly funded fossil - fuel propaganda campaigns are more dangerous to our health than tobacco ads , and have no place masquerading as well - intentioned information on the websites of our magazines and newspapers .
The Evil of Greenwashing
When I saw greenwashing ads for Chevron in The New Yorker I smelled hypocrisy .
How could the magazine that publishes Elizabeth Kolbert ’s devastating reports on climate change allow itself to be sponsored by one of the most heinous and destructive energy companies in the world today ?
When I saw banners for “ Clean Coal : America ’s Power ” on The New York Times website I was sickened .
Coal is not clean .
Coal smoke is choking us .
Wrapping filth in the American flag is an insult to every citizen who loves this country .
The claim that coal is “ cheap ” power becomes very false very fast as soon as health care costs are taken into account .
Explore sustainability with Shell and Harpers ?
As a friend put it , that ’s like saying “ learn more about diversity !
Contribute to the KKK ! ” .
But the final straw came today , when I visited The New York Times opinion page and saw a banner ad promising “ The Truth ” about the Canadian tar sands .
Let ’s get one thing clear : the massive tar sand projects in Canada are fueling climate change and causing vast ecological destruction .
Thanks to wonderful journalism from sources like the Times , we know just how much we stand to lose if climate change is left unchecked .
Opposing the expansion of the tar sand projects is a life or death issue , not just for the cancer victims of Alberta , but for all Creation .
Editorial Separation
Apologists will argue that big media companies maintain a wall between editorial and advertising .
That is no excuse .
In the age of new media , common sense morals are more important than a self - righteous blind - eye .
How can anyone trust an institution that purports to give us the truth about important world issues , but is sponsored by harmful propagandists ?
The big energy companies are mounting a sophisticated propaganda and disinformation campaign .
They are pouring money into online media projects .
We need to fight back .
Boycotts and Counter Attacks
Sorry , Nick Kristof .
Sorry , Gail Collins .
Tom Friedman – how big is YOUR carbon foodprint ?
As much as I love the Times , I ’m going to get my news elsewhere for a while .
I encourage you to do likewise .
Here are some good alternatives :
Global Voices Online
The Pulitzer Center
IPS News
Google News
Additionally , in the face of the massive energy lobbyist PR campaign , it ’s imperative that all of us work overtime to counter the faux - patriotic green - washing of the energy industry .
The energy reform challenge is as imperative as the civil rights struggle was in the days of Martin Luther King .
Call them out .
Expose the false arguments .
Look beyond the carefully market - tested messages .
If you know someone who buys into the fossil fuel lobby ’s misleading claims , sit them down for a serious talk .
Be the change you want to see in the world .
Ask why the places where fossil fuel is central to the economy – like West Virginia – are the poorest and unhealthiest places in America .
Ask why places where the fossil fuel lobby is effectively countered by informed citizens – like Vermont – boast healthy populations and strong local economies .
Our future depends on our willingness to reform our energy policy .
Big oil companies and their big media collaborators are standing in the way with billions of dollars on their side , but the truth needs no ally .

Today I have a good post for you !
I recently decided to make Ubuntu 9.04 64 bit edition my operating system for my work computer .
I figured why not , the dual monitors thing works pretty good in Jaunty Jackelope without too much finagling .
So I go ahead and install it .
Now I am finally using a 64 bit operating system for work !
So what 's the problem ?
Well , on my Windows XP installation I had Adobe Air installed so I could use my favorite Twitter client Twhirl .
The problem is that Adobe air is n't really made for 64 bit operating systems quite yet , so i had to install some dependencies .
Here comes yet another problem .
Most of the tutorials I found mentioned getting the getlibs - all.deb package from a site called boundlesssupremacy.com , but it looks like that site is gone now .
I did finally find it though which is good news for you !
Also , in some of the tutorials , they talk about some other dependencies you need .
I decided to put them all in a nice script for easy installation !
Follow these simple instructions and you 'll have Adobe Air running on Ubuntu 9.04 64 bit in no time !
After that you are done , and you should be able to install and run your Adobe Air programs like Twhirl and Tweedeck without issues .
Are you using Ubuntu 9.04 64 Bit ?
What applications are you having problems with ?
Got any tips or suggestions ?
Perhaps some blog posts of your own ?

With over 250 million users , Facebook is a social networking behemoth .
The site is host to thousands of celebrity fan pages and has been taking steps to make these more appealing to self - promoters .
On Saturday Bill Gates revealed that he 's not a Facebook user , and many other famous names are notably absent from the site .
Which leads us to wonder ... what might those pages look like ?
Fortunately , some of the web 's most creative minds had the exact same thought , and below we bring you the very best fake Facebook pages .
Click through to the sites to see the pages in full size and quality .
In April , Slate came up with a highly original way to recap Barack Obama 's first 100 days in office : a parody Facebook feed marking the key events .
For those who remember that far back , the creation offers a light - hearted take on the course of the Administration .
This one goes way back ... to a posting on a satire blog in December 2007 .
Banterist ( aka humorist Brian Sack ) imagined what it might have been like if Hitler had a news feed .
Bizarrely , the concept of Hitler posting funny videos and playing Scrabulous is more amusing that the parody of real world events .
From a taunt directed at Bill Gates to his friendship with " Every Celebrity in Hollywood " , PC World took a friendly poke at Apple 's Steve Jobs , with plenty of zingers thrown in .
Back in November 2008 , comedy site College Humor turned Genesis into a Facebook feed , with hilarious results .
The re-telling of the creation story is good - naturedly irreverent and is sure to serve up a few chuckles .
From a provocative friend 's list to the subtle use of " the number of the beast " , PC World outdid themselves with this fictional Facebook page for the Antichrist himself .
Recommended Facebook Fakers
Still not gotten your fill of Facebook fakes ?
There are many more great Facebook page parodies that did n't make the list :
1. PC World 's " Facebook Pages We 'd Like to See " - You 'll notice two of the above images are from PC World .
That 's because , as we discovered today , PC World created a set of 9 hilarious " fake Facebooks " for April Fools Day 2009 .
Those not highlighted here include Elvis , William Shakespeare and Andy Warhol .
2 . Jesus ' Facebook Page - What if Jesus used Facebook ?
This irreverent parody - of unknown origin - attempts to imagine what might have been .
3 . Facebook Passover -
We 're unsure what to make of this , a retelling of the story of the Jews ' Exodus from Egypt .... all in Facebook updates .
Alas , we do n't know this creation 's origin either .
Are there any other faux Facebook pages we might have missed ?

" To restore confidence , you need total disclosure of possible losses , " said Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the IMF 's managing director .
" Not only losses which are linked to the original sub - prime crisis , but also the losses linked to the slowdown in the economy , and impaired assets .
There are lots of things that still have to be disclosed , " he said , adding that credit mechanism remained jammed .
Access Copyright , the Canadian author 's collecting society ( a group that collects money from libraries for book lending and gives it to authors ) is using its members ' money to sabotage an enormously popular consultation on the future of Canadian copyright .
Previous to this consultation , the Canadian government twice tried to ram through restrictive , US - style copyright rules , refusing to meet with Canadian creators , net - users , libraries , educators , publishers or musicians .
Now , after hundreds of thousands of Canadians came forward demanding public consultations and a balanced , made - in - Canada answer to copyright in the information age , Access Copyright has responded with an hysterical , dishonest call to its members to condemn the consultation and any notion of protecting privacy , access , fair dealing and other public rights in copyright .
The broadside includes this remarkable condemnation of " users " of information — that is , readers , writers , teachers , scholars , fans , government , students —
" It 's a simple fact that users outnumber us .
But Canadian users involved
in the online debate are so adept at leveraging the Internet and social
networks to their advantage , there 's a danger that your voices as
Canadian creators and publishers will be drowned out by the chatter .
Your interests need to be expressed as forcefully as possible , and it's
up to you to get involved to make that happen . "
These are the same people who launched the ill - starred " Captain Copyright " campaign , using writers ' money to produce embarrassing , half - witted comic books that were meant to indoctrinate children , inculcating them with fear of using authors ' works in their own creations .
After the Captain Copyright fiasco , it seemed that Access Copyright would settle down and look at a balanced approach .
But recent times have seen an upswing in loony , toxic copyright maximalism from the organization , including a recent bid to collect money for out - of - copyright public domain materials .
As Michael Geist says , " So AC claims that the public is trying to deprive them of their livelihood , while they actually try to get the public to support their livelihood by charging for things that does n't even belong in their repertoire .
Hard to believe that users are now characterized as powerful and adept at controlling the debate .
All the more reason to encourage people to use Speakoutoncopyright.ca and make their voice heard . "
As a Canadian author , Access Copyright is supposed to represent my interests in the Canadian copyright debate .
Instead , they are setting out to undermine the first glimmer of sanity in Canadian copyright policy in three governments — and using my money to do it .
For shame .
Copyright Debate Takes Aim at Your Livelihood
The Recording Industry Association of America on Monday demanded a federal judge order Harvard University 's Charles Nesson to remove from the internet " unauthorized and illegal recordings " of pretrial hearings and depositions in a file - sharing lawsuit headed to trial .
" Enough is enough .
For the past five months , this court has repeatedly warned defense counsel regarding his insistence on engaging unauthorized and illegal recordings of counsel and proceedings in this case , " RIAA attorney Daniel Cloherty wrote ( .pdf ) U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner of Massachusetts .
Cloherty urged the court to sanction Nesson , the founder of the 12 - year - old Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University .
" The idea that a court is being asked by them to order educational material to be removed from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society website seems a questionable intrusion both on my liberty and the public interest , " said Nesson in a telephone interview .
" I certainly do n't agree that I am violating any law . "
The case concerns former Boston University student Joel Tenenbaum , who Nesson is defending in an RIAA civil lawsuit accusing him of file - sharing copyrighted music .
Jury selection is scheduled in three weeks , in what is shaping up to be the RIAA 's second of about 30,000 cases against individuals to reach trial .
The labels , represented by the RIAA , on Monday cited a series of examples in which they accuse Nesson of violating court orders and privacy laws by posting audio to his blog or to the Berkman site .
Among them , they include :
In a 2008 deposition of his client , " a surreptitious recording , " that included " confidential communications between the attorneys involved in the case . "
A January telephone conversation between the judge and RIAA lawyers " without the prior consent of participants . "
The July 1 deposition of defense copyright expert John Palfrey , which Nesson was also simultaneously twittering .
The July 2 - 3 deposition of defense peer - to - peer expert Johan Pouwelse , which Nesson is accused of videotaping .
Judge Gertner , in February , issued an order in response to RIAA complaints about unauthorized recordings .
" The parties are advised that any such recording without permission of participants , as well as the broadcast of such communications , runs afoul " ( pdf ) of state law .
On June 16 , Gertner said such taping was a " violation of the law . "
Still , Nesson took Monday 's court filing in stride .
At one point , he said he had been " unaware " of the Massachusetts law requiring all parties of a communication consent to its recording .
" I have to say I was completely unaware of this Massachusetts law .
When I dug into this thing , I am amazed to what it purports to be , " said Nesson , who is defending the Tenenbaum case for free .
He labeled as " gobbledygook " the felony privacy law that is punishable by up to five years in prison .
" That is so outrageously unconstitutional that I would prefer myself to honor the United States Constitution and take my chances that recording a conversation with a judge in a federal case and opposing lawyers is somehow in violation of a Massachusetts statute that makes me a felon , " Nesson said .
Nesson , who has attempted but so far failed to get the upcoming trial and pretrial proceedings webcast , said the lawsuit 's proceedings should be in the public domain .
" I 'm opening it up , " he said .
" That 's what I founded the Berkman Center to fight for . "

Click to viewYou just shelled out a bucketful of clams for your new MacBook and you want to protect your investment .
What if a sticky - fingered thief eyes your hot new lappie at the coffee shop ?
It 's easy to add a security system to your MacBook that 'll help you ID would - be robbers .
Advertisement
With freeware app iAlertU and some Applescript magic , your MacBook can snag a photo of the thieving scoundrel and upload it to your FTP server automatically .
Here 's how .
Advertisement
NOTE : iAlertU requires an iSight camera and the motion sensing features built in to Apple 's MacBooks and MacBook Pros , so you 'd need one of those two computers for this to work correctly .
Also , keep in mind that this method is far from foolproof .
This wo n't necessarily save your Mac from being stolen , but hey - it 's cool , and it certainly * could * help get your stolen Mac back .
i AlertU -
The car alarm for your Mac
In case you missed our original post , iAlertU is a snazzy app that works as an alarm system for your MacBook .
After you arm iAlertU with the Apple remote , the alarm will go off if anyone tries to type , mouse , unplug , or power off your computer .
When the alarm goes off , iAlertU also snaps a picture of ( hopefully ) the potential thief and saves the image in your home directory ( you'd be surprised how well it actually works - the photo it saves is generally from a few seconds before the alarm goes off , so attempts to avoid being caught by the camera do n't generally work ) .
Here 's the original video of iAlertU in action :
The problem with iAlertU is that it 's really just a noisy deterrent - the hope being that the loud , flashing alarm will scare of would - be burglars .
But what happens if the thief is n't so easily scared ?
Your laptop will have a picture of the thief on it , but it 's not doing you any good .
So I 've put together a couple of Applescripts that will upload iAlertU 's capture to an FTP server using Transmit .
Below I 've put together a very short video to give you an idea of what the Applescripts do :
Here 's how it works :
Set up Transmit
If you 've got Transmit ( a Mac FTP app that we simply love here at LH headquarters ) , open it up .
If you do n't have it , well , you might want to consider getting it .
Transmit superior FTP Version 3 of the Transmit Mac FTP client is now on sale .
Features include tabbed connections , … Read more

The first thing you want to do is set up a favorite in Transmit .
To do so , go to the Favorites tab and hit the plus sign (+ ) to add a new favorite .
Enter your FTP info and you 're good to go .
Next , go to the Transfers tab of the Transmit preferences .
Where it says " When an item already exists ... " , change the Uploading files option to " Replace the existing file " .
This is n't necessary , so if you do n't want to overwrite files by default , do n't change this setting .
You just want to make sure that when it matters , your image capture will be uploaded to the FTP server .

Folder monitors and auto-FTP
So , now that you 've got your favorite all set up in Transmit , it 's time to set up the first Applescript , which uses a handy Mac OS X feature called Folder Actions .
In our case , we 're setting a monitor that watches your home directory and activates a script to upload the iAlertU picture if it appears in the folder .
Here 's how :
Advertisement
Download the iAlertU FTP script / Library / Scripts / Folder Action Scripts .
Advertisement
Turn on Folder actions ( if they 're not already enabled ) .
To do so , go to Applications -> Applescript -> Folder Actions Setup , and click the checkbox labeled Enable Folder Actions .
Next , click on the plus sign (+ ) to add the to - be - monitored folder , in this case your home folder .
Now click the plus sign (+ ) on the script side .
You should see a menu listing several Folder Actions scripts , including the script you just downloaded .
Double click the iAlertU FTP script .
The last thing you need to do is create a folder in your home directory called alert .
This will come in handy for the next section .

You 're all set .
Now , as soon as iAlertU 's alarm goes off , it 'll snap a picture .
The picture will go into your home folder , which will fire off the Applescript , uploading the image to your FTP server .
When the image is uploaded , it is moved to the alert folder so that we know it was uploaded successfully .
To give you an idea of the amount of time this takes , from alarm to completed upload normally takes about 15 seconds ( in the video it only took around 12 ) , which is pretty good .
However , if the thief gets you computer turned off before the upload can complete , this script wo n't work .
That 's why we head to the second tier of the iAlert FTP upload .
Advertisement
Upload iAlertU image on startup
The next Applescript will check the home folder for the iAlertU picture on startup , and , if it 's there , upload it to the server .
This way , even if the thief gets your computer home , you 've still got a good chance of getting the iAlertU picture as long as he connects to the internet eventually .
Advertisement
Download the Upload image on startup script
Advertisement
Again , open the Applescript file and edit the config section to match your settings .
After you 've set up the Applescript , you need to save it as an application .
Go to File ->
Save as ... , change the File Format to application , and uncheck the Startup Screen option .
Click save .
Finally , go to your Accounts settings in the preferences .
In the Login Items tab , add your new upload image on startup.app to the list of startup items .
Advertisement
Now , if the iAlertU image was not uploaded the first ( or subsequent times ) , it will continue to try and upload the image every time the computer starts up until it 's successful .
When it is successful , the image will be moved to the alert folder and the Applescript will no longer attempt to upload it to the server .
This method could definitely be tweaked if anyone out there knows more than me and feels like putting in the time , but as - is it 's a pretty good method for bolstering , if not your theft protection , your vigilante justice prospects .

THIS has been a banner week for the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama ( whose birth certificate can be seen on the right ) was not born in the United States , with CNN 's pugnacious host Lou Dobbs doing a lot of the promotion .
Again and again , on his radio show and on his TV show , Mr Dobbs suggested that the jury was out on whether Mr Obama was born in Hawaii in 1961 .
Today , the one - man crusade ended with an email from Jon Klein , CNN / US 's president , informing producers to knock it off .
" I asked the political researchers to dig into the question ' why could n't Obama produce the ORIGINAL birth certificate ? ' " wrote Mr Klein .
He handed over all of their research and added
It seems to definitively answer the question .
Since the show 's mission is for Lou to be the explainer and enlightener , he should be sure to cite this during your segment tonite .
And then it seems this story is dead — because anyone who still is not convinced does n't really have a legitimate beef .
This is actually an insight into how conspiracy theories work .
They feed off of the conventions of journalism and the legal system .
A year ago , when the first sceptics scratched their head about where Mr Obama was born , CNN 's producers investigated it .
At the same time , John McCain 's lawyers investigated it .
They found out that Mr Obama was born in Hawaii , but they did n't rush to report it , because , well , it was n't news .
To conspiracy theorists , however , the fact that no one answered their questions in public meant that the questions were unanswerable .
Lawsuits against Mr Obama on this issue have fallen flat because they 've been frivolous ; the conspiracy theorists call that evidence that no one can answer their concerns .
Eventually , we ( and by we I mean you ) are going to get our chance to take down Arthas .
Selfishly , I wish it could be a 5 - man instance because I will never have the time or desire to gear up through raiding for the purpose of participating in the 10 or 25 - man that will feature Arthas ’ demise .
But , make no mistake ; it ’s coming .
And , as you know , there is n’t anybody in the Warcraft universe that wants Arthas more than Sylvanas Windrunner .
Sure , there are millions who want him taken down – from beings like Kil ’ jaeden all the way down to some lowly peasants whose families either became Scourge or were killed by them .
Sylvanas burns for revenge and I think it would be a bit of a slap in the face to her if she is n’t directly involved in his tortuous demise .
Sylvanas would never give someone a quest to go snap Arthas ’ neck .
No , she would want to do that with her own cold hands .
The least Blizzard could do is allow for the raid party to get Arthas down to 1 % and then , after somehow being delayed , Sylvanas strolls in and shoots an arrow right between the eyes .
Or , more likely , she drags him off to Undercity where she can make him suffer before killing him .
What do you think ?
Will Blizzard shut Sylvanas out of the Arthas raid ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Job seekers looking for six - figure salaries during the recession are often so worried about their prospects that they ruin their chances with silly mistakes , according to a new survey .
People walk in line to register for the 2009 CUNY Big Apple Job Fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York , March 20 , 2009 .

“ Particularly in a downturn , people lose their bearings and can get very anxious and as a result can make rookie mistakes , ” said Marc Cenedella , chief executive of TheLadders.com , which caters to the job market for those earning $ 100,000 or more a year and more .
The top mistake candidates for higher - income jobs made was inadequately preparing for an interview , with 44 percent of recruiters naming it as the biggest interview error , the survey of 500 executive recruiters found .
It was conducted from April 8 to April 23 .
Weak resumes , being too desperate and willing to take any job offered were close behind , with 43 percent of recruiters naming them as the biggest mistake .
“ People can get very frustrated and very anxious and very upset about it and as a result behave in ways that make them look desperate , ” Cenedella said .
He added that some fearful job seekers adopted a false machismo that cast their candidacies in a poor light .
Thirty - five percent of recruiters found that candidates being overly aggressive was also a mistake , the survey found .
Other mistakes included failure to follow up after the initial contact or interview , selling oneself short on salary , conducting an unfocused job search , and not sending a thank you note after an interview .
The anxiety that many job applicants feel is warranted by the difficult job market in the recession , Cenedella said .
The number of open jobs paying upward of $ 100,000 per year will fall 20 percent in 2009 , to 3.2 million openings from about 4 million openings , TheLadders.com estimates .
And the average job hunt during the downturn is likely to take about eight to nine months rather than the five to six months it would take otherwise , Cenedella said .
To land a job in the tougher environment , candidates can take several steps : have their resume professionally written ; apply for fewer but more appropriate jobs ; and be persistent , calling the potential employer once a week for five weeks after the interview to express interest , he added .
While we wait for Chrysler to emerge , hopefully leaner but not that much lighter , from its bankruptcy — perhaps with some fashionable Italian loafers and a rejuvenated Dolce & Gabbana wardrobe — TheCarConnection.com started thinking about the company ’s product missteps in recent years .
No , not the Dodge St. Regis or the TC by Maserati ( shhhhh ! ) , but the very recent past .
What ’s gone wrong — this time — from a product perspective ?
Here are five of them :
2009 Chrysler Sebring
Chrysler Sebring : No contest here .
The Sebring sedan , along with its Dodge Avenger sibling and its Sebring Convertible variant , were somehow a step behind the instant they arrived , beginning for 2007 .
These models have been almost universally panned by reviewers — mostly for being behind the curve in performance and lacking in interior quality — and they have a lackluster repair record to boot , with Consumer Reports rating the Sebring the worst in reliability , of all the models surveyed , in 2008 , with lots of recalls affecting its rollout as well .
This is a huge , bread - and - butter , money - making segment that hosts the Honda Accord , Toyota Camry , Nissan Altima , Ford Fusion , and Chevrolet Malibu ; Chrysler clearly cut corners on the Sebring and placed its wagers on some admittedly innovative features for the options list but skimped on interior materials and cabin quality , with noise and vibration , to some , a step backward .
The name change for the Dodge sedan , from the benign Stratus to the renaissance - fair - worthy Avenger , probably did n’t help either .
2007 Dodge Nitro
Dodge Nitro :
Nowhere does the term half - baked apply so well as with Jeep ’s Nitro .
Closely related to the Jeep Liberty , an off - road capable vehicle with niche appeal , the smallish Nitro is a truck - based SUV that ’s not intended for off - roading .
The Nitro was brought to market at the same time as GM , among other companies , was admitting that there was n’t a future for mid-size truck - based SUVs , gobbling up product development and marketing money that could have been used for more fully realized vehicles .
Factor in the 15 - mpg city rating , 3,500 - pound tow rating ( the same as many car - based crossovers ) , and the unimpressive performance that TheCarConnection.com has noted firsthand , and you have to wonder where the Nitro is coming from .
2008 Dodge Caliber SE
Dodge Caliber :
When gas hit $ 4 a gallon last summer and shoppers — still flush with jobs , real - estate money , and credit to spare — went to the dealership , many were disappointed to find that Dodge dealerships did n’t have any vehicles that topped 30 mpg .
The Dodge Caliber , which gets ratings in the low - to mid-20s in its most popular variants — despite a roomy interior and some trick features like tailgate speakers and a cooler box — just does n’t have the fuel economy or even the refinement of rival models .
Dealerships were caught like deer in headlights , lacking fuel - efficient small cars at a critical time when shoppers were flocking to more fuel - efficient cars like the Honda Fit , Toyota Yaris , and Ford Focus — and GM had even rolled out a 37 - mpg ( highway ) version of its Chevy Cobalt , the XFE .
The Caliber just was n’t frugal enough for most shoppers and Chrysler lost out at a critical time .
2008 Chrysler Pacifica Touring
Chrysler Pacifica :
The Pacifica was a likable , well - designed family vehicle , its success ruined by ill - conceived marketing and a glitchy product rollout .
With a roomy , attractive interior that combined Chrysler ’s minivan seating expertise with a welcome upscale ambiance from then - parent company DaimlerChrysler , the Pacifica was a large , comfortable , and luxurious crossover vehicle that was even a little ahead of its time in 2003 ; it might still even today match up reasonably well versus GM ’s full - sizers like the Buick Enclave .
But everything else went wrong .
Initially the Pacifica suffered from quality flaws , and it was at first priced too high , forcing Chrysler later to drop prices ( and send resale values into freefall ) .
In the end , Pacificas were benchwarming on dealer lots , some sold at a $ 10,000 discount .
Dodge Challenger : Okay , this one ’s going to be controversial , we know — even within TheCarConnection.com .
But this editor feels that the Challenger just sends out the wrong message for a company with a very checkered past .
The Challenger might fire up all the right nostalgia cues for some of the older Boomers looking to put on some deep - tinted sunglasses and relive that special window of opportunity in the ‘ 60s or early ‘ 70 s — or for a younger set perhaps a Dukes of Hazzard episode — but those times are long , long past , and the number of those people with 401Ks and pension money to spare has dwindled .
By making the Challenger so retro , as opposed to the more modern feel of the revived Chevy Camaro , the end product somehow feels like an aging geezer who ’s trying desperately to keep his high - school haircut — and shunning the very engineering mindset that set Chrysler apart from the rest of Detroit leading up to the original muscle cars .
PHOENIX ( AP )  Arizonans with concealed weapons permits will be allowed to take a handgun into bars and restaurants that serve alcohol under a bill signed Monday by Gov. Jan Brewer .
The measure , backed by the National Rifle Association , will require bar and restaurant owners who want to ban weapons on the premises to post a no - guns sign next to the business ' liquor license .
Drinking while carrying a weapon would be illegal .
Before a compromise reached late in the Legislature 's regular session , the measure pitted powerful groups representing gun and bar owners against each other .
Opponents have said mixing guns and alcohol produces a dangerous combination that could cause violence .
Supporters said people should be able to protect themselves at businesses that serve alcohol .
Supporters also said it was risky to leave guns in parked vehicles .
The bill originally only applied to establishments with kitchens , but it was expanded to include bars .
Another change was to move the location for posting a no - guns notice , which originally was to have been next to the main entrance .
Some bar owners had worried about uncertainty over which entrance would be considered the main entrance .
A lobbyist for the Arizona Licensed Beverage Association , which opposed the original bill , said the amended version created clear , uniform and enforceable rules .
" It 's going to happen one way or another , and this was the best version we 've seen , " ALBA lobbyist Don Isaacson said after the bill was revised last month .
It 's already legal to carry a gun into a store that sells alcohol for consumption elsewhere .
It would be a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $ 500 to carry a gun into an establishment with a no - guns notice posted .
The law , however , includes a partial legal defense for a person carrying a concealed weapon within an establishment banning guns .
It would apply if the sign had fallen down , the person was n't an Arizona resident and the notice was first posted less than a month earlier .

Radiocarbon dating can easily establish that humans have been on the earth for over twenty thousand years , at least twice as long as creationists are willing to allow .
Therefore it should come as no surprise that creationists at the Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) have been trying desperately to discredit this method for years .
They have their work cut out for them , however , because radiocarbon ( C - 14 ) dating is one of the most reliable of all the radiometric dating methods .
This article will answer several of the most common creationist attacks on carbon - 14 dating , using the question - answer format that has proved so useful to lecturers and debaters .
Question :
How does carbon - 14 dating work ?
Answer : Cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere are constantly converting the isotope nitrogen - 14 ( N - 14 ) into carbon - 14 ( C - 14 or radiocarbon ) .
Living organisms are constantly incorporating this C - 14 into their bodies along with other carbon isotopes .
When the organisms die , they stop incorporating new C - 14 , and the old C - 14 starts to decay back into N - 14 by emitting beta particles .
The older an organism 's remains are , the less beta radiation it emits because its C - 14 is steadily dwindling at a predictable rate .
So , if we measure the rate of beta decay in an organic sample , we can calculate how old the sample is .
C - 14 decays with a half - life of 5,730 years .
Question : Kieth and Anderson radiocarbon - dated the shell of a living freshwater mussel and obtained an age of over two thousand years .
ICR creationists claim that this discredits C - 14 dating .
How do you reply ?
Answer :
It does discredit the C - 14 dating of freshwater mussels , but that 's about all .
Kieth and Anderson show considerable evidence that the mussels acquired much of their carbon from the limestone of the waters they lived in and from some very old humus as well .
Carbon from these sources is very low in C - 14 because these sources are so old and have not been mixed with fresh carbon from
- page 24 -
the air .
Thus , a freshly killed mussel has far less C - 14 than a freshly killed something else , which is why the C - 14 dating method makes freshwater mussels seem older than they really are .
When dating wood there is no such problem because wood gets its carbon straight from the air , complete with a full dose of C - 14 .
The creationists who quote Kieth and Anderson never tell you this , however .
Question : A sample that is more than fifty thousand years old should n't have any measurable C - 14 .
Coal , oil , and natural gas are supposed to be millions of years old ; yet creationists say that some of them contain measurable amounts of C - 14 , enough to give them C - 14 ages in the tens of thousands of years .
How do you explain this ?
Answer : Very simply .
Radiocarbon dating does n't work well on objects much older than twenty thousand years , because such objects have so little C - 14 left that their beta radiation is swamped out by the background radiation of cosmic rays and potassium - 40 ( K - 40 ) decay .
Younger objects can easily be dated , because they still emit plenty of beta radiation , enough to be measured after the background radiation has been subtracted out of the total beta radiation .
However , in either case , the background beta radiation has to be compensated for , and , in the older objects , the amount of C - 14 they have left is less than the margin of error in measuring background radiation .
As Hurley points out :
Without rather special developmental work , it is not generally practicable to measure ages in excess of about twenty thousand years , because the radioactivity of the carbon becomes so slight that it is difficult to get an accurate measurement above background radiation .
( p. 108 )
Cosmic rays form beta radiation all the time ; this is the radiation that turns N - 14 to C - 14 in the first place .
K - 40 decay also forms plenty of beta radiation .
Stearns , Carroll , and Clark point out that " . . . this isotope [ K - 40 ] accounts for a large part of the normal background radiation that can be detected on the earth 's surface " ( p. 84 ) .
This radiation cannot be totally eliminated from the laboratory , so one could probably get a " radiocarbon " date of fifty thousand years from a pure carbon - free piece of tin .
However , you now know why this fact does n't at all invalidate radiocarbon dates of objects younger than twenty thousand years and is certainly no evidence for the notion that coals and oils might be no older than fifty thousand years .
Question : Creationists such as Cook ( 1966 ) claim that cosmic radiation is now forming C - 14 in the atmosphere about one and one - third times faster than it is decaying .
If we extrapolate backwards in time with the proper equations , we find that the earlier the historical period , the less C - 14 the atmosphere had .
If we extrapolate
- page 25 -
as far back as ten thousand years ago , we find the atmosphere would not have had any C - 14 in it at all .
If they are right , this means all C - 14 ages greater than two or three thousand years need to be lowered drastically and that the earth can be no older than ten thousand years .
How do you reply ?
Answer :
Yes ,
Cook is right that C - 14 is forming today faster than it 's decaying .
However , the amount of C - 14 has not been rising steadily as Cook maintains ; instead , it has fluctuated up and down over the past ten thousand years .
How do we know this ?
From radiocarbon dates taken from bristlecone pines .
There are two ways of dating wood from bristlecone pines : one can count rings or one can radiocarbon - date the wood .
Since the tree ring counts have reliably dated some specimens of wood all the way back to 6200 BC , one can check out the C - 14 dates against the tree - ring - count dates .
Admittedly , this old wood comes from trees that have been dead for hundreds of years , but you do n't have to have an 8,200 - year - old bristlecone pine tree alive today to validly determine that sort of date .
It is easy to correlate the inner rings of a younger living tree with the outer rings of an older dead tree .
The correlation is possible because , in the Southwest region of the United States , the widths of tree rings vary from year to year with the rainfall , and trees all over the Southwest have the same pattern of variations .
When experts compare the tree-ring dates with the C - 14 dates , they find that radiocarbon ages before 1000 BC are really too young — not too old as Cook maintains .
For example , pieces of wood that date at about 6200 BC by tree - ring counts date at only 5400 BC by regular C - 14 dating and 3900 BC by Cook 's creationist revision of C - 14 dating ( as we see in the article , " Dating , Relative and Absolute , " in the Encyclopaedia Britannica ) .
So , despite creationist claims , C - 14 before three thousand years ago was decaying faster than it was being formed and C - 14 dating errs on the side of making objects from before 1000 BC look too young , not too old .
Question :
But do n't trees sometimes produce more than one growth ring per year ?
Would n't that spoil the tree -ring count ?
Answer :
If anything , the tree -ring sequence suffers far more from missing rings than from double rings .
This means that the tree - ring dates would be slightly too young , not too old .
Of course , some species of tree tend to produce two or more growth rings per year .
But other species produce scarcely any extra rings .
Most of the tree-ring sequence is based on the bristlecone pine .
This tree rarely produces even a trace of an extra ring ; on the contrary , a typical bristlecone pine has up to 5 percent of its rings missing .
Concerning the sequence of rings derived from the bristlecone pine , Ferguson says :
- page 26 -
In certain species of conifers , especially those at lower elevations or in southern latitudes , one season 's growth increment may be composed of two or more flushes of growth , each of which may strongly resemble an annual ring .
Such multiple growth rings are extremely rare in bristlecone pines , however , and they are especially infrequent at the elevation and latitude ( 37 � 20 ' N ) of the sites being studied .
In the growth - ring analyses of approximately one thousand trees in the White Mountains , we have , in fact , found no more than three or four occurrences of even incipient multiple growth layers .
( p. 840 )
In years of severe drought , a bristlecone pine may fail to grow a complete ring all the way around its perimeter ; we may find the ring if we bore into the tree from one angle , but not from another .
Hence at least some of the missing rings can be found .
Even so , the missing rings are a far more serious problem than any double rings .
Other species of trees corroborate the work that Ferguson did with bristlecone pines .
Before his work , the tree-ring sequence of the sequoias had been worked out back to 1250 BC .
The archaeological ring sequence had been worked out back to 59 BC .
The limber pine sequence had been worked out back to 25 BC .
The radiocarbon dates and tree - ring dates of these other trees agree with those Ferguson got from the bristlecone pine .
But even if he had had no other trees with which to work except the bristlecone pines , that evidence alone would have allowed him to determine the tree-ring chronology back to 6200 BC .
( See Renfrew for more details . )
So , creationists who complain about double rings in their attempts to disprove C - 14 dating are actually grasping at straws .
If the Flood of Noah occurred around 3000 BC , as some creationists claim , then all the bristlecone pines would have to be less than five thousand years old .
This would mean that eighty - two hundred years worth of tree rings had to form in five thousand years , which would mean that one - third of all the bristlecone pine rings would have to be extra rings .
Creationists are forced into accepting such outlandish conclusions as these in order to jam the facts of nature into the time frame upon which their " scientific " creation model is based .
Question : Creationist Thomas G. Barnes has claimed that the earth 's magnetic field is decaying exponentially with a half - life of fourteen hundred years .
Not only does he consider this proof that the earth can be no older than ten thousand years but he also points out that a greater magnetic strength in the past would reduce C - 14 dates .
Now if the magnetic field several thousand years ago was indeed many times stronger than it is today , there would have been less cosmic radiation entering the atmosphere back then and less C - 14 would have been produced .
Therefore , any C - 14 dates taken from objects of that time period would be too high .
How do you answer him ?
- page 27 -
Answer : Like Cook , Barnes looks at only part of the evidence .
What he ignores is the great body of archaeological and geological data showing that the strength of the magnetic field has been fluctuating up and down for thousands of years and that it has reversed polarity many times in the geological past .
So , when Barnes extrapolates ten thousand years into the past , he concludes that the magnetic field was nineteen times stronger in 4000 BC than it is today , when , actually , it was only half as intense then as now .
This means that radiocarbon ages of objects from that time period will be too young , just as we saw from the bristlecone pine evidence .
Question :
But how does one know that the magnetic field has fluctuated and reversed polarity ?
Are n't these just excuses scientists give in order to neutralize Barnes 's claims ?
Answer :
The evidence for fluctuations and reversals of the magnetic field is quite solid .
V. Bucha , a Czech geophysicist , has used archaeological artifacts made of baked clay to determine the strength of the earth 's magnetic field when they were manufactured .
He found that the earth 's magnetic field was 1.5 times as strong as today around 1 AD , 1.6 times as strong around 400 BC , 0.8 times as strong around 2000 BC , and only 0.5 times as strong around 4000 BC .
( See Bailey , Renfrew , and Encyclopedia Britannica for details . )
In other words , it rose in intensity from 0.5 times its present value in 4000 BC to a peak of 1.6 times its present value in 400 BC , and it has been slowly declining since then .
Even before the bristlecone pine calibration of C - 14 dating was worked out by Ferguson , Bucha predicted that this change in the magnetic field would make radiocarbon dates too young .
This idea [ that the fluctuating magnetic field affects influx of cosmic rays , which in turn affects C - 14 formation rates ] has been taken up by the Czech geophysicist , V. Bucha , who has been able to determine , using samples of baked clay from archeological sites , what the intensity of the earth 's magnetic field was at the time in question .
Even before the tree-ring calibration data were available to them , he and the archeologist , Evzen Neustupny , were able to suggest how much this would affect the radiocarbon dates .
( Renfrew , p. 76 )
Not only that , but his predictions were confirmed in detail :
There is a good correlation between the strength of the earth 's magnetic field ( as determined by Bucha ) and the deviation of the atmospheric radiocarbon concentration from its normal value ( as indicated by the tree - ring radiocarbon work ) .
( Renfrew , p. 76 )
So , once we know all the magnetic data , we see that it really supports the tree-ring
- page 28 -
calibration of C - 14 dating , rather than the conclusions of Cook and Barnes .
As for the question of polarity reversals , plate tectonics can teach us much .
It is a fact that new oceanic crust continually forms at the mid-oceanic ridges and spreads away from those ridges in opposite directions .
When lava at the ridges hardens , it keeps a trace of the magnetism of the earth 's magnetic field .
Therefore , every time the magnetic field reverses itself , bands of paleomagnetism of reversed polarity show up on the ocean floor alternated with bands of normal polarity .
These bands are thousands of kilometers long , they vary in width , they lie parallel , and the bands on either side of any given ridge form mirror images of each other .
Thus it can be demonstrated that the magnetic field of the earth has reversed itself dozens of times throughout earth history .
Barnes , writing in 1973 , ought to have known better than to quote the gropings and guesses of authors of the early sixties in an effort to debunk magnetic reversals .
Before plate tectonics and continental drift became established in the mid-sixties , the known evidence for magnetic reversals was rather scanty , and geophysicists often tried to invent ingenious mechanisms with which to account for this evidence rather than believe in magnetic reversals .
However , by 1973 , sea floor spreading and magnetic reversals had been documented to the satisfaction of almost the entire scientific community .
Yet , instead of seriously attempting to rebut them with up - to - date evidence , Barnes merely quoted the old guesses of authors who wrote before the facts were known .
But , in spite of Barnes , paleomagnetism on the sea floor conclusively proves that the magnetic field of the earth oscillates in waves and even reverses itself on occasion .
It has not been decaying exponentially as Barnes maintains .
Question : Does outside archaeological evidence confirm theC - 14 dating method ?
Answer : Yes .
When we know the age of a sample through archaeology or historical sources , the C - 14 method ( as corrected by bristlecone pines ) agrees with the age within the known margin of error .
For instance , Egyptian artifacts can be dated both historically and by radiocarbon , and the results agree .
At first , archaeologists used to complain that the C - 14 method must be wrong , because it conflicted with well - established archaeological dates ; but , as Renfrew has detailed , the archaeological dates were often based on false assumptions .
One such assumption was that the megalith builders of western Europe learned the idea of megaliths from the Near - Eastern civilizations .
As a result , archaeologists believed that the Western megalith - building cultures had to be younger than the Near Eastern civilizations .
Many archaeologists were skeptical when Ferguson 's calibration with bristlecone pines was first published , because , according to his method , radiocarbon dates of the Western megaliths showed them to be much older than their Near - Eastern counterparts .
However , as Renfrew demonstrated , the similarities between these Eastern and Western cultures are so superficial that
- page 29 -
the megalith builders of western Europe invented the idea of megaliths independently of the Near East .
So , in the end , external evidence reconciles with and often confirms even controversial C - 14 dates .
One of the most striking examples of different dating methods confirming each other is Stonehenge .
C - 14 dates show that Stonehenge was gradually built over the period from 1900 BC to 1500 BC , long before the Druids , who claimed Stonehenge as their creation , came to England .
Astronomer Gerald S. Hawkins calculated with a computer what the heavens were like back in the second millennium BC , accounting for the precession of the equinoxes , and found that Stonehenge had many significant alignments with various extreme positions of the sun and moon ( for example , the hellstone marked the point where the sun rose on the first day of summer ) .
Stonehenge fits the heavens as they were almost four thousand years ago , not as they are today , thereby cross-verifying the C - 14 dates .
Question :
What specifically does C - 14 dating show that creates problems for the creation model ?
Answer : C - 14 dates show that the last glaciation started to subside around twenty thousand years ago .
But the young - earth creationists at ICR and elsewhere insist that , if an ice age occurred , it must have come and gone far less than ten thousand years ago , sometime after Noah 's flood .
Therefore , the only way creationists can hang on to their chronology is to poke all the holes they can into radiocarbon dating .
However , as we have seen , it has survived their most ardent attacks .

WASHINGTON  President Obama told human rights advocates at the White House on Wednesday that he was mulling the need for a “ preventive detention ” system that would establish a legal basis for the United States to incarcerate terrorism suspects who are deemed a threat to national security but cannot be tried , two participants in the private session said .
The discussion , in a 90 - minute meeting in the Cabinet Room that included Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and other top administration officials , came on the eve of a much - anticipated speech Mr. Obama is to give Thursday on a number of thorny national security matters , including his promise to close the detention center at the naval base in Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
Human rights advocates are growing deeply uneasy with Mr. Obama ’s stance on these issues , especially his recent move to block the release of photographs showing abuse of detainees , and his announcement that he is willing to try terrorism suspects in military commissions  a concept he criticized bitterly as a presidential candidate .
The two participants , outsiders who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the session was intended to be off the record , said they left the meeting dismayed .
Abstract
We advocate the usage of modern functional programming languages , and lazy functional techniques for the description and implementation of abstract mathematical objects in Quantum Mechanics , needed both for pedagogical purposes , and for some real , not too computationally intensive , but conceptually and algorithmically difficult applications .
We show how to perform simple abstract computations on state vectors , and we discuss the construction of some lazy algorithms , which facilitate enormously the manipulation of potentially infinite data structures , or iterative processes .
Lazy functional techniques may replace in many cases the usage of symbolic computer algebra packages , and often offer additionally an interesting algorithmic complement to the manipulation of mathematical data , more efficient than blindly used symbolic algebra , and easily integrable with the numerical code .

“ The Ultimate Fighter 9 ” Finale , June 20 , Las Vegas Diego Sanchez vs. Clay Guida “ The Ultimate Fighter 9 ” Finale , June 20 , Las Vegas
Stephen Martinez / Sherdog.com
Condit vs. Kampmann
was a modern classic .
With arguably the biggest mixed martial arts show of all - time drawing near , one cannot help but look back on six of the most memorable months this sport has ever seen .
From Lyoto Machida announcing the renaissance of Karate and Mike Thomas Brown going from lightweight also - ran to featherweight top dog to the ongoing reign of Russian demigod Fedor Emelianenko , it has been an exciting six months for the fans .
Nothing drives that point home like the unexpected glut of top - shelf fights to which we have been treated lately .
With an excess of candidates for mid-year “ Fight of the Year ” from which to choose , Sherdog.com has narrowed the field down to five -- in no particular order .
Read on and reminisce , with some of the best fistic fireworks of the year on the horizon .
The dream of a Shooto standard bearer turning into a stateside superstar had all but fizzled out by the time Mizugaki was brought in on late - notice to tangle with Torres , the WEC bantamweight champion and East Chicago , Ind . - based eater of souls .
You can only hold out hope for so long after watching one Japanese import after another get turned into scrap metal , and Mizugaki , despite a strong resume , was expected to join his expatriates on that pile .
It took all of five minutes for Mizugaki to prove to the world -- and especially Torres -- that he did not fly halfway across the world to admire the champion ’s Wolfman mullet .
Launching accurate counters to the vaunted Torres jab and bullying the champion in the clinch , Mizugaki all but overwhelmed Torres in the first round and laid the foundation for a winning strategy .
Faced with real adversity for the first time during his WEC reign , Torres proved his worth as a champion by storming back into the pocket and facing the toughest test of his career without so much as a flinch .
The next four rounds saw a pitched battle , with one man desperate to earn respect and the other desperate to hold on to it .
The championship rounds proved to be the Wolfman ’s territory , as Torres gained the upper hand with accurate boxing and cringe - inducing clinch work and Mizugaki ’s power punch blitz left his cardio playing catch up .
Those championship rounds proved to be the difference , as the scorecards were unanimous in Torres ’ favor .
Still , Mizugaki announced his presence to millions and played a key role in the bantamweight class graduating from fringe division to fight sport foothold .
Guida was supposed to be the stiffest test yet for lightweight convert Sanchez .
With his endless cardio , frenzied style and borderline masochistic love for fighting , Guida is a trial for anyone not wearing armor .
Unfortunately for Guida , the only thing we saw from him early in the bout was his appetite for self - destruction , as Sanchez opened with a savage salvo that left “ The Carpenter ” more dazed and confused than Robert Downey Jr. , circa 1988 .
What would be a convenient excuse to call it a day for most turned into a singular opportunity for Guida to dive headfirst into the fray and let the chips fall where they may .
A stirring second round saw Guida rally with his trademark ground - and - pound , while Sanchez delivered a unique brand of slashing strikes and submission attempts from the bottom that turned the pivotal stanza into a high - stakes game of back and forth .
Going into the final frame , the fight was up for grabs , and neither man left anything to chance , as they went toe - to - toe for the last five minutes with the same tenacity that defined the first 10 .
A battle of will and skill ended with Sanchez being announced the winner via split decision , but perhaps the most enduring image from this matchup was that of a bloodied and battered Guida bouncing around like a kid , sporting the kind of smile that seemed both entirely out of place and the perfect exclamation point on 15 minutes that left fans in awe .
After the WEC welterweight division fizzled out , thanks in large part to his own dominance , Condit packed his bags and entered the UFC , already regarded as a top contender .
That status was put to the test , literally , from the opening bell , as Condit was matched with Xtreme Couture virtuoso Kampmann .
With both men having a reputation for offensive versatility , it did not take long for them to back up their credentials ; they went for broke on the feet , mat and clinch .
While Condit scored his points with long - range striking and fluid guard work , Kampmann went blue - collar by staying inside Condit ’s reach with constant flurries and takedowns .
After splitting the first two rounds , the third came down to a battle of wills , as cardio was in short supply .
Struggling to find openings on the feet , Kampmann filled his lungs , lunged forward and delivered the takedown he needed .
In between avoiding Condit ’s notoriously shifty guard work , Kampmann managed to sneak in some highlight reel - worthy strikes and win over the judges .
While the court of public opinion remains split , there was no arguing that the night gave rise to not just one , but two , welterweight stars .
Rematches are a rare commodity in MMA , and a rematch between incumbent WEC featherweight champion Brown and the man he deposed , Faber , seemed an unlikely prospect .
In hindsight , the fight Gods smiled upon us , as the sequel turned out to be the polar opposite of Brown ’s quick technical knockout win in their first title tilt .
Undaunted by what would have been a demoralizing defeat for any athlete , Faber stormed Brown from the start by using his hyperactive offense to stay one step ahead of the champion and keep him from maximizing his size advantage .
To his credit , Brown stayed patient and got in his own licks , reminding Faber that he is always a split second away from ending a fight .
As the bout progressed , Brown ’s patience paid off .
He survived Faber ’s quicksilver strategy and took over the bout with a pressing , hardnosed attack .
As Faber tried to stay above water , a gut check came in the form of a broken right hand with plenty of time left on the clock .
Amazingly , Faber made it to the closing bell by relying on kicks , elbows and anything else he could devise to keep Brown from running him over .
That staggering effort left Faber with only a unanimous decision loss to bring home , but the respect he won from fan and fighter alike will keep his superstar status safe for as long as he wants it .
The second - for - second champion on this list , Neer and Danzig were in the cage for less than nine minutes , but fans would be hard - pressed to find more than a few seconds that did not see these two recreating key scenes from “ Godzilla vs. Mecha - Godzilla . ”
The striking was the spectacle in this one , as Neer relied on his reach and power to wobble Danzig , who answered with beautifully timed counters that kept his opponent at bay and unsteady .
The pace remained impossibly frenzied throughout the first round , and no one seemed sure of who would enter the second with the scorecards in his favor .
That issue proved irrelevant , and , ironically , after five minutes of Russian roulette - style striking , the fight was decided on the mat .
While Danzig sought out the ground game , Neer benefitted , as he quickly battered “ The Ultimate Fighter 6 ” winner with ground - and - pound before he seized his back and put himself in position to seal the deal .
It was then that Danzig managed a last - gasp rally with a slick reversal and ground - and - pound of his own that appeared to level the playing field .
The tide soon turned against Danzig , however , as Neer bolted down a triangle choke that left his exhausted quarry with no escape but the tapout .
The cancellation of Affliction “ Trilogy ” and resulting collapse of Affliction Entertainment as a mixed martial arts promotion , leaves the UFC with perhaps its best chance to date to land former Pride Fighting Championships heavyweight titleholder Fedor Emelianenko Still , Vadim Finkelchtein , Emelianenko ’s manager and M - 1 Global president , clings to the idea that the Russian ’s involvement with the UFC will only come through co-promotional efforts .
“ This is the moment of truth that the UFC has talked about , ” Finkelchtein said in a statement on the M - 1 Global Web site .
“ Fedor and I are here in the states .
If they want to come out and fly here , we are ready to conduct negotiations .
Of course , it still does n’t imply we are ready to accept any conditions they ’ll throw at us .
We want to talk to the UFC about having Fedor compete against some of their fighters , but only within the framework of co-promotional efforts with M - 1 Global .
” Unbeaten in his past 27 fights , Emelianenko ( 30 - 1 , 1 NC ) flattened former UFC champions Andrei Arlovski and Tim Sylvia in his most recent outings in the ring .
The 32 - year - old Russian knocked out Arlovski with one punch 3:14 into their match at Affliction “ Day of Reckoning , ” as he posted his 10th consecutive victory since a no contest in 2004 .
Hard to handle on his feet and on the ground , Emelianenko has finished his last five opponents inside one round and holds victories against Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira , 2006 Pride Open Weight Grand Prix winner Mirko “ Cro Cop ” Filipovic and former UFC heavyweight champions Mark Coleman and Kevin Randleman .
He has delivered 23 of his 30 career wins by knockout , technical knockout or submission .
Emelianenko was booked to face Josh Barnett in the Affliction “ Trilogy ” main event on Aug. 1 at the Honda Center in Anaheim , Calif .
However , the bout fell through when Barnett tested positive for a banned anabolic agent , causing the entire event to collapse .
What move Emelianenko , the world ’s top heavyweight , makes from here remains to be seen .
“ We are now with Fedor in the US , and we hope to make a decision about his next fight within the next few days , ” Finkelchtein said .
“ There are many business meetings and negotiations planned with all the major promotions . ”

( Reality flow chart ) ( GOP propaganda chart )
As Media Matters points out , today 's GOP is trying the same old tricks of yesteryear , when they set out to destroy the Clinton health care plan in 1994 .
They 've released a confusing and misleading flow chart ( pictured above , right ) to show how awful a public option would be -- and it 's already being picked up by the right wing media .
On July 15 , the Drudge Report , Fox News , and CNBC's The Kudlow Report provided a forum for a chart released by congressional Republicans that day -- a day after House Democrats introduced their health care reform bill -- that purported to show " the complex health care reform proposal by Democratic congressional leaders . "
The release from Rep. Kevin Brady ( TX ) about the chart , titled " BAFFLING FLOW CHART ; Public Gets Peek at Complicated Bureaucracy in Democratic Health Care Plan , " stated that the chart " depicts how the health care system would be organized at the national level if the Democrats ' plan became law .
These new levels of bureaucracy , agencies , organization and programs will all be put directly between the patient and their health care . "
In response , TNR 's Jonathan Cohn has come up with his own flow chart ( pictured above , left ) that describes the incredibly confusing private system most Americans are currently trying to understand and forced to endure :
The Ravine Hotel , one of the best Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar hotels , is situated 4,500 feet above sea level .
Situated at the base of Sydney Point and overlooking the Dhom Dam , it is only 20 km from Mahabaleshwar .
Nestled in year long greenery and away from the hustle and bustle of big cities , it is a truly peaceful break from everyday noise , stress and pollution !!
The only certified 3 Star Hotel in Panchgani , the Ravine Hotel , is equipped to satisfy all your needs , from conferences to movie shoots .
A resort which is just an easy 4 - hour drive away from Mumbai , it is a favorite getaway for a weekend of peace and tranquility for many Mumbai residents and visitors .
Read More Panchgani is one of the best hill stations amongst most places near Mumbai / Pune .
Along with the nearby Mahabaleshwar , Panchgani is considered one of the “ must - visit ” hill stations in Maharashtra and tourists from nearby metros of Mumbai , Pune and other parts of Maharashtra , India as well as abroad throng this place to relax and rejuvenate their senses .
It has generally been in the shadow of its more famous neighbor , Mahabaleshwar , yet it has its own tourist influx and often it is very difficult to find empty Hotels in Panchgani .
The Krishna River , which cuts a meandering course through the smaller valleys below , keeps the valleys lush green through the year .
Read More Mahabaleshwar is one of the most popular hill stations in India .
Mahabaleshwar attracts weekend getaway visitors from nearby metros that are looking for places to visit near Mumbai & Pune as well as tourists from all over India and abroad who mark this as a must - visit place in their itinerary .
It is hardly half - an - hour ride from Hotel Ravine , thus keeping Ravine guests comfortably away from instances of crowding that can happen in Mahabaleshwar but still keeping them within reachable distance of various Mahabaleshwar attractions
The Australian authorities have ordered an inquiry after a boy fell with a rope around his neck during a mock hanging staged as part of a school activity .
The student was being photographed as part of a staged crime scene at Laidley State High school in Queensland when he slipped and fell , officials said .
Fellow students said he turned blue as teachers rushed to cut the rope at the school near Brisbane .
State Education Minister Geoff Wilson said the incident " beggars belief " .
He said Queensland 's health and safety teams were investigating .
" We want to find out how it took place so that whatever action needs to be taken can be taken to ensure that such an incident can never happen again , " he said .
" I 'm a parent - the last thing I 've ever wanted any of my children to do is put a rope around their neck and I 'm astonished that the incident 's taken place . "
Recovering
The incident happened as a class of 14 and 15 year olds were photographing the " crime scene " as part of an English lesson , state deputy education director Lyn McKenzie said .
This is clearly a very serious incident
Geoff Wilson
Queensland 's education minister
The boy fell from a table with a rope around his neck , injuring his neck .
Local media reported that the teacher was not in the classroom at the time , but rushed in after hearing the screams of students .
The boy is reported to be recovering at home with his family .
Mr Wilson said he wanted to keep an " open mind " over the investigation , but said he expected any recommendations to be implemented immediately .
" This is clearly a very serious incident , " he said .
" The safety and wellbeing of students must be the first priority at all times " .

It ’s not just good manners to wait your turn – it ’s actually down to evolution , according to new research by University of Leicester psychologists .
A study in the University ’s School of Psychology sought to explain how turn - taking has evolved across a range of species .
The conclusion is that there is an evolution - based “ invisible hand ” that guides our actions in this respect .
What 's more , the researchers have shown that this behavior can be simulated using a simple computer algorithm and basic genetic laws .
Professor Andrew Colman and Dr Lindsay Browning carried out the study due to appear in the September issue of the journal Evolutionary Ecology Research .
The study has helped to explain the evolution of cooperative turn - taking .
Professor Colman said : “ In human groups , turn - taking is usually planned and coordinated with the help of language .
For example , people living together often agree to take turns washing up the dishes after meals or taking their children to school .
But turn - taking has also evolved in many other species without language or the capacity to reach negotiated agreements .
These include apes , monkeys , birds , and antelopes that take turns grooming each other , and mating pairs of Antarctic penguins that take turns foraging at sea while their partners incubate eggs or tend to chicks .
“ It is far from obvious how turn - taking evolved without language or insight in animals shaped by natural selection to pursue their individual self - interests . ”
The researchers say that playing “ tit for tat ” – copying in each time period whatever the other individual did in the previous period ­– can explain synchronized cooperation , but cannot fully explain turn - taking .
“ For example , many predatory animals hunt in pairs or larger groups , and this involves synchronized cooperation .
‘ Tit for tat ’ has been shown to work very well in initiating and sustaining this type of cooperation . ”
“ But where cooperation involves turn - taking , a ‘ tit for tat ’ instinct could sustain the pattern once it was established but could not initiate it in the first place .
For example , in a mating pair of penguins who both went foraging or both incubated the eggs at the same time , ‘ tit for tat ’ would not be enough to evolve the habit of taking turns . ”
Using evolutionary game theory and computer simulations , Professor Colman and Dr Browning discovered a simple variation of “ tit for tat ” that explains how turn - taking can evolve in organisms that pursue their individual self - interests robotically .
The researchers state : “ Turn - taking is initiated only after a species has evolved at least two genetically different types that behave differently in initial , uncoordinated interactions with others .
Then as soon as a pair coordinates by chance , they instinctively begin to play ‘ tit for tat ’ .
This locks them into mutually beneficial coordinated turn - taking indefinitely .
Without genetic diversity , turn - taking cannot evolve in this simple way . ”
Professor Colman added : “ In our simulations , the individuals were computer programs that were not only dumb and robotic but also purely selfish .
Nevertheless , they ended up taking turns in perfect coordination .
We published indirect evidence for this in 2004 ; we have now shown it directly and found a simple explanation for it .
Our findings confirm that cooperation does not always require benevolence or deliberate planning .
This form of cooperation , at least , is guided by an ‘ invisible hand ’ , as happens so often in Darwin ’s theory of natural selection . ”
Andrew Colman is a Professor of Psychology and Lindsay Browning is a former student and Honorary Visiting Fellow of the University of Leicester .
The research , which used a specially developed genetic algorithm , was funded through an Auber Bequest Award from Scotland ’s National Academy , The Royal Society of Edinburgh .
Episode 4 : The Professional
Jimmy Cha
Is he a professional gambler or a professional Baduk player , or is this distinction even relevant ?
Whether it 's poker , martial arts , classical music , or Baduk , he is at the highest level in all of them .
Perhaps the only relevant distinction for this Renaissance Man is that he is , simply , a " professional . "
His name is Cha MinSoo , or as he is known more widely outside Korea , Jimmy Cha .
If any of these applies to you , please raise your hand .
Anyone who 's made as much as $ 370,000 USD in one day 's work .
Anyone who 's amassed $ 20 million USD in career earnings as a poker player .
Anyone who 's reached the quarterfinals of a major international Baduk tournament two years straight .
Anyone who has flown 120 times a year .
Anyone who has survived a street brawl against thirty gang members out to get you .
To top it off , anyone who holds a perfect record in Baduk against several 9 dans including Cho Chikun .
Okay , it 's not you .
The official title for Jimmy Cha is a professional gambler .
In Las Vegas , he is considered as one of the top three cash game experts with Chip Reese and Doyle Brunson .
Cha won his first $ 1 million USD in 1986 and has made that figure a habitual yearly earning since .
Until 1996 , he terrorized opponents in cash events in stud , limit , and no- limit hold 'em varieties .
It was when he flew 120 times to seek and destroy high - stake games all over the country .
Why has he slowed down since 1996 ?
He is taking his time off to care for his feeble mother stricken with Alzheimer 's back in Korea .
Even now and then he skips town for weeks , and when returns he explains his absence with a sly grin , " I gotta make a living , too , you know ? "
Cha 's mother is the crucial figure for the extraordinary man that Cha is today .
While she was pregnant , Cha 's father , a mid-level government employee , was abducted by agents from the North .
The loss of her husband did not dispirit Mrs. Cha .
Being a strong woman with savvy business skills , she managed to build wealth by wisely investing in the up - and - coming movie industry that turned out to be a huge success in the post - Korean War society .
Growing up privileged , Cha was given extensive training in piano , violin , swimming , table tennis , pool , and the list went endless .
Violin remains to this day a viable expertise on which he could make a decent living .
Among his lessons included Baduk , which he started learning at age 8 but did n't get serious about it until he entered middle school .
In 11th grade he had become a 5 - dan amateur and was already good enough to pass the preliminary stages of the pro admissions test .
By the time he entered college as an economics major , he was arguably the strongest amateur in the nation , winning several amateur tournaments and representing Korea in various international amateur championships .
It was only natural that he built a reputation as a can 't - miss pro prospect .
There exists a behind - the - scene story involving Cha and his shady amateur status during his college days .
When Korea was about to enter into a diplomatic relation with the People 's Republic of China , the Korean Baduk Association faced a strange dilemma ; the Chinese Weiqi Association and the KBA had agreed to host a series of friendly matches with their respective amateurs to commemorate the national event .
However , most of the strong amateurs in Korea had already turned pro.
Anxious that the amateur " leftovers " would be crushed by the overwhelming Chinese , the KBA allegedly blocked Cha from taking the pro admissions test .
Cha conceded to the will from the top by remaining amateur until the conclusion of the matches .
In 1974 , when he entered third year of college , was he finally allowed to take the test , which he passed with flying colors .
After completing his mandatory military service , however , his mother sent his son away to America because she thought her spoiled young boy needed to learn life by living an unprivileged lifestyle .
When he arrived in Los Angeles , the Asian communities welcomed their first resident pro ever .
Looking back , he was one of the early pioneers in spreading and popularizing the game of Baduk in southern California in the late 70s .
In order to make a decent living , however , he had to do things other than just giving lessons on life - and - death .
While working as an employee at a local gas station , he ran into three gang members looking to pump gas .
Cha sensed instinctively they were going to fly without paying .
He was right .
Approaching their car , Cha and the punks got into an altercation in which the classically trained Kung - Fu expert ( another product of his intensive childhood training ) drummed three of them pretty good .
They paid .
About a week later , a group of thirty gang members , along with the three that took a beating , marched into the gas station looking for Cha .
To find sufficient moving space , Cha walked out to the front yard and proceeded to knock out two of them .
In this dire do - or - die situation , Cha knew the only way to get out of it alive was to act calm and confident .
Impressed at the sight of this unfazed Asian warrior under serious pressure , the boss said to Cha , " Who the ---- do you think you are , Bruce Lee ?
If you acted like a coward we would 've already killed you . "
The boss and his followers left without causing any more trouble .
Surviving the incident , Cha quit his job at the gas station .
Instead , he spent a considerable amount of time to learn how to play poker professionally with Chip Johnson , a renowned poker theorist in southern California .
Combining game theory with his instinct of a professional Baduk player created a monster of a poker player .
Throughout the 80s , Cha earned his reputation as one of the most successful pro gamblers in the country .
Despite his success in poker , however , his true love remained with Baduk .
As a North American representative , he entered the 2nd Fujitsu World Championship in 1989 and beat two 9 dans from Japan to reach the quarterfinals , only to lose in the following round to his good friend Cho HoonHyun 9 dan .
It was a stunning come - from - behind victory for Cho , which Kobayashi Koich 9 dan claimed in private an intentional loss by Cha .
Cha responded to the charge saying , " I was clearly winning by a lot but when I started thinking about beating Cho HoonHyun , no less , I just could n't keep my composure .
I started to make mistakes .
The truth is , I choked . "
The controversy notwithstanding , he went on to make history the following year by beating Japan 's number one Cho Chikun 9 dan to again advance to the quarterfinals .
He holds a notable 8 - 1 all - time record against Japanese players .
Actor portraying Jimmy Cha in " All - In " Actor portraying Jimmy Cha in " All - In " Jimmy Cha is a former one - time American Go Association president who is currently sponsoring a pro tournament in China as well as one in the United States .
His incredible story is being developed into a novel and TV series in Korea by prominent Baduk journalist Noh Seung Il .
The title fits his dramatic life and career as a quintessential professional , which is simply dubbed , " All - In . "

For the last five months , I have been an active user of Reddit .
When I first got started with Reddit , I was really impressed by how much more democratic Reddit seemed to be than Digg and some of the other social media websites .
As I talked to other Reddit users , I realized that I was n’t alone in feeling this way .
As Brent Csutoras noted in a recent post , there have been a significant amount of people who have been leaving Digg and going to Reddit .
The reason for these users moving to Reddit is because while Digg likes to say that they are all about their users , everyone knows that their moderators have a significant amount of control over the content that makes it to the front page ( and their trend of having more control has continued to increase over time ) .

Unfortunately , it seems that my initial impression of Reddit may have been too good to be true .
During my first three to four months on Reddit , I noticed that from time to time , my submissions would be deleted .
Although the submissions did n’t break any Reddit TOS ( such as being adult content ) , were n’t self - promotional and were n’t related to SEO ( since the Reddit community is weary of any content related to search engine marketing ) , some of my posts seemed to be randomly deleted .
However , during the past few weeks , I have noticed that every one of my submissions has been getting deleted .
The most surprising thing is that they were always deleted extremely quickly ( as in ten seconds or less ) .
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
While this was quite puzzling at first , the cause of this issue has started to become more clear .
As Brent explained in his post , the categories on Reddit are actually subreddits , and instead of being run by the Reddit staff , many of the most popular ones are run by a single Reddit user .
This means that these subreddits are fully controlled by a single user , and that user is allowed to play god with the submissions .
While a Reddit staff member would probably have to justify why they deleted specific submissions , these users could delete submissions simply because they did n’t like another user .
So , while people like to complain about Digg ’s preferred treatment of power users , I think the issue of power users pales in comparison to this one .
Although this information explained why some of my links had been randomly deleted during my first three to four months on Reddit , it still did n’t explain the recent acivity .
However , after doing some more investigating , I think I have found the answer , and this is where things get really interesting .
If I am logged in and look at my recent submissions , I can see them all as shown by the screenshot below :
( notice that my submissions are a random mix of interesting content that is n’t self - promotional or related to SEO )
Advertisement Continue Reading Below
However , when I log out and visit my user page , this is what I see :
So , what does this mean ?
From what I can gather , this means that if a user like myself has been banned , Reddit does n’t actually let you know that you have been banned .
Instead , the site makes you think you are still an active user , but anything that you submit is autoburied .
So , regardless of what you submit or how interesting it is , no one will ever have a chance to vote on it .

While I can understand why social media websites need to be able to ban users , I think it ’s quite devious to trick banned users like myself into thinking that they still have an active account , when the truth is that they are nothing more than a ghost of Reddit !
While I know that I could create a new Reddit account and start over from scratch , I simply do n’t know if I want to be part of a website that not only gives complete control over many of their main categories to single users ( who do n’t have to justify their decisions to anyone ) , but also feels that it is okay to trick their banned users into thinking that they are still members of the Reddit community .

I have been thinking about spending my social media time building a presence within the Mixx community ( because it seems to be the most democratic option at this point ) , but before I do , I want to hear what you all think I should do :

Microsoft investigators noticed there was an oddly similar pattern in a seemingly unrelated area , advertisements for the game World of Warcraft .
Though investigators were n’t sure how the two were connected , they began to see some similarities .
Although traffic appeared to come from different computers , it was actually coming from two proxy servers , which mask the original address of a click .
Microsoft began trying to stop the suspect traffic , but a little game evolved .
Microsoft would block a server , or block a certain level of traffic for those advertisements , but whoever was on the other side of the clicks kept finding new ways around the company ’s fixes .
“ They ’re basically just trying to figure out what our filters and technology tools are going to flag , and seeing if they can change their thresholds to get around it , ” Mr. Cranton said .
“ Then we figure out what they ’ve done and we change our thresholds , and it goes back and forth . ”
Microsoft did n’t know why someone would be interested in both World of Warcraft and auto insurance ads , though , until a third party told investigators that an advertiser for World of Warcraft keywords named Eric Lam was also taking a fee for directing traffic to auto insurance sites .
Investigators figured out that seven different accounts , registered under different individual and company names , were linked to Mr. Lam and two other defendants , Gordon Lam and Melanie Suen , believed to be Mr. Lam ’s brother and mother .
Microsoft ’s theory is that Mr. Lam was running or working for low - ranking sites that took potential client information for auto insurers .
The complaint said that he directed traffic to competitors ’
Web sites so they would pay for those clicks and exhaust their advertising budgets quickly , which let the lower - ranking sites that he sponsored move up in the paid - search results .

When people clicked through to his site , it asked them to supply contact information , which he then resold to auto insurance companies , according to Microsoft ’s complaint , which estimated his profit at $ 250,000 .
In the complaint , it also said it had to credit back $ 1.5 million to advertisers because of the Lams ’ alleged fake clicks .
Microsoft is seeking $ 750,000 in damages from the defendants .
The Dollhouse season 1 DVDs hit stores soon , complete with the show 's brilliant unaired pilot and season finale .
We 've got an exclusive clip - with special io9 intro from Joss Whedon - of a terrific fight scene .
One of the things you 'll learn when you get the DVDs is that this scene would have played a lot differently if you 'd seen the show 's original pilot .
In the show as it aired , one of the central plot arcs was how former FBI Agent Ballard had destroyed his career searching for the legendary Dollhouse , and especially new recruit Echo .
Instead of us waiting several episodes for Agent Ballard to meet Echo , however , the original pilot has them meeting almost immediately .
Advertisement
In the show as it aired , the two do n't meet until much later ( for example , during this fight scene from episode 6 ) .
Knowing that Ballard and Echo had a backstory really helps to explain the tension between them throughout the season , which always seemed a little unmotivated or ( on Ballard 's part ) kind of weirdo - stalkery .
When you see the original pilot in its full glory , you 'll understand why Ballard zeroed in on Echo as the person he wanted to save .

US State Department workers have begged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to let them use Firefox .
" Can you please let the staff use an alternative web browser called Firefox ? " worker bee Jim Finkle asked Clinton during Friday 's State Department town hall meeting .
" I just moved to the State Department from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and was surprised that State does n’t use this browser .
It was approved for the entire intelligence community , so I do n’t understand why State ca n’t use it .
It ’s a much safer program . "
Presumably , the State Department is using Microsoft 's Internet Explorer .
And we would n't be surprised if it 's still mired in the eight - year - old IE6 .
The only thing that moves slower than Orange is a US government agency .
But the State Department has yet to respond to our questions about its Firefox - less browsing mandate .
Finkle 's fellow workers responded to his Firefox request with applause .
While Clinton responded with bewilderment .
" Well , apparently , there ’s a lot of support for this suggestion .
I do n’t know the answer .
Pat , do you know the answer ? " she said , turning to under Secretary Pat Kennedy .
" The answer is , at the moment :
It ’s an expense question , " Kennedy said .
Then someone in the audience pointed out that Firefox is free .
" Nothing is free , " Kennedy responded .
" It ’s a question of the resources to manage multiple systems .
It is something we ’re looking at ... It has to be administered .
The patches have to be loaded .
It may seem small , but when you ’re running a worldwide operation and trying to push , as the Secretary rightly said , out FOBs [ for remote log-ins ] and other devices , you ’re caught in the terrible bind of triage of trying to get the most out that you can , but knowing you ca n’t do everything at once . "
Clinton then told her staff to have a look through their closets .
" The more money we can save on stuff that is not cutting edge , the more resources we ’ll have to shift to do things that will give us more tools , " she said .
" [ That reminds ] me of what I occasionally sometimes do , which I call shopping in my closet , which means opening doors and seeing what I actually already have , which I really suggest to everybody , because it ’s quite enlightening .
And so when you go to the store and you buy , let ’s say , peanut butter and you do n’t realize you ’ve got two jars already at the back of the shelf – I mean , that sounds simplistic , but help us save money on stuff that we should n’t be wasting money on , and give us the chance to manage our resources to do more things like Firefox , okay ? "
If the State Department buys less peanut butter , Clinton may even let them use Facebook .
During a state department town hall meeting earlier this year , a bigwig at the US embassy in Mexico City told Clinton that the social networking site is a great way to prevent solipsistic stupid people from entering the country .
" Facebook , MySpace , and other web 2.0 social networking technologies will significantly enhance the Department ’s diplomacy efforts and business goals , " he said .
" For example , an astute consular officer in Hermosillo recently used Facebook to determine a visa applicant ’s ineligibility based on information contained on the applicant ’s Facebook page , proving its value as an anti-fraud tool . "
And Clinton seemed to like the idea .
" We ’ve got to figure out how we ’re going to be smarter about using technology .
So I think that ’s a great example , the Facebook example .
And you know , we might want to follow up on that example , checking out Facebook .
For everybody who is applying for a visa , you just should know that the State Department is on the watch here for Facebook . "
No doubt , the State Department will officially adopt Facebook at about the same time the revenue - challenged site follows Friendster into social networking oblivion . ®

Police have clashed with hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews in Jerusalem over the opening of a car park on the Sabbath .
It was reported that protesters threw stones and ran at police barricades .
It is the third week of protests over the opening , which ultra-Orthodox Jews fear will lead to an increase in tourism and shops trading on the Sabbath .
Today we officially shipped the final release of Silverlight 3 .
Silverlight 3 Features
Silverlight 3 is a major update and delivers a ton of new features and capabilities .
Some of the new Silverlight 3 runtime capabilities include :
HD Media
Silverlight 3 now supports hardware graphics acceleration – enabling both video and graphics compositing to be offloaded onto a GPU .
This can dramatically lower CPU usage on a computer , and enables HD video to be played on older low end machines .
You can now deliver and play 1080 p HD video experiences over the web .
Silverlight 3 includes new media codec support for H.264 video , AAC audio and MPEG - 4 content .

Validation error template support has been added to controls ( enabling better error message display ) .
Hierarchical data binding is supported by the DataGrid .
And a new DataForm control enables better master / detail scenarios .
Silverlight 3 also now enables SaveFileDialog support .
Silverlight 3 includes a new navigation framework that enables deep - linking and forward / back button integration within the browser .
This also enables search engine optimization ( SEO ) support so that content within a Silverlight application can be indexed by search engines – including Google , Bing and Yahoo .
Silverlight 3 also supports the ability to cache assemblies on the client , and re-use them across multiple applications ( decreasing the download size and improving the startup time of applications ) .
Silverlight 3 includes much better text rendering and font support .
Text rendered using Silverlight 3 applications is much crisper and cleaner than previous releases , and applications now have access to local fonts .
The Silverlight 3 styling system also now supports merged resource dictionaries , BasedOn style inheritance support , and the ability for styles to be reset any number of times .
Silverlight 3 also adds richer accessibility support , and is the first browser plug - in to provide access to all system colors , allowing partially - sighted people to make changes such as high contrast color schemes for ease of readability using familiar operating system controls .
Silverlight 3 includes richer networking support .
WCF error faults are now supported across the network .
Server - side push duplex support is now easier to setup .
Binary XML serialization of payloads is now supported .

Is Texas Harboring Torture Decider ?
Editor ’s Note : Prior to giving some talks in Texas , former CIA analyst Ray McGovern offered the following op - ed to the Dallas Morning News and the Fort - Worth Star Telegram .
Both newspapers in George W. Bush ’s home state turned it down : Seldom does a crime scene have so clear a smoking gun .
A two - page presidential memorandum of Feb. 7 , 2002 , leaves no room for uncertainty regarding the “ decider ” on torture .
His broad - stroke signature made torture official policy .
Email
Printer friendly
This should come as no surprise .
You see , the Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum has been posted on the Web since June 22 , 2004 , when then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales mistakenly released it , along with other White House memoranda .
The title seemed innocent enough – “ Humane Treatment of al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees ” – but in the body of the memo President George W. Bush authorized his senior aides to withhold Geneva Convention protections from suspected al - Qaeda and Taliban detainees .
Like Shakespeare , the media seem harshest on the lawyers , including Texans Gonzales and William J. Haynes II ( Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ’s lawyer ) , who later outdid themselves trying to make torture legal .
What gets lost in the woodwork is this : Banal as their ex-post - facto “ justification ” for torture was , the lawyers were not the deciders .
After the decider - in - chief , the key decision makers were the eight addressees of the Feb. 7 memorandum : Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of State Colin Powell , Rumsfeld , Attorney General John Ashcroft , White House chief of staff Andrew Card , CIA Director George Tenet , National Security aide Condoleezza Rice , and Joint Chiefs Chairman Richard Myers .
During the Q & A after a recent Myers talk in Washington , I asked him what he did after he had read the President ’s memo on ignoring Geneva .
The tone of his non-answer was this :
If the President wanted to dismiss Geneva , what was a mere Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to do ?
In his memoir , Eyes on the Horizon , he tries to blame the lawyers : “ By relying so heavily on just the lawyers , the President did not get the broader advice on these matters that he needed . ”
Myers and the other seven addressees might these days be called derivative deciders — or , more simply , accomplices .
There is not a shred of evidence that any of the Gang of Eight gave the slightest consideration to resigning , rather than carry out the President ’s decision .
They elected to “ just follow orders , ” a defense dismissed out of hand at the post - WWII Nuremberg Tribunal on war crimes .
Together with the lawyer - advisers , the derivative deciders provide abundant proof that the “ banality of evil ” did not die with Adolf Eichmann and other functionaries of the Third Reich .
But the buck stops — actually , in this case , it began — with President Bush .
Senate Armed Services Committee leaders Carl Levin and John McCain on Dec. 11 , 2008 , released the executive summary of a report , approved by the full committee without dissent , concluding that Bush ’s Feb. 7 , 2002 , memorandum “ opened the door to considering aggressive techniques . ”
Here is Conclusion Number
One of the Senate committee report : “ Following the President ’s determination , techniques such as waterboarding , nudity , and stress positions … were authorized for use in interrogations of detainees in U.S. custody . ”
It is essential that those responsible for torture be held to account .
This is not about “ policy differences . ”
It is about crimes .
More important still , it ’s about holding fast to our Constitution and enforcing accountability in the executive branch .
There was a time when we regularly looked to folks from Texas to defend the law .
What would we have done , for example , without the late Barbara Jordan , African American jurist and member of the House Judiciary Committee , who spoke out with memorable eloquence in arguing that President Richard Nixon had to be held to account .
He could not get away with placing himself over the law .
Jordan and most of her committee colleagues voted out articles of impeachment against Nixon , leaving him little choice but to resign or be impeached .
Speaking to the House , Jordan described Nixon as a President “ swollen with power and grown tyrannical . ”
She added : “ My faith in the Constitution is whole ; it is complete ; it is total .
I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution , the subversion , the destruction of the Constitution . ”
Barbara Jordan was a Texan through and through .
She was also , above all , an American patriot .
I suspect she may be rolling over in her grave at the prospect of a chief executive escaping accountability for approving torture .
Ray McGovern will address these and other issues on Thursday evening , July 9 , for the Dallas Peace Center .
He served as an Army officer and CIA analyst for almost thirty years and is co-founder of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) .
He now works with Tell the Word , the publishing arm of the ecumenical Church of the Saviour in inner-city Washington .

newswire article announcements united states anti-racism help stop racist and homophobic " punk " author : ( a)nti-racist
The unitarian church is hosting a 90's hardcore band who is openly racist and homophobic this upcoming Saturday , June 6th .
While not openly neo - nazi themselves , this band has a huge current of neo -nazi followers .
If you want more info on why its important that this be stopped , read the email that follows .
FORWARD WIDELY :
I wrote a letter to email to as many unitarian churches as I could look up , but I need your help .
To try to reach as many people in the church as possible , email all the unitarian churches you can look up in your state , then pick another state and email it to them .
http://www.uua.org/aboutus/findcongregation/index.php can be your friend in looking up congregations .
Feel free to use my email , change my email around and send that , or write your own email .
Just remember , it 's Unitarians we 're emailing , so tailor your language to your audience .
If you do n't know what language to use with Unitarians , look at the tone I take in my email ...
I really think that 's the way to go .
-----------
Begin Email ---------
Hi .
I 'm with a group of concerned anti-racists trying to get to the bottom of a show in Philadelphia by a band called One Life Crew .
If you 're unclear why we would be taking issue with this band in particular , we 'd like to point you to some links and lyric samples provided ( for clarity sake ) at the bottom of this email .
We 've tried speaking with Reverend Walker directly , but can't seem to express to him the urgency of this matter .
We hope that you will take this matter seriously and examine how your power as an active member of the Unitarian Universalist church can be utilized through an action as small as a phone call .
Please at least treat this with enough respect to delay the show until all the issues can be hashed out by the church as a whole .
Issues that have the potential to affect the whole church , must be decided by the whole church .
In an issue this serious , there are a number of things to consider :
1 ) The danger :
Whenever neo-nazis , racists , and homophobes gather in one place , there is an implicit danger .
There is a danger of violence at the event , but more likely is the danger of violence after the event .
It 's never an intelligent move to get hate groups together in a room and get them amped up .
After events of these kind , queer - bashing , immigrant - bashing , and other forms of right - wing hate - violence is a common occurrence .
Rev.
Walker claims his interest is in opening up a dialogue with these people who have opposing points of view .
If this is the case a safer option would be for him to sit down and talk with them personally , in his office or in a public coffee shop .
It is possible to open up a dialogue without lending tactical support .
2 ) The privilege : I should n't have to explain to a church like Unitarian Universalist that most of us have a certain amount of privilege , some earned , most unearned .
By virtue of being , straight , white , male , financially - well - off , able - bodied , first - world , or some combination of these things , we have certain advantages .
It is difficult if not impossible to completely eliminate these privileges from our day - to - day life .
Even if we sincerely do n't want them , we 're given them by virtue of the society we live in .
If we are to justify our actions as progressives , we can only seek to use our privilege as gatekeepers , using them in a way conscious of those who do n't have the same privilege we do .
By giving your privilege - megaphone to a racist , homophobic band with a neo - nazi following , you are making your church a non -safe - space for people of color and queers .
We have a limited amount of resources at our disposal , in this case stage - time , and by allowing this event you are making a conscious decision regarding your church 's priorities .
This should come as an obvious statement to you , as it is written in your bylaws ( Section C - 2.3 .
See Bottom )
3 ) The reputation of your group :
We live in a society that expresses itself beautifully via music .
At this very moment there are surely hundreds of musicians who would love the opportunity to play in your beautiful Philadelphia ministry building .
Out of all the potential musical acts to pick , you are choosing one whose politics are suspect at best .
While in your heart - of - hearts you may disagree strongly with the message that OLC attempts to spread , there is no practical distinction to the outside observer between someone who supports racism ethically and someone who supports racism materially .
This indiscretion will not soon be forgotten , and will tie the church 's name to a brand of hatred I have no reason to believe it wishes to associate .
Thank you for taking the time to read this , and remember : it takes a lot more work to undo a mistake of this caliber than it does to prevent it .
You can reach reverend Nate Walker at his cell at ( 215 ) 701-9072 or via the church office at ( 215 ) 563-3980 , and if this is something you truly stand against , do n't hesitate to call others in the church .

It was easy .
We got some thick - sliced bacon and fried it up real good ( can you say " fry it up really well " without sounding like a complete tool ? ) , draining the bacon grease off as needed but keeping it aside .
Then we set the bacon to cool on some paper towels .
Oh , yes .
A long time ago I read about a restaurant somewhere in East Texas that serves chicken - fried bacon .
I had always wanted to try it , and I decided this was the weekend .
While Eric was cooking the bacon , I set up Ye Olde Dredging Station by beating a couple of eggs with a little milk in a pie pan and mixing bread crumbs , cornmeal , and black pepper in a dinner plate .
We dredged the bacon through the cornmeal mixture , then through the egg , and then back into the cornmeal .
We shook off the excess , heated the bacon grease back up , placed the pieces back in the pan , and cooked them until they turned a beautiful golden brown .
Finally , we ate the shit out of that shit .
The verdict : A moderate success .
Bacon - fried chicken - fried bacon is crispy and tasty , but bacon by itself is so perfect that this recipe is completely unnecessary .
As in , why the hell are all these bread crumbs diluting the flavor of my delicious , delicous bacon ?
Also , the cornmeal mixture needed a little salt .
You'd think frying something in bacon grease would impart enough flavor , but no .
So if you try this , add salt .
And I could be paranoid , but it seems like my heart is beating a little faster than usual .
On 10 June 2009 , 88 year old white supremacist and convicted felon James W. von Brunn was arrested for the murder of Stephen Tyrone Johns , a black security guard working at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , DC at the time .
Two of Johns ’ fellow security guards returned fire , wounding von Brunn .
The suspect allegedly ( it ’s “ alleged ” because he has n’t been convicted of this crime yet ) walked into the museum and immediately shot Johns with a .22 rifle .
Predictably , Mayor Adrian Fenty of Washington , DC chose to lay the blame for this event at the feet of the evils of inanimate objects .
He said “ In these days and times , you never know when someone is going to grab a gun and use it in an inappropriate way . ”
DC City Council Chairman Vincent C. Gray said this incident underscores the need for strict gun laws :
It ’s all the more reason why , though , District of Columbia gun legislation should be not used as a bargaining chip by those in Congress who would use our city for political gain while compromising safety , particularly when it involves our right to a vote .
The shooter violated the following laws , at least :
It is illegal to carry a firearm into the Holocaust Museum in Washington , DC .
It is illegal to carry a loaded rifle in public in Washington , DC .
It is illegal to fire a loaded rifle in public in Washington , DC .
It is illegal to murder someone in Washington , DC .
It is illegal for a convicted felon to carry a firearm of any kind in Washington , DC .
It seems to me that the problem here is not a need for stricter gun control , or stricter laws at all , and certainly not more laws .
Everything relevant has already been covered by the law .
The problem is not legality , but enforcement , in this case ; some laws are unenforceable , and others are simply not effectively enforced .
Some do n’t let that stop them from using the still - warm body of security guard Stephen Johns as a soapbox , though .
Perhaps Adrian Fenty and Vincent Gray should consider focusing on ensuring convicted felons do n’t break the laws against carrying firearms and murdering security guards before resorting to fretting over the “ need ” for gun control laws that are only effective against those who voluntarily obey them — in short , law - abiding citizens who are among the least likely people to commit murder with any weapon at all .
As Professor Nicholas J. Johnson once said :
The notorious AK - 47 can be assembled from a kit of roughly - machined parts using only hand tools .
Gun prohibition then is not the same as banning DDT or leaded gasoline .
It is more like banning fire .
I ’m sure these politicians have little interest in actually preventing such acts in the future , aside from the ability to point at declining crime rates as evidence they should be reëlected to office .
Their interest seems to be better served by dancing on the grave of the dead victim of an event more likely to be prevented by more widespread gun ownership than facilitated by it .
Their interest seems to be better served by bowing and scraping before powerful gun control lobbies like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , whose president , Paul Helmke , offered a sound bite or two ( or three ) of his own :
Congress should think very hard about their responsibilities for public safety before weakening gun laws in our nation ’s capital , and should rethink their decision to allow more guns in our national public areas .
It is dangerous to force more guns into places that American families expect to be gun-free and safe .
Clearly , the fact that further murders were prevented only because good people had firearms at the scene of this crime never crossed Helmke ’s mind when he composed that gem .
Nor , it seems , did the fact that the place was only free of legal firearms , discounting for the moment the security guards .
He also seems perfectly content to ignore the fact that Congress did n’t “ force ” more guns anywhere by loosening restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms ; it only gave people more choice whether to keep and bear arms .
. . . but what have we learned from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum shooting ?
Judging by the behavior of DC officials , all we ’ve learned is how to turn yet an other tragedy into a talking point for policy that is n’t even supported by these events .
Sources :
Whatever happened to the neocons , those creatures of legend whose fulminations led to the worst strategic disaster in American history ?
Oh , do n’t worry , they ’re still around and up to no good – out of power , but not out of mischief - making schemes to drag us into yet another war , this time on a scale much bigger than their previous " accomplishment . "
The Weekly Standard , Rupert Murdoch ’s gift to the War Party , is no longer delivered in multiple copies to the White House , but that does n’t mean editor Bill Kristol is totally bereft of influence in Washington .
Kristol & Co. , having disbanded their Project for a New American Century [ .pdf ] – which played a key role in dragging us into Iraq – have come up with a new vehicle , the Foreign Policy Initiative , which recently co-sponsored a conference with the head of the Center for a New American Security ( the Obamaites ’ favorite foreign policy think - tank ) and the Center for American Progress , the Soros - funded headquarters for progressives such as Matt Yglesias .
The subject was the " Af - Pak " front , and the attendees , whatever their other political differences , were in agreement that our new president is on the right track as he escalates this latest surge in the " war on terror . "
The reason for this ideological harmonic convergence is simple enough to see : in spite of Obama ’s alleged commitment to " change , " so far our foreign policy is Bushism without Bush – a policy of perpetual war , albeit without the Bushian bells and whistles .
Not that the administration will ever admit to this essential continuity .
In a move that underscores the stylistic differences between the new crowd and the old , the Pentagon recently issued a diktat to its minions , notifying them that " this administration prefers to avoid using the term ‘ Long War ’ or ‘ Global War on Terror ’ [ GWOT ] .
Please use ‘ Overseas Contingency Operation . ' ”
Appearances are everything to this administration , whose top guns are understandably sensitive to the charge , coming from the more principled element of the Democratic Party base , that the revolution has been betrayed .
The president ’s defenders note that none of this should come as any surprise to those who listened to what Obama actually said on the campaign trail , and they ’re right about that : he constantly charged that the Bushies had " neglected " the Afghan front and that we were fighting " the wrong war . "
Once in office , he would fix that , he vowed – and that is precisely what he is doing .
Yet one has to note that the Bushian terminology at least had the virtue of honesty .
This new crowd , which supposedly disdains all ideology and is devoted to a streamlined , hard - as - nails " pragmatism , " is slipperier than a greased - up eel in a frying pan .
" Overseas Contingency Operation " indeed !
The euphemism is comical , yet not totally meaningless .
Within it lies a hint of what the Obamaites intend , or , at least , what they say they intend .
Being sensitive barometers of the political zeitgeist , the Obamaites are perfectly aware of the war - weariness of the American people .
Even if you call it an " overseas contingency operation , " a war in these hard times is likely to grate much harder on people ’s nerves as they listen to the latest news from the Af - Pak front .
Yet to call the current war a contingency is to imply that there ’s going to be an end to it , and , not only that , but that the end is in sight , if still a decade or so off .
This , one assumes , is progress of a sort , but one has to wonder : what is the administration ’s current overseas operation contingent on ?
Or , in plain English , what event , or series of events , would cause us to declare victory and come home ?
The answer to this question is lost in a maze that would baffle the Minotaur , tangled up in so many contingencies , what - ifs , and weasel words that it would take an analyst of Alexandrian abilities to cut the Gordian Knot of this conundrum .
In taking a stab at it , however , one is forced to conclude that the term " Long War " is forbidden precisely on account of its accuracy .
Whatever contingencies will bring America ’s post - 9/11 madness to an end lie in the far future .
We ought to take seriously that U.S. general who recently said we ’re preparing to stay in Iraq for the next decade or so , regardless of the 2011 cutoff point stipulated in the recently signed U.S. - Iraq status of forces agreement [ .pdf ] .
I empathize with those who had hope for a significant change in American foreign policy , yet the evidence that we are making an even bigger
military footprint in the Middle East and Central Asia seems irrefutable .
The one hope left is that the Obamaites will really crack down on the Israelis , who are intent on building new settlements with your tax dollars , and who are moving steadily toward a particularly nasty form of ultra-nationalism , one that represents a direct threat to U.S. interests in the region .
The chances that an Israeli provocation will lead to a full - scale Iranian assault on U.S. troops stationed in Iraq are quite high at the moment , and that is one big reason for increased strains on the " special relationship . "
The Obama administration seems headed for a showdown with the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a hard - liner who , in the context of his ferociously rightist cabinet , is a relative moderate .
With Avigdor Lieberman , the Israeli version of George Lincoln Rockwell , in charge of the Foreign Ministry , it looks like we ’re going to be in for a long , bumpy ride .
Yet the Obama administration , in making a big issue out of the settlements , is paving the way for Israeli " concessions " that still leave Tel Aviv with de facto control over large swathes of Palestinian land .
Even minus the settlements , the peace plan one envisions coming from the Obamaites leaves Israel lording it over a demilitarized Palestinian castrato - state , one that acts as a kind of human shield for Israel ’s expansionist designs .
The Israelis need only agree to stop torturing their Palestinian helots quite so harshly – perhaps by letting food and medicine into Gaza – in order to successfuly goad the U.S. into provoking a war with the Iranians .
The U.S. stance on Iran is reportedly Obama ’s chief bargaining chip in his testy negotiations with Tel Aviv – a price that , if it is ever exacted , will be paid in blood , American and Iranian ( but never Israeli ) .
The fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy – a policy based on the grandiose delusion that the U.S. can and must retain hegemonic power in the world in order to ensure its own security – have n’t changed a single iota .
According to our commander in chief , that fanatics are plotting against America in a cave somewhere in Waziristan is reason enough to launch a decades - long occupation and nation - building project in the wilds of Central Asia .
As long as these baddies find a " safe haven " for their plotting , there is no country in the world that ’s safe from a future as a battle zone .
This is the Bush doctrine of preemptive warfare carried to its logical , Bizarro World conclusion : in keeping the peace we must invade and conquer the world .
What has changed , however , is the willingness of the American people to put up with an " overseas contingency operation " without end .
Therefore the Obamaites have to tread very carefully , even as they carry out the same old policies under a freshly minted rubric , mindful that the natives are already getting restless , albeit not quite yet as restless as Ted Rall .
I remember way back when Rall ’s rhetoric was considered radical ; the Iraq war , he averred , was " a war waged under false pretexts by a fictional coalition led by an ersatz president . "
In 2003 and thereabouts , when news announcers had yet to take off their flag lapel buttons and Phil Donahue was getting unceremoniously ousted from the airwaves , Rall was accurately calling the Iraq war as lost and demanding Bush ’s prosecution as a war criminal .
In those dark days , Rall ’s views – quite aside from his style – were considered beyond - the - pale radicalism .
Today , we have members of Congress , including the speaker , calling for what amounts to a war crimes tribunal to sit in judgment on Bush administration officials .
Yesterday ’s radicalism , in this instance , is today ’s growing consensus .
Similarly , I believe , Rall ’s recent piece calling for the president to resign on account of his serial betrayals , especially on the foreign policy front , will prove to be a prophetic reading of the zeitgeist to come .
I agree with Katrina van den Heuvel , editor of The Nation , who , in an interview with Antiwar.com ’s Scott Horton , compared Obama to another Democratic president with a liberal domestic agenda who got bogged down in a no-win , no - sense war : Lyndon Baines Johnson .
The War Party , driven from power by the Bush defeat , has regrouped and had a makeover : in their new guise as nation - building humanitarians , they ’re not making war – they ’re conducting an Overseas Contingency Operation .
Instead of the damn - the - torpedoes approach taken by his predecessor , this president is not averse to euphemism and what passes for subtlety in pursuing the very same ends .
Yet the real contingency here is the patience of the American people , which is fast coming to an end .
How long the Obamaites can delay the inevitable revolt is a matter of pure speculation .
However , I ’m willing to bet it ’ll be sooner than they fear .
Israel 's education ministry has ordered the removal of the word nakba – Arabic for the " catastrophe " of the 1948 war – from a school textbook for young Arab children , it has been announced .
The decision – which will alter books aimed at eight - and nine - year - old Arab pupils – will be seen as a blunt assertion by Binyamin Netanyahu 's Likud - led government of Israel 's historical narrative over the Palestinian one .
The term nakba has a similar resonance for Palestinians as the Hebrew word shoah – normally used to describe the Nazi Holocaust – does for Israelis and Jews .
Its inclusion in a book for the children of Arabs , who make up about a fifth of the Israeli population , drives at the heart of a polarised debate over what Israelis call their " war of independence " : the 1948 conflict which secured the Jewish state after the British left Palestine , and led to the flight of 700,000 Palestinians , most of whom became refugees .
Netanyahu spoke for many Jewish Israelis two years ago when he argued that using the word nakba in Arab schools was tantamount to spreading propaganda against Israel .
Palestinians have always maintained that the 1948 refugees were the victims of Israeli " ethnic cleansing " .
But in recent years a new generation of revisionist Israeli historians has rejected the old official narrative that the Palestinians , supported by the neighbouring Arab states , were responsible for their own misfortune .
Reflecting those changing perceptions , Ehud Olmert , Israel 's last prime minister and leader of the centrist Kadima party , referred to Palestinian " suffering " at the Annapolis peace conference in 2007 .
Netanyahu 's Likud takes a different view .
" There is no reason to present the creation of the Israeli state as a catastrophe in an official teaching programme , " said the education minister , Gideon Saar .
" The objective of the education system is not to deny the legitimacy of our state , nor promote extremism among Arab - Israelis . "
There was bitter controversy in 2007 when nakba was introduced into a book for use in Arab schools only , by the then education minister , Yuli Tamir of the centre - left Labour party .
" In no country in the world does an educational curriculum refer to the creation of the country as a ' catastrophe ' , " Saar told MPs in the Knesset yesterday .
" There is a difference between referring to specific tragedies that take place in a war – either against the Jewish or Arab population – as catastrophes , and referring to the creation of the state as a catastrophe . "
Arab MP Hana Sweid accused the government of " nakba denial " .
The follow - up committee for Arab education said : " Palestinian - Arab society in Israel has every right to preserve its collective memory , including in its school curriculums . "
Jafar Farrah , director of Mossawa ( Equality ) , an Israeli - Arab advocacy group , told Reuters the decision to excise the term nakba only " complicated the conflict " .
He called it an attempt to distort the truth and seek confrontation with the country 's Arab population .
Yossi Sarid , a dovish former education minister , said the decision showed insecurity .
" Zionism has already won in many ways , and can afford to be more confident , " he said .
" We need not be afraid of a word . "
Israeli Arab activists have also pledged to carry on marking Nakba Day in the face of planned legislation that would withhold government money from institutions that fund activity deemed detrimental to the state .
These include commemorating the nakba – on the same day as Independence Day – " rejecting Israel 's existence as the state of the Jewish people " and supporting an " armed struggle or terrorist acts " against Israel .
An initial version proposed by the far - right foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman would have banned all Nakba commemorations and carried sentences of up to three years in prison .
By the book
Japan has long been criticised for toning down aspects of its wartime atrocities in textbooks , particularly the Nanjing massacre and use of sex slaves .
Russia has taken up Soviet techniques of airbrushing history , a book being banned two years ago for positing that Vladimir Putin had established an " authoritarian dictatorship " .
A decade after Nelson Mandela 's release from prison , black schoolchildren in South Africa were still studying textbooks that extolled the voortrekkers and offered only minimal explanations of their own history .
In Britain it was an exam paper that caused offence when a poem by Carol Ann Duffy containing referencing knife crime was removed from the GCSE syllabus .
The Carol Ann Duffy poem began : " Today I am going to kill something .
Anything ./
I have had enough of being ignored and today / I am going to play God . "
The desertion of advertising dollars from the ailing print media industry has left publishers searching for more of the one thing that the Internet seems intent on denying them : paying customers .
Print publications in the US and Europe are scrambling to find ways to charge somebody — readers , link aggregators , blogs , competitors — for deriving any sort of benefit from the reporting they 're doing .
A group of European publishers has recently released a declaration of principles , the " Hamburg Declaration , " that amounts to a long - winded rant against the Internet for stealing their news .
They want the government to step in and fix the situation by force of law .
Most of the statements in the relatively short declaration , which will surely take its place among thousands of other European declarations on intellectual property and other matters that have come out over the past few years , hinge on the idea that " universal access to news " does not equal " free . "
In this respect , the publishers want to maintain the democratic ideal of a " fourth estate " that provides news to an informed citizenry , while simultaneously restricting access to that news to those who can pay for it directly .
What sets this declaration apart from the other Hamburg declarations out there , or from the various Geneva declarations or Berlin declarations , is that this one is intended to give the publishers ' favorite solution to the news - stealing problem , the Automated Content Access Protocol , the force of law .
ACAP is a metadata standard that 's a bit like robots .
txt — but on illegal steroids that cause anger management issues and can precipitate bouts of violence and heart problems .
The standard aims to dictate how search engines and other aggregators handle a publisher 's content by defining usage rights that third parties are supposed to respect ( more on this below ) .
But because search engines have rejected ACAP in favor of their own news metadata solutions , the publishers are asking the EU to step in and mandate it outright :
" We need search engines to recognize ACAP as a step towards acknowledging that content providers have the right to decide what happens to their content and on what terms , " said the Chairman of ACAP , Gavin O'Reilly .
" The European Commission and other legislators call on our industry constantly to come up with solutions — here we have one and we call upon the regulators to back it up " .
Google to ACAP : let 's try Rich Snippets instead
In a takedown of ACAP last year , our own Ryan Paul described the faults of the publisher - backed system as follows :
The problem , however , is that ACAP expands beyond the scope of indexing and also stipulates restrictions on the manner in which content is conveyed ...
ACAP can describe restrictions on the number of words that third parties are permitted to display in a text snippet , prohibit annotations like user ratings or tags , prohibit conversion to alternate formats like PDF , limit the use of typographical style and formatting changes , restrict translation , insist that the content can only be displayed in a frame that replicates the exact conditions of the original source , or impose a number of other equally bizarre requirements .
Implementation of ACAP is trivial for publishers , but it would put a real burden on indexing engines , which would have to accommodate a potentially huge range of rules and display formats .
So instead of ACAP , Google has put forth its own news metadata standards that are intended to serve the reader , and has invited others to suggest their own such standards .
Google 's " Rich Snippets , " announced in May , include information like user ratings , content samples , and data that publishers would like to share with Google users .
More recently , the AP and Media Standards Trust have also announced a new metadata format , called Value Added News , which appears to live somewhere between Rich Snippets and ACAP on the reader - friendly vs. publisher - friendly scale , in that it contains rights information on the content as well as snippets of text that can be republished by aggregators .
But given that the AP would apparently prefer restrictions on bloggers ' use of basic AP facts and reporting , and given the organization 's track record with trying to charge money for quotes over a few words in length , a fair amount of skepticism towards VAN is warranted .
Twitter : sort of like the old AP wire , but with more hype
It does indeed seem likely that readers are going to have to pay more for some types of content , at least while advertising dollars continue to be scarce .
But the billion dollar question for news organizations is , what type of content will readers pay for ?
I can't say what the answer to that is , but I know what the answer probably is not : short , bare - facts wire stories intended to break news about major happenings .
A case in point was the Pentagon 's recent panic - inciting photo - op / flyover of the Statue of Liberty .
Like most of the Internet , I heard about this first on Twitter , and the mainstream news orgs were left to " break " the story by getting the facts off of Twitter and blogs and then turning those facts into a news story — with or without the addition of some extra legwork .
Take a look at our summary of the 1918 " hot news " case that spawned the " misappropriation " doctrine that the AP recently cited in its efforts to police the Internet 's use of its " scoops " :
In 1918 , the AP was involved in a case called International News Service v. Associated Press .
Like current competitor All Headline , INS did n't actually copy AP 's stories .
Instead , they 'd snatch AP 's hot wartime scoops off the wire , have a hired hack rewrite the story in his own words , and put out their own version of the breaking news without having to bear all the overhead ( not to mention the considerable risk ) of sending trained reporters to a war zone .
I 'm the last person who wants to add to the Twitter hype , but copying the news off the wire and doing a write - through sounds a whole lot like what the big news orgs do to Twitter when a pop star dies or military jets overfly NYC .
My point is that a lot of really big , hot news is now effectively free - as - in - speech , and this will make it very hard for publishers to justify charging for it , or for readers to justify paying for this type of ephemeral , " just the facts " news .
So while the AP and Media Standards Trust are right to focus on " value add , " unfortunately for them , " value " that readers will pay for increasingly does not include the bare facts of major events .
Donald Knuth , distinguished computer scientist , recipient of the Turing Award , creator of the TeX computer typesetting system , and author of The Art of Computer Programming , which some call the Bible of computer programming , has submitted a letter [ PDF ] to the European Patent Office for submission to the EPO 's Enlarged Board of Appeal considering the question of software patents and whether they should be allowed in Europe .
Here 's his view : Basically I remain convinced that the patent policy most fair and most suitable for the world will regard mathematical ideas ( such as algorithms ) to be not subject to proprietary patent rights .
He attaches a letter he wrote in 1994 to the US Patent and Trademark Office , explaining why software patents were -- and would be -- so damaging .
How true his words proved to be .
Here 's a snippet : I am told that the courts are trying to make a distinction between mathematical algorithms and nonmathematical algorithms .
To a computer scientist , this makes no sense , because every algorithm is as mathematical as anything could be .
Ah !
But will the EPO listen ?
Here 's why it should , from the introduction to Wikipedia 's article about Knuth : Knuth has been called the " father " of the analysis of algorithms , contributing to the development of , and systematizing formal mathematical techniques for , the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms , and in the process popularizing asymptotic notation .
In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science , Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system , the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system , and the Computer Modern family of typefaces .
A prolific writer and scholar , Knuth created the WEB / CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming , and designed the MMIX instruction set architecture .
If he says algorithms are math , I 'd say he should know .
Now extrapolate .
If they are math , are they patentable ?
Should they be ?
He says no , if you continue with the letter :
Nor is it possible to distinguish between " numerical " and " nonnumerical " algorithms , as if numbers were somehow different from other kinds of precise information .
All data are numbers , and all numbers are data .
Mathematicians work much more with symbolic entities than with numbers .
Therefore the idea of passing laws that say some kinds of algorithms belong to mathematics and some do not strikes me as absurd as the 19th century attempts of the Indiana legislature to pass a law that the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter is exactly 3 , not approximately 3.1416 .
It 's like the medieval church ruling that the sun revolves about the earth .
Man -made laws can be significantly helpful but not when they contradict fundamental truths .
Congress wisely decided long ago that mathematical things cannot be patented .
Surely nobody could apply mathematics if it were necessary to pay a license fee whenever the theorem of Pythagoras is employed .
The basic algorithmic ideas that people are now rushing to patent are so fundamental , the result threatens to be like what would happen if we allowed authors to have patents on individual words and concepts .
Novelists or journalists would be unable to write stories unless their publishers had permission from the owners of the words .
Algorithms are exactly as basic to software as words are to writers , because they are the fundamental building blocks needed to make interesting products .
If only they had listened to him then !
And what a mess the US patent system has become , because they did not listen .
Hopefully , Europe will not make the same mistake .
You can find the other amicus briefs and letters submitted to the EPO here , and I 'll be publishing several of them here on Groklaw in time , to show more reasons why software patents are viewed as so harmful by programmers , those most directly impacted by whatever decision the EPO 's Enlarged Board of Appeal reaches .
Remember when patent attorney Gene Quinn wrote that software is n't math ?
I see absolutely no justification for all software to be considered unpatentable subject matter because it is simply not correct to say that software code is the equivalent of a mathematical equation or a mathematical algorithm .
Employing the same logical structure is certainly wise , and complies with best practice standards for programming , but at the core computer software directs .
The code is a series of instructions written using mathematical logic as its foundation .
In the patent arena this does not and cannot mean that the patenting of software is the equivalent of patenting mathematics .
It merely means that the instructions are written in a language and format that are heavily influenced by mathematics .
Well , Knuth would know better than we would what an algorithm is , I think , but even if we accept what Quinn wrote , it does n't actually help his argument .
If software code is " a series of instructions " then it 's like a manual , in which case it 's deserving of copyright , like any book .
Can you patent a manual ?
Is it an invention ?
I will present both Knuth letters now in full , and we 'll add another attachment , an interview with him on this same subject , as soon as we are able to finish transcribing it .
Here are both letters : ************************

80298 Munich , Germany Dear Ms Brimelow , A friend in Europe just told me that you are interested in " amicus curiae " letters to explain why so many computer scientists around the world have long been alarmed about patent trends , and that you hope to receive them by 30 April .
I hope this letter reaches you in time ; I could not send it by FedEx , having no complete address .
Enclosed is a copy of a letter that I wrote to the US Patent Commissioner in 1994 ; I believe it is self explanatory .
Also enclosed is the transcript of a talk I gave at the Technical University of Munich in 2001 , where I gave a somewhat more nuanced view of extremely unusual cases in which algorithms or even mathematical constants might conceivably be patentable in my view .
[ The latter remarks occur near the end of a rather long lecture ; I have highlighted the relevant information , on page 324 , for your convenience . ]
Basically I remain convinced that the patent policy most fair and most suitable for the world will regard mathematical ideas ( such as algorithms ) to be not subject to proprietary patent rights .
For example , it would be terrible if somebody were to have a patent on an integer , like say 1009 , so that nobody would be able to use that number " with further technical effect " without paying for a license .
Although many software patents have unfortunately already been granted in the past , I hope that this practice will not continue in future .
If Europe leads the way in this , I expect many Americans would want to emigrate so that they could continue to innovate in peace .

[ Telephone ] February 23 , 1994 Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks
Box 4
Patent and Trademark Office
Washington , DC 20231 Dear Commissioner :
Along with many other computer scientists , I would like to ask you to reconsider the current policy of giving patents for computational processes .
I find a considerable anxiety throughout the community of practicing computer scientists that decisions by the patent courts and the Patent and Trademark Office are making life much more difficult for programmers .
In the period 1945 - 1980 , it was generally believed that patent law did not pertain to software .
However , it now appears that some people have received patents for algorithms of practical importance -- e.g. , Lempel - Ziv compression and RSA public key encryption -- and are now legally preventing other programmers from using those algorithms .
This is a serious change from the previous policy under which the computer revolution became possible , and I fear this change will be harmful for society .
It certainly would have had profoundly negative effect on my own work :
For example , I developed software called TEX that is now used to produce more than 90 % of all books and journals in mathematics and physics and to produce hundreds of thousands of technical reports in all scientific disciplines .
If software patents had been commonplace in 1980 , I would not have been able to create such a system , nor would I probably have ever thought of doing it , nor can I imagine anyone else doing so .
I am told that the courts are trying to make a distinction between mathematical algorithms and nonmathematical algorithms .
To a computer scientist , this makes no sense , because every algorithm is as mathematical as anything could be .
An algorithm is an abstract concept unrelated to physical laws of the universe .
Nor is it possible to distinguish between " numerical " and " nonnumerical " algorithms , as if numbers were somehow different from other kinds of precise information .
All data are numbers , and all numbers are data .
Mathematicians work much more with symbolic entities than with numbers .
To Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks - February 23 , 1994 - Page 2
Therefore the idea of passing laws that say some kinds of algorithms belong to mathematics and some do not strikes me as absurd as the 19th century attempts of the Indiana legislature to pass a law that the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter is exactly 3 , not approximately 3.1416 .

Novelists or journalists would be unable to write stories unless their publishers had permission from the owners of the words .
Algorithms are exactly as basic to software as words are to writers , because they are the fundamental building blocks needed to make interesting products .
What would happen if individual lawyers could patent their methods of defense , or if Supreme Court justices could patent their precedents ?
I realize that the patent courts try their best to serve society when they formulate patent law .
The Patent Office has fulfilled this mission admirably with respect to aspects of technology that involve concrete laws of physics rather than abstract laws of thought .
I myself have a few patents on hardware devices .
But I strongly believe that the recent trend to patenting algorithms is of benefit only to a very small number of attorneys and inventors , while it is seriously harmful to the vast majority of people who want to do useful things with computers .
When I think of the computer programs I require daily to get my own work done , I cannot help but realize that none of them would exist today if software patents had been prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s .
Changing the rules now will have the effect of freezing progress at essentially its current level .
If present trends continue , the only recourse available to the majority of America 's brilliant software developers will be to give up software or to emigrate .
The U.S.A. will soon lose its dominant position .
Please do what you can to reverse this alarming trend .
There are far better ways to protect the intellectual property rights of software developers than to take away their right to use fundamental building blocks .

HTTP is one of the simpler protocols to implement for communication between computers .
On the iPhone , since there are no APIs for data synchronization or file sharing , embedding an HTTP server is one of the best ways to transfer data from your iPhone application to a computer .
In this post I 'll show you how to write your own simple but extensible HTTP server .
The server classes will also work on Mac OS X ( Cocoa un- Touched ) .
Introduction
In this post I will present the following sample application :
The application is very simple : you can edit text and save it to a file ( it is always saved to the same file ) .
While the application is running , it also runs an HTTP server on port 8080 .
If the path " / " is requested , it will return the content of the saved file .
All other requests return a 501 error .
To transfer the text file from the iPhone application , just enter the IP address of the phone followed by " :8080 " in any web browser .
HTTPServer and HTTPResponseHandler classes
The approach I use for an HTTP server involves two classes : the server ( which listens for connections and reads data up to the end of the HTTP header ) and the response handler ( which sends the response and may choose to read from the connection past the header ) .
The key design choice for me was simplicity of each new response implementation : the server and response classes are designed so that a new response implementation need only implement three methods :
canHandleRequest:method:url:headerFields : — to decide if the implementation can handle a specific request
— to decide if the implementation can handle a specific request startResponse — to begin writing ( or completely write ) the response
— to begin writing ( or completely write ) the response load — all subclasses should implement the standard +[ NSObject load ] method to register themselves with the base class
It is just a tiny HTTP server but the approach should allow you to quickly integrate HTTP communications into any application .
Opening a socket for listening
Most server communications , HTTP included , begin by creating a socket for listening .
Sockets in Cocoa can be created and configured entirely using the BSD sockets code but it 's often marginally easier to use the CoreFoundation CFSocket API where possible .
Unfortunately , that only makes it marginally easier — we still have a large block of boilerplate code to throw down just to open a socket .
From the - [ HTTPServer start ] method :
socket = CFSocketCreate ( kCFAllocatorDefault , PF_INET , SOCK_STREAM , IPPROTO_TCP , 0 , NULL , NULL ) ; if ( ! socket ) { [ self errorWithName : @ " Unable to create socket . " ] ; return ; } int reuse = true ; int fileDescriptor = CFSocketGetNative ( socket ) ; if ( setsockopt ( fileDescriptor , SOL_SOCKET , SO_REUSEADDR , ( void * ) & reuse , sizeof ( int ) ) != 0 ) { [ self errorWithName : @ " Unable to set socket options . " ] ; return ; } struct sockaddr_in address ; memset ( & address , 0 , sizeof ( address ) ) ; address .
sin_len = sizeof ( address ) ; address .
sin_family = AF_INET ; address .
sin_addr .
s_addr = htonl ( INADDR_ANY ) ; address .
sin_port = htons ( HTTP_SERVER_PORT ) ; CFDataRef addressData = CFDataCreate ( NULL , ( const UInt8 * ) & address , sizeof ( address ) ) ; [( id ) addressData autorelease ] ; if ( CFSocketSetAddress ( socket , addressData ) != kCFSocketSuccess ) { [ self errorWithName : @ " Unable to bind socket to address . " ] ; return ; }
This is a large block of code but it 's really only doing one thing : opening a socket to listen for TCP connections on the port specified by HTTP_SERVER_PORT ( which is 8080 for this application ) .
There is some additional work because I like to specify SO_REUSEADDR .
This lets us reclaim the port if it is open but idle ( a common occurrence if we restart the program immediately after a crash or killing the application ) .
Receiving incoming connections
After the socket is setup , Cocoa handles a little more of the work so things get easier .
We can receive each incoming connection by constructing an NSFileHandle from the fileDescriptor above and listening for connection notifications
From the -[ HTTPServer start : ] method ( immediately below the previous code ) :
listeningHandle = [ [ NSFileHandle alloc ] initWithFileDescriptor : fileDescriptor closeOnDealloc : YES ] ; [ [ NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter ] addObserver : self selector : @selector ( receiveIncomingConnectionNotification :) name : NSFileHandleConnectionAcceptedNotification object : nil ] ; [ listening Handle acceptConnectionInBackgroundAndNotify ] ;
When receiveIncomingConnectionNotification : is invoked , each new incoming connection will get its own NSFileHandle .
If you 're keeping track , that was :
1 file handle ( listening Handle ) manually created from the socket fileDesriptor to listen on the socket for new connections .
) manually created from the socket to listen on the socket for new connections .
1 file handle automatically created for each new connection received through listening Handle .
We 'll continue to listen to these new handles ( the keys in the incoming Requests dictionary ) to record the data for each connection .
So , now that we 've received a new , automatically created file handle , we create a CFHTTPMessageRef ( which will store the incoming data ) we receive over the file handle .
We store these as the objects in incomingRequests dictionary to allow easy access to the CFHTTPMessageRef for each file handle
The CFHTTPMessageRef is both storage and the parser for the incoming data .
We can invoke CFHTTPMessageIsHeaderComplete ( ) every time we add data to check when the HTTP headers are complete and we can spawn a response handler .
The response handler is spawned in the -[ HTTPServer receiveIncomingDataNotification : ] method :
if ( CFHTTPMessageIsHeaderComplete ( incomingRequest ) ) { HTTPResponseHandler * handler = [ HTTPResponseHandler handlerForRequest : incomingRequest fileHandle : incomingFileHandle server : self ] ; [ responseHandlers addObject : handler ] ; [ self stopReceivingForFileHandle : incomingFileHandle close : NO ] ; [ handler startResponse ] ; return ; }
The server stops listening to the file handle for the connection at this point but it does n't close it , since the file handle is passed to the HTTPResponseHandler so that the HTTP response can be sent back over the same file handle .
Flexible response handling
Exactly which subclass the +[ HTTPResponseHandler handlerForRequest:fileHandle:server :] method chooses to return determines the entire content of the response .
It does this by iterating over a priority ordered array of the registered handlers and asking each one if it wants to handle the request .
+ ( Class ) handlerClassForRequest : ( CFHTTPMessageRef ) aRequest method : ( NSString * ) requestMethod url : ( NSURL * ) requestURL headerFields : ( NSDictionary * ) requestHeaderFields { for ( Class handlerClass in registered Handlers ) { if ( [ handlerClass canHandleRequest : aRequest method : requestMethod url : requestURL headerFields : requestHeaderFields ] ) { return handlerClass ; } } return nil ; }
For this to work , all HTTPResponseHandler s need to be registered with the base class .
The easiest way to do this is to add an implementation of the + [ NSObject load ] method to every subclass :
+ ( void ) load { [ HTTPResponseHandler registerHandler : self ] ; }
In the sample application , the only response handler other than the default is the AppTextFileResponse .
This class chooses to handle the response when the requestURL is equal to " / " .
From the AppTextFileResponse class :
+ ( BOOL ) canHandleRequest : ( CFHTTPMessageRef ) aRequest method : ( NSString * ) requestMethod url : ( NSURL * ) requestURL headerFields : ( NSDictionary * ) requestHeaderFields { if ( [ requestURL . path isEqualToString : @ " / " ] ) { return YES ; } return NO ; }
AppTextFileResponse then handles the entire response synchronously ( before returning from the startResponse method ) by writing the text file saved by the application as the response body .
- ( void ) startResponse { NSData * fileData = [ NSData dataWithContentsOfFile :[ AppTextFileResponse pathForFile ] ] ; CFHTTPMessageRef response = CFHTTPMessageCreateResponse ( kCFAllocatorDefault , 200 , NULL , kCFHTTPVersion1_1 ) ; CFHTTPMessageSetHeaderFieldValue ( response , ( CFStringRef ) @ " Content - Type " , ( CFStringRef ) @ " text / plain " ) ; CFHTTPMessageSetHeaderFieldValue ( response , ( CFStringRef ) @ " Connection " , ( CFStringRef ) @ " close " ) ; CFHTTPMessageSetHeaderFieldValue ( response , ( CFStringRef ) @ " Content - Length " , ( CFStringRef ) [ NSString stringWithFormat : @ " %ld " , [ fileData length ] ] ) ; CFDataRef headerData = CFHTTPMessageCopySerializedMessage ( response ) ; @try { [ fileHandle writeData :( NSData * ) headerData ] ; [ fileHandle writeData : fileData ] ; } @catch ( NSException * exception ) { //
Ignore the exception , it normally just means the client // closed the connection from the other end .
} @finally { CFRelease ( headerData ) ; [ server closeHandler : self ] ; } }
The [ server closeHandler : self ] ; invocation tells the server to remove this HTTPResponseHandler from the set of active handlers .
The server will invoke endReponse when it removes this handler ( which is where we close the connection — since this handler does not support keep - alive ) .
Work not implemented
The biggest task not handled in this implementation is parsing the HTTP request body .
The reason for this is that a general HTTP body solution is very complicated .
The body 's size may be specified by the Content - Length header but it need not be — so knowing where the body ends can be difficult .
The body may also be encoded in one of about a dozen different Transfer - Encoding s , including chunk , quoted - printable , base64 , gzip — each of which require different processing .
However , I have never needed to implement a generic solution .
It is normally easiest to determine what is needed for your specific needs and handle the HTTP body in accordance with those needs .
You can handle the request body by overriding -[ HTTPRequestHandler receiveIncomingDataNotification : ] .
The default implementation ignores all data it receives after the HTTP request headers .
Data handling note : the first time the - [ HTTPRequestHandler receiveIncomingDataNotification : ] method is called , the initial bytes of the HTTP body will already have been read from the fileHandle and appended to the request instance variable .
If you need to read the body , either continue reading into the request object , or remember to include this initial data .
Another task not handled are Keep - Alive connections .
These also need to be handled in -[ HTTPRequestHandler receiveIncomingDataNotification : ] and I 've left a big comment on the method about what would be involved .
The reality is that it 's probably easier to set the Connection header field to close for every response to tell the client that you 're not going to handle Keep - Alive ( see the startResponse code sample above for an example ) .
The HTTPReseponseHandler priority does not take the requested Content - Type into account .
If this is an important consideration for you , you might want to change how +[ HTTPResponseHandler handlerClassForRequest:method:url:headerFields :] selects its handler .
Finally , this server does not handle SSL / TLS .
It is intended for local network transfers where the network itself is relatively secure .
If you are transferring over the open internet and want a secure connection , there 's a lot to change and manage at the socket level .
You could try it yourself but if security is really important , you probably should n't risk writing your own server — if you can arrange it , use a mature , TLS - enabled HTTP server and only handle the client - side in your application .
Client - side security in Cocoa is very easy — it is automatic and transparent in CFReadStream and NSURLConnection .
Conclusion
Download the sample app TextTransfer.zip ( 45 kB ) which includes the HTTPServer and HTTPResponseHandler classes .
Just because mainstream HTTP servers are large , complex pieces of software , does n't mean an HTTP server is necessarily large and complex — the core implementation here is only two classes , yet is flexible and configurable .
Of course , the end result is not intended for use as a complete web server solution , however it should work well as a small communications portal into your custom iPhone or Mac applications .
Now that you have your batch of solar cells you must determine if each cell has tabbing on the busbar .
If if does continue to the next step .
If your cell has no tabbing you must first use a pencil eraser to clean the surface of the busbar .
Use a gentle hand as poly and monocrystalline cells are extremely fragile .
Rubbing too hard will break the cell .
Some of the dark spots on the busbar will hinder the solder from sticking so try to get these off .
Do n't go crazy if you can't , as long as a descent amount of solder sticks you are OK .
The more you use the eraser the better .
Next you must tin your soldering iron with a nice blob of solder , and wait a few seconds until it stops smoking ( some of the rosin burns off ) , then run it down the busbar .
Do n't beat yourself if you can't get every spot to stick as long as you can get a few spots you 're good .
Now cut a piece of tabbing and use your soldering iron to melt the tabbing into the tinned busbar .
Do n't press down too hard let the soldering iron do the job .
Thats why I suggest using a 25 watt minimum soldering iron so that you do n't feel the need to press down on the cell so much .
Now that you tinned and tabbed your first cell continue and do the rest .
Now you must solder a lead to the back of the cell .
Most polycrystalline cells have a dark area on the back , this is where you solder to .
MonoCrystalline cells usually have small squares where you need to solder to .
Just like before start by tinning your soldering iron with a good blob of solder and apply it to the underside of the cell directly under the busbar ( makes it easier to line up the cells later ) .
Then cut a small 1.5 inch of tabbing and melt it into the solder .
now that you have your leads soldered to the cell you are ready to move on to the next step .

Joe 's story is the iconic American tale .
He 's a patriot who became instantly famous for simply asking a question that millions of us wanted asked .
As my friend Sean Hannity would say , Joe is a great American ! -- Mike Gallagher , Syndicated Talk Radio
Yes , " Joe " the " Plumber " has " written " a book .
What strikes me about that promotional blurb , taken from its Amazon page , is what it implies about our national standards : these days , it is apparently instant fame that confers status as an iconic American .
In order to be " a great American , " one need no longer distinguish oneself by achievements in commerce , science or the arts , nor display valor on the battlefield , nor serve fellow citizens as an exceptional leader .
On the populist right , asking a question is now a sufficient achievement to be a great American .
And the unironic metric for measuring a good question ?
How successfully it spreads in the 24 hour news cycle .
It is disconcerting that Mike Gallagher 's blurb was chosen due to a belief that it would make the book appealing to the widest possible audience on the right .
My faith in the conservative base 's ability to elevate credible leaders wanes daily .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Oh how did we miss this latest entry into Certified Crazy TM arguments against same - sex marriage ?
Please join us in adding “ It will hurt women !
And make all men gay ! ” to our growing list of nonsense theories — and place it alongside the “ It will hurt black families ” farce .
Do n’t act surprised when you learn it ’s a conservative religious type trying to convince you same - sex marriage will hurt women .
Beliefnet columnist David Klinghoffer , who declares himself not to be a Biblical scholar , quotes from Israel ’s Bar - Ilan University professor Joshua Berman .
We ’ll reprint Berman ’s argument below , but here ’s the gist :
Those crazy gays are n’t just after same - sex marriage , but want mainstream homosexuality — sorry , homoeroticism — so one day Little Billy grows up in a world where men are engaged in romps with other men simply because it ’s just so normal , and not because , uh , they ’re sexually attracted to other men .
Let history be our teacher !
[ W ] ere I a woman , I would be concerned by the tide of legislation now sweeping our country .
[ Ed : You know you ’re entering problem territory when a man tries to adopt the mindset of a woman . ]
To see how these ancient writings demonstrate that feminism and homosexuality are on a collision course , we need to first take a step back and consider the end - game of the gay and lesbian movement .
The immediate aim is to win in the courts .
But the ultimate aim is to win over the culture : to arrive at a day when homoeroticism is fully accepted .
[ Ed : Yes , we want gay sexy time all the time !
That is our goal . ]
Let ’s fast - forward the video - tape and see what that day would look like .
Johnny , a teenager , has pals who date boys and pals who date girls .
In the movies , on billboards , Johnny sees depictions of men in love with men and of men in love with women .
Johnny admires the picture in his principal ’s office of the principal and his husband on their honeymoon .
In this day , no one uses the word “ homosexual ” anymore , in just the same way that today no one uses the word “ negro ” — it ’s so laden with the baggage of yesteryear ’s bigotry .
In fact , in this day , no one makes a big deal about sexual orientation at all .
Johnny knows that when he seeks intimacy he is free to choose a blonde , a brunette , a Latina , a Phillipino , a guy , a girl ; it ’s all cool .
Free choice and tolerance take the day .

Because of what you read in the the writers of imperial Rome .
Some people are indeed homoerotic by nature .
But others , as Aristotle noted , develop this as an acquired passion .
Homoeroticism is , to a large degree , socially constructed .
It turns out that where homoeroticism is granted full social sanction , as it was in Rome , it flourishes — so much so , that one writer noted that the emperor Claudius exhibited an unusual trait : he was sexually interested in women alone !
Men , we learn from ancient Rome , will enjoy sex with other men , if there is no social censure .
Now , all of this should be fine for us as well — after all , we should let free choice and tolerance reign .
The real problems begin , however , when we read what these writers had to say about marriage .
Consider this piece from the first century BCE poet Catullus ( Carmen 61:134-141 ) , in which the poet addresses himself to a bridegroom on the eve of his nuptials : “ You are said to find it hard , Perfumed bridegroom , to give up Smooth - skinned boys , but give them up …
We realize you ’ve only known Permitted pleasures : husbands , though , Have no right to the same pleasures . ”
The social history behind this piece is clear : once they ’ve experienced sex with other men , Catullus tells us , men are unsatisfied with what their new wives provide them .
Notice that the poet is unconcerned about the husband ’s dallying with other women — it ’s the other men around that threaten the marital union .
[ Ed : Even if that argument held any water , we ’re pretty sure Romans did a fine job procreating . ]
You read all that correctly :
Once we get this country to a point where gays are accepted , all men will want to screw other dudes , simply because they know somebody who does it .
Having no real attraction to another dude ’s genitals be damned !
And this means men will leave their wives and girlfriends and mistresses and take up with other men and leave all the women in America alone , childless , and miserable .
Everytime we shoot ’em down , opponents just keep creating new far - fetched scare tactics .
But fairytales are fun to read .
The gang also left its mark in Australia and Japan
Six " intelligent and well - educated " Australians have been jailed for causing damage put at £ 70,000 during a six - month graffiti spree in London .
The men targeted Tube and overground trains , Southwark Crown Court heard .
The graffiti artists , who all admitted criminal damage , were caught in Ilford , east London , by police officers who heard rattling cans and smelt paint .
Sentencing , Judge Michael Gledhill said it was " appalling " to see " talented " graffiti artists sitting in the dock .
Ringleader of the graffiti gang - called the AMF - Marcus Wisman , 22 , was sentenced to 16 months for conspiracy to commit criminal damage .
' Talented artists '
Scott Mulhearn , 21 , Adrian Hing , 22 , Luke Vassell , 23 , Jack Shumack , 24 , and Alex Wisman , 24 , were also jailed over the vandalism attacks between late summer and Boxing Day last year .
Mulhearn received 14 months imprisonment , Shumack and Hing were both sentenced to 12 months , Vassell received a 10 - month sentence and Alex Wisman was jailed for eight months .
The court heard that each of the men has an interest in graphic art .
Marcus Wisman , Shumack , Hing and Vassell have all either worked as graphic designers or hope to train to do so .
Sentencing , Judge Gledhill said : " Each of you are intelligent well - educated young men , hard working and capable of holding down jobs .
" Each of you are talented artists , in terms of graffiti artists , so to have to see the six of you sitting in the dock of this court about to be sentenced is quite appalling . "
All of the men will serve half their sentence on licence and will not face deportation .
British Transport Police detectives found photographic evidence that the gang had also left its mark in Australia and Japan .

The wombat 's plant diet makes its droppings suitable for paper - making Wombat droppings are helping an industrial city in Australia fight the effects of the global financial crisis .
Burnie , in the north - west of the state of Tasmania , has been hit by repeated rounds of job cuts .
But despite the gloom , one local industry is thriving by producing handmade paper out of a material no - one else wants - wombat poo .
The novelty paper is a hit with tourists keen to buy a distinctly Australian souvenir from the area .
The wombat , a furry marsupial , lives in the wild only in Australia .
Its characteristic waddle and playful appearance , makes it one of the country 's most endearing native creatures .
' Nice organic smell '
In recent years , a company in the port city has been experimenting with paper made from kangaroo droppings - but its popularity has been eclipsed by wombat - inspired products .
Creative Paper manager Darren Simpson says the manufacturing process can be rather unpleasant .
WOMBAT FACTS Herbivorous marsupial or pouched mammal About 1 metre ( 40 in ) in length Tends to graze at night Produces cube - shaped dung Closest relative is koala " When we are boiling it , it does smell horrific as you can imagine , but once it has been sterilised and rinsed properly there 's no scent left to it .
If anything it just gives you a nice organic smell , " he said .
He added that it was the tourists themselves who came up with the wombat idea .
" As people were coming through and we were showing them the samples of our paper , they would throw questions at you like ' can you make it from sheep poo or can you make it from koalas ? ' .
And the one that kept popping up more than any other was the wombat . "
All the paper is made from the dung of a single animal called Nugget that lives in a wildlife park near Cradle Mountain , one of Tasmania 's most popular tourist destinations .
Every day Nugget 's droppings are collected by his keeper and sent off to the factory .
Wombats are herbivores and diets loaded with plant fibre make their faeces ideal for making some of Australia 's most unusual paper .

Dr. George R. Tiller had many critics , but arguably the one with the highest profile was Bill O’Reilly , the Fox News Channel host .
Mr. O’Reilly , a vocal opponent of abortion , often called him “ Tiller the baby killer ” for performing late - term abortions and said repeatedly that he had “ blood on his hands . ”
Within hours of the shooting that left Dr. Tiller dead on Sunday , Mr. O’Reilly found himself under attack from liberal journalists and bloggers who accused him of inciting violence .
By early Monday , some Web sites were asking , as a newsletter from the Air America radio network did , “ Is Bill O’Reilly to Blame for Murder Of Kansas Doctor ? ”
Mr. O’Reilly responded to the critics on his program on Monday night , saying that “ clear - thinking Americans should condemn ” the killing .
He defended his remarks about Dr. Tiller , declaring that “ every single thing we said about Tiller was true , and my analysis was based on those facts . ”
Finger - pointing is nothing new , but the nature of the accusations thrown at Mr. O’Reilly show the swiftness and vociferousness with which the blame game is now played .
Finally , I ’ve been attacked — sort of .
So far the response to my book Meltdown , a free - market look at the financial crisis , has been almost eerily favorable .
That ’s very gratifying , to be sure , but criticism is what gets debate going and pushes a given subject matter beyond its typical confines .
Until now , it ’s been hard to come by .
Even though it spent ten weeks on the New York Times bestseller list , the paper refuses to review it .
When the Times last reviewed one of my books — a review that consisted of a breathless list of forbidden things I had said , as if they refuted themselves — all it managed to do was give the book more notoriety and more sales .
Now comes a shot from left - wing blogger Matthew Yglesias , who is honest enough not to pretend to have read the book .
His attack on it comes in the context of a discussion of conservatives ’ increasing interest in something called Austrian business cycle theory .
( He notes that staffers for Rep. Michele Bachmann , R- MN , confirm that she has been reading the book , which contains a foreword by another congressman , Rep. Ron Paul . )
Woods , Yglesias declares , is “ pushing a fringe economic doctrine that tells the right what it wants to hear so he ’s gaining popularity . ”
Um , Matthew , what right - wing circles have you traveled in over the years that have “ wanted to hear ” scathing criticism of the Federal Reserve ?
How many “ right - wing ” politicians can you name that have even mentioned the Fed as a political issue over the past , oh , ninety - six years ?
But that ’s a small point .
Much more interesting is Yglesias ’ dismissal of Austrian business cycle theory ( ABCT ) as a “ fringe economic doctrine . ”
Well , according to James Galbraith , maybe 10 or 12 of the country ’s roughly 15,000 professional economists predicted the current crisis .
( Ol ’ Jimmy was n’t counting hundreds of Austrian economists , natch . )
Matt , you sure you want to use the consensus of these geniuses as your bellwether of respectability ?
Good luck with that .
I ’ve written quite a bit about ABCT , both in my book and in numerous articles , so I wo n’t repeat the theory in any detail here .
What matters for right now is that the theory , which won F.A.
Hayek the Nobel Prize in 1974 , exonerates the free market of blame for the boom - bust cycle .
Instead , the culprit is the government - established central bank ( in the American case , the Federal Reserve System ) , whose activities lead the economy into an unsustainable configuration that can seem like prosperity for a time , but which inevitably collapses in a bust when the accumulated resource misallocations reveal themselves .
( Yes , the theory can also account for booms and busts that occurred in the absence of a central bank ; see Jess Huerta de Soto ’s treatise Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles . )
Fiscal and monetary stimulus , in turn , are based on a juvenile misdiagnosis of the problem , and can only misdirect the economy still further .
Note that although Yglesias himself does not know the first thing about Austrian business cycle theory , and in fact does n’t even seem entitled to an opinion , he is certain it is incorrect .
Why ?
Because it implies that the economy is actually damaged , rather than stabilized , by our overlords .
We cannot question our overlords , citizen .
You are taking this “ question authority ” business much too far .
The Left ’s motto “ question authority ” has almost never been employed sincerely .
What it seems to mean is that we ought to question beliefs and institutions of long standing .
What it clearly does not mean is that we ought to question the beliefs and institutions that our wondrous experts have replaced them with .
Thus it never even occurs to Yglesias , the alleged progressive , to question the Fed .
Why , the Fed furnishes us with the scientific management of the money supply !
Whatever is there to question about it ?
The Fed , you see , was created when the American people spontaneously cried out for banking reform .
Their wise legislators promptly drafted legislation with an eye to the common good , thereby giving birth to the Federal Reserve , our warm and cuddly little stabilizing agent .
Absolutely nothing in the above paragraph is true , but it ’s how inhabitants of the progressive la-la land , to the extent they give any thought to the Fed at all , seem to assume it must have come about .
Now I do n’t mean to suggest that the Left wo n’t question anything authority tells them .
They ’ll question war — sometimes .
The thinking seems to run as follows .
Many foreign conflicts , like the war in Iraq , have begun when mean , self - interested people got hold of the ship of state , manipulated patriotic sentiment and pushed the country into unnecessary fighting .
However , no major institutional aspect of our domestic life could possibly be unnecessary , or the result of self - interested activity or propaganda .
While I ’m on the subject of war , how does Yglesias suppose the Iraq War — which he deeply opposed , I ’m sure — was financed ?
In considerable part by the Fed ’s creation of new money out of thin air .
Let me put this as simply as possible .
Is the federal government more or less likely to go to war , and are its wars likely to be more or less costly and destructive , if it has access to a money creation machine ?
Why is the Left , which prides itself on its intellectual independence and its willingness to question old taboos , so intellectually moribund that an obvious question like this is never even raised ?
I ’m supposed to take Yglesias and the rest of the misnamed “ progressives ” seriously when they propose to grant the government its money - creation machine but hope it does n’t use it in an anti-social or murderous way ?
That ’s just a super theory , Matt .
Not mentioned , presumably because Yglesias does n’t know anything about them , are the Cantillon effects of expansionary monetary policy .
This piece of economic knowledge reveals how the process of inflation generates wealth transfers to the politically well connected at the expense of average Americans , the vast bulk of whom do not even realize the process is taking place .
I explained the full mechanism in this earlier article I wrote on the Left ’s touching devotion to the Fed .
This is “ progressive ” how , exactly ?
When Lew Rockwell interviewed Naomi Wolf , she was honest enough to admit that she , and the Left at large , knew next to nothing about the Fed .
Not Matthew Yglesias , though , who has already learned everything he ’ll ever need to know .
And good golly , he ’s learned that the Fed is our Great Stabilizer .
No further intellectual curiosity is necessary .
Yglesias links to the usual boilerplate about the economic downturns before the Fed , a subject I ’ll bet he does n’t really know anything about apart from an inchoate sense that they were Very , Very Bad , and were ( of course ) caused by the free market .
I discuss these cases in Meltdown and a bit in this lecture .
Suffice it to say that the same precipitating factor is evident in each one of them — the creation of credit beyond the level of voluntary saving , a discombobulating process that sets in motion an inevitable process of reversal , which we experience as a recession / depression .
It ’s also worth pointing out that economic historians , as even the New York Times now admits , have caught up with Murray Rothbard on the subject of the so - called “ long depression ” of the 1870s .
Charles Morris , not a libertarian by any means , wrote in the Times not long ago that “ recent detailed reconstructions of 19th - century data by economic historians show that there was no 1870s depression : aside from a short recession in 1873 , in fact , the decade saw possibly the fastest sustained growth in American history .
Employment grew strongly , faster than the rate of immigration ; consumption of food and other goods rose across the board .
On a per capita basis , almost all output measures were up spectacularly .
By the end of the decade , people were better housed , better clothed and lived on bigger farms .
Department stores were popping up even in medium - sized cities .
America was transforming into the world ’s first mass consumer society . ”
An article I plan to write later this month will incidentally respond to the critics of ABCT whom Yglesias has haphazardly assembled , though there is little need to reinvent the wheel : most of them have been abundantly replied to already , though Yglesias probably just forgot to include the replies .
Just for starters , here are Mish on Krugman ’s criticism of ABCT and Robert Murphy on Krugman ’s criticism of ABCT .
In addition , here ’s Bob replying to Tyler Cowen and explaining why Krugman ’s capital theory , if we can call it that , is too primitive for him even to comprehend ABCT .
( You can listen to Bob ’s article if you ’re too busy to read it . )
And here are Bill Barnett and Walter Block on Tyler Cowen ( .pdf ) .
Yglesias ’ reaction to growth of the Austrian school is n’t surprising — naturally he ’d like nothing more than to see the debate on the economy confined to Keynesian drones versus monetarist drones .
Anyone who dares to question authority , to propose that these false alternatives are intellectually bankrupt , is on the “ fringe , ” you see .
These are the approved alternatives , citizen .
Choose from among them .
The experts know what is best .
Citizen :
But the experts have been all wrong !
Should n’t we question them ?
Should n’t we listen to the people who had a clue ?
Commissar : Let us hear no more of this anti-social talk about your betters .
Stay away from the fringe , citizen .
Listen to the experts .

The pay of employees who receive more than the Social Security wage base -- now $ 106,800 -- increased by 78 % , or nearly $ 1 trillion , over the past decade , exceeding the 61 % increase for other workers , according to the analysis .
In the five years ending in 2007 , earnings for American workers rose 24 % , half the 48 % gain for the top - paid .
The result :
The top - paid represent 33 % of the total , up from 28 % in 2002 .(...)
Social Security Administration actuaries estimate removing the earnings ceiling could eliminate the trust fund 's deficit altogether for the next 75 years , or nearly eliminate it if credit toward benefits was provided for the additional taxable earnings .
There is a specific US issue here that Social Security contributions are subject to a cap ( a profoundly regressive rule ) , but you can find similar mechanisms in each country ( in France , you have the bouclier fiscal , which caps the marginal tax rate and has the same effect ) and the conclusion is that major chunks of public deficits - and of future social benefits " holes " - that we are fearmongered into worrying about could be completely eliminated by taking care of such incredibly unfair loophooles that favor the rich .
And it needs to be underlined that increasing inequality , and massively boosted incomes at the top mean that an ever larger chunk of incomes and GDP escape taxation ( or social contributions ) , thus worsening the deficits of governments , pensions and healthcare systems .
Thankfully , that also points to an easy solution to all of these " problems " : as they were created by lower taxes on the rich , they can be solved by higher taxes on the rich .
he new Merb MVC framework offers developers exceptional scalability , agility , flexibility , and performance , particularly developers who have been working with Ruby and Rails .
In The Merb Way , author Foy Savas has written a comprehensive guide to using , extending , and deploying Merb .
The book covers everything developers need to know to build production - quality Merb applications , offering code examples to jumpstart virtually any project .
Within the scope of a typical Merb application , examples of modeled objects may include users , posts , entries , or comments .
These objects are most often persisted in a database through the use of an object - relational mapper ( ORM ) .
The default ORM included as part of the standard Merb stack is DataMapper , an ActiveRecord - like ORM that aims to push the boundaries of object / data interaction even more significantly toward the object side .
Chapter 5 of The Merb Way shows you how to work with modeled objects in Merb .
Given its acceptance as part of the standard Merb stack , the chapter covers the use of only DataMapper .
However , as agnosticism is central to Merb 's design , application developers are free to integrate whatever Ruby ORM they may need .
For example , you can use ActiveRecord , Sequel , or any of the other options ; each of these ORMs is capable of creating , retrieving , updating , and deleting persisted data and is fully supported by the Merb core .
Read an excerpt of " Chapter 5 : Models " from The Merb Way .

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner listens to a question during a hearing of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program on Capitol Hill in Washington , April 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
( Reuters ) - The Treasury Department will allow 10 banks to pay back Troubled Asset Relief Program funds , Bloomberg said , citing people familiar with the matter .
JPMorgan Chase &
Co is one of the banks , the news agency said , citing an anonymous source .
The Treasury did not immediately respond to a Reuters email , seeking comment on the report , that was sent outside normal business hours .
The government conducted “ stress tests ” on the 19 largest U.S. banks to assess their exposure to risky real estate and other loans and to weigh how they might fare if economic conditions deteriorated .
Nine banks were considered healthy enough that they did not need to add more capital , while the other 10 were told they needed to fatten their capital cushions by a combined $ 74.6 billion .
The results of the tests were released in May .
On Monday , the Federal Reserve said all 10 of the banks that were ordered to raise capital had come forward with plans that , if implemented , would raise the needed funds .
Human laughter can be traced back 10 - 16 million years to the last common ancestor of humans and great apes , according to new research published today .
Dr Marina Davila Ross , a primatologist of the psychology department at the University of Portsmouth , reconstructed the origins of human laughter by mapping the laughter sounds of great apes and humans on an evolutionary tree .
In Davila Ross ’s reconstructed evolutionary tree , humans were closest to bonobos and chimpanzees , more distant from gorillas and most distant from orangutans .
Biologists always love when researchers in psychology departments reconfigure the evolutionary tree for them .
Stop , that tickles !
Photo : University of PortsmouthDavila
Ross took over 800 acoustic recordings from 22 juvenile and infant apes and three human babies while their palms , feet , necks and armpits were being tickled .
The study compared the laughter sounds of all four great ape species and acoustically analysed and compared them to human laughter .
Despite acoustic differences between ape and human laughter the results prove laughter is not a uniquely human trait .
The similarities and differences in patterns of laughter sounds in orangutans , gorillas , chimpanzees , bonobos and humans correspond closely to the relationships between the species shown in well - established evolutionary trees worked out according to genetics – providing strong evidence that laughter in great apes and humans has its origins with our evolutionary ancestors .
Davila
Ross said , “ Our results on laughter indicate it ’s pre-human basis .
It is likely that great apes use laughter sounds to interact in similar ways to humans .
" Davila Ross ’s previous study , published in 2007 , showed that orangutans ’ facial expressions during social play reveal a sense of mimicry – an essential part of laughter .
“ This is important for emotional research in humans and animals as well as for the management of primates in captivity and in the wild .
” Who 's laughing now ?

Ross says the study proves that laughter evolved gradually over the last ten to 16 million years of primate evolutionary history .
Human laughter is obviously distinct from the laughter of great apes because evolutionary changes have been more rapid in the last five million years .
Despite the differences in great ape and human laughter the study also found an unexpected similarity .
Gorillas and bonobos are able to make laughter sounds while breathing out for three - four times longer than their normal breathing cycle which was unexpected and shows they have some control of their breathing .
Davila
Ross said this ability was thought to be unique to humans and to have played an important role in the evolution of speech .
Davila Ross conducted the study with Dr Michael Owren from Georgia State University , Atlanta , and Professor Elke Zimmermann at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hannover , Germany .
The research , funded by the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Centre for Systems Neuroscience in Hannover , is published in ' Reconstructing the evolution of laughter in great apes and humans ' , Current Biology .

Before you tl ;dr or flame , please RTFA .
I do not wish to offend anyone in the writing of this article .
I just feel the the core GNOME developers and the community at large needs to stop with the hype about GNOME 3.0 and slow down to think about a few things .
I am not only going detail what I dislike about GNOME Shell , I 'm also going to propose what I personally think is a better idea .
These are my personal opinions and I really am not trying to step on anyone 's toes .
If I had the time and expertise , I would be committing a new patch every other day .
Also note , not all the pictures I provided here are mine .
I have tried to cite the source I found it in where possible .
Please notify me via comment if I got something wrong , and I will be happy to change it .
However , I hate nitpicking , so do n't nitpick ( eg. It 's GNU / Linux not Linux ) .
This is my view of the current situation .
After the announcement of KDE 4 , an even before , many thought that GNOME was stagnating .
While Qt 4 and KDE 4 were bringing out cool new features and " redesigning the desktop " , GNOME seemed to be stuck in the past , perpetuated by it's old momentum ( eg. Firefox uses the native GTK theme , many apps are written for GTK , etc . )
Even if not completely true , many users saw the announcement of GNOME 3.0 as a direct response to KDE 4 .
However , I am unsure about the future of GNOME 3.0 ( and it 's associated GTK + release ) and the Linux Desktop in general as many programs use the GTK + bindings ( eg Firefox ) and it's regarded as the standard and default for many distributions ( including Ubuntu , the current most popular desktop Linux and the one most newbies see first ) .
I have some deep reservations about GNOME 3.0 and it's flagship new desktop design : GNOME Shell .
Basically , I do n't think it 's a bad idea per se , I just think that it 's not exactly what users need or want .
KDE 4 was a major leap in terms of technology from KDE 3.5 .
However , KDE 4 is not a major paradigm shift in how user 's use their desktops .
It 's very similar but much more powerful .
Developers can do amazing things thanks to all the new updates in QT 4 , but it 's not a complete rehash of ideas and designs that have been developed already and are already familiar to most users .
Here is a picture of KDE 3.5 :
Here is a picture of KDE 4 : Notice they are very similar from a user aspect .
Click the K , choose and application , action , or recent document , and open it .
It 's not too difficult .
Or at least it would n't be if the developers did n't inist on having a K in every single application name ( no seriously , what is up with that ? ) .
KDE interfaces also fail in that their complicated and filled with options when sane defaults and a neat Preferences pane could hide it , and that their dialogs are a little unintuitive .
GNOME on the other hand , with a history of evolution over revolution , has always been familiar and easy - to - use .
Interfaces in general are very similar and menu options ( like About , Help , Preferences ) are all located in the same place .
It 's intuitive and simple .
It does not force the user to adopt a new way of thinking , nor restrict what they can really do .
GNOME 3.0 on the other hand , is not .
GNOME
Shell tries to force the user into a new paradigm of computing .
When most computer users can barely tell the difference between a web browser and a search engine or the difference between their operating system and a their word processor , trying to " innovate " and " invent " new , complicated ways of doing the same thing is just not practical .
I compiled GNOME Shell and tested it out ( again ) to see whether it had made any progress .
Here , are my thoughts :
This is probably the first thing that irked me .
It 's very cramped .
I tried it on both my 17 " laptop monitor my 22 " widescreen desktop monitor and had the same feeling .
Part of this feeling stems from the fact that clicking that the Activites menu takes up a large portion of your screen and suddenly zooms out of your desktop .
This is a waste of screen space and an inefficient way of trying to open an application .
A smaller dropdown menu might be better .
The user should be able to choose when to Zoom out of his workspaces and seem them laid out on front of him similar to Compiz Fusion 's Desktop Wall plugin .
By pressing a key combination , they user can zoom out or back in .
They can move windows around the different desktops and zoom back into a specific desktop by double clicking it .
Adding a plus or minus icon would n't be too difficult .
As I understand it , and the GNOME Shell developers are implemented the ability to drag and drop application icons from the Applications menu section or documents from the Recent documents menu section on to an arbitrary workspace , thereby launching the app or opening the document .
This sounds pretty nifty , but is extremely confusing for users .
I showed this feature to 3 - 4 people and even after showing them they were still confused as to how it works .
They just ended up ignoring the feature altogether and just clicking the Application icon .
This feature poses problems though .
Because of this , users can no longer figure out how to make links on the desktop or panel by dragging the icon from the menu onto the desktop or panel , like they 've been doing since at least Window 95 .
That is not a trade - off a lot of people are comfortable with .
Do n't remark how it 's not necessary .
You can't stop the user from doing what they want to do .
User 's blindly open email attachments because they want to see the picture of the " kitten " they were promised in the Subject .
They do n't care .
They just want to do something , and they wo n't let the environment or rules change how they do it .
The panels can stay persistent on the top and bottom of the screen , staying there even when one zomms out to the workspace overview .
When one zooms out , dragging the icon onto a desktop launches it .
When on the regular view , dragging creates a link .
In either mode , dragging onto the panel creates a link .
I stopped using a Menu altogether a long time ago .
At first I began launching applications via the Terminal or using the Run Dialog ( Alt + F2 ) box .
However , I found something MUCH better .
If anyone has used GNOME - Do , they will know what I mean .
It 's extremely useful .
One can launch applications , open documents and folder , install software , visit bookmarks and URLs quickly , open a chat , and do a variety of actions easily and quickly .
What if we had GNOME - Do integrated into say , a menu ?
Mac OS X has a universal desktop search called Spotlight .
One can search for Files , Folders , Applications , Emails , etc. and it's all organized .
GNOME has a similar applet called Deskbar .
Deskbar had problems though : it was ugly and it did not play any prominent role in how the user manages their desktop .
It was n't really advertised and few people knew about it .
If instead of a conventional menu , the user will provided with a drilldown search ( similar to what GNOME Shell is aiming to provide ) .
It would clear up a lot of confusion .
Deskbar + GNOME - Do = Awesome .
Adding functionality would be like adding plugins to GNOME - Do or Deskbar .
By typing in search terms , one could search for recent documents , applications , contacts , emails , files , folders , media , their bookmarks , the dictionary , and do simple math .
Here are some mockups .
Sorry .
They look pretty ugly , but I just wanted to get the point across .
The mockups sort of represent what I have in mind , but I think it could be done better and more GNOME - Do like .
Note , I have n't exactly figured out what one would do if they only had a mouse .
One possible idea is replacing the text " Search " with a Dropdown containing " Search " , " Applications " , " Places " , " System " , and " Favorites " .
By selecting one of these of the dropdown , one could easily select which navigate soley using a mouse .
Although I personally use only one , the two - panel layout that users have been accustomed is very well designed .
It 's useful : window list on the bottom , and menu , launchers , applets , and tray on the top .
This is good and I encourage developers to stick with it .
I like this .
Kudos to the developers for keeping this .
This is a
It 's a very common sight to see .
Cluttered desktops with hundred of icons scattered everywhere .
Most of this is just whatever the user downloaded off of the Internet .
People just save everything to their desktop .
It becomes a huge jumbled mess .
It 's ugly and disgusting .
But there is a solution .
In every desktop user 's home folder there should be a folder called Downloads ( it should also probably aggregate downloads saved in other folders , but that 's a feature for another day ) .
Add a Recent Downloads section to the Menu and a launcher on the panel that takes the user directly to their Downloads folder ( or a pretty way of displaying it ) .
OS X kinda solved this problem with a Downloads stack .
Windows has n't exactly gotten the hang of this yet ( the Desktop Cleanup wizard is not a solution ) .
But Linux can !
The solution is very simple , and implementation should be very quick and painless if we have a menu like the one Deskbar + GNOME - Do mentioned earlier with a plugin interface .
Another way to solve this problem would be to take a page out of KDE 4's book .
In KDE 4 , using the new plasmoids system , one can display and folder 's contents or even the contents of multiple folders on the desktop easily .
This is pretty much like saving it to the desktop , but the plasmoid can be hidden , removed , or another plasmoid can display a small list of the recent downloads .
Either way , that 's more useful than silly weather icons , stock tickers , and yet another Now Playing widget on your desktop .
There are other solutions .
Just do something .
Seeing screens full of random icons is very annoying .
I think the desktop should be a wallpaper , some widgets , icons for volumes ( flash drives and the such ) , and maybe a launcher or two for that stubborn Windows user .
This is not necessarily about GNOME Shell 's usability , but about it 's implementation .
I know I 'm going to lose this argument because Clutter has so much momentum with the GNOME developers and it's supposedly , " The next big thing " .
There is a lot of buzz and hype about Clutter and JavaScript being used to build the next GNOME desktop .
For one , this is n't really JavaScript .
It 's sort of like watered - down C .
In fact it 's not even that .
It 's something with vaguely JavaScript syntax and platform bindings to GObject and GTK + and whatnot .
There are plenty of better languages to be used .
We could use Python , C , C++ , or even languages designed specifically for GNOME : Vala and Genie .
Vala and Genie both output C files without sparing us the ability to use high level languages and concepts .
We could even use Lua , as it's a much better language for embedding things than JavaScript .
So far , the argument for JavaScript is that it does n't bring in a bunch of dependencies or libraries .
It does , considering your binding it to GTK + anyways .
Many GNOME apps ( in fact many core ones ) are written in Python , C , and C++ anyways , so the libraries are already loaded .
The other argument I 've seen , is that a lot of people know JavaScript and it means more people will develop applications for GNOME .
This is a silly idea .
People will misuse any language , especially JavaScript , trying to create stupid effects that they have somehow deluded themselves into thinking are pretty ( excluding the amazing AJAX and jQuery / mooTools / scriptaculous / etc. stuff I 've seen properly used ) .
Instead of changing the language , why not develop tools that make development less tedious .
We need better editors ( besides vim , emacs , nano , and gedit ) , better debuggers , more documentation , better toolchains , more tutorials , and scripts for writing all that boring boilerplate code .
It does n't matter what language you make people program in if you do n't give them adequate tools .
It all boils down to this : Hardware is a platform for software , and unless you make that platform easy to develop for , no one will want to write software .
We 're not getting paid to write free software ( or at least most of us are n't ) .
If I 'm not solving problems and writing something cool , I wo n't write it .
If it 's tedious , I wo n't write it .
Just pushing JavaScript and Clutter down everyone 's throats will not change that .
Tools will .
I really want the GNOME desktop to succeed and prosper , but I think the developers need to actually watch users ( beginners , average users , power users , etc. ) and how they use the desktop .
For example , to open a document , my mom opens Firefox and uses File > Open to open the File ( which of course uses gnome - open to open the file in a OpenOffice , evince , Abiword , etc . )
Most users have no idea what they are doing ( although they think they do ) .
Apart from " reinventing the desktop " , we should have a large set of video tutorials ( HTML 5 , YouTube , etc. ) that teach users to do simple things such as open files and applications , close applications ( you would n't believe how many people just minimize / open a new window ) , and do other basic stuff .
In short , users are stupid .
And over complicating things will just push users away .
Users want to feel in control and empowered .
They want to enjoy using their machine .
They want to be able to do things quickly , and being able to open commonly used applications , recent documents and downloads , quickly do some arithmetic , or get a definition really speeds things up .
Please comment , link , digg , reddit , delicious , twitter , dent or whatever to this article .
Also , I want to see your mockups and hear about your ideas.can build the next GNOME desktop the right way .
The Dull Reality of Change
The so - called " pep talk " the president gave a few minutes ago could have benefited from a bit more pep .
Barack Obama seemed tired , almost somber .
The early word was that he would use the unscheduled address to reignite excitement over health - care reform .
Instead , he gave a detailed explanation of where we are in the health - care reform process .
The emphasis was n't on excitement or persuasion , but reassurance .
This prompted an incensed , semi-coherent tweet from Sen. Chuck Grassley , who specializes in such things :
Obama speech on healthCareReform Absolutely nothing new Waste of time saying we are going to get that done Baucus and I know that But doRITE
So writes the guy who 's supposed to be writing heath - care reform .
Confidence - inspiring , innit ?
But this question of , as Grassley so eloquently put it , " doRITE , " is an interesting one .
Insofar as there was anything new in Obama 's speech , it was his full - throated advocacy of the Independent Medicare Advisory Council ( IMAC ) ( formerly known as MedPAC ) .
This really is a good idea .
But it 's an idea that probably makes Grassley mad .
The theory underlying IMAC is that Congress cannot do health - care reform , err , RITE .
It is too captured by special interests and too baffled by technical arguments and too paralyzed by partisanship .
Leaving the continual tweaks and hard decisions that will bend the curve over the long term up to Congress is a bit like asking JD Salinger to blog :
It might happen occasionally , but it 's not a safe bet .
The IMAC proposal substantially removes Congress from the process .
The letter that Peter Orszag sent to Nancy Pelosi explained how it would work :
This draft bill would establish an Independent Medicare Advisory Council ( IMAC ) , which would have the authority to make recommendations to the President on annual Medicare payment rates as well as other reforms .
Both the annual payment updates and the broader reforms would be prohibited from increasing the aggregate level of net Medicare expenditures .
This proposed legislation would require the President to approve or disapprove each set of the IMAC ’s recommendations as a package .
If the President accepts the IMAC ’s recommendations , Congress would then have 30 days to intervene with a joint resolution before the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to implement them .
In a way , this seems small .
But it 's what cost control looks like in practice .
It 's Congress recognizing that it's a process , and a process for which it is ill - suited .
It 's an expert body able to continuously evaluate the data and make changes to Medicare that will increase the program 's effectiveness and decrease its costs .
There has been a theory , for many years now , that the health - care system 's cost problems would eventually be solved all at once when some popular president and some large congressional majority finally got serious about the issue and made the big , hard decisions .
Well , that 's happened , and what we 're seeing is that they can barely pull off the easy stuff , much less the hard stuff .
There will be no big , wrenching concessions .
We will not have an exciting , thrilling , satisfying conclusion to our health - care woes .
Not for the foreseeable future , anyway .
Instead , we 'll begin doing things a bit differently .
Making things a bit better with each year rather than a bit worse .
Putting a process like IMAC into motion is one way to do that .

Over at my favorite SF blog io9 , my old pal Annalee Newitz writes of a " singularity backlash " :
" But now we ’re starting to see the bleeding edges of a backlash against this kind of ‘ everybody disappears ’ singularity where the human future is unimaginably awesome .
Partly this backlash is coming from history - obsessed authors like Jo Walton and Robert Charles Wilson .
Wilson ’s novel Julian Comstock imagines a 22nd century United States sapped of its energy resources and returned to 19th Century levels of technology . "
She goes on to mention the Steampunk trend , Firefly , and Stephenson ’s Anathem ( " about a society that has rejected the singularity , and how this choice has not only saved their civilization but put them in a position to advance far more than they would have otherwise . " )
I ’m dubious ( and suspect that Annalee was just finding an excuse / context for writing about some cool and interesting stuff … come on , we all do it … )
I ’m pretty sure you could make this point about people advocating some transcendent vision in SF ( Arthur Clarke ’s Childhood ’s End for instance ) while other people showed different futures , some of them bleak and some of them preservationist ( we save mankind by not leaping into the unknowable next thing ) , including ones that land people back in those wonderful days of the 19th century when white men were … oh never mind … )
There may be a sort of singularity backlash though within transhuman or radical technology circles , in the sense that the Singularity is outpopularizing other memes … and everybody assumes that if you advocate radically self - directed evolution , you must buy into the Singularity model … ( and probably Ray Kurzweil ’s model at that ) when in fact , those who do n’t may be a majority .
Michael Anissimov gets into this a bit in commenting on a biting satire of Singularity University that appeared in Wired magazine .
Personally , as a meta - agnostic , I can go either way on the Singularity but on the whole , I ’m glad Ray Kurzweil is out there giving his version of it , because it ’s ever so intriguing and gets people talking ( plus the mass spread of the concept gave us an idea for a funny in house ad that you see every time you come to our front page if you look just to your right .
We were also happy to have Lisa Rein at Singularity University liveblogging — more or less — from their first week of activity .
SU is a case in point , in the sense that the school is about accelerating technology and not specifically about the Singularity , as SU Chairman Peter Diamandas made clear in our Summer Edition interview .
In other words , " Singularity " is a pretty hot marketing term for radical tech media , which bothers people who have nothing better to do than to get reactive about such things . )
Is there a singularity backlash ?
It ’s almost a meaningless question in the sense that it ’s tautological that —
If some idea ( or rock band or brand of socks ) starts getting a lot of notice , it will bring out critics and opposition .
And it will bring out satire — hopefully really excellent satire .
Hell , I think Charlie Stross ’ singularitarian stuff is already pretty funny and satirical .
I ’m looking forward to the h+ magazine backlash .
It ’s a sign of success .
Like many artists of their generation , English brothers Jake and Dinos Chapman allude to an incredible amount historical reference in their work .
This is particularly evident in a series ( aptly ) named “ Hell ” ( 1999 –2000 ) , of which portrays an apocalyptic vision of hell on Earth as war , Nazi atrocities , concentration camps , and mass executions with thousands of miniature figures taken apart and put together again .
These were arranged in nine glass cases laid out in the shape of a swastika and later destroyed by the artists .
Dinos Chapman is reported to have shrugged off the loss , saying , “ We will just make it again …
It is only art . ”

Veteran investor and world traveler Jim Rogers ' new book , A Gift to My Children : A Father 's Lessons for Life and Investing , will be published by Random House on Apr. 28 .
BusinessWeek investing reporter David Bogoslaw spoke by telephone with Rogers , who now lives in Singapore with his wife and two young daughters ( ages five and one ) .
Here 's what he had to say about investing , the financial crisis , and lessons learned .
In your book , you advise people to thoroughly educate themselves about a subject before they ask for advice from reputed experts so that they can truly evaluate the worth of the advice .
How practical is that for investors who are n't professionals like yourself ?
The people you 're describing should not be investing at all , unless they invest in things they know a lot about .
If you 're an auto mechanic , you 'll know much more about your field than anyone on Wall Street ever will .
You 'll know when new products or processes are coming out .
Those people can get extremely rich by just staying with what they know .
It could be products that go into cars , like tire companies , or glass companies , rather than [ only ] auto companies .
They should n't try to compete with Warren Buffett .
So you reject the advice about diversified portfolios ?
Diversification is something that stock brokers came up with to protect themselves , so they would n't get sued [ for making bad investment choices for clients ] .
Henry Ford never diversified , Bill Gates did n't diversify .
The way to get rich is to put your eggs in one basket , but watch that basket very carefully .
And make sure you have the right basket .
You can go broke diversifying .
Ask anyone who 's diversified in the last three years .
They 've lost money .
Nonprofessionals are always jumping around , thinking they have to do something .
If they have a big success , they think they need another one right away .
That 's when hubris sets in at its worst .
That 's when people really should go to the beach .
It happens to me too .
You believe there is a need for more restrained spending and a higher savings / investing rate in the US , closer to what you observed in China two decades ago .
But economists warn that if everyone opts for higher savings at the same time , it will kill consumer spending completely and hamper economic recovery .
You 'll never see America save one - third of its annual income [ the way the Chinese once did ] .
Even Japan is down to a 15 % savings rate .
America should increase its savings rate .
Thirty years ago , America was saving 9 % or 10 % of its income .
The reason we 're having this crisis is everyone borrowed too much .
The idea that you can solve a period of horrible borrowing and spending with more borrowing and spending is not going to work .
We 've had the worst credit excesses in world history , mainly in the U.S.
You can't end a problem like that with no pain .
Somebody 's got to suffer .
You 've been very vocal in criticizing the government policy responses to the financial crisis .
Does n't the Lehman example show how much harm would have been done if the government had allowed other big financial institutions to fail ?
It would be better to let some of them fail now , rather than wait for six or eight of them to happen all at once .
The system can recover from bankruptcies .
After Lehman went down , the stock market did n't really collapse right away .
It happened a month later , but people started blaming it on Lehman in hindsight .
We 've got to have some pain .
Even if AIG ( AIG ) and Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE ) and Lehman all went bankrupt , it cleans out the system .
South Korea went through this in the late 1990s .
They did n't have anyone to bail them out , and they had to go through the pain .
Sweden did it in the early 1990s , Mexico did it , Russia did it .
The list goes on and on .
Competent people take over the assets from incompetent people and rebuild from a solid base .
You 've spoken a lot about the 21st century belonging to China and the investment opportunities there .
As the Chinese middle class grows , do you expect a big change in Chinese savings habits as they become more able to afford consumer goods ?
Look at Japan 's and Korea 's extremely high savings rates .
Those have come down as those countries have become more prosperous .
China is developing [ social ] safety nets now .
When you have safety nets , there 's less reason to have very high savings .
That will happen in China as well .
China is maybe one fifth the size of Europe 's economy .
China can't save the world , no matter what they do .
They are investing in their own economy and have huge reserves and huge savings , The World Bank has predicted that in 2020 , China will be the world 's largest economy .
But the World Bank has never been right about anything .
It could well happen in the next 10 or 20 years , but on a per capita basis probably not within my lifetime , unless the U.S. really collapses and China really booms .
Do you think the up cycle for commodities has farther to run ?
If history is any guide , we have further to go .
The only sector of the world economy where the fundamentals are getting better is commodities .
Farmers can't get loans for fertilizers [ which is constraining crop supply ] .
It takes 10 years to open a new mine .
Stocks peaked in October 2007 and commodities kept going up until July 2008 .
If the world economy is going to revive , commodities are going to lead it back up .
If the world economy is not going to revive , commodities are still the place to be , especially with governments printing so much money .
Look at the 1970s .
The world economy was in the tank , but commodities did very well .
We have supply constraints .
Oil production is declining .
How are you investing in commodities ?
I use my indexes [ he created the Rogers International Commodity Index in 1998 ] because my lawyers wo n't allow me to buy individual commodities because I 'm always talking about them in public .
Most of my indexed products use futures , Ultimately , you 'll be buying futures , even if you buy an ETF or ETN .
Your favorites are agricultural commodities ?
The prices historically are still very depressed , compared with most other commodities .
I bought all commodities recently , but I probably bought more agriculture than anything else .
Can you share an example of an investing insight your experience on the ground in foreign countries has given you that most economists and top - down strategists miss ?
Crossing into Botswana by motorcycle , there was no hassle from guards at the border .
It was perfectly efficient and straightforward .
I filled out forms and nobody asked me for bribes .
In the country there was no black market for the local currency .
There were real roads and real hotels and stores with real products in them .
When I got to the capital , there were real traffic lights and office buildings .
I did more homework and found that Botswana had a huge trade surplus and a balanced budget , compared with many other countries .
There was a democracy where they have elections and a stock market .
It 's been one of the greatest stock markets in the world for the past 20 years .

The state will pay $ 335,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a woman former state Sen.
Carole Migden rear - ended after a wild 30 - mile drive in Solano County , attorneys in the case said Monday .
Several motorists called 911 after seeing the San Francisco Democrat weaving in and out of traffic on Interstate 80 and Highway 12 on May 18 , 2007 , in her state - issued Toyota Highlander hybrid sport utility vehicle .
At one point , Migden sideswiped a guardrail on I - 80 near American Canyon Road .
" She 's been on the phone and reading a book , doing about 80 miles per hour , " one driver said in his 911 call .
" She 's really scary . "
Migden 's drive came to an abrupt halt when she rear - ended a 2005 Honda sedan driven by Ellen Butawan , who was slowing for a red signal light at the intersection of Beck Avenue and Highway 12 in Fairfield , the California Highway Patrol said .
Butawan , now 33 , who suffered minor injuries , sued the state and Migden in Solano County Superior Court last year .
The state has agreed to pay $ 335,000 to settle the suit , said Steven Gevercer , supervising deputy attorney general .
The state defended Migden because the crash happened while she was acting within the scope of her state employment , Gevercer said .
Migden , 60 , lost her seat last year to Democratic rival Mark Leno and is now on the Integrated Waste Management Board .
She told officers that she remembered little of her driving spree and suggested that medication she was on for treatment of chronic leukemia might have been to blame .
CHP officials listed Migden 's cell phone use as a contributing factor to the crash .
Migden 's license was suspended for several months .
She pleaded no contest to reckless driving , a misdemeanor , and was fined $ 710 and given two years of court probation .
Der schleswig - holsteinische Landtag hat in seiner vergangenen Sitzungswoche einen Gesetzesentwurf beschlossen , der den Strafverfolgern im nördlichen Bundesland Zugang zu den sechs Monate lang verdachtsunabhängig von Telekommunikationsanbietern aufzubewahrenden Telefon - und Internetdaten verschafft .
Für das von der Öffentlichkeit noch weitgehend unbeachtete Vorhaben zur Umsetzung der umstrittenen Bestimmungen des Bundes zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung ins Landesrecht stimmte die Parlamentsmehrheit von CDU und SPD .
Scharfe Kritik kam dagegen von der Opposition , die verfassungsrechtliche Bedenken hat .
Die Fraktionen von FDP und Grünen stimmten daher gegen die Initiative .
Konkret passt die große Koalition in Schleswig - Holstein mit dem Entwurf ( PDF - Datei ) ihr Landesverwaltungsgesetz an die Paragraphen zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung im Telekommunikationsgesetz ( TKG ) des Bundes an .
Ein neuer Absatz in Paragraph 185a des entsprechenden Normenwerks stellt künftig sicher , dass die Polizei des Landes " zur Abwehr einer gegenwärtigen Gefahr für Leib , Leben oder Freiheit einer Person " auf die bei den Providern gesammelten Verbindungs - und Standortdaten zugreifen darf .
Die Verankerung in dem Landesgesetz sei nötig , hieß es bei CDU und SPD , weil ein Telefonanbieter sich mit Hinweis auf eine Lücke im Landesrecht bisher geweigert habe , entsprechende Informationen an die Behörden weiterzugeben .
Der Vorsitzende der FDP - Landtagsfraktion , Wolfgang Kubicki , bemängelte im Rahmen der abschließenden Lesungen des Vorhabens , dass durch den Beschluss Regelungen ins Landesrecht übernommen würden , " die aktuell vor dem Bundesverfassungsgericht auf ihre Verfassungsgemäßheit überprüft werden " .
Dies sei " ein bisher einmaliger Vorgang in der schleswig - holsteinischen Gesetzgebung " .
CDU und SPD hätten sich nicht einmal Zeit gelassen , um abzuwarten , ob die Vorratsdatenspeicherung in der Strafverfolgung vor dem Grundgesetz standhält .
Kubicki räumte zwar ein , dass man von einer Regelungslücke sprechen könne .
Der Griff nach den Vorschriften zur Protokollierung elektronischer Nutzerspuren im TKG gehe allerdings in die falsche Richtung .
Es werde niemand erklären können , dass zur Abwehr einer gegenwärtigen Gefahr eine Bestimmung notwendig sei , " die den Zugriff auf bis zu sechs Monate alte Telekommunikationsverbindungsdaten ermöglicht " .
Einer angemessenen Regelung , die bei einem konkreten Verdacht einer gegenwärtigen Gefahr für Leib und Leben einen Zugriff auf aktuelle TK - Daten im Einzelfall erlaubt hätte , wäre die FDP nicht im Wege gestanden .
Mit ähnlichen Bedenken äußerte sich gegenüber heise online auch ein Sprecher des Unabhängigen Landeszentrums für Datenschutz Schleswig - Holstein ( ULD ) .

The EU said the arrangement continued after gas markets were liberalised
Energy giants E.On and Gaz De France ( GDF )
Suez have been fined by European Commission competition regulators for carving up gas markets between them .
Both Germany's E.On and France 's GDF Suez have been fined 553 m euros ( $ 770 m ; £ 477 m ) by the Commission .
The firms agreed in 1975 not to compete with each other in their national gas markets when they started to import gas through a pipeline from Russia .
" The Commission has no alternative but to impose high fines , " it said .
" They maintained the market - sharing agreement after European gas markets were liberalised , and only abandoned it definitely in 2005 . "
EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said the secret carve - up had deprived customers of price competition and choice of supplier in two of the largest markets in the 27 - nation EU .
" This decision sends a strong signal to energy incumbents that the commission will not tolerate any form of anti-competitive behaviour , " she added .
Merger
The commission investigation - which was focused on the jointly - owed Megal pipeline from southern Germany to the French - German border - followed raids on the offices of the two firms .
The Megal pipeline is jointly owned and operated by E.On Ruhrgas and GDF Suez .
E.On had earlier said the alleged anti-competitive practices referred to agreements that had expired in 2004 .
It also said that its business had been competitive for many years .
Gas supplier GDF merged with Suez last year to form GDF Suez , Europe 's biggest utility by market capitalisation ahead of EDF and E.On .
Last week Gerard Mestrallet , the head of GDF Suez , said the group would appeal against any fine imposed by the Commission .

This millimeter - sized fragment revealed a mix of minerals , including khatyrkite and cupalite that contain quasicrystalline grains .
Text Size A A
In the 25 years since quasiperiodic crystals were first proposed to exist , scientists have observed and studied more than 100 examples of these oddly ordered materials .
All of them were synthesized in laboratories — until now .
An international research team has found a quasicrystal in a naturally occurring mineral sample originating in Russia ( Science 2009 , 324 , 1306 ) .
The finding broadens the range of natural atomic structures and could provide clues that lead scientists to synthesize new kinds of quasicrystals .
Quasicrystals are ordered solids that lack periodicity , meaning their structures cannot be depicted by a geometric pattern of atoms that repeats in three dimensions at fixed intervals — a description of ordinary crystals .
Typically built from multicomponent alloys , quasicrystals often exhibit five - or 10 - fold rotational symmetry , a condition that 's theoretically forbidden in conventional crystallography .
After years of searching , Luca Bindi of the Museum of Natural History , in Florence , Italy , and Princeton University 's Paul J. Steinhardt and coworkers Peter J. Lu and Nan Yao discovered fivefold symmetry in micrometer - sized quasicrystal grains in samples of khatyrkite and cupalite .
The Al - Cu - Fe- based mineral specimens in the Florence museum are reported to have come from the Koryak Mountains in Russia .
" Only because of Luca 's stubborn determination and willingness to test every part of the sample was the quasicrystal found .
It 's a miracle , really , " Steinhardt says .

IRAN says it has freed five of the local British embassy staff it arrested on accusations of stoking post- election unrest , a move that further threatened tense ties with London .
" Eight people were arrested .
Five were freed and three are still being interrogated , '' ministry spokesman Hassan Ghashghavi said at a press conference in Tehran today .
Earlier , English - language state television Press TV had spoken of a total of nine arrests .
Mr Ghashghavi also said that Iran , which has accused Western nations , particularly Britain and the US of " meddling , '' has no current plans to close embassies or downgrade diplomatic ties with foreign nations .
" There is no plan at the moment to close any embassy or downgrade ties with them , '' Mr Ghashghavi said when asked if Tehran planned to close the British embassy .
The Fars news agency , announcing the arrests yesterday , said the British embassy staffers were accused of playing a " considerable role ' ' in the unrest that swept Iran after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Intelligence Minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejeie accused the British embassy of sending local staff " undercover among rioters in order to push its own agenda , '' the official IRNA news agency reported .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said yesterday that London had protested strongly over the arrests , which he described as " harassment and intimidation ' ' and dismissed claims the embassy was behind the demonstrations .
EU nations also vowed to respond to any harassment of diplomats in Iran with a " strong and collective response ' ' , Mr Miliband said at an EU foreign ministers ' meeting in Corfu .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki - who has previously said Tehran was considering downgrading its ties with London - urged Britain and the EU not to take rash action over the arrests .
" Do n't continue with this losing game because this is neither in the interests of the British people nor the two countries ' relations that have ( already ) been damaged because of the British Government 's behaviour , '' he said .
He also called for European countries and officials to " revise their stand ' ' towards Iran , after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused European and American officials of making " idiotic comments ' ' about the country .
Britain and Iran have already expelled diplomats in tit - for - tat moves last week .

Last Friday , Orrin Hatch , the veteran Republican senator from Utah , announced that he would vote against the confirmation to our supreme court of judge Sonia Sotomayor .
Hatch is a devout conservative , and Sotomayor seems pretty liberal , so on the face of it , you might say , so what ?
Here 's what .
Hatch has been in the Senate for 32 years and has never voted against any president 's high court nominee .
True , most of the nominations in that time have been made by Republican presidents .
But even so , Hatch 's history means he has voted for two nominees who were obviously liberal , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer .
Sotomayor 's record does not mark her out as appreciably to their left , and in terms of years of service on the bench , she towers over them .
So what 's changed ?
Hatch 's decision reflects the degree to which , during the Obama era , American conservatism – already fiercely ideological and obstructionist , operating according to sets of " facts " produced and paid for by oil companies , pharmaceutical manufacturers and other corporate interests – has contrived to go completely barmy .
In most countries , you have two major political parties or broad factions .
They disagree on many things .
But both begin by accepting certain suppositions .
I would imagine that in Britain , for instance , both Labour and the Tories think healthcare for all or at least most people is a good idea .
They have different notions about how to do it , but the goal is agreed upon .
I gather also that the Tories accept the basic idea that global warming exists and that man 's actions have contributed to it .
But American conservatism does not believe healthcare for all or most is a desired outcome at all .
Conservatives believe people are responsible for their own healthcare , and that people who do n't have it just are n't showing enough pluck and initiative .
Last Thursday , one Republican congressman announced that the party would n't even offer its own version of healthcare legislation – and this man runs the party 's so - called Solutions Group !
And on climate change , of course , most deny its existence , and all deny that human activity has played any role in it whatsoever .
I could give you 50 examples , but you get the idea .
We have a party that lives in an alternate universe .
Wondering why Obama and the Democrats are having trouble lately ?
They 've committed their errors , and the party 's genuine ideological diversity can make consensus hard to come by .
But the big issue is this .
The alternate - universe party represents the views of about 27 % of the people , as nearly as I can tell .
More will label themselves conservative in polls , but when you analyse the percentage of Americans who endorse the extreme views the GOP represents on a range of matters , it comes to a little more than quarter of the population .
But the Republicans hold about 42 % of the power in Washington , with the ability in Senate , according to that body 's rules , to block almost anything , almost any time .
Let 's return for a moment to Hatch .
In his statement , he gave no actual reason for opposing Sotomayor .
He 'd reviewed her record and concluded – naturally , with " heavy heart " – that he could not support her .
In the absence of stated reasons , we can speculate on some .
Might fear of rightwing radio loudmouth Rush Limbaugh be a factor here ?
Might it have something to do with the fact that , the day before Hatch 's statement , the National Rifle Association had announced that it would take senators ' votes on Sotomayor into account in its future evaluations ?
It 's true that most Democrats opposed George Bush 's last high court nominee , Samuel J Alito .
If supreme court votes were the only measure , this would just be normal politics .
But there are multiple signs of Republican psychosis .
Obama has been compared to Hitler , Stalin , Mussolini , Charles Manson , a monkey ( of course ) and , in an image promoted last week , a witchdoctor – by a neurosurgeon no less , who has been a big opponent of healthcare reform .
Most conspicuously , there 's the growing " birther " movement , people who believe that Obama is not a US citizen , does n't meet the constitutional requirements for the presidency and must therefore be impeached .
He was born in Hawaii in 1961 .
That makes him a citizen .
His campaign last year released a copy of his birth certificate .
But of course , for these folks , it 's a forgery .
There 's even a video afoot " demonstrating " how the document was faked .
You might think people in positions of responsibility would try to reel these folks in a little .
Instead , in the House of Representatives , a few Republicans have introduced a bill to require future presidential candidates to prove their citizenship , starting in 2012 , when Obama will be seeking re-election .
Healthcare is socialism .
Saving the auto industry is liberal fascism .
Trying to halt global warming is both .
Negotiating with Iran – I did n't even get to foreign policy – is proof that Obama wants to obliterate the US .
And to top it all off , the Great Obliterator is n't even a citizen .
Obama has to try to conduct the business of state with people who believe or lend cover to all these notions .
Trust me .
Be glad you have your Tories .

Then they got bored with her because it just did n't look like they could make sequels out of her .
They dumped the project as she was entering the final stages of development .

Wall Street , Obama administration conspire to block financial regulation
By Barry Grey
4 June 2009
In the guise of enhanced regulation , the Obama administration is working with major Wall Street banks to sanction a continuation of the speculative practices that precipitated the financial meltdown and deepest economic slump since the Great Depression .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has , according to a detailed exposé published June 1 by the New York Times , adopted a proposal drawn up by a group of big Wall Street firms for new regulations on the lucrative trade in derivatives such as credit default swaps .
Geithner headed the New York Federal Reserve Bank and played a key role in the Bush administration ’s bank bailout program before being named to his present post by Obama .
His recently issued proposal on derivatives regulation , in opposition to measures backed by certain corporate interests , such as agribusiness firms and the congressmen who represent them , would exempt most trading in credit default swaps from any serious public exposure or government regulation .
Credit default swaps are contracts agreed to between corporations in which the seller insures the buyer against the default of specific corporate bonds or securities .
The transactions are “ over the counter , ” i.e. , arrived at privately without being listed on any public exchange .
Since the passage of a law in 2000 supported and signed by then - Democratic President Bill Clinton , they have been unregulated .
The 2000 law sparked an explosive growth of this form of financial gambling .
According to the Times , “ The market now represents transactions with a face value of $ 600 trillion , up from $ 88 trillion a decade ago .
JPMorgan , the largest dealer of over - the - counter derivatives , earned $ 5 billion trading them in 2008 , according to Reuters , making them one of its most profitable businesses . ”
Trading in credit default swaps played a major role in the subprime mortgage bubble that imploded in August of 2007 , leading to the financial crash of 2008 .
The collapse of insurance giant American International Group , which has to date received $ 170 billion in government funds , was the result of the firm ’s massive holdings in credit default swaps tied to subprime mortgage - backed securities and other dubious assets .
AIG bet that the underlying mortgages would not default .
It lost its bet and was required to come up with huge amounts of cash as collateral , which it did not have .
AIG ’s imminent failure threatened to bankrupt thousands of “ counterparty ” banks and other financial firms around the world , provoking a panic that was stanched only by the infusion of hundreds of billions of taxpayer funds into its coffers and those of scores of other financial firms .
The Times reports that in November of 2008 , only a month after receiving billions of dollars in government cash infusions , the nine biggest participants in the derivatives market — including JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citigroup and Bank of America — set up a lobbying organization , the CDS Dealers Consortium , to counter calls for serious regulation of credit default swaps and other forms of derivatives speculation .
The new lobby hired a “ longtime Washington power broker ” who had helped push through the 2000 law , Edward J. Rosen , a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton .
The Times reports that it has obtained a copy of a confidential memo drafted by Rosen in February that was “ shared with the Treasury Department and leaders on Capitol Hill ” and played “ a pivotal role in shaping the debate over derivatives regulation . ”
According to the Times , Rosen opposed proposals that derivatives be traded on open exchanges , akin to stock markets , and instead argued that they should be traded through “ clearinghouses ” that would be run by private firms closely affiliated with the banks .
He further proposed that the derivatives trade continue to be overseen by the Federal Reserve Board , which has a long record of giving the banks free rein to engage in this form of speculation .
Moreover , he argued that a special dispensation be given to so - called “ customized ” derivatives , a vague term that encompasses most credit default swaps , which would shield them from public scrutiny or government regulation .
The Times article indicates that all of these suggestions were incorporated into the proposal for “ increased ” oversight released by Geithner .
The newspaper notes that Treasury officials “ say that their proposal was arrived at independently ... ”
But the article makes clear that the Obama administration ’s plan for derivatives was basically drafted by the big Wall Street banks .
The article further reports that the big banks ’ clearinghouse firm of choice is ICE US Trust , “ an entity closely affiliated with banks that are also members of Mr. Rosen ’s group , the CDS Consortium . ”
The Obama administration also favors this firm , according to the Times .
Citing Brad Hintz , a brokerage firm analyst at Bernstein Research , the article states , “ ICE seems to be the clearinghouse of choice , especially among policy makers in Washington . ”
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa , a state with large agribusiness interests that are pressing for tougher regulation of derivatives , is quoted as saying , “ The swaps and derivatives people are all over the place up here .
... A lot of money is on the line . ”
The article also quotes Collin C. Peterson , a Minnesota Democrat and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee , who is sponsoring a bill that would bar derivatives trading in a clearinghouse , such as ICE , regulated by the New York Federal Reserve .
He calls the New York Fed , Geithner ’s former home , “ a tool of the big banks ” which “ would n’t do much ” to regulate credit default swaps or other derivatives .
Peterson is blunt about the domination of Congress by Wall Street .
“ The banks run the place , ” he says .
“ I will tell you what the problem is — they give three times more money than the next biggest group .
It ’s huge the amount of money they put into politics . ”
The article provides some figures : “ Through their political action committees and their own employees , securities and investment firms gave $ 152 million in political contributions from 2007 to 2008 , according to the most recent Federal Election Commission data .
“ The top five companies — Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Credit Suisse — gave $ 22.7 million and spent more than $ 25 million on lobbying activities in that period , according to election data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics .
“ All five companies are members of the CDS Dealers Consortium , the lobbying group formed in November . ”
The Times quotes Yra Harris , an independent commodities trader , who sums up the situation as follows : “ The banks want to go back to business as usual — and then some .
And they have a lot of audacity now that everyone has bailed them out .
But we have to begin with the premise that Wall Street does n’t want transparency because more transparency means less immediate profits . ”
The instrument through which the banks are resuming at full throttle the criminal methods that have brought the US and world economy to its knees and inflicted growing social misery on the working class , is the Obama administration .

Subordinating science to religion
Obama names evangelical Christian to run National Institutes of Health
By Patrick Martin
30 July 2009
Earlier this week , President Obama announced the selection of Francis S. Collins as the director of the National Institutes of Health .
Collins , while an accomplished biologist and the leader of the groundbreaking Human Genome Project , is an increasingly outspoken advocate of evangelical Christianity who has publicly declared that Darwin ’s theory of evolution cannot explain the moral dimensions of humanity .
In selecting Collins , Obama clearly bypassed many qualified scientists whose appointment would not have generated controversy over their outspoken religious views .
The decision was intended as a deliberate accommodation to the religious right .
In 2006 , Collins published a volume entitled The Language of God .
The title of Collins ’ book was suggested to him by the statement made by President Bill Clinton welcoming the first successful mapping of the human genome .
Clinton , like George W. Bush a Southern Baptist , declared , “ Today , we are learning the language in which God created life . ”
While opposing the pseudo - scientific teaching of the creationists , known as “ intelligent design , ” Collins argued instead that there was no contradiction between evolution and religion .
He claimed that god created the world 13.7 billion years ago , set evolution in motion , and then intervened from time to time in human history , as in the Christ story .
Collins claimed that there were aspects of human nature that could not be explained by Darwin ’s theory .
“ Selfless altruism presents a major challenge for the evolutionist , ” he argued .
Shortly after the book was published — and more than four years after the Human Genome Project successfully mapped the genetic structure of man—Collins was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Bush .
Collins left the government - run Genome Project in 2007 and launched the BioLogos Foundation to promote his claim that biological evolution is the product of the will of god .
He reportedly had differences with the Bush administration ’s suppression of certain areas of scientific research .
He supported making use of the hundreds of thousands of human embryos discarded every year by in vitro fertilization clinics to conduct stem cell research .
Collins supported Obama in both the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination and in the general election .
There is little argument that Collins is a fully qualified scientist who can capably lead a major research effort , as he did on the human genome .
However , these advances were made in conflict with the religious views with which he has become publicly associated .
As director of the National Institutes of Health , Collins will have a different role from his position as a scientist .
He will head the most important and well - funded scientific organization on the planet .
Over the next 14 months , NIH will spend $ 4 billion on research at its Bethesda , Maryland campus , while distributing $ 37 billion in research grants throughout the United States and around the world .
Harvard experimental psychologist Steven Pinker wrote , “ I have serious misgivings about Francis Collins being appointed director of NIH .
It ’s not that I think that there should be a religious litmus test for public science administrators , or that being a devout Christian is a disqualification .
But in Collins ’s case , it is not a matter of private belief , but public advocacy .
The director of NIH is not just a bureaucrat who tends the money pipeline ...
He or she is also a public face of science , someone who commands one of the major bully pulpits for science in the country .
The director testifies before Congress , sets priorities , selects speakers and panelists , and is in many regards a symbol for biomedical research in the US and the world .
In that regard , many of Collins ’s advocacy statements are deeply disturbing . ”
The selection of Collins was generally hailed in the corporate - controlled media as a clever maneuver by Obama , a way of paying tribute to religion while selecting an individual who defends evolution against creationism and opposes restrictions on abortion rights and stem cell research .
Both Christian fundamentalist and Catholic groups hailed the nomination , except for those devoted specifically to the promotion of the theory of “ intelligent design . ”
Over the past several years , Collins has become an increasingly vocal religious advocate .
In his blog for BioLogos , entitled “ Science and the Sacred , ” Collins wrote : “ Suppose God chose to use the mechanism of evolution to create animals like us , knowing this process would lead to big - brained creatures with the capacity to think , ask questions about our own origins , discover the truth about the universe and discover pointers toward the One who provides meaning to life .
Who are we to say that ’s not how we would have done it ? ”
British naturalist Richard Dawkins ridiculed this argument in a dialogue with Collins on science and religion published by Time magazine .
He said : “ I think that ’s a tremendous cop-out .
If God wanted to create life and create humans , it would be slightly odd that he should choose the extraordinarily roundabout way of waiting for 10 billion years before life got started and then waiting for another 4 billion years until you got human beings capable of worshipping and sinning and all the other things religious people are interested in . ”
While many of his statements are worded to suggest that Collins gives full value to scientific knowledge , there have been unguarded moments when he has expressed views closer to Biblical literalism .
In Religulous , the sophomoric anti-religion film by comedian Bill Maher , Collins makes an appearance , in an interview where he describes the New Testament as “ the record of eyewitnesses who put down what they saw . ”
Scholarly analysis of the textual record during the 19th century , however , demonstrated conclusively that those who wrote the New Testament actually lived as much as a century after the death of the historical Jesus of Nazareth .
Their often - contradictory accounts reflected various oral traditions and doctrinal trends among the early Christian sects .
Whatever the particular religious views of the nominee to head the NIH , however , the political significance of his selection by Obama is obvious .
As in every significant area of policymaking — the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the bailout of Wall Street , the assault on democratic rights and social benefits — the Democratic administration of Barack Obama is continuing and deepening the right - wing course of its Republican predecessor .

SASKATOON , July 6 , 2009 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) -
The revelation of $ 400,000 in funding from the federal Conservatives for the recent Toronto Gay Pride parade , which is notorious for its inclusion of full frontal nudity and public sex acts by homosexuals , came as a shock to most social conservatives in the nation .
According to Conservative MP Brad Trost , however , the decision to fund the event also came a shock to most of the Conservative caucus , even those inside the Prime Minister 's office .
Speaking to LifeSiteNews.com from his riding office in Saskatoon today , the 36 - year - old Conservative said , " The pro-life and the pro-family community should know and understand that the tourism funding money that went to the gay pride parade in Toronto was not government policy , was not supported by - I think it 's safe to say by a large majority - of the MPs .
This was a very isolated decision . "
Trost also hinted that Minister Diane Ablonczy , who was responsible for the funding , lost the file as a consequence of the embarrassment to the Party .
Protesting more than once that there was no " official connection , " he said , however , " it should be noted that the file has been reassigned to a different Cabinet Minister since that announcement was made . "
He added , " The whole tourism program and funding for major tourism events is being reviewed . "
Trost claimed that " almost the entire Conservative caucus " including " most of the Prime Minister 's Office were taken by surprise at this announcement . "
" It should n't be deemed to have been a change in Party policy , " he said , adding , " Most of the caucus is still strongly pro-traditional marriage . "
The MP attributed the move to " sloppiness . "
" Canadian taxpayers , even non-social - conservative ones , do n't want their tax dollars to go to events that are polarizing or events that are more political than touristic in nature , " he said .
" I 'm glad they 're owning up to a very grave error here , " said Mary Ellen Douglas , national coordinator for Campaign Life Coalition ( CLC ) , in response to Trost 's remarks .
CLC had originally protested the decision to fund Gay Pride as soon as it was made public .
At the time , CLC's Jeff Gunnarson had told LSN , " Given the fact that the Conservative government supports marriage as a union of one man and one woman in Section 68 iii of their Policy Declaration , I am concerned that they find it prudent to give nearly half a million dollars to a group that diametrically opposes that very section of the policy . "
Mary Ellen Douglas told LSN today , " Hopefully such mistakes wo n't happen again , especially at a time when the economy is so bad . "
Under pressure to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy , Lamborghini says it 's developing hybrid engines and researching biofuels .
Would you drive a Lamborghini Hybrid ?

The news is buried deep in a press release about solar panels on factory roofs , using recyclable implants in booth babe 's breasts and all sorts of nonsense about CO2 .
But here 's the key paragraph for ADD - addled readers .
At this point , Research & Development activities will continue in the following directions : - decreasing vehicle mass
- improving combustion
- reducing friction
- Start - and - Stop systems
- hybrid drive train solutions
- biofuels

The Italian supercar maker has previously discussed the possibility of future hybrid powertrains , most likely on the Lamborghini Estoque , should it reach production .
At last year 's Paris Motor Show , Lambo President and fashion icon Stephan Winkelmann said about the Estoque , " a particularly economical , but nevertheless dynamic , variation would be a V8 with a hybrid module or an extremely high - performance TDI . "
Since Lamborghini is owned by Audi , it 's reasonable to assume that hybrid technology could be borrowed or adapted from cars like the Audi A1 Concept while a diesel engine would likely come from the Audi Q7 V12 TDI .

The reason both Ferrari and Lamborghini are suddenly hoping on the hybrid bandwagon is increasing pressure from US and European governments to raise Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for all automakers over the next decade .
Even though Ferraris and Lamborghinis make up only a fraction of one percent of vehicle miles driven and therefore do n't contribute significantly to pollution , they could get factored in to the overall average of their parent companies Fiat and VW , respectively .
Like the performance - oriented Ferrari Hybrid , we 'd expect any eco-friendly Lambo to be big on badass and short on the emasculated wimpyness of cars like the Toyota Prius .

The press release follows :
LAMBORGHINI ANNOUNCES NEW , AMBITIOUS PROGRAMS FOR REDUCING CO2 • 35 million Euros investments
• The construction of a large photovoltaic plant , combined with an energy - saving project , will achieve a 30 % reduction in the factory 's CO2 emissions by 2010
• Modifications to vehicles will result in a 35 % reduction in CO2 emissions by 2015 Automobili Lamborghini announces its intention to complete its program of environmental sustainability in record time by presenting new plans which will enable the company : • to achieve a 30 % reduction , by the year 2010 , in the CO2 emissions produced by its factory
• to achieve a 35 % reduction , by the year 2015 , in the CO2 emissions produced by its vehicles
The plans for reducing emissions will thus involve two areas : modifications to the Lamborghini factory in Sant ' Agata Bolognese , and development in vehicle design .
To redefine its industrial processes in accordance with its policy of environmental sustainability , Lamborghini has just begun a project to complete installation of a large photovoltaic system by the end of 2009 .
The roof - top plant will produce 1,582 Megawatt hour ( MWh ) of " green " energy per year , which translates into a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions ( - 1,067,820 Kg / year ) by 2010 .
The photovoltaic systems will have a total installed power rating of 1,4 Megawatts and will extend over 17,000 m2 throughout the entire industrial area .
The new system will be built by Sinergia Sistemi S.p.A .
At the same time , an equally important energy conservation project involving insulating the production facility 's whole roof , improving lighting and heating and introducing destratification systems for heated air will be completed , thus resulting in a 10 % energy usage reduction by 2010 .
These projects represent the next step in a program that began last year with the opening of the new Lamborghini
Logistics Center .
The Center has already contributed to diminishing the impact caused by heavy truck traffic on the roads between Anzola and Sant ' Agata Bolognese .
It is calculated that this facility has achieved a reduction of emissions by over 75 kg per annum , and nitrogen oxide by over 750 kg ( Sources : Standard Euro 3 ) .
In April 2009 Lamborghini obtained the UNI EN ISO 14001 certificate , meeting the international environmental standards .
It is also the first firm in the Italian automotive sector to be close to registering for the EMAS environment certificate , having successfully completed the program : EMAS regulations are set by the European Union to support organisations in their effort to evaluate and improve their own environmental efficiency .
These recent achievements support Lamborghini 's commitment to protecting the environment in which it operates , and its desire to make all stakeholders aware of its actions in a transparent manner .
With regard to Lamborghini vehicles , the CO2 reduction plan aims for an additional 35 % decrease in emissions by the year 2015 .
The program reached its first milestone with the Gallardo LP 560 - 4 .
Introduced last year , the new car 's technical advancements resulted in an 18 % reduction in CO2 emissions .
At this point , Research & Development activities will continue in the following directions : - decreasing vehicle mass
- improving combustion
- reducing friction
- Start - and - Stop systems
- hybrid drive train solutions
- biofuels Lamborghini 's commitment and its sense of social responsibility regarding the environment is evidenced by the numbers and by the sheer size of the investments that are planned .
35 million Euros will be appropriated over the next five years for this purpose .
Stephan Winkelmann , the President and CEO of Lamborghini , has said , " Despite the difficult situation in today 's global economy , Lamborghini is committed to its policy of environmental management , since we are well aware of the great opportunities that derive from it .
We have an objective to reduce CO2 emissions to the greatest possible degree .
We have also set compulsory annual goals that are part of an integrated approach both considering the automobile as an element which is more considerate of the environment , in terms of emissions and the use of resources , to the accomplishment of a series of corresponding measures such as modifications to our factory .
This is an important action for Lamborghini and a central opportunity for our long term corporate and product development . "
European Parliamentarian Guido Sacconi , President of the European Commission on Climate Change , recently paid a visit to Lamborghini headquarters in Sant ' Agata .
At that time , he said that , " The commitment shown by Lamborghini with its efforts to reduce environmental impact and develop vehicles with less polluting technologies confirm the company 's goal of following the right path toward complying with the directives of the European Union .
To safeguard the DNA , history and technology of niche car manufacturers on a European level , a series of exceptions have been passed for manufactures of ' specialty ' vehicles ( with fewer than 10,000 new cars made per year ) who run their own production facilities and design centres , even though they are part of a group of associated producers .
This is the exact situation in which Lamborghini finds itself .
We have been particularly satisfied with the actions it has taken thus far , because they illustrate this company 's desire to embrace a new industrial vision which combines competitiveness and performance with social responsibility . "

Four New York men were arrested Wednesday in connection with an alleged plot to blow up area Jewish centers and military targets .
The plot , however , was foiled by undercover agents .
Raids by the FBI - NYPD Joint Terrorist Task Force in the Bronx captured the suspected ringleader and three followers in what law enforcement sources are calling a homegrown terrorist plot .
" The NYPD did exactly what they 're trained to do and have prevented what could have been a terrible event in our city , " Mayor Michael Bloomberg said this morning .
Agents and police watched Wednesday night as the suspects allegedly planted what they thought were bombs outside two Jewish community centers in Riverdale , a Bronx , New York neighborhood .
In one case the suspected terrorists planted a bomb inside a parked car .
However , officials said the suspects were actually using fake explosives given to them in an earlier sting operation to make sure they did n't get their hands on real bombs .
" The bombs had been made by the FBI technicians , they were totally inert , no one was ever at risk , " Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said .
The four suspects were identified as James Cromitie , David Williams , Onta Williams and Laguerre Payen , of Newburgh in upstate New York , where authorities were conducting raids at their homes , sources said .
Authorities said they had the plotters under surveillance since June of 2008 and there was " no chance " the alleged scheme could succeed .
They credited the work of a long time informant with keeping tabs on the group .
The FBI said the Muslim suspects were angry and full of hate for America .
" Hatred of the West .
The leader of the group , James Cromitie was concerned about deaths at the hands of the U.S. military in Afghanistan , " and also expressed anti-Jewish sentiment , Joseph Demarest the head of the New York FBI said .
Read the full complaint
According to the criminal complaint , Cromitie said " I hate those f-ing Jewish bastards . "
He bragged that it would be a " piece of cake " to bomb a Jewish Center in Riverdale , according to the complaint .
He said his father lives in Afghanistan and he was upset about U.S. military presence there .
" The fact that this type of hatred exists means that we all have to be vigilant all of the time , " city councilman Jeffrey Dinowitz said Thursday .
Cromitie was the first to approach the informant , authorities said .
He told the informant he has ties to the terrorist group Jaish - e - Mohammad .
Authorities said Cromitie had 27 past arrests and had recently been working at a nation - wide discount retailer , authorities said .
Several of the suspects have previously been arrested on drug charges and may have converted to Islam in prison , authorities said .
The four men allegedly would meet in a safe house in Newburgh , which authorities said they had bugged with audio and video equipment .
The suspects said they wanted to get their hands on stinger missiles to shoot down planes at the nearby Air National Guard Base at Stewart Airport , according to a criminal complaint unsealed late Wednesday .
The suspects also received what they believed were two stinger missiles which they intended to use to shoot down military planes , the complaint said .
They also bought cell phones to allegedly use in the plot .
Officials said they moved in now so the alleged plot could not progress any further .
The four men are in custody and are expected to be arraigned Thursday in a White Plains , New York federal court on terrorism - related counts .
" It shows you can't let your guard down , " Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) said .
" They did intend to use car bombs by remote control but the bombs the informant sold them were duds . "
“ I have spoken to both the New York office of the FBI and Commissioner Kelly and I want to commend them both on an outstanding job .
They have told me they have been monitoring this group for some time and that the men arrested did not have any connection to other terrorists , " Schumer added .
Since the 9/11 attacks , authorities have arrested suspects in a number of alleged plots against area targets , including the Fort Dix New Jersey military base , John F. Kennedy Airport , the Herald Square subway station in Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge .
Last December , a New Jersey jury convicted five foreign - born men , living and working in the area for years , of conspiring to kill U.S. soldiers at Ft. Dix .
Three were brothers from Yugoslavia ; the others were born in Jordan and Turkey .
The FBI arrested them after 15 months of surveillance after they tried to buy AK - 47s and M - 16s .
The men had claimed they were set up by an unscrupulous informant .
In June 2007 , four alleged Muslim extremists -- a 63 - year - old former JFK airport cargo employee living in Brooklyn and three others from Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago -- were charged with plotting to blow up fuel lines and gas tanks at the busy Queens airport .
All four have pleaded not guilty .
Two men were convicted of plotting to bomb the Herald Square station including a Pakistani immigrant Shahawar Matin Siraj .
He is serving 30 years in federal prison for conspiring to blow up the subway station on the eve of the 2004 Republican National Convention in nearby Madison Square Garden .

What is GTK +
============
GTK + is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces .
Offering a complete set of widgets , GTK + is suitable for projects ranging from small one - off tools to complete application suites .
GTK + has been designed from the ground up to support a range of languages , not only C/ C ++. Using GTK + from languages such as Perl and Python ( especially in combination with the Glade GUI builder ) provides an effective method of rapid application development .
GTK + is free software and part of the GNU Project .
However , the licensing terms for GTK + , the GNU LGPL , allow it to be used by all developers , including those developing proprietary software , without any license fees or royalties .

A LITTLE - KNOWN Australian - Chinese property billionaire has emerged as the largest offshore benefactor of Australia 's political parties .
Chau Chak Wing has poured more than $ 2 million into the coffers of the Liberal , National and Labor parties in the past decade .
In the two financial years that had the heaviest impact on the last federal election - 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 - he gave $ 980,000 to the Coalition and $ 402,000 to Labor .

Yet despite the generous gifts to both sides he has stayed well below the radar in debates about Australia 's burgeoning links with China , and is barely known outside the political and business elites in both countries .
He eclipses the Macau entrepreneur Stanley Ho as a donor because Labor returned most of Mr Ho 's money after the 2007 election .
A pair of new studies say that more people than ever lie in harm ’s way from earthquakes , droughts , floods and other disasters , largely because of a surge in urban populations in developing countries .
Smaller or poorer countries can be devastated by disasters that are relatively inconsequential in places shielded by size or wealth , said one of the reports , a United Nations study that is being released Sunday in Bahrain .
That study , the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction , compared the impact of cyclones in the Philippines and Japan , for example .
While more people in Japan are exposed to cyclones , the estimated annual death toll from such storms is 17 times higher in the Philippines , the study said .
Yet the report ’s authors concluded that the level of vulnerability does not always mirror economic conditions , with high rates of disaster losses seen in a mix of developing countries with growing or weak economies .
A browser - based system for anonymous peer - to - peer file sharing is due to be unveiled this weekend at the Black Hat conference – somewhat surprisingly created by Hewlett - Packard .
The so - called ' darknet ' – a private network for file sharing and communication – is the brainchild of Hewlett - Packard security researchers Billy Hoffman and Matt Wood , according to eWeek Unlike existing darknet systems – such as the Freenet – Hoffman and Wood 's creation , dubbed ' Veiled ' requires no technical knowledge for participation , and neither does it require the installation of a client .
Instead , the darknet relies on advances in browser technology to participate in the network – meaning that anyone with an HTML 5 - capable browser can make use of the encrypted , anonymous network .
Coupled with the ' private browsing ' functionality that is present in modern browsers – including Mozilla 's Firefox and Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 8 – the system would allow for use with zero footprint on the host PC , meaning that there would be no evidence that the darknet has ever been used .
Files being shared across the system – which could even be accessible from smartphone devices , so long as the browser is up to the task – are fragmented and stored across multiple members of the darknet , and are encrypted to provide a layer of protection against snooping .
The system even supports the hosting of entire websites , with fully operational hyperlinks to other documents hosted on the system .
The main aim for the project – aside from lowering the barriers to entry for darknet use – is to allow easy anonymous file distribution and storage .
Wood claims that the system will allow a user to “ While Veiled clearly has a number of uses that will make the RIAA et al squirm , Hoffman and Wood believe that it serves a legitimate purpose too : human rights organisations and government whistleblowers who need to get some form of secret document out there without compromising themselves could easily make use of the system without putting themselves at risk .
The pair are expected to give a talk on Veiled on the 29th of July at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas .
Does the idea of a truly anonymous browser - based darknet fill you with joy , or are you concerned about the uses criminal types could find for the technology ?

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Australia plans to build the world ’s largest solar power station with an output of 1000 megawatts in a A $ 1.4 billion ( US $ 1.05 billion ) investment , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Sunday .
Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd delivers remarks on the world economic crisis at a luncheon at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington in this March 26 , 2009 file photo .

The plant would have three times the generating capacity of the current biggest solar - powered electricity plant , which is in California , Rudd said during a tour of a power station .
Tender details will be announced later in the year , and successful bidders will be named in the first half of 2010 .
Rudd said the project was aimed at exploiting the country ’s ample sunshine , which he called “ Australia ’s biggest natural resource . ”
It was also aimed at helping the country become a leader in renewable , clean energy , he said .
“ The government plans to invest with industry in the biggest solar generation plant in the world , three times the size of the world ’s current biggest , which is in California , ” Rudd said .
“ Why are we doing this ?
We are doing it in order to support a clean energy future for Australia , we ’re doing it to boost economic activity now and we ’re doing it also to provide jobs and much needed opportunities for business as well . ”
The project should eventually lead to a network of solar - powered stations across the country , Rudd said , with locations chosen to fit in with the existing electricity grid and ensure good access to sunshine .
“ We do n’t want to be clean energy followers worldwide , we want to be clean energy leaders worldwide . ”
Rudd said .
The A$ 1.4 billion dedicated to this project was part of a wider A$ 4.65 clean energy initiative by the government , he said .
Rudd also said Australia would become a full member of the International Renewable Energy Agency , which will have its first global meeting in June .

BBC News , Baghdad
Officials say some families have paid bribes to get their sons into the army
As the sun disappears behind the dusty horizon and the air begins to cool , a group of men gather near a butcher 's shop in the Karada neighbourhood of Baghdad .
They sip sweet tea , play dominoes and debate which Iraqi ministry is the most corrupt .
" For sure it 's the trade ministry , " one says .
" No , it 's the interior ministry , because the police are the worst of all , " another argues .
The list of suggestions grows longer , till one of them waves all arguments off : " They are all equally corrupt . "
The verdict is in line with a recent report by Iraq 's anti-corruption committee , leaked to the Western media , which reveals the magnitude of the problem facing the Iraqi government .
The report , which is a result of the committee 's investigation into some 12,000 complaints of government corruption , says that that among the worst offenders are - in no particular order - the ministries of defence , interior , finance , education and health .
One of the cases , says a defence ministry official , involves tens of thousands of dollars made by illegally charging young recruits up to US $ 500 each to join the army .
The report does not even scratch the surface of what goes on .
Millions , billions of dollars are being stolen
Alia Nusaif
Iraqi MP
" The report does not even scratch the surface of what goes on .
Millions , billions of dollars are being stolen , " says Alia Nusaif , an Iraqi MP and member of the parliamentary anti-corruption committee .
After she publicised evidence of corruption in the trade and defence ministries , Ms Nusaif says that both filed law suits against her .
Iraq 's Prime Minister Nuri Maliki has recently called on his government to declare a war on corruption .
But Ms Nusaif says for her it has been a lonely battle .
" He made the same promises last year .
The problem is that senior officials are never punished in Iraq , " she said .
Trade not aid
In the bustling Shorja market in Baghdad , corruption is on display as some stalls sell government food rations that many Iraqis depend on .
The ministry of trade is accused of making millions by selling the food aid to traders instead of giving it away .
In late April the anti-corruption committee sent a police unit to deliver arrest warrants for senior trade ministry officials , including the minister 's two brothers .
Under Saddam things were bad , but now they are worse ... what frightens me most is the effect this will have on the security situation
Former dissident
But the police were greeted by shots fired into the air by the ministry 's own guards .
During the brief shoot out that followed , the officials , including the brothers , escaped through a back gate .
One of the brothers has since been caught , but the minister denies allegations of wrong - doing .
" Is this what you call democracy ?
Government officials are getting rich off the back of our misery , " one buyer in Shorja market said .
" This would never have happened under Saddam , " added another .
" We may have had our problems , but we were not being robbed . "
Corruption and security Even some of Saddam 's former opponents are making similar comparisons .
" Under Saddam things were bad , but now they are worse , " said a former political exile , who did not want to give his name .
After 30 years living in the UK , he returned only recently , full of hope and optimism for the future of Iraq .
" I was astonished by the levels of corruption .
And what frightens me most is the effect this will have on the security situation . "
While the streets of Baghdad are safer than before , violence is still part of daily life .
Many Baghdad residents worry that once the Americans leave the city at the end of June , their safety will be in the hands of the police and army that are accused of being seriously corrupt .
" Millions of dollars are being stolen , and some of this money is going to terrorist groups .
The government cannot win the war against the insurgency if it does not fight corruption first .
And the war against corruption is much harder to win , " said the former dissident .
Some believe the government has already lost this war .
According to the anti-corruption group Transparency International , Iraq is one of the most corrupt places in the world , third only to Burma and Somalia .
The problem is that fighting corruption in Iraq is not only difficult , it 's also highly dangerous .
Last week one of the members of the committee that put together this anti-corruption report was shot dead in the streets of Baghdad .

CANNABIS CULTURE – On May 2 , marchers in 263 cities will take to the streets to celebrate cannabis and demand an end to marijuana prohibition for the Global Marijuana March of 2009 .
The annual event , also known as the Million Marijuana March and other various names around the world , is a commemoration of cannabis culture , where pot lovers gather as a peaceful show of force for the marijuana movement – to discuss ideas , educate the public , and call for an end to the Global Drug War .
Since its beginnings in 1999 , between around 500 countries ( estimates vary ) have participated in the event .

In Vancouver , thousands of legalization activists will march from downtown to the Liberal Party of Canada convention at the waterfront .
Participants will meet at the Vancouver Art Gallery at 12 pm .
The March starts at 2 pm and will be escorted by the Vancouver Police Department .
The route takes the march down Georgia and Burrard Streets to the new Convention Centre plaza at Thurlow and Canada Place .
“ We are marching to demand the Liberal Party and it ’s new leader heed the overwhelming scientific evidence and vote no on Bill C - 15 ” said Vancouver organizer Jacob Hunter .
“ The United States is currently repealing its mandatory minimum sentencing laws because the laws are an expensive and unmitigated failure .
Why would the Liberals ignore the US experience and help pass C - 15 ? ”
Bill C - 15 establishes mandatory minimum sentences for a host of drug offences , including 6 months for growing a single marijuana plant .
The Bill has been widely opposed by researchers , criminologists , policy experts and civil rights leaders .
Despite this , the Conservative Party has continued to advocate for C - 15 as part of its self described ‘ tough on crime ’ program .
“ Mr. Ignatieff and the Liberal Party have a real opportunity to connect with Canadians , more than half of whom want to end marijuana prohibition ” , continued Hunter , “ We need to tax and regulate marijuana to ensure that it is grown safely , sold only to adults , and that the profits go to government , not gangsters ” .

Below is a sample of news articles about the 2009 Global Marijuana March .
A celebration of personal choices
from the Eye Weekly .
The official herbal holiday , April 20 ( known in some circles as 4/20 Day ) , has come and gone , but the city ’s biggest celebration of personal freedom is upon us this weekend with the third annual Toronto Freedom Festival .
While the Freedom Festival ’s flagship event is the May 2 Global Marijuana March , it ’s not specifically a pot party .
More than anything , it ’s a celebration of the freedom to make lifestyle choices and the willingness to accept responsibility for those choices .
Festival organizers Gavin “ The Gerbz ” Bryers and Neev Tapiro explain that the idea was to create an event that the city could get behind in order to stimulate the public discussion about drug - law reforms .
Since its inception , Freedom
Fest has grown to being one of the largest free spring festivals in the city .
And though it ’s still operating without any kind of government funding , the fact that they held the launch party right in the heart of downtown shows that at least some councillors — like festival supporter Kyle Rae — are on board with the tolerant atmosphere .
Bryers hopes that this year the festival will bring out enough people that it will be impossible to ignore .
The lineup should serve this purpose rather well .
On the main stage , performers like Snoop Dog and Dr. Dre ’s DJ Jam , Spookey Ruben and Juno winner Humble will follow in the footsteps of previous years ’ breakout acts like USS and Down With Webster .
Legendary Toronto DJ
Kenny
Glasgow is one of the many acts to grace the electronic music stage and EYE WEEKLY ’s own Voices of Freedom speaker stage plays host to the one and only “ Prince of Pot , ” Marc Emery , Alison Myrden from the group Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , as well as a poetry slam .
This year also features a film component , called F3 , where a program of short films and a special screening of Ron Mann ’s Know Your Mushrooms will be playing at 5 pm .
And , of course , the big draw is hanging out in the northern half of Queen ’s Park for an afternoon among a freedom - loving crowd — or as the cartoon version of Cypress Hill ’s Sen Dog once said , “ That and getting toasted , nicely toasted . ”

Chronic City : Goin ’ To A Party , Party — Global Marijuana March 2009
from SFWeekly.com
Got plans for this weekend ?
Well , cancel ’em .
Have I got a party for you !
It ’s time , once again , for the Global Marijuana March , a worldwide event held the first Saturday in May since 2005 .
An estimated 15,000 revelers are expected to attend the San Francisco edition , which has been a time - honored tradition here for 15 years , predating the global event by more than a decade .
Sure , mainstream media might give you the impression that grassroots ( see what I did there ? ) street activism of the sort represented by the Marijuana March is a thing of the past — and certainly , counterculture protests and demonstrations are a proud and storied part of our history in the City on the Bay .
But the marijuana legalization movement is stronger than ever .
A solid majority of Californians ( and an even larger majority of San Franciscans ) now support removing all criminal penalties for the herb , and cannabis activists have momentum on their side according to almost any knowledgeable observer of the scene .
If you ’ve ever attended a pot rally , I do n’t have to tell you what a positive rush such a gathering of the kind tribes can bring .
There ’s nothing like a group of like - minded hempsters united by a common purpose to put a smile on your face , a song in your heart , and a buzz in your brain .
If this will be your first time , do n’t worry — you wo n’t find a gentler , friendlier , more mellow crowd anywhere .
Marijuana march Saturday in Palm Springs
from The Desert Sun
An organizer of Million Marijuana March events and her supporters are headed back to Palm Springs .
Aurora Maldonado plans to conduct a march Saturday to celebrate marijuana and protest its prohibition , according to a press release .
She organized a similar march last year in Palm Springs .
“ It ’s all about liberating marijuana , ” Maldonado said in the release .
“ Marijuana is good medicine for a lot of people and it is time to stop arresting people for using this harmless plant and that ’s what the march is all about . ”
Marchers will meet at 10:30 a.m. at the parking structure at Baristo Road and Indian Canyon Drive and march through downtown .
They will chant , wave signs , hand out information about marijuana and encourage people to speak to elected officials about ending its prohibition .
Maldonado , who grew up in Desert Hot Springs , was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia .
She said using marijuana , as well as her faith in God , helped relieve the side effects of chemotherapy .
“ I do n’t think I should be labeled as a criminal because I take a medication that helps me , ” she said .
Eugene mayor plans appearance at pot rally
from the Associated Press
EUGENE , Ore. ( AP ) – Eugene Mayor Kitty Piercy has set pro-pot Web sites buzzing with her decision to attend the Global Marijuana March rally here on Saturday .
Piercy will issue a formal declaration marking April 30 through May 6 as “ Medical Marijuana Awareness Week . ”
But the mayor says her appearance at the rally is hardly an endorsement of legalizing marijuana .
Piercy told The Register - Guard newspaper that she ’s not offering any opinion on marijuana – only her support for its legal use as part of medical treatment .
She said a 57 - year - old rheumatoid arthritis patient forced to use a wheelchair convinced her to offer some public support for medical marijuana .

I love a long book that I can really get into , so I decided to compile a list of the longest novels ever written .
As I did more research , I realized that there were many issues I had to take into consideration when deciding what to include on this list .
This task ended up being much more complex than one would think a “ list of longest books ever ” should be .
Here are the various parameters I decided on : 1 . I included only published works ( read : not self - published ) , 2 . I used word count , not number of pages , as the measure of length , and 3 .
I included only books originally written in English , since it is easier to achieve a high word count in some languages than others , and English is the language I am most familiar with .
10 Infinite Jest David Foster Wallace : 484,001 words
David Foster Wallace may have been the most critically acclaimed novelist of the modern era .
His novels , The Broom of the System and Infinite Jest , were both highly acclaimed by literary critics .
Infinite Jest was even named one of the best 100 novels from 1923 through present day by Time Magazine .
Wallace committed suicide in 2008 , at the age of 46 , leaving an incomplete novel behind .
However , the publishing company responsible for his first two novels announced that it will release the unfinished manuscript sometime in 2010 .
Summary : Set in an absurd , yet uncanny , near - future , with a cast of hundreds and close to 400 footnotes , Wallace ’s story weaves between two surprisingly similar locales : Ennet House , a halfway - house in the Boston Suburbs , and the adjacent Enfield Tennis Academy .
It is the ‘ Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment ’ ( each calendar year is now subsidized by retail advertising ) ; the U.S. and Canada have been subsumed by the Organization of North American Nations , unleashing a torrent of anti-O.N.A.N.ist terrorism by Quebecois separatists ; drug problems are widespread ; the Northeastern continent is a giant toxic waste dump ; and CD - like “ entertainment cartridges ” are the prevalent leisure activity .
The novel hinges on the dysfunctional family of E.T.A. ’s founder , optical - scientist - turned - cult - filmmaker Dr. James Incandenza ( aka Himself ) , who took his life shortly after producing a mysterious film called Infinite Jest , which is supposedly so addictively entertaining as to bring about a total neural meltdown in its viewer .
As Himself ’s estranged sons , professional football punter Orin , introverted tennis star Hal and deformed naif Mario , come to terms with his suicide and legacy , they , and the residents of Ennet House , become enmeshed in the machinations of the wheelchair - bound leader of a Quebecois separatist faction , who hopes to disseminate cartridges of Infinite Jest and thus shred the social fabric of O.N.A.N .
9 Gai-Jin James Clavell : 487,700 words
In addition to being a successful novelist , James Clavell was also an immensely talented screenwriter – he was the mind behind The Great Escape and To Sir , With Love .
He only began to pen novels during a writer ’s strike in Hollywood , when his wife recommended that he spend his time recording his experiences as a prisoner of war in Japan during World War II .
Clavell ’s written memories became his first novel , King Rat .
He continued to write about Japan , and other areas of Asia , in his subsequent novels , including Gai-Jin .
Summary : [ Gai - Jin ] takes place in 1862 Japan .
The gai - jin ( foreigners ) have arrived , intent on doing business with the Japanese .
With laws against the use of the wheel in carriages or carts , the Japanese , their tradition - bound Emperor and competing warlords detest the foreigners , who have ruined the Chinese with the Opium Wars .
The mighty Struan shipping empire , Noble House , has built a base in Yokohama , but with the illness ( fatal ) of Culum Struan , tai -pan ( head ) of the business empire , 20 - year - old Malcolm Struan stands ready to become tai-pan .
In the first chapter , however , he ’s attacked by samurai assassins on the Tokaido road and lies either bedridden or hobbles about for the rest of the novel .
Young Angelique Richaud , 18 , Parisienne daughter of a gambler who has lost what money the family had , sets her eye on Malcolm .
Angelique is raped by a rogue samurai and now secretly carries his child , unbeknownst to the love - besotted Malcolm .
Angelique ’s syphilis - stricken fellow Frenchman , Andre Poncin , wends his way through the plot toward a glorious love - death with his Japanese mistress , while Japanese warlords fight each other , samurai endlessly behead samurai , earthquakes shiver and Yokohama burns .
8 Remembrance Rock Carl Sandburg : 532,030 words
Carl Sandburg won two Pulitzer Prizes during his lifetime , one for a biography of Abraham Lincoln , and the other for a book of poetry .
Remembrance Rock was Sandburg ’s only novel , and it clearly meant a lot to him , personally .
Upon his death in 1967 , Sandburg ’s ashes were placed beneath a red granite boulder named Remembrance Rock .
Summary : … Remembrance Rock follows the growth of the American dream through more than three centuries of our nation ’s history .
The narrative stretches from the founding of Plymouth Colony , through the Revolution and Civil War to World War II , and includes a cast of characters as vast as the landscape itself .
Puritans and heretics , revolutionaries and Tory loyalists , abolitionists and slaveholders and even a Supreme Court Justice .
Thematic unity to this sprawling epic surfaces in the symbolic reappearance of a bronze plaque that bears an inscription of Roger Bacon ’s ‘ Four Stumbling Blocks to Truth , ’ each of which is relevant to a particular period of our past .
7 Atlas Shrugged Ayn Rand : 565,223 words
In Atlas Shrugged , Ayn Rand presented her philosophy of Objectivism , which maintains that reason is the only way for man to gain knowledge .
Rand was a champion of laissez - faire capitalism , likely in part due to her negative experience with communism in her homeland of Russia .
Summary : In Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged , heroine Dagny Taggart fights to save her transcontinental railroad from collapse .
Dagny ’s efforts prompt her to seek out the man who stopped the motor of the world , and to hunt down the destroyer who ’s leading a strike of the great minds .
She finds both in the person of John Galt , who asserts that the first right of human beings is the freedom to think and act independently .
6 A Suitable Boy Vikram Seth : 593,674
Vikram Seth was born in India and was educated in the United States , The United Kingdom and China .
His international life is reflected in his literary works , which are set in the United States , England and India .
He has also written a travel guide to China .
Summary : Set in the post - colonial India of the 1950s , this sprawling saga involves four families : the Mehras , the Kapoors , the Chatterjis and the Khans , whose domestic crises illuminate the historical and social events of the era .
The multi-charactered plot pits mothers against daughters , fathers against sons , Hindus against Muslims and small farmers against greedy landowners facing government - ordered dispossession .
The story revolves around independent - minded Lata Mehra :
Will she defy the stern order of her widowed , upper - caste Hindu mother by marrying the Muslim youth she loves ?
The search for Lata ’s husband expands into a richly detailed and exotically vivid narrative that crisscrosses the fabric of India .
5 Miss MacIntosh , My Darling Marguerite Young : 700,000 words
While Miss MacIntosh , My Darling met with some acclaim , Marguerite Young ’s earlier work , Angel in the Forest : A Fairy Tale of Two Utopias , won multiple literary awards .
It was a study of the foundation of New Harmony , Indiana , a utopian commune where Young lived for seven years .
Summary : … [ A ] young woman embarks on a dreamlike voyage through time and memory in search of her darling childhood nursemaid , Miss Macintosh from What Cheer , Iowa , who has disappeared into the ocean , never to be seen again .
Finding herself adrift on a sea of delusion and fantasy , the young woman fervently searches for reality only to discover herself drowning in illusion .
4 Poor Fellow My Country Xavier Herbert : 850,000 words
This novel is also , unfortunately , out of print , although used copies seem to be available on amazon.com and eBay .
Poor Fellow My Country is the only Australian novel to appear on this list .
While Xavier Herbert was a controversial figure , both by todays and his own time ’s standards , he was known for being a champion for the Australian Aboriginal people ; this commitment appears in Poor Fellow My Country .
Summary : Ranging over a period of some six years , the story is set during the late 1930s and early 1940s ; but it is not so much a tale of this period as Herbert ’s analysis ( and indictment ) of the steps by which we came to the Australia of today .
Capturing the Spirit Of The Land , Herbert has paralleled an intimate personal narrative with a tale of approaching war .
Prindy , the young quarter - caste Aborigine identifies with Bob Wirridirridi the witch - doctor and the Rainbow Snake Cult .
He grows from adolescence to manhood through a series of events , some of which are hilariously comic and others tragically violent , but he does not lose sight of his final goal : that of initiation into full manhood in the Cult of the Rainbow Snake .
His natural grandfather Jeremy Delacy , The Scrub Bull , infuriates people with his attitudes , especially that of his apparent lack of interest in influencing Prindy .
At times he is harsh and brutal , but he is also shown to love with rare compassion .
Rifkah , the Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany , who eventually identifies with the Aborigines and becomes Prindy ’s tribal mother , is brought into conflict with Aelfreda Candlemas the reformer and writer who tries to make a superman of Jeremy and in her failure turns from scorching love to violent rejection .
3 Clarissa Samuel Richardson : 969,000 words
The word count of 969,000 words is true for the first edition of Clarissa , but later editions seem to have climbed to above 1,000,000 words .
However , it was not possible to find an estimate more accurate than “ above 1,000,000 words ” for these later editions .
However , even when using the lower number of the first edition , Clarissa still easily comes in third on this list .
Though Clarissa is well - known for its length , it is also noted for being an example of an epistolary narrative .
Summary : Richardson first presents the heroine , Clarissa Harlowe , when she is discovering the barely masked motives of her family , who want to force her into a loveless marriage to improve its fortunes .
When Lovelace , a romantic who holds the code of the Harlowes in contempt , offers her protection , she runs off with him .
She is physically attracted by , if not actually in love with , Lovelace , but she is to discover that he wants her only on his own terms and she refuses to marry him .
In Lovelace ’s letters to his friend Belford , Richardson shows that what is driving [ Lovelace ] to conquest and finally to rape is really revenge for her family ’s insults and his sense of Clarissa ’s moral superiority .
For Clarissa , however , accepting marriage as a convenience is no better than accepting the opportunistic moral code of her family .
As the novel comes to its long - drawn - out close , she is removed from the world of both the Harlowes and the Lovelaces , and she dies true to herself to the end .
2 Sironia , Texas Madison Cooper : 1,100,000 words
Unfortunately , this novel is out of print and rather difficult to come by .
The novel ’s setting , the town of Sironia , is based on the author ’s hometown of Waco , Texas .
The extent to which the book is autobiographical is not known , as Cooper had all of his files destroyed , though a few of the characters from his work have been identified with their likely counterparts in real life .
Summary : Sironia ,
Texas describes life in the titular town during the first twenty years of the 20th century .
“ … to judge from Sironia , Texas in those days must have been … wilder than even now .
In the lives of Cooper ’s 30 - odd major characters , there occur a flood , several murders and suicides , and a castration party .
One whorehouse burns down , one Negro is burned alive , one changeling is introduced into a childbed .
Girls are seduced and others are beaten ; at times it seems as though the streets of Sironia must be paved with female teeth .
Crowbars are swung in labor strife , horsewhips in political campaigns .
Sex - crazed old women corner fresh - faced youths in locked bedrooms .
Blackmail is commonplace , miscegenation comes almost as natural as breathing , and the highest ambition of mankind , it would seem , is to own a real , live , spangly N’awlins ‘ hoah ’ .
1 Mission Earth L. Ron Hubbard : 1.2 million words
Some people might argue that Mission Earth is , in fact , a series of novels , and should be excluded from this list , but it appears that it was the author ’s intent for the work to be a single novel , published in ten volumes .
Despite being authored by L. Ron Hubbard , this novel in fact has little to do with Scientologist beliefs , though , like the Scientologist mythology , Mission Earth ’s plot is based on an alien race coming to Earth and the chaos that ensues .
Summary : Mission Earth has an entire galaxy for its backdrop , though the main action occurs on Earth and the planet Voltar .
The Voltarian Grand Council has become convinced that it must send a mission to prevent Earth from destroying itself –thus allowing the Voltar Confederacy to proceed on its long - standing invasion plan and timetable to conquer a planet they regard as an important future way - stop on the main invasion route toward the center of the galaxy .
The mission is assigned to a clandestine agent , Fleet Combat Engineer Jettero Heller .
Soon after arriving on Earth , he heads to New York City where he is determined to get to the bottom of what is causing Earth to self - destruct , unaware that his every move is being tracked and that powerful forces on Voltar want his mission to fail .
For the 14 crew aboard the Karagöl , a ­Turkish chemical tanker churning through the lawless waters of the Gulf of Aden , it was the moment all seafarers dread : heavily armed Somali pirates were speeding towards the slow - moving cargo vessel , and there was no chance of escape .
The Turkish sailors were swiftly overpowered and the 5,850 - ton tanker was diverted to a port in Somalia , where it was held for two months while its owners negotiated a ransom payment .
What the crew could not know was that their ship had been singled out as a target by a network of informers based several thousand miles away – in London .
Security officials say well - placed informants in the British capital , the world centre of shipbroking and insurance , gather so much detail on targets that , in the case of the Karagöl , they not only knew its layout , route and cargo , but had spent several days practising the assault .
The attack on the Turkish ship was a sign that the pirates have turned a regional phenomenon into a global criminal business that now reaches into the heart of London 's shipping community .
" They made regular calls from the ship to London , " said Haldun Dincel , general manager of Turkey 's Yardimci shipping company , who negotiated the release of their ship .
The calls were made on satellite phones the pirates brought with them .
Speaking by telephone from Istanbul , Dincel said today that London was one of a number of centres the pirates contacted regularly after the tanker had been sailed to the Somali coast and senior gang members had boarded and taken control .
" Every day the chief of the pirates got in touch with people from London , Dubai and some from the Yemen , " he said .
At least one of the four or five major pirate groups that are now carrying out the attacks has London - based " consultants " to help them choose their targets , according to a European military intelligence report leaked to Spain 's Cadena SER radio station yesterday .
The report has been circulated around those countries , including Britain , that are involved in the European Union 's Operation Atalanta to protect ships against piracy in the area .
It indicated that the hijacking of at least three vessels , including the Karagöl , the Greek cargo ship Titan and Spanish tuna trawler Felipe Ruano , followed tipoffs from the London - centred network of informers , according to Cadena SER .
In each case , according to the report , the pirates had full knowledge of the cargo , nationality and course of the vessel .
It is not clear who these ­" consultants " were , but Dincel believes they may work inside the industry .
" They knew the ­vessel , they knew the cargo , they knew the loading ports , they knew the destination , they knew everything , " he said .
" The knew their job . "
Andrew Mwangura , who heads the East African 's Seafarer 's Assistance Programme , a piracy monitoring group based in Mombassa , Kenya , said negotiations over hijacked ships often involve Somalis in London .
" Not only for the Karagöl , but for many other ships , the negotiations involve people in London , " he said .
The EU report said information being passed to the pirates was often extracted from the international organisations that control or track the world 's shipping .
The national flag of the vessel was also taken into account when choosing a target , with British vessels apparently being increasingly avoided , the report said .
" We have heard this a lot .
It strikes me as plausible , " said Graeme Gibbon - Brooks , of Dryad Maritime Intelligence , last night .
" They are getting more sophisticated because they are funded by criminal gangs from outside of Somalia . "
He warned , however , that while pirates might receive information on individual targets from London and elsewhere it was still difficult to locate a ship in mid-ocean .
Pirates were more likely to receive lists of potential targets so they could identify one if they came across it , he said .
Dincel said he suspected the pirates ' informers had also infiltrated the authorities who run the Suez canal , enabling them to track the Karagöl 's movements from the moment it left the canal .
Dincel himself spoke several times a day to one of two pirate negotiators who had both lived in the US .
" One said he had lived there for 10 years , " he said .
" The other had graduated from a US college .
The ship 's master also said they were educated people . "
Dincel said the chief negotiator had told him over the telephone that all young Somalis wanted to become pirates .
" He said that he had a car , money and a house .
He has everything and the young people see him , and naturally they ask to be pirates . "
In January , Yardimci eventually airlifted money to the pirates to secure the release of the Karagöl and its cargo .

The biggest changes of note are :
Shader convenience module OpenGL.GL.shaders , provides shader entry points named as the core entry points with alternate implementations using ARB when necessary .
Includes Two utility functions compileShader ( source , type_constant ) and compileProgram ( * shaders ) which allow for easily creating shader - using demos .
Cython OpenGL_accelerate wrapper mechanism accelerators available ( pre-built for Python 2.5 and 2.6 on Win32 )
Many bug - fixes .
SIZE_1_ARRAY_UNPACK
flag to configure single - value - array - unpacking behaviour
CONTEXT_CHECKING
flag to enable rigorous ( slow ) checking for valid contexts before each GL / GLU / GLE call in order to debug crashes due to calls before there is a valid context present .
STORE_POINTERS flag to enable / disable storage of ( temporary ) pointers
Optimizations to reduce or remove certain wrapper operations when the ERROR_ON_COPY flag is enabled .
This release is very much an alpha , do not install in production environments , use it to test your software and send me bug reports .
There are enough significant implementation changes in this release that it would be extremely unlikely that no bugs have crept in .

The United States attorney representing the Post Office , S. Hazard Gillespie Jr. , thought Rembar had misread the law , and he recited a clause of the Roth ruling that Rembar had omitted .
Justice Brennan had written that controversial ideas “ have the full protection ” of the First Amendment  “ unless , ” Gillespie underlined , these ideas were “ excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests . ”
One of those interests , surely , was keeping obscenity under wraps .
Hence Rembar ’s argument was irrelevant .
This was , however , just the rebuttal Rembar was hoping for .
He pointed out a footnote in which Brennan elaborated on what kind of “ more important interests ” were “ excludable . ”
All of them involved actions  peddling , picketing , parading without a license , playing loud music from a truck .
The First Amendment did n’t protect any of that .
But none of Brennan ’s examples involved writing  expression unattached to conduct .
Pure expression could be forbidden , Rembar argued , only if it was “ utterly without social importance . ”
On July 21 , 1959 , Judge Bryan ruled in favor of Grove Press and ordered the Post Office to lift all restrictions on sending copies of “ Lady Chatterley ’s Lover ” through the mail .
This , in effect , marked the end of the Post Office ’s authority  which , until then , it held absolutely  to declare a work of literature “ obscene ” or to impound copies of those works or prosecute their publishers .
This was n’t exactly the end of obscenity as a criminal category .
Into the mid-1960s , Barney Rosset would wage battles in various state courts over William Burroughs ’s “ Naked Lunch ” and Henry Miller ’s “ Tropic of Cancer , ” other Grove novels now widely regarded as classics .
But the “ Chatterley ” case established the principle that allowed free speech its total victory .
The Post Office did appeal Judge Bryan ’s verdict ; a panel of three judges upheld it unanimously .
The government ’s lawyers decided not to appeal further to the Supreme Court .
They knew that they would lose  that the justices who , just two years earlier , had excluded this sort of literature from constitutional protection would now change their minds .
They knew that Rembar ’s creative view of Justice Brennan ’s opinion  a view that Brennan had not explicitly considered when he wrote it  was logically unassailable .
The case also made clear that laws are more complex than strike zones or foul lines , which is why the analogy between judges and umpires is so misleading .
The distinction is sharpened by another argument Rembar made during the “ Lady Chatterley ” trial .
“ A novel , no matter how much devoted to the act of sex , ” he said , “ can hardly add to the constant sexual prodding with which our environment assails us . ”
In the mass media of the day , with its appeals to a booming youth market , movies and advertisements were often “ calculated to produce sexual thoughts and reactions , ” to the point where “ we live in a sea of sexual provocation . ”
The latest news in the world of Internet censorship is about China 's Green Dam software , which ostensibly protects Chinese children by filtering out pornographic Web sites .
The OpenNet Initiative reported on the software yesterday .
China has recently announced that all PCs sold in the country must come with the software , beginning on July 1 , 2009 .
Critics say Green Dam will be used to crack down on Internet users , making it even more difficult to access uncensored information from China .
In addition to blocking sites that include keywords such as " pornography " and , somewhat less justifiably , " touch " and " play , " the software also filters out images that have a high percentage of " skin colored " pixels .
Oiwan Lam at Global Voices rounded up Chinese reactions to the software ; among them was this comment :
" How much flesh color does it take to make something ' pornography ' ?
I went on the Internet to check out some animal photos .
A lovely little naked pig was sent onto the black list .
Pitiful little pig !
I was curious , so I looked up some photos of naked African women .
Oh , they were not censored ! "

An American soldier was blinded in one eye and three others required medical evacuation out of Iraq in a series of laser " friendly fire " incidents , the U.S. military has disclosed .
These injuries are caused by the misuse of dangerous green - laser dazzlers .
Since November 2008 , a single unit in Iraq " has experienced 12 green - laser incidents involving 14 soldiers and varying degrees of injury .
Three soldiers required medical evacuation out of Iraq and one soldier is now blind in one eye , " writes Sgt. Crystal Reidy , from the3rd Sustainment Command ( Expeditionary ) , or ESC .
Captain Russell Harris , a Troop Commander with 3rd ESC reports that his troops have suffered " temporary blindness , headaches and blurred vision , ” as a result of laser incidents .
Others describe severe , 48 - hour migraines after lasing .
These types of laser injuries appear to be common when units first deploy to Iraq , and may be the result of inadequate training ; soldiers may assume that the lasers are harmless and use them without due caution .
It is not clear what type of laser was involved .
In 2006 , the Army 's Rapid Equipping Force reportedly acquired 2,000 green lasers for use at checkpoints , as a tool to warn oncoming drivers to stop .
Although they are said to be safe for eyes , the unspecified lasers are also described as being fifty times the power of normal red-laser pointers .
( Green light is far more effective than red for dazzling . )
MSNBC noted in 2006 that troops were trained not to use the laser closer than 75 yards , as this " would cause eye damage . "
Noah and David Axe reported some time ago on the Marine Corps ' struggle to get laser dazzlers ; one source estimated that up to fifty civilians had been killed because of the lack an effective warning device .
And instead of getting the CHP laser dazzler they asked for , the Marines ' top brass stepped in and sent them the GBD - III , or Green Beammade by BE Meyers .
The problem is that the GBD - III is not intended to dazzle .
The makers call it " the most powerful military grade visible lasers available " to be " used for weapon aiming or marking targets for fire support . "
They quote a Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance ( NOHD ) of 1,460 meters :
In other words , the GBD - III laser can potentially cause eye injuries if used on anyone up to almost a mile away .
( By contrast the CHP laser dazzlerhas an NOHD of 45 meters . )
And it 's easy to see how accidents could happen with this type of laser without thorough training .
“ We are all U.S. soldiers , you would never point your rifle at another soldier , do n’t point your laser , ” says a Sergeant in the 3rd ESC who experienced a laser incident .
Things might be about to get a lot worse .
There are a number of lasers under development for the " Counter Rocket , Artillery , Mortar , " or CRAM role , detonating or destroying incoming rounds before they are a threat .
Unfortunately , laser light scattered off the target may cause eye damage to anyone in the area , and the Army has issued two contracts to develop technology for safer lasers .
These are a " High - Power 2.1 Micron Fiber Laser " from Advalue Photonics Inc and a " Fiber - Based , Reduced Eye - Hazard Laser " from Q Peak Inc .
" To date , the solid lasers involved have employed either neodymium ( Nd ) - or ytterbium ( Yb ) - doped media ....
All operate in the 1000 - 1100 - nm wavelength region , which , because the wavelengths are invisible but are transmitted to the retina , leads to a significant operational concern about eye safety in real - world uses .
Even minimal reflections from targets or debris can exceed the eye - safety limit , " notes the proposal from Q Peak .
The new lasers would be " retina safe " — any eye damage would be confined to the surface of the eyeball which is far less serious and need not result in permanent blinding .
Air Force personnel have had laser eye protection for some years .
It may be time to start issuing it a lot more widely .
UPDATE : The Expeditionary Times have withdrawn the original piece , which is why we changed the link to a site that copied the original – but only because of some minor errors , and they have issued a corrected version .
They still emphasise the dangers of careless use of laser dazzlers and the number of casualties that have been caused .
As the Army Surgeon General advises : " Always treat lasers with the same respect and care as you would a loaded weapon . "

Upon returning from Switzerland two days ago , Srur was arrested by Israeli security officials at the Allenby Bridge crossing and is currently being held at the Ofer Prison .
His brother Moussa told Ynet that Mohammad had first contacted his family on Wednesday , and that he had not been questioned since his arrest .
The family says the arrest is an attempt to hurt Srur because of his testimony before the UN committee .
His brother rejected the notion that the arrest was a result of any transgression on his brother 's part , and said the latter had received permission to embark on the excursion .
Security sources claim Srur was detained for questioning on suspicion that he was involved in terror activity and that his visit to Geneva had no bearing on the arrest .
In March 2007 , acting on an ambitious whim , I found myself running the Marathon des Sables , a 151 - mile ( 243 km ) six - day endurance race in the Sahara .
The event , dubbed the " toughest footrace in the world " is notable not only for its searing temperatures but for its location in one of Earth 's most unhospitable environments .
There could have been no more dramatic introduction to the vast potential of solar power .
It was neither the incredible heat , nor the desolate expanses of scorched earth that had left the greatest impression .
Rather , it was the fact that , in the middle of nowhere and without seeing a plug socket for days , a tiny solar panel was all it took to charge my MP3 player .
I had been a keen environmentalist for some time , starting up a sustainable - living blog in 2004 .
Now though , I turned my attention to solar energy .
Investigations led me to the first solar - powered rickshaws operating in India .
Always keen to seek out original challenges , I meandered onto the idea of taking one on a long distance journey .
To my dismay , the rickshaw was not suitable for covering such distance .
But the idea of undertaking an adventure to demonstrate solar around the world had taken root .
If I could n't do it on a rickshaw I would do it in another environmentally - friendly way : by bicycle .
I began to read about new flexible nanosolar panels , which would be ideal to power my technology in places far from a plug .
In my research , I eventually found G24 Innovations , a Cardiff - based company specialising in dye - sensitised flexible thin - film solar technology .
I gave them a call .
" Of course we can make solar panniers .
We can attach the panels to almost any fabric . "
Really ?
Could I have a solar dress too ?
Sadly , the dress was deemed impractical but I convinced my friends Iain and Jamie to accompany me on this solar - powered journey .
Today , starting in London on EU Solar Day , we set off for a 12,000 - mile tour of solar power around the world .
We are taking a satellite tracking device which , along with other communications equipment , will be powered using solar panels on our bike panniers .
The independence of the solar kit will help us document the entire route - from Libyan sandstorms to ancient Iranian cities , 4000 - metre passes in Kyrgyzstan to the lowest point of Death Valley - precisely and second by second .
Our route has been chosen to take us through North Africa and the Middle East in order to visit a concentrated solar plant and profile the work of the Trans - Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation ( TREC ) , a project to supply huge amounts of green energy from the Sahara .
We 'll go past the Quidam basin , where the world 's biggest PV solar power station is being built , across the pacific by cargo ship ( we are hoping to be carried by Nippon who have just launched the first solar - assisted freighter ) and on to America 's solar heartland , the Nevada desert .
I hope the trip will demonstrate the potential of solar power in the run up to the Copenhagen climate summit this December .
Follow us in real - time on The Solar Cycle Diaries , and wish us good luck with the weather .

Activision recently changed the publishing date of Singularity ( FPS ) and they might delay StarCraft 2 aswell .
The reason might be " Modern Warfare 2 " which belongs to the very popular FPS series " Call of Duty " .
Due to the fact that the first quarter of a year usually has a low turnover for publishers this could be a big opportunity for Activision to sell Modern Warfare 2 in winter and StarCraft 2 in spring .
Another reason is timing of the beta test which has not even started yet .
Gamestar.de explains that Blizzard has not confirmed this theory but what 's more important is that they did n't deny it .
I hope they will release the game in 2009 but a big publisher as Activision might want to get the highest possible turnover .
This would be really sick !!!

Well , Well ... Going to Healthcare Hell ...
by Donna Smith - June 18th , 2009 - Commondreams
While here in the United States , we let insurance companies not only get in between our doctors and patients but actually block them ever seeing one another .
This week we heard testimony in a Congressional committee that the insurance companies our President and Congress want so desperately to protect have no intention of stopping the practice of policy rescissions .
Rescissions happen when you get sick , file an insurance claim and then the insurance company searches your records to find reasons they would have denied you coverage before your illness and then retroactively drops your coverage .
And their favorite targets ?
The committee found , according to the Los Angeles Times , " WellPoint 's Blue Cross targeted individuals with more than 1,400 conditions , including breast cancer , lymphoma , pregnancy and high blood pressure . "
Ugly stuff .
And talk about getting between you and your doctor ...
( emphasis added )
http://www.michaelmoore.com/...
Additional source : LA Times -- June 17 2009
How can this be legal ?
How can Insurers target you for " retroactively dropping your coverage " simply because you " got sick " ?
Is n't that what Health Insurance IS FOR ?
Do n't try telling the average Health Insurance Exec about " What Health Insurance is for " -- because chances are you wo n't be speaking any language he or she understands .
( ie . you wo n't be speaking " Legalese " ! )
Just listen to the Legalese , those Exec's are asserting to the Senate Committee , regarding their position on " Cancellation Practices " after being challenged to change them :
Insurers Refuse To Stop Canceling Some Sick Patients ' Policies
18 Jun 2009
The House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations found that " policyholders with breast cancer , lymphoma and more than 1,000 other conditions were targeted for rescission and that employees were praised in performance reviews for terminating the policies of customers with expensive illnesses . "
One executive said rescission is intended to stop fraud and abuse .
The [ L.A. ]
Times reports that the executives " would not commit to limiting rescissions to only policyholders who intentionally lie or commit fraud to obtain coverage , a refusal that met with dismay from legislators on both sides of the political aisle .
( emphasis added )
http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/...
Why would they want to " kill the Golden Goose " ?
Unless , of course , that " Goose " is just a " former " policy holder , who happened to get one of those " expensive ailment " ( one with a high Payout - to - Premium Ratio ) .
Then in those cases , " what the hey ! "
In those cases , some " unlucky Goose " may soon , out on their own ! ... without the insurance coverage , they were counting on to be there , in times of crisis .
SO how is the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations finding out this shocking information about " inner workings " of the Insurance Industry ?
Simple -- one of the Industry 's former Execs , actually " grew a conscious " -- and is telling the truth about how these " Privateers " really operate :
Health Insurance Exec Speaks
Testimony of Wendell Potter before the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation
by Wendell Potter , Date June 24 , 2009
My name is Wendell Potter and for 20 years , I worked as a senior executive at health insurance companies , and I saw how they confuse their customers and dump the sick -- all so they can satisfy their Wall Street investors .
I know from personal experience that members of Congress and the public have good reason to question the honesty and trustworthiness of the insurance industry .
Insurers make promises they have no intention of keeping , they flout regulations designed to protect consumers , and they make it nearly impossible to understand -- or even to obtain -- information we need .
[...]
In the 15 years since insurance companies killed the Clinton plan , the industry has consolidated to the point that it is now dominated by a cartel of large for - profit insurers .
( emphasis added )

[ continuing pg 2 ]
[...]
To help meet Wall Street 's relentless profit expectations , insurers routinely dump policyholders who are less profitable or who get sick .
Insurers have several ways to cull the sick from their rolls .
One is policy rescission .
They look carefully to see if a sick policyholder may have omitted a minor illness , a pre-existing condition , when applying for coverage , and then they use that as justification to cancel the policy , even if the enrollee has never missed a premium payment .
[...]
They also dump small businesses whose employees ' medical claims exceed what insurance underwriters expected .
All it takes is one illness or accident among employees at a small business to prompt an insurance company to hike the next year 's premiums so high that the employer has to cut benefits , shop for another carrier , or stop offering coverage altogether -- leaving workers uninsured .
The practice is known in the industry as purging .
The purging of less profitable accounts through intentionally unrealistic rate increases

As disturbing as that internal Private Sector " so - called competition " is -- there is also a more " human side " of those boardroom profit equations .

The Health Care Industry vs. Health Reform
by Wendell Potter - 06/25/2009
What I saw happening over the past few years was a steady movement away from the concept of insurance and toward " individual responsibility , " a term used a lot by insurers and their ideological allies .
This is playing out as a continuous shifting of the financial burden of health care costs away from insurers and employers and onto the backs of individuals .
As a result , more and more sick people are not going to the doctor or picking up their prescriptions because of costs .
If they are unfortunate enough to become seriously ill or injured , many people enrolled in these plans find themselves on the hook for such high medical bills that they are losing their homes to foreclosure or being forced into bankruptcy .
As an industry spokesman , I was expected to put a positive spin on this trend that the industry created and euphemistically refers to as " consumerism " and to promote so - called " consumer - driven " health plans .
I ultimately reached the point of feeling like a huckster .
[...]
Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw when I reached the Wise County Fairgrounds , where the expedition was being held .
Hundreds of people had camped out all night in the parking lot to be assured of seeing a doctor or dentist when the gates opened .
By the time I got there , long lines of people stretched from every animal stall and tent where the volunteers were treating patients .
That scene was so visually and emotionally stunning it was all I could do to hold back tears .
How could it be that citizens of the richest nation in the world were being treated this way ?
( emphasis added )
http://guaranteedhealthcare4all.org/...
Good Question , Wendell !
How could it be ?
...
How can it continue to be ?
Why can't OUR Representatives intervene in a system , that counts its Profits , according to the number of Patients it casts aside ?
Until they have an " honest broker " as a Competitor ( ie the Public Option ) , we will just continue to see
insurers routinely dump policyholders who are less profitable or who get sick .
Take it from an Industry Insider .
Whatever you do , do n't " get " any of these more " costly " conditions :
breast cancer , lymphoma , pregnancy , or high blood pressure .
or any of the 1400 others that would make you a " Candidate for Cancellation " .
Afterall those Insurance Exec have to keep " Purging the less Profitable Policies " , if they 're going to keep their Shareholders - bosses happy !
( or so they just told the Sub Committee )
Best bet , just Do n't ever get sick , period !

Extract from paper I am writing on Jesus ' historicity
Here is an extract for comments ...
A skeptical argument
I want now to show how our two principles - P1 and P2 - combine with certain plausible empirical claims to deliver a conclusion that very few Biblical scholars are willing to accept .
Let me stress at the outset that I am not endorsing the following argument .
I present it , not because I am convinced it is cogent , but because I believe it has some prima facie plausibility , and because it is an argument that any historian who believes the available evidence places Jesus ’ existence beyond reasonable doubt needs to refute .
1. ( P1 ) Where a claim ’s justification derives solely from evidence , extraordinary claims ( e.g. concerning supernatural miracles ) require extraordinary evidence .
In the absence of extraordinary evidence there is good reason to be skeptical about those claims .
.
2 . There is no extraordinary evidence for any of the extraordinary claims concerning supernatural miracles made in the New Testament documents .
3 . Therefore ( from 1 and 2 ) , there 's good reason to be skeptical about those extraordinary claims .
4. ( P2 ) Where testimony / documents weave together a narrative about an individual that combines mundane claims with a large proportion of extraordinary claims , and there is good reason to be skeptical about those extraordinary claims , then there is good reason to be skeptical about the mundane claims , at least until we possess good independent evidence of their truth .
5 . The New Testament documents weave together a narrative about Jesus that combines mundane claims with a large proportion of extraordinary claims .
6 . There is no good independent evidence for even the mundane claims about Jesus ( such as that he existed )
7 . Therefore ( from 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) , there 's good reason to be skeptical about whether Jesus existed .
This argument combines our principles P1 and P2 with three further premises - 2 , 5 and 6 - concerning the character of the available evidence .
These are the premises on which historians and Biblical scholars are better qualified than I to comment upon .
However , premise 5 , is , I take it , uncontentious .
Clearly , many historians also accept premise 2 ( there is a significant number of Biblical historians who remain sceptical about the miracle claims made in the New Testament , and most will surely accept 2 ) .
What of premise 6 ?
Well , it is at least controversial among historians to what extent the evidence supplied by Josephus and Tacitus , etc. provides us good , independent evidence for the existence of an historical Jesus .
Those texts provide us with some non-miracle - involving evidence for the existence of Jesus , of course , but whether it can rightly be considered good , genuinely independent evidence remains widely debated among the experts .
So , our empirical premises – 2 , 5 and 6 , – have some prima facie plausibility .
Premises 2 and 5 have a great deal of plausibility , I suggest , and 6 is at the very least debatable .
I suspect a significant number of Biblical scholars and historians ( though of course by no means all ) would accept all three empirical premises .
If that is so , it then raises an intriguing question : why , then , is there such a powerful consensus that those who take a sceptical attitude to Jesus ’ existence are being unreasonable ?
The most obvious answer to this question is that while many Biblical historians probably would accept that our three empirical premises have at least a fair degree of plausibility , and most of them probably also accept something like P1 , few of them accept P2 .
Indeed , as we shall see below , many of them do in fact reject P2 .
Assessing P2
Are there cogent objections to P2 ?
Presumably , some sort of contamination principle is correct , for clearly , in the Ted and Sarah Case , the dubious character of the extraordinary , uncorroborated parts of their testimony about Bert does contaminate the non-extraordinary parts .
However , perhaps , as an attempt to capture the extent to which testimony concerning the extraordinary parts of a narrative can end up undermining the credibility of the more mundane parts , P2 goes too far , laying down a condition that is too strong ?
After all , Alexander the Great was said to have been involved in miraculous events .
Plutarch records , for example , that Alexander was miraculously guided across the desert day and night by flocks of ravens that waited for his army when it fell behind .
Plutarch also suggests Alexander was divinely conceived .
Should the presence of these extraordinary claims lead us to reject all of Plutarch ’s claims concerning Alexander as untrustworthy ?
Of course not .
As historian Michael Grant notes :
That there was a growth of legend round Jesus cannot be denied , and it arose very quickly .
But there had also been a rapid growth of legend around pagan figures like Alexander the Great ; and yet nobody regards him as wholly mythical and fictitious ( 200 )
Indeed , no one of note is skeptical about Alexander ’s existence .
However , noe of this should lead us to abandon P2 .
For P2 does not require that we be sceptical about the existence of Alexander .
To focus just on Plutarch ’s history – the miraculous claims made by Plutarch constitute only a small proportion of his account of Alexander ’s achievements .
Moreover , regarding the miracle of the ravens , it is not even clear we are dealing with a supernatural miracle , rather than some honestly misinterpreted natural phenomenon .
Further , there is good , independent evidence that Alexander existed and did many of the things Plutarch reports ( including archeological evidence of the dynasties left in his wake ) .
So the inclusion of a couple of miraculous elements in some of the evidence we have about Alexander is not much of a threat to our knowledge about him – and P2 does not suggest otherwise .
The problem with the textual evidence for Jesus ’ existence and crucifixion is that most of the details we have about him come solely from documents in which the miraculous constitutes a very large part of what is said about Jesus , where many of these miracles ( walking on water , etc. ) are unlikely to be merely misinterpreted natural phenomena , and where it is at least questionable whether we possess any good , independent non-miracle - involving evidence of his existence and crucifixion .
Other reasons for rejecting P2
Even if P2 does not require we be sceptical about the existence of Alexander , perhaps it still sets the bar for reasonable belief too high ?
In a culture in which miracle claims are rife , perhaps the inclusion of even a significant number of miracle stories within an historical narrative should not necessarily require we adopt a sceptical attitude towards what remains , even if we possess no good independent evidence for its truth .
I return to this concern about P2 below ( in “ Does the cultural difference matter ? ” ) .
Historians may also reject P2 on other grounds .
They may suggest there are particular features of textual evidence that can still rightly lead us to be confident about the truth of some of the non-miraculous parts , even if the evidence involves very many miracle claims , and even if there is no good independent evidence for the truth of the non-miraculous parts .
Several criteria have been suggested for considering at least many of the non-miraculous claims made about Jesus in the New Testament documents to be accurate and indeed to be established beyond reasonable doubt .
The three most popular criteria are the criterion of multiple attestation , the criterion of embarrassment , and the criterion of discontinuity .
The criterion of multiple attestation
Several historians ( such as Michael Grant and John Meier ) suggest that the fact that a number of different New Testament sources make similar claims in different literary forms gives us some reason , at least , to suppose these claims are true .
C. Leslie Milton goes further - he argues that the New Testament gospels draw on three recognised primary sources ( Mark , Q and L ) , and concludes that :
If an item occurs in any one of these early sources , it has a presumptive right to be considered as probably historical in essence ; if it occurs in two …that right is greatly strengthened , since it means it is supported by two early and independent witnesses .
If it is supported by three , then its attestation is extremely strong . ”
REF P82 .
Milton cites a list of claims that pass this test of “ multiple attestation ” , insisting they have a “ strong claim to historicity on the basis of this particular test , making a solid nucleus with which to begin . ”
REF P83 .
If we already know that Jesus existed and is likely to have said at least some of what he is alleged to have said , this criterion might provide us with a useful tool in attempting to determine which attributions are accurate and which are later fabrications .
But what if we are unsure whether there was any such person as Jesus existed ?
How useful is Milton ’s criterion then ?
How can we know we are dealing with reports tracing back to the testimony of handful of independent eye - witnesses to real events , rather than , say , a skilled band of myth - makers ?
Consistency between accounts can indicate the extent to which their transmission from an original source or sources has been reliable , but it cannot indicate whether the source itself is reliable .
As Grant notes about the homogeneity of the Gospel accounts of the life of Jesus :
one must not underestimate the possibility that this homogeneity is only achieved because of their employment of common sources , not necessarily authentic in themselves .
REF p203
In fact , even if we are dealing with largely consistent reports from several alleged eye - witnesses themselves , the fact that their reports contain a large proportion of extraordinary claims will normally make us highly suspicious even about the non-miraculous parts of their testimony .
If , in the Ted and Sarah case , we increase the number of alleged witnesses to Bert ’s miraculous visitation from two to ten , we would still , rightly , remain rather sceptical about whether there was any such person as Bert .
The criterion of embarrassment
One of the most popular tests applied by historians in attempting to establish historical facts about Jesus is the criterion of embarrassment .
The Jesus narrative involves several episodes which , from the point of view of early Christians , would seem to constitute an embarrassment .
C. Leslie Milton asserts that
those items which the early Church found embarrassing are not likely to be the invention of the early Church .
Milton supposes that reports of Jesus ’
attitude to the Sabbath , fasting and divorce ( in contradiction to Moses ’ authorization of it in certain conditions ) , his free - and - easy relationships with people not regarded as respectable
all pass this test .
Michael Grant also considers Jesus ’ association with outcasts , his proclamation of the imminent fulfilment of the Kingdom of God ( which did not materialize ) , and his rejection of his family “ because he was beside himself ” embarrassing to the early Church , and concludes these attributions are unlikely to be inventions of early evangelists .
Meier too , considers the criterion of embarrassment a useful if not infallible criterion .
Regarding the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist – which raises the puzzle of why the “ superior sinless one submits to a baptism meant for sinners ” ( REF p 168 ) - Meier says ,
Quite plainly , the early Church was “ stuck with ” an event in Jesus ’ life that it found increasingly embarrassing , that it tried to explain away by various means , and that John the Evangelist finally erased from his Gospel .
It is highly unlikely that the Church went out of its way to create the cause of its own embarrassment ” ( p169 )
The criterion of embarrassment is related to a further criterion – that of discontinuity ( they are related because discontinuity is sometimes a source of embarrassment ) .
The criterion of discontinuity
Many historians assert that if a teaching or saying attributed to Jesus places him at odds with the contemporary Judaism and early Christian communities , then we possess grounds for supposing the attribution is accurate .
Again , Jesus ’ rejection of voluntary fasting and his acceptance of divorce are claimed to pass this test .
Historian Norman Perrin considers the criterion of discontinuity the fundamental criterion , giving us an assured minimum of material with which to begin .
C. Leslie Milton concurs that this criterion gives historians an “ unassailable nucleus ” of material to work with ( REF p 84 ) .
John Meier considers the criterion promising , though he notes that it may place undue emphasis on Jesus ’ idiosyncracies , “ highlighting what was striking but possible peripheral in his message ” ( p173 ) .
Yesterday nursery worker Vanessa George was charged with abusing children in her care .
The fact that she is a woman has caused widespread shock - but , reports Sandra Laville , it is an issue that society has long brushed under the carpet
Every so often , a criminal case jolts the national consciousness : James Bulger , the Soham murders , Beverley Allitt and the death of Baby P to name just a few .
The mob who gathered outside Plymouth magistrates court yesterday for the arrival of Vanessa George signalled all too clearly that her story has already been added to that list .
Child sexual abuse is shocking and disturbing enough , but the added fact that this allegation is levelled against a woman who was in loco parentis for hundreds of very small children has created waves of outright confusion , anger and disbelief .
All our newspapers and broadcasters have pored over the details of the case of George , who is charged with four counts of sexually assaulting children , and three of making , possessing and distributing indecent images of children .
The key talking points have been the rarity of women as sexual abusers , the easy access women have to children , and the nightmare question facing parents : if you cannot trust a nursery to look after your infant , then who can you trust ?
If nothing else , the case raises awareness of a topic that society as a whole - from police officers to social workers , teachers and the general public - has historically failed to acknowledge fully .
Women can and do sexually abuse children .
What 's more , according to recent research , the failure to recognise this can hinder child abuse investigations and the detection of female abusers .
Research for the NSPCC from 2005 says there is " compelling " evidence of a wide variety of sexual offences known to have been committed by women , either alone or with a man - from voyeurism to inappropriate touching , rape , penetration and ritualistic , sadistic sexual abuse .
While the existence of paedophile websites has been acknowledged and investigated for years , it is not so widely known that there are several sites catering for female paedophiles .
One of these sites has carried comments such as " I really look at little girls and want to see them naked " , and " I am a 21 - year - old and for as long as I can think I have been attracted to young girls around 5 - 12 years old ...
I buy movies because there are little girls in them .
Books about little girls in sexual situations ... I am not attracted to women , only young girls . "
This particular website is one of the most prolific .
Agencies have tried to close it down , only for it to re-emerge under a new name .
Dr Sharon Lambert , a psychologist who has studied female sexual abusers , says : " We still do n't really understand what effect the internet has on people , least of all on women .
All of the research has been done on men interacting with these paedophile sites .
But women are also interacting with them and , as yet , we do n't know how likely it is that women who view these websites feel their behaviour is rationalised and validated enough to go on and commit further offences .
One thing that is recognised is that women have far more unfettered access to children than men . "
Everyone in the field agrees that the internet revolution has provided extraordinary opportunities for paedophiles .
Images of children being abused in a home in the UK can be viewed around the world within minutes , making the investigation and prosecution an international concern .
One of the most recent cases of a female sex abuser in the UK was uncovered by the FBI , who were viewing hundreds of images as part of a global operation .
From a single picture of a victim , they traced the abuse to a home in Northamptonshire and , within six hours of being contacted by the FBI , officers from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Unit were on the doorstep .
They arrested Katie Scott , 26 , and her partner Christopher Oxtoby , 27 .
Scott was jailed last year for four - and - a - half years for sexually abusing a four - month - old child , an act that was filmed and distributed on the web by Oxtoby , who received an indeterminate sentence .
Two years ago , police in Kent broke up a paedophile ring in which a middle - class woman , a pharmeceutical rep , was convicted of four offences of sexual activity with a child and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child .
Monica McCanch , 55 , and two male companions had subjected two children to what the police described as " horrific abuse " .
She was jailed for six years .
Research suggests that between 5 and 10 % of sexual offences against children are carried out by women , either acting alone or with a male accomplice , but the true extent of female sexual abuse is simply not known .
A senior paedophile investigator says lack of acknowledgement that women can and do sexually abuse children could delay detection of sexual assaults .
" It 's almost certainly the case that people tend to make assumptions it is the male doing the abuse .
There have been a few cases where teams have had medical evidence that sexual assaults are taking place , but the officers have looked at the man again and again and found nothing - and then later thought ; ' Ah , perhaps we should have a look at mum here . ' "
" We have to get away from believing in the typical image of a paedophile - a middle - aged , balding man wearing a dirty raincoat , " says Zoe Hilton , policy adviser for child protection with the NSPCC .
" It 's important that we do n't become fixated with this image .
It blurs the real extent of sexual abuse and can make it difficult for children to speak out .
Child abuse is very prevalent in society , and it comes from a range of sources , including those people whom society views as maternal and nurturing : women " .
• Are women who abuse children more demonised than their male counterparts ?
Are teenage victims of sexual abuse treated differently ?

The new report confirms uncontrolled waves of violent , eco-damaging and illegal fishing activity worldwide , but with some of the biggest offences connected to the European market
Pirate fishing is out of control , depriving some the most world 's most vulnerable communities of food and leading to ecological catastrophe , a three - year investigation has found .
" Illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing is one of the most serious threats to the future of world fisheries .
It is now occurring in virtually all fishing grounds from shallow coastal waters to deep oceans .
It is believed to account for a significant proportion of the global catch and to be costing developing countries up to $ 15bn a year , " says the report by the Environmental Justice Foundation .
Unscrupulous Chinese , European and Latin American companies , using flags of convenience , are operating illegal gear , fishing in sea areas they are not allowed and are not reporting their catches , the investigators found .
In addition , ships are laundering illegally caught fish by transferring them at sea to legal boats making it impossible to identify catches .
The situation is particularly serious in African waters where pirate fishing may be now be taking nearly 30 % of the catch from local fishermen .
" IUU operators are stealing food from some of the poorest people in the world and are ruining the lives of local fishermen in countries like Somalia , Angola .
These countries do not have the resources to police their territorial waters , " says the report .
An aerial survey of Guinea 's territorial waters found that 60 % of the 2,313 ships spotted were committing offences .
Surveys of Sierra Leone and Guinea Bissau waters found that levels of illegal fishing at 29 % and 23 % .
An estimated 700 foreign - owned vessels are fishing regularly in Somalian waters for endangered tuna , shark and lobster .
" Heavily armed foreign vessels come close inshore and compete with small scale , artisan fishermen .
They destroy their nets and traps and this has resulted in confrontations and loss of life , " says the report .
Apart from the human misery that the pirate fishers are causing , the investigators found the practice undermining conservation measures , resulting in the depletion of fish stocks .
Up to 75 % of the world 's fish stocks are fully exploited , over exploited or depleted according to the UN's Food and Agriculture organisation .
Rich countries police some oceans , but at great expense .
In 2003 , the Australian navy chased the Uruguayan - flagged Viarsa 1 trawler for 21 days across the Southern ocean .
Its illegal catch of Patagonian toothfish was finally sold for over $ 1 m .
But poor countries are helpless in the face of force used against them .
Angolan fisheries authorities , says the report , have had their boats rammed and sunk by illegal trawlers , whilst other pirates have hurled buckets of boiling water on boarding parties .
At least two inspectors have disappeared , believed murdered , while on observer duty aboard industrial trawlers .
The authors identify Las Palmas in the Canary islands as the centre of the illegal fishing trade in the Atlantic ocean .
IUU vessels are allowed to land or tranship illegal catches which then enter Europe and the international market .
The port only employs a handful of inspectors .
" It is inexcusable that the Spanish government and the wider European authorities have failed to close Las Palmas , " says the report .
It recommends that a global database of high seas fishing vessels is set up and that onboard observers , aerial patrols and more patrol vessels be used .
But it acknowledges that countries need to put up hundreds of millions of pounds to stamp it out .
In a separate study , international marine group Oceana reported that European seas are among the most damaged in the world due to overfishing .
" According to the European Commission , 88 % of our fish stocks are overexploited .
Of these , 69 % are at risk of collapse .
Each day in European waters more than 55,000 tonnes of oily and bilge waters and fuel waste are spilled into the sea , more than 350,000 hectares of the sea bed is impacted by trawlers and 20,000 tonnes of fish are taken out , " says the report .
" Up to 3,000 tonnes of fish caught accidentally by fishing vessels in European waters is thrown back dead .
Discards can reach 90 % of the total weight of the catch in some fisheries , " it adds .
Scented Candles for Every Day

However , even luxury scented candles are meant to be used every day as an affordable indulgence .
High quality scented candles , such as Barbara Berry or Altu scented candles , are designed to last for a long time .
While you may initially pay a little more for these candles than for cheap ( and often unsafe ) candles you find at your local grocery store , these candles last for dozens of hours and offer plenty of scent , even when unlit .
If you have been saving some luxury scented candles for a special occasion , consider making your candles part of everyday life .
Consider these tips for adding a little scented sparkle to your daily life :
Light a luxury scented candle while you take a long bath to unwind after a long day .
Light a luxury scented candle when serving dinner .
It ’s a simple and fast way to add some glamour and elegance to dinnertime , even if you ’re only serving leftovers .
Instead of spraying your home with an air freshener when you tidy up , light a luxury scented candle to add delicious scent safely to your home .
Tuck an unlighted luxury scented candle among your linens , clothes , or towels .
Quality candles have enough scent that they act like a sachet , even unlit .
Just remember to eventually take out your candle and enjoy it lit , as well .
When entertaining friends on a deck or in your home , light a luxury scented candle so that everyone can enjoy the scent .
Meditate with a luxury scented candle .

One good investment in a high quality luxury scented candle can mean months of use .
Candles can cost just a few dollars a month and can bring a great deal of pleasure and quiet luxury – not to mention elegance – to your life .

Massachusetts photographers have unearthed the only known image of legendary brain - injury patient Phineas Gage , a daguerreotype showing the former railroad worker sitting in repose and holding the nearly 4 - foot - long iron rod that pierced his brain without killing him .
Contemporary accounts suggest that Gage ’s personality was dramatically altered because he was disfigured in the accident , but the new image , to be published online next week in the Journal of the History of the Neurosciences , shows a relatively handsome man -- confirming the belief of most experts that damage to his brain accounted for the changed personality .
Gage was the 25 - year - old foreman of a construction gang on Sept. 13 , 1848 , preparing a railroad bed outside Cavendish , Vt .
As usual , he was using a pointed iron rod -- 3 feet , 7 inches long and 13 1/ 4 pounds -- to tamp gunpowder and sand into a hole drilled in the rock .
But on that day , the mixture exploded , sending the rod through his left cheek and out through the top of his head .
It was successfully removed and , to the surprise of physicians , Gage lived 11 more years , dying after a series of increasingly violent convulsions .
His story is a showpiece in neurology texts and folklore because of his survival and the abrupt changes in his personality .
Advertisement
The daguerreotype has been in the possession of Jack and Beverly Wilgus for 30 years , although they do not know its origin .
They thought it was an image of a whaler holding his harpoon , but whaling experts viewing it online told them it was not .
Then an anonymous tipster suggested it was Gage .
Intrigued , the Wilguses compared their image to that of a life mask at Harvard Medical School ’s Warren Anatomical Museum and found it could be superimposed perfectly , with scars lining up correctly .
Apparent writing on the metal rod in the image matches writing on Gage ’s iron rod , which is also in the Warren Museum .

DRESDEN , Germany  President Obama on Friday intensified his pledge to unlock the Middle East stalemate , sending an envoy next week to pursue his call for a two - state solution , as he toured a former concentration camp that he said served as a lesson to “ be ever - vigilant about the spread of evil in our own time . ”
The president met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on the contentious issues of detainees at Guantánamo Bay , the nuclear program in Iran and the global financial crisis .
But he quickly moved to the next stop of a trip built on his biography , visiting the site of Buchenwald , not far from where his great - uncle helped liberate prisoners in World War II .
“ To this day , there are those who insist that the Holocaust never happened  a denial of fact and truth that is baseless and ignorant and hateful , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ This place is the ultimate rebuke to such thoughts , a reminder of our duty to confront those who would tell lies about our history . ”
The poignant imagery , which was broadcast on television here , was intended to underscore what Mr. Obama had described the day before in Cairo as America ’s “ unbreakable ” bond with Israel .
His speech there , which also called for two states , angered some in Israel because of his forceful opposition to expanding existing settlements on the West Bank .

2. A SPAMMING PRIMER
How does a spammer obtain a million working e-mail addresses ?
Most simply , there are lists you can buy off the Internet .
But there are also other , cheaper , ways .
A '' dictionary attack , '' Colbert instructs , is when you blast reams of computer - generated potential e-mail names ( Arnie1@hotmail.com , Arnie2@hotmail.com , Arnie3@hotmail.com . . .) and see which ones take .
Another good tool is called a spider , a software program that can crawl through Web pages , looking for that telltale symbol : @ .
Then it simply records everything to the left and right of it , and bingo , it has a good e-mail address .
( A good method for avoiding spam , then , is to always type your e-mail address on the Web this way : Arnie at hotmail.com or ArnieREMOVETHIS@hotmail.com .
Humans can look at either and figure out what to do ; software -- so far -- is helpless . )
Sitting at Richard 's computer , I set out to launch my first spam .
I append a file of e-mail addresses to the software along with my cover letter -- my spam .
To keep everything vaguely legal , my spam is nothing more than a cheerful holiday greeting , at the end of which is a link to bowieltd.com , one of Colbert 's Web sites .
The software starts firing , and my notes ricochet through cyberspace .
The software monitors which e-mails are returned and tabulates their status .
When an '' out of the office ' ' auto - reply comes back on one e-mail message , Colbert says : '' Oh , we love those .
They confirm that the address is active . ''
Within six minutes , on a single computer , running through a regular phone line , I have fired off 1,000 e-mail messages .
Which is one of the attractive things about spam for spammers .
You do n't have to leave your mobile home to do it .
There 's no door - to - door soliciting for clients , no annual conferences to attend .
The business is all neatly contained on your desktop .
For instance , how does a spammer find clients willing to hire him ?
He spams .
Colbert used to find clients by trolling through AOL 's member directory .
Many of AOL 's 35 million members fill out helpful ' ' online profiles ' ' when they join , listing their interests and activities .
Colbert used those profiles to turn AOL into a rich and easy source of contacts .
He would limit his search by typing in '' business opportunity ' ' or '' multilevel marketing ' ' in order to find the sort of small - time sales folks who might be receptive to his offer , then he would spam them all with his pitch .
' ' I might get 100 responses from 100,000 e-mails , '' Colbert says .
He would write back personally to those , asking for the text of the ad they wanted to spam out and relaying his pricing structure : $ 300 to send out 100,000 messages or $ 900 for a million .
From the 100 people who would agree to hear his personal pitch , he would usually land between two and five contracts .
Although this might seem like a pitiful response rate -- one - five - hundredth of one percent is ruinous in any other market -- this one search for spam clients could yield Colbert as much as $ 14,000 .
Colbert describes how he would set his computers for '' send ' ' with millions of e-mail messages queued up , then go to sleep and let the machinery make the money for him .
'' I used to have nine computers bound over five DSL lines on a 10 meg pipe feeding 500 K per second per computer , '' Colbert says .
'' That 's a million e-mails an hour per computer , nine million an hour on a good day . ''

Overconsumption of fatty , sugary foods leads to changes in brain receptors , according to new animal research at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
The new research results are being presented at the 2009 annual meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior ( SSIB ) , the foremost society for research into all aspects of eating and drinking behavior .
The results have implications for understanding bulimia and other binge eating disorders .
Dr. Bello and colleagues report that either continuous eating or binge eating a high fat , high sugar diet alters opioid receptor levels in an area of the brain that controls food intake .
Opioids are a family of chemicals with actions similar to those of morphine ; however , opioids exist naturally in the brain and have been linked to feelings of pleasure and euphoria .
" These results are interesting because we saw changes in opioid receptor gene expression in a brain area that controls how much we eat during a meal " , said Bello .
The new findings suggest that overconsumption of highly palatable foods maintains bingeing by enhancing opioids in the brain , and that increased opioids could be a factor involved in binge eating disorders .
These findings may help to understand the biological basis of eating disorders .

Muslim extremists jailed for arson attack on Mohammed book publisher 's home
A fanatic who once paraded his baby in an ' I love Al Qaeda ' hat was yesterday jailed for firebombing the home of the publisher of a novel about Mohammed .
Sentencing Ali Beheshti , 41 , and two accomplices to four and a half years , Mrs Justice Rafferty told them : ' If you choose to live in this country , you live by its rules . '
' There is no such thing as " a la carte citizenship " and , in your case , there is no such thing as " a la carte obedience " to the law . '
Notorious : Ali Beheshti , posing with a gun in this Metropolitan Police photo , admitted conspiracy to endanger life
Beheshti , a follower of hate cleric Abu Hamza , poured diesel through the letterbox of Martin Rynja 's £ 2.5 million house and set it alight to ' punish ' him for agreeing to release The Jewel of Medina , a fictional account of the Prophet 's child bride .
Beheshti achieved notoriety three years ago at a protest against Danish cartoons of Mohammed when he was photographed with his 18 - month - old daughter , Farisa , whom he had dressed in a pink bonnet celebrating Al Qaeda .
Beheshti , who has a previous conviction for the attempted murder of his father , described her to reporters as the youngest member of the network .
Accomplices : Abrar Mirza , Abbas Taj and Ali Beheshti ( l - r ) were sentenced to four - and - a - half years in jail each
Last September , with accomplices Abrar Mirza , 23 , and Abbas Taj , 30 , he attacked the five - storey home and office of Mr Rynja in Islington , North London .
Cab driver Taj of Forest Gate , East London , acted as the getaway driver as Beheshti and Mirza , a mobile phone salesman of Walthamstow , North East London , poured diesel into the house .
A small fire began but nobody was hurt because police and fire crews arrived in time to smash down the door and put it out .
The defendents used diesel as an accelerant , causing damage to the front door of the publisher 's house
The arsonists were seized by armed police as they fled the scene in what officers described as an ' intelligenceled operation ' .
Yesterday Andrew Hall QC , for Beheshti , said it was 'an act of protest born of the publication of a book felt by him and other Muslims to be disrespectful , provocative and offensive ' .
Novel ' The Jewel of Medina ' motivated the extremists to commit the arson attack
Before his arrest Beheshti lived with his family in Ilford , East London .
He described himself as a pilot on Farisa 's birth certificate .
Beheshti and Mirza had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to recklessly damage property and endanger life at a hearing in April .
Taj was convicted of the same offence at Croydon Crown Court in May .
At a sentencing hearing yesterday Mrs Justice Rafferty , sitting at London 's Royal Courts of Justice , praised Mr Rynja as a ' principled man ' who had exercised critical judgment on a literary work , and stood up to be counted , knowing that publishing it put him at risk .
Mr Rynja 's publishing company , Gibson Square Books , bought the rights to the novel after Random House dropped plans to publish it , fearing it could ' incite acts of violence ' .
Miss Jones said her book was respectful to Islam , and Mr Rynja said last October that he felt its publication was part of a liberal democracy .
Before his arrest Beheshti lived with his family in a smart semi detached house in Ilford , east London , where a 2007 Mitsubishi 4x4 sits on the drive .
He described himself as a pilot on Farisa¹s birth certificate .
His wife , Hannah , 28 , is the daughter of a sales consultant for an engineering firm who grew up in a smart home in a Bristol suburb .
Beheshti and Mirza , a mobile phone salesman of Walthamstow , North East London , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to recklessly damage property and endanger life .
Cab driver Taj of Forest Gate , East London was convicted of the same offence at Croydon Crown Court in May .
They were sentenced at the Royal Courts of Justice for administrative reasons .
A new Web site called Republicans for Ignatieff makes things much easier for those who do n't have the time or the inclination to read what the Canadian Liberal leader wrote in the post - 9/11 period .
It 's a slick spoof designed to highlight Ignatieff 's right - wing leanings .
The site includes videotaped clips of Ignatieff expressing support for targeted assassinations and preventive detention .
Earlier this year , I interviewed retired political scientist Denis Smith , author of Ignatieff 's World Updated : Iggy Goes to Ottawa ( James Lorimer & Company Ltd. , $ 19.95 ) .
Smith exhaustively researched what Michael Ignatieff wrote over the past 20 years , and his book includes some disturbing revelations .
Here 's just one of the quotes that Smith unearthed :
" Permissible duress might include forms of sleep deprivation that do not result in lasting harm to mental or physical health , together with disinformation and disorientation ( like keeping prisoners in hoods ) that would produce stress , " Ignatieff wrote in his book The Lesser Evil : Political Ethics in an Age of Terror ( Penguin Canada , 2004 ) .
So far , Ignatieff has avoided much scrutiny in the mainstream media on his pronouncements justifying Bush administration tactics in the post - 9/11 era .
However with former U.S. vice president Dick Cheney coming under increasing fire for his support for targeted assassinations , can criticism of Ignatieff , a former director of the Carr Center for Human Rights at Harvard University , be very far behind ?
The federal Liberals chose Ignatieff as their leader in haste .
The biggest beneficiaries could turn out to be the federal NDP and Bloc Quebecois , whose natural supporters wo n't take too kindly to what they see on the Republicans for Ignatieff site .
Health chiefs are preparing to vaccinate the entire population against swine flu , it emerged today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In what would be the biggest vaccination programme of the last 50 years , experts are already drawing up a priority list of patients to be given immunity before the bug becomes more virulent .
It comes after the first British patient without underlying health problems died after contracting swine flu , taking the number of swine flu - linked deaths in the UK to 15 .
Peter Holden , the British Medical Association 's lead negotiator on swine flu , told The Sunday Times : " The high risk groups will be done at GPs ' surgeries .
" People are still making decisions over this , but we want to get cracking before we get a second wave , which is traditionally far more virulent . "
He added : " If the virus does ( mutate ) , it can get a lot more nasty , and the idea is to give people immunity .
" But the sheer logistics of dealing with 60 million people can't be underestimated . "
The latest swine flu - linked death happened at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , NHS East of England .
Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson warned yesterday that other healthy people were at risk of dying from the disease .
He said : " As with all flu - like viruses , some people are at higher risk than others .
Unfortunately , people who are otherwise healthy could also become seriously ill or , sadly , die . "
But Sir Liam added : " Fortunately , this particular new virus is n't nearly as severe as it could have been .
" If it had , for example , come out of the bird flu variant it would have been producing much higher levels of mortality . "
Yesterday holidaymakers were advised to check their travel insurance and keep in touch with tour operators as the bug sweeps across the UK .
With school terms ending and summer breaks approaching , people who contract the virus should take the advice of their doctors about whether to stay at home , according to travel association Abta .
Abta spokeswoman Frances
Tuke said : " We have had calls about this with regard to insurance - apparently some insurers are placing exemptions on policies .
" If you need to cancel because of swine flu you need to check your travel insurance policy to ensure it is covered . "
Nearly 10,000 Britons have gone down with swine flu after it spread to the UK from Mexico .
The UK has the third highest case total in the world after Mexico , with 10,262 , and the US , which has at least 33,902 .
:: The NHS advises anyone who thinks they might have flu to check their symptoms on http://www.nhs.uk or call the swine flu information line on 0800 1 513 513 .
Is America on its way to becoming a boiled frog ?
I ’m referring , of course , to the proverbial frog that , placed in a pot of cold water that is gradually heated , never realizes the danger it ’s in and is boiled alive .
Real frogs will , in fact , jump out of the pot  but never mind .
The hypothetical boiled frog is a useful metaphor for a very real problem : the difficulty of responding to disasters that creep up on you a bit at a time .
And creeping disasters are what we mostly face these days .
I started thinking about boiled frogs recently as I watched the depressing state of debate over both economic and environmental policy .
These are both areas in which there is a substantial lag before policy actions have their full effect  a year or more in the case of the economy , decades in the case of the planet  yet in which it ’s very hard to get people to do what it takes to head off a catastrophe foretold .
And right now , both the economic and the environmental frogs are sitting still while the water gets hotter .
Start with economics : last winter the economy was in acute crisis , with a replay of the Great Depression seeming all too possible .
And there was a fairly strong policy response in the form of the Obama stimulus plan , even if that plan was n’t as strong as some of us thought it should have been .
Seth Wenig / Associated Press
In his piece on the new pizza stars of New York , Frank Bruni writes of older places that were “ products of less self - conscious pizza times . ’’
Places like Di Fara .
I remember those times .
For 20 years , I ’ve lived a short walk from DiFara , the tiny , non-descript corner pizzeria on Avenue J in Brooklyn .
But in the past decade it ’s become world famous for its artisanal - league pies , made by the Zen pizza master , Dominico De Marco .
As much as I hate to admit it , the hype is true .
It is magical food for no reason I can decipher .
In dark times , it has actually cured my depression .
It is better than Lexapro .
This cramped little pizza joint was an intimate , comforting staple in my life .
Now the crowds have become such that securing a slice involves a commitment , focus and investment of time I no longer have .
Waits of up to an hour or more and a steely determination that often requires a feral lean and growl to keep interlopers from snaking your slice .
So I ’ve had to let it go .
But it was n’t easy .
It was a five - stage process :
1. Denial
It starts with hipsters trickling into Midwood , probably the most unhip neighborhood in all the five boroughs .
This is a zip code where people wear plastic bags on their heads when it rains .
So why the skinny jeans and the Airwalk Kicks , the scruffy faux - slacker dudes and the ironic model - gorgeous - geek girls ?
“ They are lost , ” I tell my wife .
“ They are lost . ”
“ But there ’s nothing else around here , ” she replies .
“ And we are very far from the L train . ”
I know she is right .
She is always right .
I just stare .
2. Anger
It is not long before the blank slate of the stare gives way to cracks .
I ’m turning mean .
Did I have to tell my daughter the cookies she made were “ not artisanal league ” ?
“ What ’s wrong with Daddy ? ” she asks at dinner one night .
“ Who is he talking to ?
Mommy , I ’m scared . ”
I ’m thinking of the guys with the cell phones .
The German tourists .
Of the guy who came in after me and broke the unspoken “ there - is - no - line - but we - all know - who - got - here - when ” law and took the last corner of a really perfect looking square pie .
( I know , I should n’t have said that thing about his mother .
And , officer , if you ’re reading this , I really do n’t know where he lives .
I was bluffing . ) .
3. Bargaining
I promise my family to stop saying “ artisanal ” — if they would just make the tourists go away .
Unfortunately my daughter is 5 and not at all threatening .
And my wife just does n’t care .
4. Depression
Why bother ?
I lose hope and do the unthinkable : I give up eating pizza altogether because it ’s “ not Dominic . ”
5. Acceptance
I admit it .
Our relationship has changed — devolved from pure bliss of love to the occasional hook - up .
I take it when I can get it .
Seth Wenig / Associated Press
If I happen to walk by the window and see slices on the pans , I will go in and buy up what is there , even if I am not hungry .
( They are not as good reheated , but I accept it , because this is the acceptance stage ) .
I start seeing other pizza makers .
They are plenty good — San Remo on Cortelyou .
Luigi’s of Avenue U. Joe ’s on Bleecker , slice places that remind me of my New York childhood and allow pizza to retake a healthier place in my life , as mere food .
I still walk by DiFara when it ’s jam packed with tourists from Manhattan and Sweden and Bratislava and Williamsburg .
And sometimes I catch Dominic ’s eye through the window , hunched over , flour covered , in his apron , and he smiles at me and I smile at him and I wave and he knows that I know that he knows .
We ’ve both moved on .
And it ’s going to be O.K .
Is n’t it ?
My two favorite words are still “ axiom ” and “ myriad . ”
Say them with me “ ax – ee – umm ” . . . “ mere – ee – aaaad . ”
Good three - syllable words .
Strong words .
Words like “ Dracula ” and “ Frankenstein . ”
Pretty words .
But this article is n’t about my favorite words .
It ’s about the word I have recently decided to hate .
Last week I was flying back from a week of grant writing assistance in Alaska .
About 10 hours into my travels , I heard the young lady in the plane seat behind me say the following sentence .
Read it aloud and try to guess which word is my least favorite : “ Like I was like what ’s wrong with like that and he was like I like guess it ’s like ok . ”
If you guessed the word “ ok , ” you ’re wrong .
My new least favorite word is “ like . ”
And she used it six times in the same sentence .
Ack !
Actually , “ like ” is a great word when used correctly — and sparingly .
The word “ like ” establishes a comparison to help the reader or listener understand some topic or concept .
To communicate a new idea or some characteristic , we compare the thing to something familiar .
For example : Puppies are like five - year - old children on permanent sugar highs .
Just to be clear , puppies are not really five - year - old children .
They are like ( i.e. , similar to , resembling ) five - year - old children .
This is a simile .
However , it is this distinction that makes the overuse of this word such a problem .
If I say , “ I ’m like ok , ” for example , then I am NOT ok .
I ’m only similar to “ ok . ”
Sentences such as “ I was like , what are you doing ? ” simply do n’t make sense .
This sentence is using “ like ” to create a simile , but what is being compared ?
Do I resemble “ what are you doing ? ” No .
When I heard that sentence I was like a dog choking on a bone .
As I mentioned earlier , using “ like ” to create similes is fine when infrequent .
This is not an issue with the word “ like ” but with similes in general .
When you are communicating a complex or foreign idea , they can be useful .
When you are using them for no other reason than to create an artistic effect , they are unnecessary .
The overuse of similes is a sure sign of an amateur writer .
A writer who uses too many similes is like a child drawing with only one color of crayon .
Clever at first , but quickly becoming dull .
An experienced , professional writer rarely needs them because he or she will have the ability to describe things as they are .
Additionally , because direct similes using “ like ” are so obvious to the reader , and often sound forced when frequent , good writers will rely on implied similes .
For example , the sentence , “ Our chief of staff , a wolf in disguise , fired the unsuspecting clerk ” compares the chief of staff to a wolf , perhaps a wolf in lamb ’s wool .
This is not a metaphor because it implies that the chief of staff is similar to a lion in disguise .
For another example of an implied simile , the phrase “ late night yawns of death ” compares the process of dying in old age to the process of falling asleep .
According to this implied simile , they are similar .
And the writer did n’t need to use “ like ” even once .
Yeah !
Do I catch myself using “ like ” like the girl on the plane ?
Yes , sometimes .
This abuse is so prevalent in society that it begins to sound normal , and it sometimes slithers into my speech ( another implied simile ) .
You wo n’t find it in my formal writing or , I hope , my formal speech .
Because , like , that would be like so wrong .

Legacy of Allah ’s Love for Rapists Continues Haunting Western Kuffar Women
Quran 3.31 : " Say ( O Muhammad , to mankind ) :
If you love Allah , follow me ; Allah will love you and will forgive you your sins . "
Our prophet raped with abandon and loved it ...
So any muslim , who rapes a woman to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet , is loved and blessed by Allah …
Here are a few hadiths about our beloved Prophet ’s banging teenage widows same day he killed their husbands in bloody raids .
JAVARIA
Bukhari Volume 3 , Book 46 , Number 717 :
Narrated Ibn Aun : Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water .
Their men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives ; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day ( along with many other young women as part of 20 % share .
He banged Juwairiya the same day to the chagrin of resident wife Ayesha ) …
SAFIA
Bukhari Volume 5 , Book 59 , Number 512 :
Narrated Anas :
The Prophet had their men killed , their offspring and woman taken as captives .
Safiya was amongst the captives ,
She first came in the share of Dahya Alkali but later on she belonged to the Prophet
Muslim Book 008 , Number 3329 :
He then sent Safia to my mother and asked her to embellish her .
Allah 's Messenger ( may peace be upon him ) then got out of Khaibar until when he was on the other side of it , he halted , and a tent was pitched for him .
He spent the night with her there ( he banged all night a grieving widow who saw her husband ’s decapitated body earlier in the day ) .
REHANA
Bukhari , Volume 5 , Book 59 , Number 362 :
Narrated Ibn Umar :
Prophet then killed their men and distributed their women , children and property among the Muslims
Sirat e Rasulullah , Ishaq , p. 464 :
After 800-900 male adults of Bani Quraiza were beheaded in batches , and thrown in trenches dug in Madina , the apostle divided their property , wives and children as booty ...
He took Rayhana d. Amr b. Khunafa for himself ( and raped her after she saw her husband and 900 other Quraiza men beheaded ) .
OTHER CAPTURED WOMEN
He received one fifth of all the booty including captured women from the raids in which men were killed and robbed and women captured …
The History of Tabari , Vol. 8 , p. 29-30 :
From his share of captive women , prophet gave ( after using them ) his son- in - law , Ali a slave girl , Raytah bt Hilal to enjoy her at his will .
He also presented Uthman b. Affan , his son - in - law , another slave girl Zainab b. Hayan , and bestowed another girl ( name unknown ) to his father in - law Omar Ibn Khattab .
Omar gave that girl to his son Abdullah .
Most of Prophet 's other elite companions received slave girls ( used ) as gifts .
Raping Younger Ones Get Extra Blessings from Allah
Since our prophet only raped young women , followers of this sunna also try to go for young ones to get extra blessings from Allah ( same way they grow beards to look like him ) .
Inshallah Allah will give them extra swab ( credit ) and award them very young virgins in paradise ...
Unfortunately lack of sharia laws in modern - day society , especially in the west , discourages true practicing muslims from practicing many of our prophet ’s sunnas ( like robbing killing and raping ) .
However even today there are true muslims who care more about Allah ’s blessings than penalties of unfair laws and try to follow “ Insan e Kamil ” ...
Here are some of them .
A poor girl becomes pregnant by an Imam of a local mosque in Faridpur , Bangladesh .
The poor girl is now on her seventh month pregnancy with high physical and mental risk of immature pregnancy .
Omar Faruk , an Imam and teacher of a “ Maktab ” ( Islamic School ) of remote village Padmar Char in Faridpur District in central Bangladesh , misguided the minor girl and raped her for long time .
The poor minor girl can not speak out in fear and shame .
As the girl steps into her deep pregnancy , the news spread out in the village .
Some local influential people called arbitration on July 18 .
The arbitration council decides that the Imam Omar Faruk will marry the pregnant girl , said the locals .
On July 18th some local influential people called arbitration on this .
The arbitration was chaired by Fazlur Rahman Fazal .
The arbitration body ordered caning of the Imam and the minor girl 101 times , and also ordered the Imam to marry the girl .
Both the Imam and the girl were canned 25 times said locals .
Although the arbitration on cases of rape is illegal , the head of the arbitration committee Fazal said that I informed the matter of arbitration to the OC ( Officer in Charge ) Kotwali Nur Alam , of Faridpur .
OC Nur Alam said I do not know anything the arbitration …
This is the third time marriage of Imam Omar , said locals .
MUSLIM RAPES A DEFECATING TEENAGE GIRL
Two momins found an innovative way to rape young women .
Since western public toilets are made of partition walls with big openings two practioners of religion of peace cashed on this opportunity and crawled in to surprise a defecating tenager and raped her .
No wonder in all muslim countries public toilets have full walls and doors .
Muslim men jailed for rape of a defecating woman in a toilet cubicle .
National News , UK Last updated 18:24 27/03/2009
Two muslim men were jailed today rape of a 19 - year - old defecating woman in the toilet cubicle of their work place , where she went to relieve herself .
Chala Sani Abdula , 27 , was found guilty by a jury in Wellington District Court of rape and jailed for seven years .
Ahmed Ahmed , 35 , was found guilty of rape .
He was sentenced to four years ' imprisonment .
The sentences were delivered to a near - full public gallery , with friends of the accused and of the victim in attendance .
The rape of the 19 - year - old student took place on Sunday , April 29 .
The court was told the woman was walking down College Street .
She asked Ahmed if she could use the toilet of the business he was working in .
He walked her to the toilet and when she was relieving herself he entered the cubicle from the opening below the partitions sexually assaulted her .
After he was done , Abdula entered the toilet cubicle and had sex with her also .
The woman then escaped the cubicle and went on to the street , leaving her clothes where they fell .
The defendants denied the charge but their DNA was found inside the complainant .
( that is why muslims of Britain want sharia which requires four male witnesses to prove a rape . , ) .
Judge Mike Behrens punished them lightly because the men had not planned the rape and sexual assault and had only taken advantage of the situation .
Abdula was held in very high regard by his community and colleagues , Judge Behrens further reduced his sentence by a year for this .
Judge Behrens recognised that , though he was a New Zealand national , because he did not speak English well prison was going to be hard for him .
" Given your part in the whole affair and that you started this off , in the guise of helping the complainant " , Judge Behrens did not make Ahmed 's sentences concurrent , but consecutive .
" Her life came to a stop ....
UK Muslim Rapist Causes Severe Blood Loss to teenage Victim
OPINIONATOR
May 20 , 2009
Paul Grumbar , prosecuting , told the jury the 18 - year - old woman met Hassan in a Weston - super - Mare nightclub and , although she stressed she did n't want intimacy , he drove her to an address " just to talk " .
When they were on a sofa for what she thought would be a chat , Hassan 's mood changed , the court heard .
Mr Grumbar said : " According to the girl , Hassan turned into a completely different person .
He kissed her and said ' come on , take your clothes off ' .
" When she said she just wanted to talk , he said they could talk in a bit . "
The jury was told Hassan took his clothes off , and forced her to commit a sex act on him .
Though she repeatedly said she was not in the mood , said Mr Grumbar , Hassan then removed her clothes and forced himself on her twice .
Mr Grumbar said during the assault , Hassan bit the woman at several places including breasts .
The jury heard he only stopped when he realised the woman was injured and losing blood .
After Hassan left the scene , the woman was able to get a lift to the accident and emergency department of Weston General Hospital .
Mr Grumbar said she made an immediate complaint of rape on the journey and recounted what had happened to her to medical staff .
Numerous cuts were detected on her body , Mr Grumbar said , and she was estimated to have lost 1.5 litres ( three pints ) of blood , which is 1/3 of her total blood in the body …
More Muslim Pedophile Rapists Arrested in Britain
BEST IDEA EVER
THE OREGON TRAIL : an MMORPG
Yes .
Seriously .
An MMORPG based on that hit edutainment game from MECC , " The Oregon Trail " .
So , it would probably start out with you at your local GameStop ( in real life .
right now I am describing you obtaining said game .
this does not take place in game . ) browsing through the racks .
EverQuest ?
Too lame .
World of Warcraft ?
Too mainstream .
Then , a box suddenly catches your eye .
On the front : " THE OREGON TRAIL MMORPG ( title to be finalized ) " .
Memories come back from times of the 80s/90s , of playing games on Apple IIs - games designed to teach , yet entertain .
I guess I should clarify something - this game would probably not be as educational as the rest of the Oregon Trail games .
It would probably be less " edu " and more " tainment " .
entertainment .
So , you decide to buy it , and take it home .
You pop the CD / DVD in , and install it .
Then , you load 'er up .
Then : WOAH !
A giant splash screen with the " THE OREGON TRAIL MMORPG ( title to be finalized ) " logo on it , and below that some wagons and some oxen rendered in stunning 3D .
This is not The Oregon Trail of days gone by !
After your mind is blown away by the title screen , there 'll be a bit of loading time for your brain to recover .
Then there 's a bit of time while the computer connects to the servers ( which should be in Oregon , just for the fun of it ) to let you prepare your mind for what is to come .
So once that 's over with , you 'll arrive at the main menu .
You could set your crazy options ( including configuring your joystick for ease of use when steering your oxen , or enabling surround sound for the full " THE OREGON TRAIL MMORPG [ title to be finalized ] " experience ) , or more likely , select " CREATE NEW CHARACTER " and create a new character .
Now , unlike Oregon Trails of days gone by , you do not automatically get a party .
In this game , you have to start out alone and find party members to venture with you !
( You could go it alone , but if you die of cholera , it 's almost guaranteed that someone else will steal your stuff from the unattended wagon .
So , when you choose a character , you can choose to be either a chick or a dude , and choose your class .
It 'll be the standard Oregon Trail occupations ; Bankers , Doctors , Merchants , Blacksmiths , Carpenters , Saddlemakers , Farmers , and Teachers .
As in the original games , some ( like bankers ) would start off with more money , but others with less money ( like teachers ) would level up faster .
( There would also be the appropriate stat bonuses , such as Doctors having a + 5 to Not Dying , while Farmers would have a + 5 to Oxen Not Dying . )
So once you create your character , you then enter the game , in good old Independence , Missouri .
This would serve as a tutorial area where you learn all the awesome nuances of the game .
You 'd get schooled in the basics of Buying Stuff , Not Dying , Steering Your Wagon , Hunting for Food , and People Skills .
Once you 're done the tutorial , you 'll be presented with a wagon , 2 oxen , and some supplies .
This 'll be the basics that you need to navigate around and Not Die ( hopefully ) .
You can walk around Independence if you want , looking for other players to join your party , or you can head out by yourself .
Now , you may be wondering right now , " Wo n't this game be monotonous ?
I mean , all you 're doing is travelling the Oregon Trail ! "
Well , that 's not what 's going to happen , so shut up .
The majority of the game will be based upon missions / quests , which will involve transporting stuff , or rescuing people , or other tasks .
But , after much tasking and leveling up , you will eventually be deemed worthy to ...
TRAVEL THE OREGON TRAIL !
The ultimate journey of the game , it will take all of your experience and trailiness to venture this hallowed trail .
And once you do , you get to be immortalized on the List of Legends !
After that you get some special recognition thing / status and you get to do more quests and stuff .
Or you could purchase the next expansion pack : " THE OREGON TRAIL MMORPG EXPANSION QUEST PACK ( title to be finalized ) " !
Chavez : send Bush to the ICC , not Bashir
Colonel Qaddafi is n’t the only bombastic leader making a lot of noise at the Arab Summit in Doha .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez won the summit ’s only mid-speech applause with his claim that the arrest warrant for Sudan ’s leader , Omar al - Bashir , was “ a legal eyesore and a political abuse . ”
Chavez fiercely criticized the International Criminal Court for issuing the warrant against the Sudanese president for crimes committed in Darfur , Sudan .
He invited the accused to visit him in Caracas .
The Chavez reply to such an insult to the global south ?
“ [ W ] hy do not they order the arrest of ( former US president George W. ) Bush , who is a genocidal murderer who ruled the United States for eight years and ordered bombing Iraq ? ”
The bad news for Chavez :
On the Sudan warrant , he does n’t speak for everyone in the “ global south . ”
While the Arab Summit has stood behind Bashir , regional leaders , such as Chile ’s Michele Bachelet , favor the court .
No matter — Chavez has a way of allying himself with whoever the West ( and particularly the United States ) does not .
Besides , by the time he had criticized Chile , Chavez was already moving on .
Time for a petro-currency aside from the dollar !
Time for the south to unite in opposition to failing economies of the G20 !
Time for Chavez to travel the world !
Too bad Chavez does n’t seem to have any time to read up on his shrinking goverment coffers .

Green vote increases by 44 %
8 June 2009
In the European elections , the Green Party 's vote increased by 44 % ( 1 ) compared with 2004 - yet the Greens still returned only 2 MEPs .
But the party 's results show considerable promise for the coming general election , with the Greens having defeated all comers in the parliamentary constituencies which will be contested by the party 's leader and deputy leader .
Party leader Caroline Lucas was re-elected comfortably , with the South East Green Party vote up by half , from 8 % to 12 % , finishing ahead of Labour .
Dr Lucas 's bid for election to the Westminster Parliament received a huge boost from a vote of 31.3 % in Brighton and Hove .
The Greens came first in Brighton and Hove , almost 6,000 votes ahead of the Conservatives , and with more than double Labour 's vote across three parliamentary constituencies .
Caroline Lucas will be contesting the Brighton Pavilion seat in the general election .
Jean Lambert successfully defended her London seat , overtaking UKIP .
In Lewisham , the Greens ( 17.8 % , up 5.2 % on 2004 ) polled close behind Labour ( 26.3 % , down 6.4 % ) .
This looks promising for the Lewisham Deptford target constituency in the general election , a seat to be contested by Darren Johnson AM , the current chair of the London Assembly .
In the South West region , the Green Party increased its vote for Ricky Knight by 2 % , to 9 % - coming fourth , ahead of Labour .
Rupert Read narrowly missed election in Eastern region , where the Green vote increased from 6 % in 2004 to 9 % .
In Norwich , the Greens came a comfortable first throughout the city , on 25 % - good news ahead of the general election , when Green Party deputy leader Adrian Ramsay will contest the Norwich South target seat .
In Yorkshire and the Humber , the Green vote went up from 6 % to 9 % - narrowly missing out to the first BNP MEP .
Ironically , the BNP's new MEP lives in Harrogate , a borough where the BNP polled only 1,887 votes compared with the Green Party 's 3,845 .
The North West Greens very narrowly missed winning a seat where the BNP leader was elected .
Highlights of the Green vote in the North West included Manchester , where the Greens finished in third place , on 13.6 % , ahead of the Conservatives .
Ironically , while the Green vote was up from 6 % to 8 % , the BNP vote actually fell numerically compared with 2004 .
In the North East - the first result announced , as there are only three seats - the Greens polled 6 % , 1 % up on 2004 , in the English region where the Green vote was always most likely to be squeezed .
In East Midlands , the Green vote increased by 1 % to 7 % and in West Midlands up 1 % to 6 % .
In Wales , the Green Party vote increased by a third , from 4 % to 6 % .
The European Green Group looks set to be much stronger after this election .
The French Greens , for example , have gained 8 seats , more than doubling their representation to 14 seats .
Note
1. Figures from the BBC website .
The Green Party of England and Wales had a vote share of 6.06 % in 2004 , versus 8.71 % of voters in 2009 , a leap of 43.7 % .

Well it was a cool wet weekend in Madison for the Regatta and Fireworks , but I still made a reasonable attempt at finally getting a few fireworks shots .
As the Fireworks began a very heavy rainstorm broke out dampening the festive activities for the evening , many people left for home and the fireworks were shortened to get them in .
The lowering clouds further obscured the display making it very dificult to view let alone photograph .
But I used a an old feed mill for my shelter and shot these from a third story window , keeping me warm and dry , they were n’t the greatest images of fireworks ever attempted but I was happy with my first experience shooting them .
I am hoping this is the sumer I got my first fireworks and lightening images , so now maybe I can come across a big storm and get them both .
The economic stimulus package has n't had the time to kick in yet , said Christopher Beam in Slate , but already Washington is buzzing with talk of a second stimulus , as unemployment figures show the economy is losing more jobs then expected .
The Obama administration is holding back , for now .
" Politically speaking , though , it 's hard to imagine the administration standing pat if jobs continue to hemorrhage . "
" Democrats are all over the map on the stimulus and the possibility of a sequel , " said Victoria McGrane in Politico , " and it ’s not hard to see why :
When it comes to a second stimulus , they may be damned if they do and damned if they do n’t . "
There 's growing talk that the first stimulus was n't enough , but the public has little appetite for a second round .
Democrats insist that the problem is simply that George W. Bush left them a worse economy than they thought , said John Lott in Fox News .
But " the alternative explanation should be obvious :
The stimulus made things worse . "
It 's nonsense to argue that the first stimulus was too small — the real problem was that " spending almost a $ 1 trillion on various stimulus projects means moving a lot of resources from where the private sector would have spent it , eliminating the jobs many people currently have . "
Talk about nonsense , said Paul Krugman in The New York Times .
Most of the stimulus money has n't even been spent yet — it was never expected to do much this soon .
" The problem , instead , is that the hole the stimulus needs to fill is much bigger than predicted .
That — coupled with the fact that yes , stimulus takes time to work — is the reason for a second round , ASAP . "
It would help if the cheerleaders for such a " huge fiscal expansion " let us know how much money we 're talking about , said Joe Wiesenthal in The Business Insider .
So , please , Mr. Krugman , tell the rest of us if " there 's such a thing as a too - big stimulus .
We do n't hear anyone going around advocating , say , $ 5 trillion in new spending , even though technically speaking that would create a lot of demand and economic activity .
So what is the cap , and how do we know ? "

Besides waging perpetual wars , nothing better reveals America 's imperial agenda than its hundreds of global bases - for offense , not defense at a time the US has n't had an enemy since the Japanese surrendered in August 1945 .
So when they do n't exist , they 're invented as former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia , Charles W. Freeman , Jr. , suggested in a May 24 , 2007 speech to the Washington Institute of Foreign Affairs :
" When our descendants look back on the end of the 20th century and the beginning of this one , they will be puzzled .
The end of the Cold War relieved Americans of almost all international anxieties . "
As the world 's sole remaining superpower , " We did not rise to the occasion . "
" We are engaged in a war , a global war on terror , a long war , we are told .... How can a war with no defined ends beyond the avoidance of retreat ever reach a convenient stopping point ?
How can we win ( any war let alone the hearts and minds of millions ) with an enemy so ill - understood that we must invent a nonexistent ideology " for justification .
In his 2006 book , " Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic , " Chalmers Johnson discussed the known number of foreign US bases by size and branch of service .
According to the Department of Defense 's Base Structure Report ( BSR ) through 2005 , it totaled 737 but likely exceeds 1000 today with so many new ones built since then - some known , others secret and always others planned .
Johnson also highlighted the fallout - unacceptable noise , pollution , environmental destruction , expropriation of valuable public and private land , and drunken , disorderly , and abusive soldiers committing crimes that include rape and murder that often go unpunished under provisions in US - imposed Status of Forces Agreements ( SOFAs ) .
An excerpt from his book reads :
" Once upon a time , you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting up colonies .
America 's version of the colony is the military base ; and by following the changing politics of global basing , one can learn much about our ever more all - encompassing imperial footprint and the militarism that grows with it .... even more than in past empires , a well - entrenched militarism ( lies ) at the heart of our imperial adventures . "
To such an extreme that " each year we spend more on our armed forces than all others nations on Earth combined " to garrison troops " in more than 130 countries . "
The Pentagon lists them in its annual Base Structure Report , but " its official count of between 737 and 860 overseas installations is incomplete " because excluded are numerous secret ones - for espionage , unofficially shared with host countries , or other reasons not disclosed .
The bases reflect " force projection " for global dominance and are positioned to strike any nation that might challenge it , friend or foe .
But they come at a great cost - well over $ 1 trillion annually with all homeland , foreign , and other budget categories included .
According to Johnson , a far greater one as well , the same dynamic that doomed past empires unwilling to change - " isolation , overstretch , the uniting of local and global forces opposed to imperialism , and in the end bankruptcy " as well as the end of democracy , loss of personal freedoms , and tyranny .
During WW II , Brits complained that GIs were " overpaid , overfed , oversexed , and over here . "
Despite the war , some called it the US " occupation , " and UK historian David Reynolds discussed it in his book , " Rich Relations : The American Occupation of Britain , 1942 - 1945 . "
He borrowed the word from George Orwell 's December 1943 comment that " It is difficult to go anywhere in London without having the feeling that Britain is now Occupied Territory . "
Today , millions in countries globally feel the same , and with good reason .
Even at peace , America 's presence is intrusive , hostile , and at the expense of the host country populations .
A new book is now out titled " The Bases of Empire : The Global Struggle against US Military Posts , " a collection of important articles on America 's worldwide empire and military presence that enforces it .
It 's edited by Catherine Lutz , Brown University Professor in the Department of Anthropology , Watson Institute for International Studies with a forward by Cynthia Enloe , Clark University Research Professor , Department of International Development , Community and Environment and Women 's Studies .
Enloe dispels some common myths in her forward :
-- about Americans believing that foreign bases benefit the host country populations ;
-- the notion that other countries request our presence ;
-- that the US military is the most " civilized " in the world , and
-- their presence is for other nations ' security " in an age of an allegedly diffuse ( and ill - defined ) ' global terror , ' ( that ) trumps any other ' lesser ' concerns . "
Contributors to " The Bases of Empire " reflect a powerfully opposite point of view as well as Enloe in her forward and Lutz in her detailed introduction , discussed below .
Introduction - Bases , Empire , and Global Response
Lutz cites the " unprecedented .... global omnipresence and unparalleled lethality of the US military , and the ambition with which it is being deployed around the world . "
Its presence shows that America stands " able and willing to control events in other regions militarily " and proves it through numerous foreign wars and other hostile interventions , directly or through proxies .
Citing data from DOD 's 2007 Base Structure Report ( BSR ) , she states :
" Officially , over 190,000 troops and 115,000 civilian employees are massed in 909 military facilities in 46 countries and territories .
There , the US military owns or rents 795,000 acres of land , and 26,000 buildings and structures valued at $ 146 billion . "
However , the numbers are misleading as they exclude the massive base and troop presence in Iraq , Afghanistan , former Soviet republics , and Warsaw Pact countries as well as unknown numbers of secret facilities in numerous other nations .
They consist of three types :
-- Main Operating Bases ( MOBs ) like the Iraq Balad Air Base housing 30,000 troops , 10,000 contractors , and covering 16 square miles plus another 12 - square mile " security perimeter . "
MOBs are large and permanent , have extensive infrastructure , command and control headquarters , accommodations for families in non-war zones , hospitals , schools , recreational facilities , and nearly anything available in a typical US city .
-- Forward Operation Sites ( FOSs ) that are also major installations but are smaller than MOBs , and
-- Cooperative Security Locations ( CLSs ) that are small , austere , called ' lily pads , " - to preposition weapons , munitions , and modest numbers of troops .
Lutz highlights the fallout :
" The environmental , political , and economic impact of these bases is enormous and , despite Pentagon claims that the bases simply provide security to the regions they are in , most of the world 's people feel ( not at all ) reassured by ( their ) global reach , " and with good reason .
Farm and public land is expropriated for their use .
Toxic pollution is enormous as well as extensive environmental damage .
Noise levels from round - the - clock aircraft are intolerable , and around numerous bases America is at war .
It also imprisons and tortures thousands , props up despotic rulers for its own advantage , and virtually holds the entire planet hostage to its extremist agenda .
Lutz says this book describes US militarism globally and campaigns to hold America accountable for the " damage and to reorient ( host ) countries ' security policies in other , more human , and truly secure directions . "
For its part , America occupies the world , reflects a hostile presence , trains about 100,000 local forces in 180 countries as partners , and turns a blind eye to human rights abuses , by its own troops and those of host nations .
Besides its presence in fixed bases , the Pentagon is involved in " jungle , urban , desert , maritime , and polar training exercises across wide swathes of landscape " - always intrusive and often provocative as in the Philippines .
After it was forced to give up its bases in 1992 , US troops remained in the country despite strong popular opposition and the Philippine constitution prohibiting the basing of foreign forces .
No matter , US military and civilian personnel lobby to change local laws to accommodate America 's access .
Laws are there for legitimate reasons , one of which is the focus of this book - the impact and costs that a foreign presence has on host countries ' people .
Lutz explores why it 's there , how it 's configured , popular myths , and " the global movement to push back or expel ( it ) altogether . "
The Purpose of US Bases
They reflect empire , an aim to dominate everywhere , a sense of " racial , cultural , or social superiority , " and a success when " wealth is extracted from peripheral areas and redistributed to the imperial center . "
The Pentagon claims they 're in place to :
-- defend the homeland with a forward or global presence ; and
-- provide other nations with security .
In fact , they 're to control trade , resources , local supplies of cheap labor , and political , economic , and social life of host countries .
They also force them to support American imperialism , including foreign wars despite harmful fallout to local populations .
A Short History of US Bases
-- they go back to colonial America , then grew to a " frontier project " to remove Native Indians for a new nation with European settlers ;
-- in 1938 , 14 foreign bases existed ; post - WW II " an astounding 30,000 ( large and small ) installations " were in about 100 countries ; by 1948 , it was 2000 ;
-- besides creating America coast - to - coast and the 1846 - 48 Mexican war , US history reflects three imperial periods :
(1 ) the 1898 Spanish - American war conquest and occupation of foreign territory and acquisition of bases in them ;
(2) World War II and its Cold War aftermath established the " bulk of the US basing system ; " even so , from 1947 - 1990 , America was asked to leave France , Yugoslavia , Iran , Ethiopia , Libya , Sudan , Saudi Arabia , Tunisia , Algeria , Vietnam , Indonesia , Peru , Mexico , and Venezuela ; in the 1990s and later , the Pentagon was forced out of the Philippines , Panama , Saudi Arabia , Puerto Rico 's island - municipality Vieques , Uzbekistan , and Ecuador , and decided voluntarily to leave elsewhere ;
( 3 ) post -9/11 militarism under George Bush neocons advanced the goal of " full spectrum dominance " over all land , surface and sub - surface sea , air , space , electromagnetic spectrum and information systems with enough overwhelming power to fight and win global wars against any adversary , including with nuclear weapons preemptively .
Common Myths about US Foreign Bases
Why do sovereign nations and the US public tolerate them ?
One explanation is that " the bases are naturalized or normalized , meaning that they are thought of as unremarkable , inevitable , and legitimate , " and militarism supports these notions as the way to bring order to a dangerous world .
The Pentagon argues their legitimacy on these grounds :
-- " utilitarianism and realism " as follows :
( 1 ) to secure America by deterring attacks and preventing or removing military challenges ;
( 2 ) overseas forces represent America 's first line of defense ; and
(3) " potential security challenges in Asia " require American intervention to prevent or intervene to " restore order . "
Strategic language justifies them to project power anywhere in the world and " contend with ( any ) uncertainty ( regarding America 's ) security challenges . "
Bases also " serve the national economic interests of the United States , ensuring access to markets and commodities needed to maintain the American standard of living .... "
Also to react to any threat , maintain trade , keep commerce routes open , and assure the dollar remains the world 's dominant reserve currency .
In a word , to have America 's footprint everywhere with a military presence for enforcement .
US forces are a " visible expression of the extent of America 's status as a superpower " and its goal to keep it that way unchallenged .
It suggests that more bases are better and a way to project a visible presence everywhere or close by .
A second argument " sees them as positive expressions of American character , and particularly its humanitarian ethos . "
The Pentagon portrays itself as a benefactor , a liberator , and helper on the scene at times of natural or other disasters .
We claim bases are " gifts to other nations , both as defense sites and as wealth generators .
They represent American altruism and sacrifice " when , in fact , they 're for hardline dominance intolerant of opposition , national sovereignty , democratic freedoms , and social justice .
They also fail on their own terms .
Instead of providing safety and security , they incite antagonism , opposition and blowback against an American occupier and enemy .
Yet they proliferate on the notion that " humans are naturally violent and that war can be a glorious and good venture . "
It 's also hugely profitable for the defense establishment and related industries , energy and technology to name two .
The World Responds
" Social movements have proliferated around the world in response to the empire of US bases . "
For some , just their presence is an affront to national sovereignty and pride .
Others reject their purpose - aggressive wars , continued violence , and all the other above - cited fallout wherever they 're located .
Globally , these bases " represent a massive injustice " to host nations and communities where they 're located .
Despite providing jobs for local workers , wages are poor , benefits few if any , and most Pentagon dollars flow to large military contractors , other major US corporations , and selected local business elites .
Ordinary people are exploited and entirely left out , especially in developing countries , hence their opposition to militarism and foreign occupation .
" With the end of the Cold War , the central pretext for most US bases evaporated , and calls for their return were renewed . "
In 1991 , a successful Philippine movement ousted them with a post - Ferdinand Marcos constitution declaring :
" foreign military bases , troops or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines except under a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate and , when the Congress so requires , ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the people in a national referendum held for that purpose . "
In 2003 , sustained direct action campaigns and political lobbying also succeeded in Vieques , Puerto Rico , in part because naval activities caused environmental and health damage - a core issue wherever US bases are located .
" The Bases of Empire includes 10 articles by different writers , divided in two parts : Mapping US Power and Global Resistance .
Part I includes :
-- Joseph Gerson's " US Foreign Military Bases and Military Colonialism : Personal and Analytical Perspectives ; "
-- John Lindsay - Poland 's " US Military Bases in Latin America and the Caribbean ; "
-- David Heller and Hans Lammerant 's " US Nuclear Weapons Bases in Europe ; " and
-- Tom Englehardt 's " Iraq as a Pentagon Construction Site . "
Part II includes :
-- Roland Simbulan 's " People 's Movement Response to Evolving US Military Activities in the Philippines ; "
-- Katherine McCaffrey 's " Environmental Struggle after the Cold War : New Forms of Resistance to the US Military in Vieques , Puerto Rico ; "
-- Ayse Gil Altinay and Amy Holmes " Opposition to the US Military Presence in Turkey in the Context of the Iraq War ; "
-- Kyle Kajihiro's " Resisting Militarism in Hawaii ; " and two other articles discussed below .
David Vine and Laura Jeffrey 's " Give Us Back Diego Garcia : Unity and Division among Activists in the Indian Ocean . "
Diego Garcia is an 84 - square mile British - controlled Indian Ocean island in the Chagos archipelago , lying strategically half way between Asia and Africa , and the reason the Pentagon wants it .
It was home to indigenous Chagossians , British citizens , before being expelled between 1967 - 1973 to let America have their island - state as a military base .
In flagrant denial of their human rights , the were mass - exiled to Mauritius and Seychelles , 1300 miles away , where they remain in abject poverty and despair .
The population had no say , and those who objected were lied to and told they had no choice because their removal was " legal " under colonial rule .
In their new home , life was hellish .
They were consigned to a society foreign to their simple ways and were n't able to adjust .
On Diego Garcia , they had their own home , grew their own food , fished , and worked on plantations .
In exile , they needed jobs to survive but could n't get them .
By the mid-1970s , most were unemployed , impoverished and began to die , but the British Foreign Office and High Commission told them to let the Mauritius and Seychelles governments handle it .
Chagossians are UK citizens entitled to the same rights as other Brits , but all they got was 1000 pounds ( around $ 1600 today ) in exchange for renouncing their right to return , agreed to on a document they could n't read .
The history of this episode was hidden until the 1990s when declassified documents were found in the National Archives at Kew in London .
They proved a conspiracy between Britain and America that the International Criminal Court 's ( ICC ) Article 7 calls a " deportation or forcible transfer of a population ( and ) and crime against humanity . "
Britain 's action also violated the UN Charter 's Article 73 that obliges a colonial government to obey its " sacred trust " to protect the human rights of its people .
Instead , America and the UK engaged in cover - up and deception that continued for a decade and went to the highest levels of both governments .
Involved were prime minister Harold Wilson and Queen Elizabeth along with presidents Johnson , Nixon and others .
Everything was hidden , including financial kickbacks Washington made that were concealed from Congress and Parliament .
That changed once the truth came out .
On November 3 , 2000 , the British High Court stunned the government , cited the Magna Carta , annulled the original deportation order , and effectively ruled that British subjects were entitled to go home .
However , the victory was short - lived as a year later Chagossians were back in the High Court seeking compensation for their ordeal .
This time a hostile judge called their case " unmeritorious " and denied their claim .
Three months later , the Foreign Office minister responsible for Chagos sent an " order - in - council " to the Queen for her automatic approval that overturned the High Court 2000 victory , banning Chagossians from ever returning home .
Nonetheless , they pursued their case , again before the High Court .
On May 11 , 2006 , a damning verdict condemned the expulsion order as " repugnant " and overturned the Blair government 's " order- in - council . "
Thus far to no avail , yet Chagossians still fight for their right of return and an end to their decades - long plight .
They held an April 18 , 2009 meeting , met with the Royal Commonwealth Society in late May , made their case , but it remains unresolved .
The UK Chagos Support Association said at the time :
" the original people of Chagos are dying of broken hearts and spirit .
They are still waiting for justice to be done and it seems like this is dragging until all the people who really have the right to fight for the cause no longer have a voice .
It has been 45 years and we believe it is time that justice is done and peace is found . "
Thus far , Britain and Washington wo n't agree .
Imperial considerations take precedence over all else .
Kozue Akibayashi and Suzuyo Takazato's " Okinawa ; Women 's Struggle for Demilitarization . "
Okinawa is Japan 's southern - most and poorest prefecture .
It 's also home to dozens of US military bases since 1945 .
In his book " Nemesis , " Chalmers Johnson cited a history of abuse - from 1998 - 2004 alone , 2024 reported crimes and accidents in which US forces were involved .
Only one led to a court - martial , 318 others to administrative discipline , and the rest were absolved , yet they involved robberies , assaults , rapes and reckless homicides .
Okinawa 's women and girls suffered most .
Akibayashi is a researcher at the Institute for Gender Studies at Toyko 's Ochanomizu University .
Takazato is an activist fighter for women 's rights , especially against the threat of US military personnel - committed rape and sexual assaults .
She 's also a City Council member of Okinawa 's capital , Naha , and helped found Okinawa Women Act Against Military Violence and the Rape Emergency Intervention Counseling Center of Okinawa , established after three US Marines gang - raped a 12 - year old girl on September 4 , 1995 .
After Japan surrendered in 1945 , America wrote its constitution , and occupied the country ever since , now with 88 bases in a nation smaller than California .
Thirty - seven are on Okinawa , a tiny sliver of land about the size of a large US city , so it 's easy to understand why its people are long - suffering and justifiably angry .
They 've been practically pushed into the Pacific to accommodate America 's occupation , forced to relinquish their most valued real estate , and put up with over six decades of all the above - cited abuses .
Their greatest outrage is over the SOFA 's article 17 covering criminal justice .
It states :
" The custody of an accused member of the United States armed forces or the civilian component ( shall ) remain with the United States until he is charged . "
It means when US personnel commit crimes , including rape and murder , Japanese investigative authorities have no exclusive access to suspects until they 're indicted in court .
That alone hamstrings investigations enough to make prosecutors reluctant to press charges because they can't get enough evidence for trials .
Further , the longer things drag out , the easier it is for the Pentagon to whitewash crimes and transfer guilty parties to new locations , far removed from Okinawa .
The most serious incident was the above - cited 1995 rape .
The 12 - year old girl involved was also beaten , then left on a beach after which the three Marines returned to their base in a rented car .
In October , 85,000 Okinawans protested .
They demanded Japanese and American authorities address the issue after the Pentagon initially refused to hand over suspects to Japanese police .
Usually they never do anywhere , but this case was an exception .
Because of political pressure , the Marines were arrested , tried in a Japanese court , convicted and sentenced to prison terms for their crime - seven years for two of them and six and a half for the other .
This case highlights what Okinawans and other people have endured for decades .
SOFAs let the Pentagon run its affairs unaccountable to host country laws , including on Okinawa .
The result everywhere is that US personnel get away with rapes , drunken brawling , muggings , drug violations , reckless driving and related accidents , arson , and criminal homicide , especially in host countries with non-white populations - abuses unchanged for decades on Okinawa .
As a result , Akibayashi and Takazato concluded :
-- " Integral elements of misogyny infect military training .... The military is a violence - producing institution to which sexual and gender violence are intrinsic ....
The essence of military forces is their pervasive , deep - rooted contempt for women , which can be seen in military training that completely denies femininity and praises hegemonic masculinity , " and
-- " The OWAAMV ( Okinawa Women Act Against Military Violence ) movement illustrates from a gender perspective that ' the protected , ' who are structurally deprived of political power , are in fact not protected by the militarized security policies ; rather their livelihoods are made insecure by these very policies . "
Gated bases do n't deter violence outside them and result in local populations being oppressed and denied their rights when it happens .
America's " Bases of Empire " menace world societies .
Okinawan women and young girls bear testimony to how grievously .

Note :
The term " Phishtistics " came from Tara Ellicott .
It 's worth going back and playing the original Wii Sports before you play Wii Sports Resort , in order to give the new game some context .
Wii Sports came packed with the hardware in the United States , and did more to sell the system than any commercial ever could .
It felt like Nintendo was bringing in a new era of gaming , complete with a brand - new way to interact with our games ; the possibilities seemed nearly limitless , and we waited for the flood of games that would take advantage of the Wiimote technology .
The competition - crushing sales numbers sure came , but the games did n't .
I can name a dozen great Wii games with no effort , but if you asked me to name six games that showed off what the system could do as well as Wii Sports , ?I would have to stop and think .
I 'm not sure if there are six .
Nintendo sits on a hollow throne : the company may have won this generation , but the revolution never came .
Not in the way we had hoped .
Title Wii Sports Resort Developer Nintendo Publisher Nintendo Price $ 49.99 Shop.ars Platform Nintendo Wii
The problem is that in too many cases a left to right or up and down swipe was simply a replacement for a button press .
The term " waggle " rose to prominence to describe the lazy games where shaking the Wiimote replaced a standard button - press .
Many of the best games worked better with a classic controller than the Wiimote / Nunchuk combination .
Rail shooters were given a boost on the system , but what else did the Wii actually deliver on , other than lowered graphical expectations and a love of bright colors ?
At E3 in 2008 , and again in 2009 , Nintendo wanted us to know that the Wii would be changed with the $ 20 Motion Plus , a peripheral that would turn the Nintendo Wii into the system we thought we were buying at launch .
To usher in this update to the hardware we have ... well , we actually had the rather excellent Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 , but now Nintendo has finally stepped up to the plate with the sequel to the game that arguably made the system what it is today .
Is this another empty promise from Nintendo ?
Is this an answer to the disappointment many of the early believers now feel when they look at the Wii 's game library ?
We 've been playing the game for hours and hours each day , and here is our verdict : this is the work of a lazy god .
It 's also worth your money , although you 'll have to be ready for a rising sense of frustration the longer you play .
Welcome to the re-launch of motion controls .
Now let 's play .
I am born again
Wii Sports Resort begins with your Mii skydiving into Wuhu Island , the background that houses the game 's events .
This gives you a brief glimpse into how precise the MotionPlus - enabled Wiimote has become , and also makes you want a new Pilotwings title right the hell NOW .
This intro is fun and attractive , and feels like something of a challenge : dive in , and get ready for an adventure .
Also be aware that you need to have a finely developed sense of play to really appreciate Wii Sports Resort .
The events do n't link together in any way , and the only thing to keep you playing is beating your own score and the fun of participation .
This does n't feel like a cohesive product as much as a series of tech demos , although the inclusion of the island itself as a framing device allows Nintendo to hide this fact somewhat better than it did in the first Wii Sports .
The good news is that the events are , by and large , fun .
They 're also incredibly uneven .
In Archery , you 'll be holding the Wiimote in your left hand and pulling back with the nunchuk in your right hand to simulate a real bow and arrow .
It sounds goofy on paper , but it works very well , and it's one of the most immediately impressive uses of the hardware in the game .
You can play against your friends , and the different difficulty levels cause the target to be farther away , or with added movement , but the basic mechanic stays the same throughout each level .
The doors opened for archery sections in games are exciting — imagine this sort of thing in a Zelda title !
My personal conspiracy theory is that even though Wii Sports Resort will likely be a success , the point of the game is n't to amaze us gamers .
Each of these events seems like Nintendo giving pointers to third - party developers .
There are so many times during the course of gameplay where you 'll wish an event or challenge were stretched into an entire game with a story , characters , or even online play .
As it stands , you 'll play something , be amazed at the clever controls , be disappointed that the overall experience is so thin , and then come back and continue playing to show your friends or fight for a higher score .
Let 's take a look at what works ... and what does n't , in Wii Sports Resort .
What we loved
SwordPlay
This is the mode you 'll use to show of the technology , because your virtual sword moves perfectly in sync with your actual hand motions .
The problem is that in Duel and Showdown modes you 're still dealing with cleverly hidden waggle : a sword held vertically will block a side strike , and a horizontal sword will block a vertical slash .
This is pretty obvious in Duel , but Showdown — where you face off , classic - Ninja - movie - style , against a horde of Miis — is incredibly fun .
Long , broad strokes can take down multiple enemies at once , while body - armor - clad " bosses " turn into mini-duels .
We have decided that the only way to play Showdown is with the sound muted and The Crystal Method 's " The Name of the Game " playing instead .
We will also accept " Battle without Honor or Humanity " for your Mii-slaying sessions .
The third game is perhaps the most interesting of the bunch : Speed Slice .
The referee drops different objects in front of you and your opponent , and you have to slice them from different sides or angles .
Slice a diamond in two from the upper left - hand corner .
Cut a cupcake in two from left to right .
It 's a test of your arm movement 's reaction time , and if you play with another person this is simply a blast .
Duel may be the mode that was hyped the most in Swordplay , but Speed Slice and Showdown are the stronger entries here .
Power Cruising ...
... Or as we like to call it " Let 's go ahead and make another Wave Race . "
You hold both parts of the controller out in front of you like the controls of a jet ski , and lean into turns as you cruise through the gates , going as fast as you can .
Twisting your right hand like a throttle will get you a speed boost .
The trick is to make gentle , sweeping turns and not overcorrect , and I 'll be damned if you do n't feel like you 're on a jet ski .
The number one enemy in the game — if you 're not playing multiplayer — is the wave - physics .
You 'll have to constantly be aware of where the waves are coming from and correct for them .
Golf and Bowling
These two sports make a comeback from the first game , and both of them are improved by the addition of the Motion Plus hardware .
If you have n't played Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 , you 'll be amazed at how natural your golf swing now feels , and how tricky it can be to hit that perfect , straight drive .
Putting is also a joy with the peripheral .
Bowling has been updated to take advantage of the MotionPlus , but it 's more of an evolution ; it 's easy now to add spin to the ball , and in fact there is an entire game mode dedicated to getting you to add spin in order to avoid obstacles in the alley .
Both of these games remain fun , and once you get used to the controls of Sports Resort it 's hard to go back to the originals .
Airsports
This section will divide fans .
I enjoyed Island Flyover , where you control your plane by holding the Wiimote like a paper airplane , exploring the islands and collecting points of interest .
It 's relaxing , fun , and a good way to explore the island and see all the locations from the other sports .
Some may find this pointless , but I found it worth spending some time with ; it felt like play , although very unstructured play .
SkyDiving works well , and again makes you long for Pilotwings , but there is n't much to it .
You fly around , grab onto other Miis , and try to face the camera before your picture is taken .
Dogfight takes the planes from Island Flyover , adds balloons to them , and has you shooting at each other .
While these events are fun for a little while , the real draw is imagining what these concepts would be like in the hands of a talented developer creating an entire suite of flying experiences .
Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen Matthias Brake
Lösung für die Krise der Erwerbsarbeitsgesellschaft ?
" Die Erwerbsarbeitsgesellschaft ist in die Krise geraten .
Steigende Produktivität und Verlagerung von Produktionsstätten in Billiglohnländer führen zum Abbau von Arbeitsplätzen - das Arbeitsplatzdefizit in Deutschland beträgt derzeit rund 7 Millionen .
Dennoch hält die Mehrheit der politischen Akteure an den Zielen Wachstum und Vollbeschäftigung fest .
Viele Befürworter des bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens gehen dagegen davon aus , dass Vollbeschäftigung nicht mehr möglich ist und dass auch deshalb für die Zukunft andere Wege gefunden werden müssen , Menschen mit Einkommen zu versorgen . "
( Netzwerk Grundeinkommen ) .
" In den Zeiten des Wirtschaftswunders stieg die Produktivität allein zwischen 1948 und 1965 um fast 300 Prozent .
Nach Abzug der Sonderkonjunktur erlebte die Bundesrepublik zwischen 1970 und 1995 immer noch eine Produktivitätsverdoppelung .
Das geschah aber bereits vor dem Hintergrund steigender Massenarbeitslosigkeit und des Zusammenbruchs großer Teile der alten Industrien , also gebremst .
Tatsächlich ist es keineswegs nötig , dass in Deutschland noch 26,5 Millionen unselbstständig Erwerbstätige ihrer Erwerbsarbeit nachgehen .
Lothar Späth und der frühere McKinsey - Manager Herbert A. Henzler haben im Jahr 1993 eine Berechnung angestellt :
Was würde passieren , schöpfte man das technisch machbare Automationspotenzial in der Bundesrepublik voll aus ?
Die Antwort : Eine Arbeitslosigkeit von 38 Prozent wäre normal .
( Wolf Lotter : Der Lohn der Angst )
Entspricht unter diesen Voraussetzungen das Festhalten am Vollerwerbsmodell nicht irrationalem Wunschdenken ?
Sollte nicht vielmehr die Situation als Chance begriffen werden ?
Die zunehmende Befreiung des Menschen von der Arbeitslast entspricht schließlich einem jahrhundertealten Traum an dem Philosophen wie Thomas More , Erich Fromm , Popper - Lynkeus auch die Hoffnung festmachten , die Befreiung des Menschen von der Fron ermögliche ihm um so mehr die Entfaltung als Person .
Wer nicht arbeitet , soll nicht essen
Grundsätzlich ist unser Sozialversicherungssystem an die Arbeit gekoppelt - durch die Massenarbeitslosigkeit ist es in die Dauerkrise geraten .
Politiker sagen , man müsse den Druck auf die Arbeitslosen erhöhen , damit sie wieder Arbeit finden .
Prekäre Arbeitsverhältnisse wie Leiharbeit , Befristung , Minijob oder Scheinselbständigkeit ohne tragfähige soziale Absicherung werden so als Brücke in den ersten Arbeitsmarkt gehandelt oder bereits als Eingliederungserfolg verbucht .
Die Arbeitsnorm ist allgemeinverbindlich und wie schon im Stalinismus der 30er Jahre gilt noch immer : " Wer nicht arbeitet , soll auch nicht essen . "
Auch das im Zuge der Hartz - Reform neu formulierte Sozialgesetzbuch II spricht von Grundsicherung nur für Arbeitssuchende und erwerbsfähige Hilfebedürftige .
Die Strategie heißt Integration durch Arbeit .
Doch wo ist diese Arbeit ?
Sollen mechanisierte und rationalisierte Produktionsabläufe wieder per Muskelkraft ausgeführt werden – und wenn ja , zu welchem ( subventionierten ) Lohn ?
Befürworter des bisherigen Systems setzen ihre verzweifelte Hoffnung in Verteilung bestehender Arbeit , Stichwort Arbeitszeitverkürzung und die Schaffung neuer Arbeitsfelder etwa sozialer Dienstleistungen wie der Kleinkinder - und Altenbetreuung .
Genug zu tun gibt es zweifellos .
Aber die letzten erfolgreichen Arbeitskämpfe für die 35 - Stunden - Woche fanden vor 20 Jahren statt .
Heute sind die Gewerkschaften stark geschwächt und nehmen in Tarifabschlüssen immer weitergehende Öffnungsklauseln hin , die es den Unternehmen erlauben , die Arbeitszeit nach ihren Belangen zu flexibilisieren und auszudehnen .
Und es sind gerade die Gemeinwesenaufgaben , die im Zuge von Hartz IV zum Experimentierfeld für so genannte Ein-Euro - Jobs wurden .
Die Krise als Chance zum Systemwechsel
Die weiterhin hohen Arbeitslosenzahlen zeigen , dass die bisherigen Lösungsansätze gescheitert sind und ein Paradigmenwechsel erforderlich ist .
Kann die Lösung in einem Grundeinkommen liegen , das dem Bürger eine bedingungslos sichere Existenz ermöglicht , frei von Entmündigung durch materielle Existenzangst und Arbeitszwang ?
Claus Offe , Professor für Sozialpolitik , zur Idee des Grundeinkommens :
Alle Bürger , nicht alle Arbeitenden und nicht alle Armen , sondern alle Bürger haben einen Anspruch , wie alle Bürger , auch einen Anspruch auf Grundschulausbildung und auf Polizeischutz und Zugang zu Gerichten , das ist ganz selbstverständlich , das sind ja auch alles kostspielige Dinge .
Also eine bürgerrechtliche Ausgestaltung von Sozialsystemen als ein Sockel , auf den andere Leistungssysteme , betriebliche , private , auch öffentliche obendrauf kommen .
Michael Opielka , Sprecher des Netzwerks Grundeinkommen , nennt als Kriterien :
Ein Grundeinkommen muss zunächst die Existenz sichern .
Es muss zweitens einen individuellen Rechtsanspruch haben , also der darf nicht abgeleitet sein vom Ehepartner .
Er soll ohne Bedürftigkeitsprüfung auskommen und ohne Arbeitszwang .
Wie hältst du's mit der Arbeit , ist das entscheidende Unterscheidungskriterium für die kursierenden Grundeinkommensmodelle .
Ein bedingungslos garantiertes Grundeinkommen ist von der Arbeit entkoppelt und funktioniert als eine Art Sozialdividende .
Jedem Bürger steht qua Bürgerstatus ein Teil des gesellschaftlich erarbeiteten Reichtums als monatliches Einkommen zu . Claus Offe
Die Frage , sagt Sascha Liebermann , einer der Initiatoren der Plattform „ Freiheit statt Vollbeschäftigung “ , sei nicht :
Wie schaffe ich es , das alte System weiterhin zu finanzieren ?
Die Frage lautet :
Wir kriegen wir ein System hin , bei dem die ungeheuren Möglichkeiten der Automation ihren Nutzen entfalten ?
Statt Milliarden an Steuergeldern und praktisch alle Energie auf die sinnlose Debatte um den Erhalt der Vollbeschäftigungsgesellschaft zu lenken , wäre es dringlicher , die Grundlagen einer sozialen Grundsicherung für alle auszuarbeiten :
Das ist die wichtigste Arbeit , die wir in der Transformation zu leisten haben .
Dabei entsteht ein kleiner , aber starker Staat , dessen einzige Aufgabe die Sicherung des Rahmens ist .
Und in dem man keine riesige Sozialadministration mehr braucht .
Sascha Liebermann
Wäre ein Grundeinkommen finanzierbar ?
Wolf Lotter hat das einmal ausgerechnet :
Selbst wenn man nur das heute gesetzlich festgelegte Existenzminimum – 7664 Euro pro Jahr und Kopf – als Mindesteinkommen garantierte , machte das für 82 Millionen Bundesbürger die gewaltige Summe von 620 Milliarden Euro aus : rund 200 Milliarden mehr , als der Staat an Steuereinnahmen zusammenkratzt .
Auf den ersten Blick scheint das vollkommen unfinanzierbar .
Doch die gesamten Sozialausgaben der Bundesrepublik betragen bereits heute jährlich mehr als 720 Milliarden Euro .
Zieht man davon die Aufwendungen für die Krankenversicherung ab , verbleiben 580 Milliarden Euro für Leistungen , die ein Grundeinkommen langfristig ersetzen könnte .
Und all jene , die weiterhin in Erwerbsarbeit blieben , würden nur potenzielle Empfänger des geregelten Einkommens ohne Arbeit werden .
Wolf Lotter : Der Lohn der Angst
Michael Opielka schlägt den Einsatz der Steuergelder für eine Grundeinkommensversicherung vor , bei der alle Einkommen ohne Obergrenze mit 17,5 Prozent besteuert würden .
Damit ließe sich ein Grundeinkommen als eine Art Bafög für alle finanzieren .
Einige Ökonomen regen auch die Umstellung auf ein System der Besteuerung des Konsums an , das gerechter wäre , als das bisher schwerpunktmäßig auf der Besteuerung der Löhne basierende Steuerprinzip und somit abhängig Beschäftigte besonders belastet .
Bei einem umsatzsteuerbasierten System werden Steuern dort erhoben , wo Waren und Dienstleistungen gekauft werden .
Egal , in welchem Winkel des globalisierten Marktes die Waren produziert werden .
Damit wäre die Einnahmeseite des Staates befreit von drohenden Mindereinnahmen durch Lohndrückerei , wie sie zur Zeit mit Hinweis auf „ die Zwänge des globalisierten Marktes “ intensiv betrieben wird .
Ein auf Konsumsteuern basierendes Grundeinkommen wäre mithin globalisierungskompatibel .
Das Grundeinkommen als bedingungslose Grundabsicherung ließe jedem Bürger die Freiheit , keiner Lohnarbeit nachzugehen .
Für den Wunsch nach einem Mehr an Konsum , dem Bedürfnis nach Anerkennung durch Entlohnung , aus Freude an der Arbeit und der durch sie möglichen sozialen Interaktion , würde jedoch die Mehrzahl weiter erwerbstätig sein .
In einem Arbeitsmarkt ohne Lohnsubventionen oder Arbeitszwang hätten zudem bisher billig entlohnte , aber für die Gesellschaft wichtige Tätigkeiten , etwa im sozialen Bereich , einen echten Marktwert – ansonsten würden sie nicht ausgeführt .
Fazit
Die andauernde Krise des bisherigen Systems mit Ziel Vollbeschäftigung , der immense bürokratische Aufwand und inflationäre Transferleistungen zu seiner Stützung verlangen nach einem befreienden Paradigmenwechsel und einem positivistischem , konstruktivem Umgang mit der Realität .
Das Konzept des bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens , sein Anerkennen der Rationalisierungspotentiale als glückliche , zunehmende Befreiung vom Joch der Arbeit , hat viel für sich .
Seine Finanzierung durch Umwidmung bisheriger Lohnsubventionen und einer gerechteren Lastenverteilung des Steuersystems , etwa durch eine Verlagerung mit Schwerpunkt Konsumsteuern erscheint machbar , zumal nur ein Teil der Bevölkerung auf das Grundeinkommen zugreifen würde .
Dennoch sind es vor allem psychologische Hemmnisse , die den Wechsel erschweren .
Zu tief hat sich Arbeit als Legitimation für Lebenssinn und Anspruch auf Teilhabe und als Stifter sozialer Kontakte in unseren Köpfen festgesetzt .
Auf Seiten der Funktionäre würde ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommens zudem Machtverlust bedeuten .
Peter Glotz , ehemaliger SPD - Bundesgeschäftsführer , formulierte es für die politischen Parteien so : „ Keine Partei findet das gut .
Denn an der Arbeit hängt auch die Macht der Parteien und Organisationen . “
Im bisherigen Arbeitssystem wird jedem unter Ausnutzung von Existenzangst signalisiert , dass er potenziell überflüssig und ersetzbar ist .
Ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen , das den Lebensunterhalt von der Arbeit abkoppelt , würde den Menschen hingegen die Chance eröffnen , Freiheit , Würde und Gemeinsinn zu gewinnen .
( Matthias Brake )
Whenever you encounter “ research ” from the Heritage Foundation , you always have to bear in mind that Heritage is n’t really a think tank ; it ’s a propaganda shop .
Everything it says is automatically suspect .
Greg Mankiw forgets this rule , and approvingly ( yes , it ’s obvious he approves - no wiggling out ) links to a recent Heritage attempt to explain away Medicare ’s low administrative costs :
Naturally , Medicare beneficiaries need , on average , more health care services than those who are privately insured .
Yet the bulk of administrative costs are incurred on a fixed program - level or a per-beneficiary basis .
Expressing administrative costs as a percentage of total costs makes Medicare ’s administrative costs appear lower not because Medicare is necessarily more efficient but merely because its administrative costs are spread over a larger base of actual health care costs .
When administrative costs are compared on a per-person basis , the picture changes .
In 2005 , Medicare ’s administrative costs were $ 509 per primary beneficiary , compared to private - sector administrative costs of $ 453 .
Well , whaddya know — this is an old argument , and has been thoroughly refuted .
Jacob Hacker :
These administrative spending numbers have been challenged on the grounds that they exclude some aspects of Medicare ’s administrative costs , such as the expenses of collecting Medicare premiums and payroll taxes , and because Medicare ’s larger average claims because of its older enrollees make its administrative costs look smaller relative to private plan costs than they really are .
However , the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) has found that administrative costs under the public Medicare plan are less than 2 percent of expenditures , compared with approximately 11 percent of spending by private plans under Medicare Advantage .
This is a near perfect “ apples to apples ” comparison of administrative costs , because the public Medicare plan and Medicare Advantage plans are operating under similar rules and treating the same population .
( And even these numbers may unduly favor private plans : A recent General Accounting Office report found that in 2006 Medicare Advantage plans spent 83.3 percent of their revenue on medical expenses , with 10.1 percent going to non-medical expenses and 6.6 percent to profits — a 16.7 percent administrative share . )
The CBO study suggests that even in the context of basic insurance reforms , such as guaranteed issue and renewability , private plans ’ administrative costs are higher than the administrative costs of public insurance .
The experience of private plans within FEHBP carries the same conclusion .
Under FEHBP , the administrative costs of Preferred Provider Organizations ( PPOs ) average 7 percent , not counting the costs of federal agencies to administer enrollment of employees .
Health Maintenance Organizations ( HMOs ) participating in FEHBP have administrative costs of 10 to 12 percent .
In international perspective , the United States spends nearly six times as much per capita on health care administration as the average for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) nations .
Nearly all of this discrepancy is due to the sales , marketing , and underwriting activities of our highly fragmented framework of private insurance , with its diverse billing and review practices

William Gibson Reads Neuromancer
The author Ray Bradbury is one of the early science fiction authors that moved science fiction into a literary form .
As a writer Bradbury constructs beautifully written stories and novels .
Bradbury 's writing is in stark contrast to Bradbury as a speaker .
The first time I heard Ray Bradbury speak was at the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) yearly conference in Los Angeles in the 1980s .
Hearing Bradbury speak is an almost painful experience .
The pictures that Bradbury can paint with the written word seem to be entirely missing when Bradbury speaks .
He is halting , awkward and does not seem to know where he wants to go in his talk .
In contrast to Bradbury , listenting to William Gibson has the feel of his written work .
The same complex world view and sentence structure is there , although not as finely edited .
An example of this can be found in the documentary made about William Gibson , No Maps for these Territories .
This documentary includes extensive interviews with William Gibson .
No Maps also provides a glimpse of the way Gibson looks at the interconnections and relationships in the world around us .
This view of Gibson 's mind shows us his genius .
The mirror between William Gibson 's spoken voice and his written voice gives special force to his readings of his work .
Early in his career Gibson did an abridged reading of Neuromancer , his first novel and the work that made him famous .
It was in this novel that Gibson coined the term cyberspace .
This reading was only published on audio - tape and is now out of print .
I hate the idea that Gibson 's wonderful reading of Neuromancer should be lost or inaccessable .
I was only able to hear it because the Mountain View ( California ) Library had a copy .
Fortunately I 've been able to find an MP3 copy of these audio tapes .
They can be downloaded below .
I am only providing these MP3s because the original has been out of print for years .
As a software engineer I believe that I should be paid for my work .
If I hold this view then it is only reasonable that I should also believe that artist should be paid for their work .
All of the software and music I own I have paid for ( or is open source ) .
I would prefer that the publisher re-issue the audio - tape of William Gibson 's reading in a more modern format ( perhaps CD ) and that William Gibson collect royalties on this work .
Gibson 's reading has been out of print so long that I can only assume that this is unlikely to happen .
If you 're a fan of William Gibson I hope that others will mirror these files as well so that they will never be lost .
This reading was published on four magnetic tape audio cassetts .
These have been re-recorded in MP3 format :
An on - line copy of William Gibson 's Neuromancer Neuromancer is one of the few books that I 've read many times .
All of Gibson 's books are good ( well , except for The Difference Engine , but that 's Bruce Sterling 's fault ) .
Neuromancer is still in print , so you should go out an buy a copy if you want to read it .
Writers pay their bills from the royalties from book sales .
I 've included the link above in case you want to get a feel for the book before you buy it ( even paperback books are not cheap these days ) .

Meghan McCain Going Nuts Because Somebody Somewhere On the Internet Wants To Kill Himself
These days , the rule of fandom is anything worth doing , is worth overdoing , often to a terrifying degree .
Just take a look at ...
Readers everywhere have fallen in love with the tale of a magical boy who escapes a decade of child abuse only to wind up in a facility with a worse child - safety record than the Industrial Revolution .
Unfortunately , humanity 's ability to simply enjoy the Harry Potter books and get on with their lives ended the very second two computers were connected together .
5 The Wizard Rock Festival

In what can only be an attempt by rogue mathematicians to create an actual physical empty set , someone organized the overlap of " Rock Festival Attendees " and " Hardcore Harry Potter Fans " in Brooklyn last September .
If you 've already guessed that the bands all had names like " The Cedric Diggorys " and " The Remus Lupins , " well done on recovering from that attack on your faith in humanity faster than we did .
Tickets actually sold out , with 20 Muggle dollars earning you Wrock festival attendance ( if you were wondering , yes , " Wrock " is " rock " about wizardly subjects ) .
Though now that we look at it , it says about 300 fans and 17 bands turned up , a ratio that they could have managed if each band just got their friends and family to fork over the cash .

Behold the face of Wrocking Out :
Wait a second , that 's ... a lot of girls there .
Maybe the young dudes in the audience know something the rest of us do n't , like that guy we all laughed at when he made it onto the cheerleading squad .
This raises many , many questions , such as , do those dudes hit on the girls by claiming they got there by accident ?
" Yeah , it 's OK I guess , but I only bought a ticket because I thought ' wrock ' was wrestling where the dudes get to bash each other with rocks . "
Or is the opposite ?
Is this the one place on Earth where some 16 - year - old dude actually increases his chances by openly recognizing the banner of Gryffindor on the wall ?
Will he win the heart of that girl on the left by telling her she looks like Cho Chang ?
A new video streaming service is set to feature music and film
Peter Sunde , a co-founder of high - profile file - sharing website The Pirate Bay , says new legal action against the site is nothing more than " harassment " .
Thirteen Hollywood production companies filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to try to get the website shut down .
In April the site 's founders were found guilty of breaking copyright law and were sentenced to a year in jail and ordered to pay $ 4.5 m ( £ 3 m ) in damages .
However , the site remains open and users can share copyrighted content .
" We have filed a complaint against The Pirate Bay because they have not stopped their activities after they were sentenced to prison , " the studios ' lawyer Monique Wadsted told AFP .
The lawsuit has been brought by Columbia Pictures , Disney Enterprises , Universal Studios and 10 other firms , many of which were due to receive damages form the April settlement .
But in keeping with their well - established stance of indifference to legal action , Mr Sunde told BBC News : " I 'm on vacation , sleeping a lot and eating great vegan food .
" The latest threats are just harassments from the industry of course .
We 've actually asked the courts to punish them with a high fine for the faulty threats . "
The Pirate Bay was set up in 2003 by anti-copyright organisation Piratbyran , but for the last five years it has been run by individuals .
Millions of files are exchanged using the service every day .
No copyright content was hosted on The Pirate Bay 's web servers ; instead it hosted links to TV , film and music files held on its users ' computers .
Following the most recent lawsuit , the site was bought by Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) for 60 m kronor ( £ 4.7 m ) who intend to turn the site into a legal , pay service .
The new owners have outlined a " give and take " model which pays users for sharing their resources .

Conservative leader David Cameron has insisted Andy Coulson 's job as his communications director is safe .
Senior Labour and Lib Dems figures have said he should be fired after revelations about phone messages being intercepted by the News of the World .
The Guardian alleges up to 3,000 high profile figures - including ex-deputy PM John Prescott - were targeted by the paper Mr Coulson edited until 2007 .
Asked if Mr Coulson 's job was safe , Mr Cameron said : " Yes , of course . "
Mr Cameron sought to make a distinction between what Mr Coulson may have done in the past and what he does now for the Conservative Party .
Speaking outside his home in West London , Mr Cameron said : " It 's wrong for newspapers to breach people 's privacy with no justification .
" That is why Andy Coulson resigned as editor of the News of the World two - and - a - half years ago .
Of course I knew about that resignation before offering him the job .
But I believe in giving people a second chance .
" As director of communications he does an excellent job for the Conservatives , in a proper , upright way at all times . "
Following the Guardian 's revelations , the police have come under pressure to launch a fresh investigation into the phone hacking claims .
But the Metropolitan Police said no new evidence had come to light to warrant this , adding that in the " vast majority " of cases there was no evidence to suggest the phones of alleged victims - including John Prescott - had been tapped .
In a statement , News International said it worked to ensure its staff operated within the law , but insisted its staff would not " shirk from vigorously defending our right and proper role to expose wrongdoing " .
Politically motivated Mr Coulson , who has yet to comment on whether he knew about phone hacking at the paper , issued a statement on Wednesday saying " this story relates to an alleged payment made after I left the News of the World two and a half years ago .
I have no knowledge whatsoever of any settlement with Gordon Taylor " .
The Guardian revealed that the News of the World had reached an out - of - court settlement with Gordon Taylor , head of the Professional Footballers ' Association , after hacking into his phone .
It 's extraordinary that the leader of the opposition , who wants to be a prime minister , employs Andy Coulson
Chris Huhne , Lib Dem home affairs spokesman
The Conservatives argue that calls by senior Labour figures such as Charles Clarke and John Prescott for Mr Coulson to be sacked were politically - motivated attempts to destabilise Mr Cameron .
Speaking on BBC's Question Time , shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt said the other parties had shown a " huge dose of political opportunism " over the issue .
" The reality is that Andy Coulson stepped down from editing the News of the World and he did it because he was taking responsibility for something he did not know about but something he wanted to take responsibility for , " he said .
" He has behaved totally honourably . "
Mr Prescott has written to Mr Cameron expressing his " deep concern " about the Guardian 's allegation .
The former deputy prime minister , who has said he will contact the police over claims phone messages were intercepted by investigators hired by a News of the World reporter , said : " This really does call Cameron 's judgement into question in hiring Coulson .
The question Cameron must answer is ' do you back him or sack him ? ' "
But pressure is likely to continue on Mr Coulson after the Commons Culture Committee said it would re-open its inquiry into the affair .
Andy Coulson was News of the World editor until 2007 Tory MP John Whittingdale , the committee 's chairman , told the BBC there was " a strong likelihood that Mr Coulson will be one of those " the committee wanted to grill depending on what the evidence seen by The Guardian contained .
The Lib Dems have called for Mr Coulson to be sacked , comparing his case to that of Damian McBride , the Downing Street aide forced to quit over e-mail smears against senior Conservatives .
" It 's extraordinary that the leader of the opposition , who wants to be a prime minister , employs Andy Coulson who , at best , was responsible for a newspaper that was out of control and , at worst , was personally implicated in criminal activity , " its home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said .
" The exact parallel is surely with Damian McBride .
If the prime minister was right to sack Damian McBride , should the leader of the opposition not sack Andy Coulson ? "
Labour MP Denis MacShane called for a Commons investigation , with evidence given on oath , and questioned why Mr Coulson still had a House of Commons pass .
' Measured response ' Labour 's Ann Clwyd called on Mr Coulson to be stripped of his Commons pass while the latest allegations are investigated .
" Given Mr Coulson 's dubious reputation , none of us on this side of the House can feel comfortable while he is allowed to wander the corridors here .
Can we not , at the very least , while he is under suspicion , take his pass away from him ? , " she told MPs .
Home Office minister David Hanson said such issues were a " matter for the House authorities " .
Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said - to laughter from the Labour and Lib Dem benches - that there was " no doubt that the story that appeared in this morning 's newspaper raised questions " .
But he called for a " measured response " to the allegations and said it should be left to the police to " decide whether there is any new information that warrants further action " .
In the Lords , security minister Lord West said the police 's decision not to launch a new investigation was " slightly surprising " , adding : " I would jolly well like to know if some blighter was trying to do that to me . "
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson told BBC
London it would defy belief if Mr Coulson , as the editor of the News of the World , did not know what was going on in the newspaper and the methods that were being used .
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the problem Mr Cameron faces was that new questions were now being opened about the past .
He said Mr Coulson had " already broken rule one for any spin doctor - ' Never become the story , ' adding : " He 's good enough at his job to know that this story could soon become one about David Cameron 's judgement . "

Mercedes - Benz is new to the hybrid gas- electric movement , but it 's going full - bore in the 2010 model year with hybrid versions of its ML450 sport-utility vehicle and its S - Class sedan .
The two vehicles use different hybrid systems -- the ML450 a version of the two - mode system shared with GM 's big SUVs and the former Chrysler SUV hybrids .
It 's the S - Class Hybrid coming next year that 's becoming more interesting -- and , Mercedes executives say , will likely lead to a Hybrid version of the 2010 Mercedes - Benz E- Class being unveiled to the press this week in Las Vegas .
The new E - Class hybrid , which is being studied now , could be available " in a couple of years , " says Bernhard Glaser , general manager of product management for Mercedes - Benz USA .
Glaser says the main hurdles to adding a new E - Class Hybrid are n't in cost , though some reports estimate the same technology in the S - Class Hybrid could raise that car 's price by up to $ 10,000 .
It 's model management ; Mercedes would have to figure out if the E - Class Hybrid would displace another model in its lineup , which the brand is keen to keep at a certain size to avoid marketing and service complexity .
The E - Class Hybrid would n't be much more complex than the S - Class Hybrid coming for 2010 .
Unlike the ML450 Hybrid , the S - Class Hybrid does n't require large battery packs and substantial re-engineering of the vehicle .
The lithium - ion battery pack simply replaces the car 's standard 12 - volt battery , with a loop of the air conditioning system routed through it to keep the cells cool .
In the 2010 Mercedes - Benz S400 BlueHybrid , the combination of a thin 15 - kilowatt electric motor sandwiched between a 275 - horsepower V - 6 engine and the company 's seven - speed automatic transmission results in nearly 30 miles per gallon in the European test cycle .
The two - mode ML450 Hybrid gets a boost , too , though its highway fuel economy tops out at 24 mpg .
While the joint - venture , two - mode hybrid program with GM and BMW has given Mercedes a leg up into the world of hybrids , it 's clear that the technological advantages of lithium - ion batteries and mild hybrids offer more advantages for the automaker .
In general , though the two - mode helped Mercedes learn the benefits of hybrids , Mercedes is clearly moving to favoring a " mild hybrid " approach that only works in parallel with the engine , a la Honda , Glaser says .
Full hybrids , like the Toyota Prius , allow the vehicle to operate in electric - only mode .
Further , serial hybrids like the planned 2011 Chevrolet Volt allow the vehicle to operate completely on electric power , with an internal - combustion engine recharging the batteries .
TheCarConnection.com is driving the new E - Class sedan and coupe this week , and we 'll be filing our driving impressions along with other news shortly .

Actor Screw - Ups on Social Networking Sites
" Kevin Kemperer is doin ' Brittany in the hot tub .
" Sadly the only thing fictional about the sentence prior , pulled from a Facebook status , is the user 's name ; Kevin Kemperer .
His " doin ' Brittany in the hot tub , " whether true or not , was only known to the user who posted the Facebook status and by Brittany .
I have a lot of Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn and MySpace friends .
I 'm gigged out by digital detente .
About one percent of my computerized companions are 3D friends : i.e. , people I actually call friends in the real world .
An additional quarter of the techno - byte buddies are people I 've met or worked with on occasion ; acquaintances .
Leaving the rest of the 74 percent of the thousands who Friend , Link , Space and Tweet me as strangers who I only know of by their statuses that stream by in a flood on my laptop screen .
Most of that 74 percentile deluge flowed to me .
I know it 's not because of my sapphire eyes , curly locks or sexual preference ( damn ) .
I know full well that when I confirm or accept the invites from strangers to become a virtual friend that it's my work as a director , casting director and / or author that 's being exploited .
I 'm being networked .
I have no qualm or complaint about that .
That 's part of this business .
It 's a vital survival component for success that anyone in any business should .
As long as they befriend business buddies in a professional manner .
If you 're going to network on social internet sites you would do yourself a professional service by creating two profiles .
One for your true friends and family .
Another to represent your career .
Keep your contacts separate and relative for each profile .
I'm often amused and remain amazed about the number of inappropriate " statuses " streaming on my newsfeeds from the people who are using me as a professional networking connection .
Some things are never meant to be witnessed .
Like Rush Limbaugh repeatedly jumping naked on a bed .
Below is a sampling from a recent quick glance of Facebook and Twitter statuses better left un -texted .
If you recognize any of them you can thank me for not revealing your name which I have replaced with " Anonymous . " " Anonymous fuck my life . " " Anonymous ai n't gonna go and act a fool and be the lead story on the nigga news ?
Neva me sucka , I 'll never be your lover , I 'd rather make you suffer .
You stupid motherfucker . " " Anonymous thinks there is nothing better than belting out songs that make the neighbors want to complain ! "
" Anonymous is burnt as a lobster and totally depressed as hell that Chandler has left her forever ( crying of course ) " " Anonymous is extremely frustrated ... " " Anonymous ' back is surprisingly tight after yesterdays climbing , and longing for a back massage " " Anonymous ' headache is gone and I cleaned my own bathroom like a big girl . "
" Anonymous is not good at this hope thing , but desperately needs to know so she can move on with her life .
So the question is to act or not ?
Will either choice help for the better or worse ?
Or has fate already decided ?
Really ... this is torture ! " " Anonymous has never been so humiliated by someone who calls her his best friend " " Anonymous is generally displeased . " " Anonymous is Dear Best Buy , thanks for ruining my fucking day by accusing me of being a criminal .
Why would I try to shop lift a 5 dollar DVD !?!?!?
TMI folks ( too much interconnection ) .
And too much information for me and other people you 're networking with professionally to know .
Way too much .
The current constant connection fad of passive aggressive communication via keystrokes is in overdrive .
Online social networks can be great tools ( of which a later blog on successful exploitation will be forthcoming ) .
But for now ; the lesson here is to keep your private thoughts just that .
Private .
With possible exceptions contained to family relations and reality friends .
If you still doubt about blindly proliferating inappropriate prose to the masses think about this .
If you were applying for a school , employment at a Fortune 500 company or keeping in contact with your grandparents via a social internet web site would you advertise to them and the world you were " doing Brittany in the hot tub " ?
If so , then you 're narcissism challenges that of Paris Hilton's .

Get help .

Davent 's suggestion of parchment paper is an excellent one .
It 'll do the same job I was recommending teflon for , at a fraction of the cost .
It 's also a lot easier to find .
Although photo paper can work great , the chief stumbling block with it seems to be being able to tell when it's " done " .
Press - n - peel has the advantage of being thin enough that when the toner has properly adhered to the copper the acetate backing sags enough that you can see a complete detailed outline of the pattern .
Photo paper is too thick to see such a " bas relief " , though after a while one gets the hang of it .
As some have noted regularly on this forum , glossy magazine paper can also work quite well , and has the advantage of being much thinner than photo paper ( which is intended to produce images you can pick up and hold in your hand ) .
Like photo paper , glossy magazine paper is a paper fibre backing with an emulsion coating ; the difference being that photo paper has no colouring in the emulsion ( it awaits your image of choice ) while magazines already have an image and accompanying pigments embedded in the emulsion layer .
That pre-colouring has no bearing on its ability to hold and transfer toner , though .
The chief shortcoming of magazine paper is that it has an emulsion layer on both sides ( the emulsion can melt and stick to the heat source on the side where heat is applied ) , and that whatever image is on the back side can make it difficult to see the " bas relief " outline of the toner pattern the way you can with the solid - colour PnP .
The first shortcoming can be addressed by using the parchment paper as davent suggests .
The second shortcoming can , for the most part , be addressed by having suitable lighting and holding up the board to the light at a suitable angle for seeing whether the pattern has been affixed to the board .

India : Bomb is clicking Population Bomb
According to population projections released by the
United Nations India 's population is projected to peak at 1.718 billion in 2060
Before 2025 India will have more population compare to China .
In 2025 Population of China will be 1.395 billion people .
By the turn of Century Population of India will be almost double that of China .
At the turn of the century , the world will have 10.1 billion people .
On October 31 this year , the world will have its seven billionth person
Very few people in India think on this , the one of the root cause of all problems in India is Uncontrolled Population Growth .
Somewhere I read that in the year 2025 India will beat china in the population .
Any political party may come into the power , it may promise you and show you dreams of heaven but reality is that It is foolish to think and expect that Indian government can provide us Decent standard of living in next 100 years .
There is problem of drinking water , sanitation , housing , health care , infrastructure many more .
2nd biggest problem which Indian government is ignoring is relation of population and job creation .
When government of India and Indian industry creates 1 job , and to get that job
500 boys and girls are standing , may be today 100 boys and girls are standing to get this job , in this also you will find 50 boys and girls are with more than 90 % score .
In this case if our population is not controlled now you can imagine a day after 25 years that for each job minimum 1000 boys and girls are in line , what this 999 boys and girls will do , this ratio is of only for one job .
I feel that out of this 25 % will become criminals , few will become hardcore criminals or will join terror group as for them there is no job after scoring more than 90 % marks .
In there graduation studies .
Today many Indians are settling abroad , but after 25 years or 50 years this process will also stop .
Reason will be European and American governments will make it very tough for outsiders to get there citizenship .
More population means more water use .
Groundwater levels will be used so rapidly that nature will not replace it .
Nature will fail .
Reason will be human population .
The forest will be cut rapidly , trees will be cut without any reasoning , and it will bring drought and other problems , will give rise to the problem of global warming .
As population will increase , the tensions between the states will rise , states will fight who will get more money from central , the states will have to the make the laws which will prohibit other people to join the jobs of other states .
States will bring more and more reservation for local people in all the industry , which very slowly will move the India towards division of India and civil war .
People are not realizing the problem .
One day the result will be - riots , fighting over food , water and petty reasons .
More population means more scope for corruption .
This is reason India will never see end of poverty .
Today also if you compare American or European poverty line you will find that 85 % Indians are living below poverty line as per American or European standards of Germany and America .
People will start to say India has more population and India contributes less towards Global warming .
But my question is does west told you to produce so many people , so comparing population with global warming is totally wrong .
Today our contribution in this problem is less because we do n’t have electricity in every home .
We do n’t have food to give to all the people .
We do n’t have schools for children .
Our Indian schools are still held under a tree , where when there is a rain , the school master says students today is holiday go home .
Rain means holiday for students .
Even cities have to face electricity problem .
If you will compare India is just 1/3 size of America , but population is more than 1 billion .
From 1950 , Indian government is trying to control population but results are magical
Population is increasing day by day .
Sometimes I think its duty of population control department to see that there is no population control hope its wrong thinking .
After reading this I am sure you will say last few years there is decrease in the population growth , Yes I agree with that , but this decrease happened because of late marriage ,
Rising ratio of Unmarried people , educated people using policy of 1 kid etc .
This population decrease is not permanent , its like interest rate on the loan is reduced but loan is remaining and this interest rate will increase any time .
This population decrease has not happen because of any government policy .
To quote Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University : “ Suppose , over the next thirty to thirty - five years , India ’s average completed family size dropped from the 1990 level of about 4.3 to 2.4 ( replacement level ) and remained there , and death rates did n’t rise .
India ’s population would continue to grow for almost a century , and when it stopped there would be about 2 billion Indians - as many people living in that one nation as populated the entire planet in 1930 ! ”
Majority Indians just take birth and spend there life just to get essentials of life .
They never get a chance to celebrate a human life , enjoy the human life .
People say we got abundance of love , compassion but do n’t forget that there are limits of the nature , money , Natural resources are limited .
Now a days very proudly majority Indians say we are young nation but be aware future is not rosy , population bomb is tickling .
After 50 years India will not remain a country where humans can survive happily and peacefully .
There will be no peace and safety .
Reason population problem .
Mr. President Obama and other world leaders do n’t ignore this Indian population problem , We as Indians will suffer but this earth will also suffer , and when this earth will suffer ; your nation will also suffer .
PREDICTED POPULATIONS , 2050
1 India , 1,628 m ( 2 )
2 China , 1,437 m ( 1 )
3 United States , 420 m ( 3 )
4 Indonesia , 308 m ( 4 )
5 Nigeria , 307 m ( 9 )

How we Indians can deal and solve the population problem of India
Few Suggestions :
Free and compulsory education for the females up to age 18
No Government job if have more than 1 or 2 kids .
No right to contest any election private or public election if have more than 2 kids .
Killing of female child in the mothers womb should be treated as murder and the family be charged for this murder along with doctor and hospital management .
Special taxes and fines if have more than 2 kids .
Reservation benefit should be given to the families who have only 2 kids .
The poor families who agree to have 2 kids only should be given government job .
The companies like Infosys wipro and Tata should make a rule that every employee has to sign a document that he will not have more than 2 kids otherwise his job will be terminated .
After this other companies and government companies will also follow the same .
Like this we can make many laws , but I do n’t see any willingness of any political party
To do anything to control population of India .
For a political party , more population means more beggars , more corruption ,
More votes from uneducated population , show them fear , give them one time food or a bottle of drug and they will vote for you and never demand accountability from the political leaders , when one is hungry and jobless and without education
Do you think he can dream of good life or he will only dream of bread and water .
democracy cannot survive overpopulation .
Human dignity cannot survive it .
Convenience and decency cannot survive it .
As you put more and more people into the world , the value of life not only declines , it disappears .
It does n't matter if someone dies .
The more people there are , the less one individual matters .
Instead of controlling the environment for the benefit of the population , maybe we should control the population to ensure the survival of our environment .
We must alert and organise the world 's people to pressure world leaders to take specific steps to solve the two root causes of our environmental crises - exploding population growth and wasteful consumption of irreplaceable resources .
Overconsumption and overpopulation underlie every environmental problem we face today .

McKinney went on to say that “ State Department and White House officials have not effected our release or taken a strong public stance to condemn the illegal actions of the Israeli Navy of enforcing a blockade of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians of Gaza , a blockade that has been condemned by President Obama . ”
The Free Gaza campaign succeeded in entering Gaza by sea on several occasions in 2008 , carrying humanitarian aid , medical personnel , journalists and human rights workers .
However , later attempts have been met with aggression by the Israeli navy , with one boat , the Dignity , having to seek refuge and repairs in Lebanon after being rammed three times by an Israeli warship .
In a brief interview with Andy Bowman of Manchester 's Mule newspaper ( http// www.themule.info), Mr Mormech gave the following account :
How are you being treated ?
It 's bad , but the conditions are OK for me , I 've not been beaten up , they 're a bit nasty sometimes and when they boarded the boat we had our faces slammed against the floor .
It was bad for the older women like Mairead .
The four other UK nationals are in the cell with me .
There 's 14 of us in the 7 by 7 meter cell which includes the toilet and shower , so very crowded .
It 's very hot and there 's only a tiny window .
We get awakened at 6 in the morning for an inspection and have to stand to attention , and then they repeat that at 9 am , and we are only allowed out of the cells for a few hours each day .
They keep giving us forms to sign but they are in Hebrew so we do n't .
Although I 'm able to cope here , other people are less comfortable than me in the situation .
If we 're here for a long time – like some of the other people in here have been – then it will be tough .
Have you had access to a lawyer yet ?
We have , and at the moment we 're discussing what to do about our deportation .
They 've taken our personal items – laptops , cameras , phones and many other valuables , and we want to find out where these are .
They obviously want to deport us as quickly as possible , but some of us are thinking about fighting the deportation .
Firstly on the basis that if we get deported we wo n't be allowed into the occupied West Bank or Israel for another 10 years , but also , because we did n't intend to come here to Israel – we intended to go to Gaza , and went directly from international waters into Palestinian waters .
There is nothing legal about what Israel has done to us grabbing us like this .
We 're considering fighting the deportation on the grounds that we should n't accept and legitimize this barbaric military blockade of Gaza .
If you challenge the deportation could you remain in prison for a while longer ?
Yes we could – there 's some people that need to get home , but some will challenge .
And for those it will be a few more weeks in prison at least , we expect .
And you ?
I 'm veering towards challenging it on the basis that it's a scar on my name to accept that I should n't have been here , but in fact I have every right to go to Gaza just as everyone else does .
That 's the whole point of these voyages and that 's the principle we want to stick to .
Have they told you what has happened to the cargo of the boat ?
No , we do n't know what they 're doing with it .
We 've been told a lot of lies so far about where we 're going and what 's happening to us , so we just do n't know .
They 're already prepared to deprive the people of Gaza of a lot of aid anyway .
What is your message to people back in the UK ?
This is not about us here in the cells , it 's about the denial of human rights to the people of Palestine , and in particular the inhumane blockade of Gaza .
People must not forget about what is happening to Gaza .
At the moment they are even being denied food and medical supplies .
After the carnage of the 1500 people killed in January , we wo n't forget and we 'll keep on going and keep fighting for the human rights of the people of Palestine .
Is real - estate development always good ?
Is a community succeeding only if it ’s growing ?
That was the post - war assumption in this country as skylines inched upward and suburbs sprawled .
But like so many economic presumptions , the growth - is - good model may now be collapsing on itself .
Flint , Michigan , for , example , was once a thriving factory town with 79,000 locals employed by General Motors .
Today it ’s one of the poorest cities in the country with 20 % unemployment and block after block of abandoned closed homes .
The possibility of shrinking the city was raised some months ago at a Rotary Club talk by acting mayor Michael Brown .
It has since become a volatile issue in the mayoral campaign .
The plan has been backed by Dan Kildee ( above ) , the treasurer of Genesee County , which includes Flint .
The goal would be to create a smaller , more manageable city with improved services .
If the plan is adopted the city would bulldoze entire neighborhoods–as much as 40 percent of its area–and return the land to nature .
The Obama administration has asked Kildee to study how the shrinking city approach might benefit other rust belt cities , according a political Web site called The Washington Independent .

We 're a movement dedicated to the eradication of
full - disclosure .
We wanted to give everyone an image of what we 're all
about .
Full - disclosure is the disclosure of exploits publicly - anywhere .
The
security industry uses full - disclosure to profit and develop
scare - tactics to convince people into buying their firewalls ,
anti-virus software , and auditing services .
Meanwhile , script kiddies copy and paste these exploits and compile
them , ready to strike any and all vulnerable servers they can get a hold
of .
If whitehats were truly about security this stuff would not be
published , not even exploits with silly edits to make them slightly
unusable .
As an added bonus , if publication was n't enough , these exploits are
mirrored and distributed widely across the Internet with a nice little
advertisement embedded in them for the crew or website which first
exposed the vulnerability to the public .
It 's about money .
While the world is difficult to change , and money will
certainly continue to be a very important in the eyes of many , our
It 's about money .
While the world is difficult to change , and money will
certainly continue to be a very important in the eyes of many , our
battle is that of the removal of full - disclosure for the purpose of
making it harder for the security industry to exploit its consequences .
It is our goal that , through mayhem and the destruction of all
exploitive and detrimental communities , companies , and individuals ,
full - disclosure will be abandoned and the security industry will be
forced to reform .
How do we plan to achieve this ?
Through the full and unrelenting ,
unmerciful elimination of all supporters of full - disclosure
and the security industry in its present form .
If you own a security
blog , an exploit publication website or you distribute any exploits ...
" you are a target and you will be rm'd .
Only a matter of time . "
This is n't like before .
This time everyone and everything is getting
owned .

Kodachrome , the storied camera film that has documented historic events and everyday lives since the Great Depression , is about to fade into oblivion .
Amid a long - running shift to digital photography , Eastman Kodak Co. said Monday that because of plunging sales , it is ending production of the film it first introduced in 1935 .
The company said the final batch of the slide film , known for its rich colors and clarity , is being manufactured now in Mexico and that supplies should probably last until the fall .

CAPITAL -BASED MACROECONOMICS
These PowerPoint shows ( below left ) represent three successive versions of capital - based analytics .
The original show was created in early 1999 , when the end of the credit - driven boom was not yet in sight and when Bill Clinton had almost two years left of his second term .
Consistent with the Mises - Hayek theory of the business cycle , the graphical analytics demonstrate the inevitability -- but not the timing -- of the subsequent bust .
Part V of the original show depicts Bill Clinton still in office when the bust comes .
In 2003 I created a second edition of the show , mainly to add some pedagogical features in the early sections and additional explanatory text throughout .
I also made changes in Part V to reflect the fact that George W. Bush was in office when the downturn came .
In 2006 , I created a third edition --- a total remake of the show using the 2003 PowerPoint software .
I also created a second show to contrast the Keynesian and Hayekian frameworks .
And I tweaked both of thise shows in 2009 .

On twitter recently I was wondering what the best way to create a dictionary of functions in Python was .
On a suggestion of Paul Hankin ’s I looked into classes and metaclasses .
The most direct way I discovered is to use a class ; metaclass not required :
class foo : def bar ( ) : pass def zon( x ) : return 1+x fundict = foo.__dict__
This is direct , but not at all obvious .
Hint to people that are mystified already : the __dict__ attribute of the class is a dictionary containing everything defined in the class .
fundict is now a dictionary that contains the two functions bar and zon .
I made this discovery a few days before EuroPython , and was fortunate enough to bump into Bruce Eckel in the hallway at EuroPython just before he gave his metaprogramming talk , so I showed it to him in what I call my “ naughty decorator ” form :
def asdict( x ) : return x.__dict__ @asdict class baz : def bar ( ) : pass def zon( x ) : return 1+x
( By the way , one of the things I learnt at EuroPython is that the crappy decorator syntax gives Java refugees a warm fuzzy feeling ) .
Bruce pronounced this “ not as naughty as you imply ” and “ worth showing ” ( this blog post was half - written before I bumped into Bruce , but he is definitely encouraging me ) .
It ’s worth showing for the following reason :
The functions you get from the class ’s __dict__ dictionary are not the same as the methods you get by accessing the attributes of the class .
In other words « foo. bar is not foo.__dict__ [ ' bar ' ] ».
I was surprised by this , and so was Bruce .
As well being a little weird , it makes a compact example to show the different between a function , an unbound method , and a bound method .
I hope I do n’t need to introduce a function .
It ’s just a thing you call with some arguments .
Where it differs from a method is that a method is regarded as a message sent to an object , and receives that object as its first argument .
In Python , an unbound method is a method that is n’t associated with any particular object ; it requires an object as its first argument ( and Python loses big here , by requiring the object to be an instance of the class that defined the method ) .
A bound method is a method already associated with an object ; that object becomes the method ’s first argument when the bound method is invoked with the remaining arguments .
So if we define a class foo ( as we did , above ) , then :
foo.bar is an unbound method ;
foo( ) . bar is a bound method ( bound to the object we just created by invoking the foo class ) ; and ,
foo.__dict__[ ‘ bar ’ ] is a function .
This last fact was a great surprise to me .
I had expected it to be an unbound method , and thought that my naughty decorator would have to have some hacky code to dig the function out of the unbound method .
But it does n’t .
Tiny problem : Using the asdict gives a dictionary that contains __module__ and __doc__ keys .
Solution : another decorator :
def cleandict( x ) : for k in ( ' __module__ ' , ' __doc__ ' ) : del x[k ] return x @cleandict @asdict class baz : def bar ( ) : pass def zon( x ) : return 1+x

Sometimes it can be difficult to see what ’s best for those we love .
Take Linux , for example .
So numerous are its virtues and so brilliant its shine that many of us get completely caught up in adoring it — sometimes to the detriment of any efforts to advance it in the world .
How much space on the Linux blogs , after all , gets devoted to wondering why more people have n’t already adopted our favorite operating system ?
Aiming to direct the efforts of Linux aficionados who want to advocate for their OS , Linux Today ’s Carla Schroder recently put together a list of tips suggesting some effective ways to do that .
‘ Show , Do n’t Tell ’
“ The most effective advocacy is one - on - one , up close and personal , ” Schroder began .
Among her tips : “ Show , do n’t tell ” and “ tie your hands behind your back . ”
After all , “ they do n’t care what you like , they care what they like , ” she wrote .
Perhaps most difficult of all : “ Be kind and patient . ”
Now , we here at LinuxInsider will be among the first to admit that self - restraint can be tough when it comes to Linux .
Nevertheless , given the stakes at hand , we knew the topic warranted a closer look .
‘ Throw People Into the Pool ’
“ Carla Schroder is right on as usual , ” blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ I have introduced thousands to GNU / Linux , and turning them loose on it works very well .
Young people are much more accepting of change if they can see the benefits in person . ”
People “ who do the long song and dance to migrate people as Munich did are wasting a lot of time and energy , ” Pogson added .
“ It is much more efficient to give a short introduction and to throw people into the pool — they will be highly motivated to learn to swim . ”
The No. 1 thing GNU / Linux needs “ to complete its ascent as a widespread OS is numbers of users , ” he asserted .
“ We are at the edge of the time when manufacturers and OEMs will cater to the body of users of GNU / Linux .
“ Next year everyone will realize they are losing market share by not catering to GNU / Linux , ” Pogson predicted .
“ M$ still can intimidate some temporarily , but the good old days of monopoly are over . ”
‘ Linux Is n’t Great ’
At the same time , however , “ I think the biggest thing we need to do right now is avoid shooting ourselves in the foot , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack warned .
“ This means pushing Linux where it makes sense , but not on people who have applications that Linux is not ready for . ”
Similarly : “ I agree partly ” with all of Schroder ’s tips , “ but I ’ll add the caveat that ‘ Linux is n’t great ’ , ” Monochrome Mentality blogger Kevin Dean told LinuxInsider .
“ This caution should be a mantra to all would - be advocates of Linux . ”
Of course , “ Linux is n’t great , but neither are Mac OS X or Windows , ” he added .
“ Meeting the needs of people is great . ”
Know When to ‘ Back Off ’
If someone has a “ clunky old XP box that is just turning them off fromcomputing , Linux might be their answer , ” Dean explained .
“ Their need for a stable , faster OS might be met by Linux — in which case the best way to sellLinux is to show them that faster , more stable OS . ”
Yet it ’s also important to know when to “ back off , ” he added .
“ Nobody likes pushy salesmen , and with Linux that ’s no exception .
If Linux ca n’t meet thatperson ’s needs today , accept that and move on ; if you push it , youbegin to cement the ‘ Linux Zealot ' ” image .
“ Back when I used to be one of those , I thought , ‘ Linux is so great that a community forms around it ! ' ”
Dean explained .
“ The simple fact of the matter is that most normal people consider the operating system to be a bit of trivial technology .
“ Lots and lots of people like and use zippers , but if someone said that they ’re partof a community of zipper lovers , they ’d instantly be classified in the minds of uninterested parties as lunatics , ” he concluded .
“ Being classified as a lunatic by your potential converts is a BAD MARKETING MOVE . ”
‘ The Key Is in the Corporate Market ’
Schroder ’s tips “ are good ones , but I think they are aimed at markets which are more difficult to reach at the moment for a variety of reasons , ” Chris Travers , a Slashdot blogger who works on the LedgerSMB project , told LinuxInsider .
“ There is no singular , monolithic desktop market . ”
The key to success is to “ make sure one understands the user ’s needs and provide a quality , easy to use system that meets those needs , ” Travers opined .
“ Right now , the key is in the corporate desktop market .
Attention to detail , solid engineering of solutions , and empowering the company and user are the important elements , ” he explained .
“ ‘ We can make this system do whatever you want ’ is the best selling point of Linux systems today . ”
Make It ‘ Newbie - Friendly ’
More than better advocacy techniques , what Linux needs to succeed is to be made “ newbie - friendly , ” Slashdot blogger hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
“ With my Windows and Apple customers , the CLI simply does n’t exist , ” he explained .
“ Compare that to Linux , where you often get , ‘ open up Bash and type ’ to fix even the smallest problem .
That has to end . ”
Similarly , a “ Help Me ” button to connect customers to a volunteer Linux “ guru ” and a Linux hardware store for compatible products would also help make it easier to switch , hairyfeet added .
“ Linux guys have to remember that new users just do n’t think like them , ” he concluded .
“ They are used to walking into Wal - Mart and buying things , not downloading packages .
If you do n’t make it easy , then Win7 and OSX will be happy to take those customers from you . ”
The Founding Fathers On Christianity , God & Religion
The Founding Fathers of the United States are often referred to as a mixture of anti-clerical Christians ( i.e. religious free - thinkers ) and deists .
In many ways , we might think of them all as laying the groundwork for what is now referred to as the Progressive Christianity movement — for they were leaders who possessed a solid sense of reason that was guided by an understanding of the divine nature of creation and their place in it .
As such , they strongly demonstrated all the characteristics of the truly progressive Christian .
In the coming weeks , we will be writing a series of posts on the religion of America ’s Founding Fathers , which will feature passages from Thomas Jefferson , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Paine , John Adams , and other early Americans , on the subjects of Christianity , God , and Religion .
To get the ball rolling , let ’s begin with the following passage from Thomas Jefferson , taken from a letter to Moses Robinson , the governor of the Vermont Republic who helped usher Vermont to statehood .
In this passage we find Jefferson commenting on the Christian clergy , the Church , and the State , comments which still are very relevant today .
Jefferson ’s hope that “ good sense ” will prevail among orthodox Christians is unfortunately still waiting to be realized :
The Eastern States will be the last to come over , because of the dominion of the clergy , who had got a smell of union between Church and State , and began to indulge in reveries that can never be realized in the age of science .
If , indeed , they could have prevailed on us to view all the advances in science as dangerous innovations , and to look back to the opinions and practices of our forefathers , instead of looking forward , for improvement , a promising groundwork would have been laid .
But I have hopes that their good sense will show them that since the mountain will not come to them , they had better go to the mountain : that they will find it in their interest to acquiesce to the liberty and science of their country , and that the Christian religion , when divested of the rags in which they have enveloped it , and brought to the original purity and simplicity of its benevolent institutor , is a religion most friendly to liberty , science , and the freest expansion of the human mind .
I sincerely wish with you , we could see our government so secured as to depend less on the character of the person in whose hands it is trusted .
Bad men will sometimes get in , and with such an immense patronage , may make great progress in corrupting the public mind and principles .
This is a subject with which wisdom and patriotism should be occupied .

News Analysis — Wolfram|Alpha , a company whose product you have never used , may turn out to be Google ’s best friend .
For those who have n’t heard yet , Wolfram| Alpha is a much - hyped , badly - named computational search engine that gives real answers to queries such as “ internet users in Europe . ”
It pulls off the techie magic by using structured data sets , rather than messy web pages , as its index .
Its demo has impressed quite a few tech journalists , including the originally skeptical Danny Sullivan , one of the crown princes of search engine journalism .
See the screenshot below from Read / Write / Web :
To put it lightly , Google could use a little competition right now , even if it ’s only from an over - hyped website closed to the public until May 18 .
Perhaps that ’s why Google co-founder Sergey Brin seemed to talk about Wolfram in his letter to shareholders this year .
I think it will soon be possible to have a search engine that “ understands ” more of the queries and documents than we do today .
Others claim to have accomplished this , and Google ’s systems have more smarts behind the curtains than may be apparent from the outside , but the field as a whole is still shy of where I would have expected it to be .
It ’s very clear Brin is trying to tell the world — regulators and antitrust lawyers included — that search is n’t solved .
It ’s just part of Google ’s busy efforts to convince the world that it loves openness and competition — in short , that it ’s no Microsoft .
You can see a copy of a Google PowerPoint to that effect on Silicon Alley Insider , which got it from Consumer Watchdog .
That group had an advertising industry insider tip them off and give them a rebuttal .
Anonymous Analysis of Google Charm Offensive
Google made this document because the federal government seems inclined to see Google as a monopoly , whatever the company does to grow its business .
The first hints came in the resistance to Google ’s acquisition of banner - ad and online - tracking giant DoubleClick .
Then Justice Department lawyers were hours from filing an anti-trust suit when Google backed out of a deal to power Yahoo ’s ads last fall .
And now lawyers are again at Google ’s doors , asking about its attempt to build the library of the future .
So , it ’s not surprising that Google is having its lobbyists spider Capitol Hill in order to convince the right lawmakers that its business is only as good as the last click on an AdSense text ad .
Though Google holds more than 70 percent of the search market , it wants the world to believe that some Google killer is bound to upend it just as it crushed the dreams of Yahoo , Lycos , AltaVista and the other forgotten search engines from the first internet boom .
That ’s despite the fact that Google kills search startups .
Google is even trying to convince the public of it , with a blog post today outlining — wait for it — Google ’s “ six prinicples of competition and openness . ”
Given the flagging fortunes of Yahoo online and Microsoft ’s perpetual inablity to translate its dominance of the desktop into an online equivalent , Google needs Wolfram| Alpha to succeed .
They need it to go through a long - hype cycle , with journalists calling it a Google killer , and distracting regulators .
Then once Yahoo or Microsoft buys it , Google can replicate Wolfram ’s useful , but limited functions into Google ’s main search system — continuing its world dominance but proving that competition is still alive and well .
And that ’s how a search engine you ca n’t use yet will become Google ’s best friend .

U.S. President Barack Obama adjusts his translators ear piece as he listens to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during their joint news conference at the Kremlin in Moscow July 6 , 2009 .
Visiting Obama and Kremlin leader Medvedev agreed a target for cuts in nuclear arms and a deal to let U.S. troops fly across Russia at the start of a trip intended to mend strained ties .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) -
In a slip of the tongue , U.S. President Barack Obama described Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Monday as president , echoing the widely held view that he remains Russia ’s most powerful man .
Putin surrendered the presidency to protege Dmitry Medvedev last May to take the lesser post of prime minister , but most political analysts say Putin remains Russia ’s ultimate decision maker .
The dual leadership has left foreign leaders to walk a difficult diplomatic tightrope .
In line with protocol Obama met Medvedev ahead of talks with the lower ranking Putin .
At a news conference Obama gave a carefully worded reply about the effectiveness of the leadership tandem when a U.S. journalist bluntly asked “ who is really in charge here in Russia ? ”
But minutes later , speaking about Medvedev ’s objections to a controversial missile defense system planned for central Europe , Obama slipped :
“ I suspect when I speak to President ..eh..
Prime Minister Putin tomorrow , he will say the same thing . ”

I had an idea the other day , to write a basic search engine – in Ruby ( did I mention I ’ve been playing around with Ruby lately ) .
I am well aware that there are perfectly adequate ruby crawlers available to use , such RDig or Mechanize .
But I do n’t want to use any libraries for the higher level functions of my search engine ( crawling , indexing , querying etc. ) , at least not for the first version .
Since the main idea is to learn ( while doing something fun and interesting ) and the best way to learn is to sometimes do things the hard way .
Now that I have ensured I do n’t get eaten alive for not reusing existing code , we can move on :) .
I will examine all the different aspects of what makes a search engine ( the anatomy ) in a later post .
In the meantime I believe doing something like this gives you an opportunity to experience first - hand all the different things you have to keep in mind when writing a search engine .
It gives you chance to learn why we do SEO the way we do ; it lets you play with different ruby language features , database access , ranking algorithms , not to mention simply cut some code for the experience .
And you get all this without touching Rails , nothing against Rails , but I prefer to get comfortable with Ruby ( by itself ) first .
Well to dive right into it , I decided to write the crawler first , after all , you ca n’t have a search engine without a nice web crawler .
First thing first , some basic features :
should be able to crawl the web ( basic general functionality )
must be able to limit the depth of the crawl ( otherwise will potentially keep going for ever and will also run out of memory eventually because of the way it ’s written )
must be able to limit number of pages to crawl ( even with a depth limited crawl , might still have too many pages to get through depending on the starting set of domains )
must be able to crawl just a single domain ( you would also be able to limit this by number of pages )
the only output it will produce is to print out the fact that it is crawling a url
If you want to dive right into the code and explore you can download it here .
For the rest , here is how it works .
Firstly to run it do the following :
ruby search - engine - main.rb -c web -d 3 -p 100 - f ' urls.txt '
where :
-c ( is either ’ web ’ or ‘ domain ’ )
-d ( is the depth of the crawl , it will only look at links this many levels below the initial urls )
-p ( is the page limit , will not crawl more than this many pages regardless of other parameters )
-f ( the file to use as input , simply contains a list of starting urls on separate lines , will use the first one from this file for domain crawl )
Our nice and clean entry point looks like this :) :
ruby argument_parser = CommandLineArgumentParser.new argument_parser.parse_arguments spider = Spider.new url_store = UrlStore.new(argument_parser.url_file ) spider.crawl_web(url_store.get_urls , argument_parser.crawl_depth , argument_parser.page_limit ) if argument_parser.crawl_type == CommandLineArgumentParser :: WEB_CRAWLER spider.crawl_domain(url_store.get_url , argument_parser.page_limit ) if argument_parser.crawl_type == CommandLineArgumentParser:: DOMAIN_CRAWLER
We do n’t really care about this too much since this is not where the real fun bits are , so lets move on to that .
The Spider
The main worker class here is the Spider class .
It contains 2 public methods , crawl_web and crawl_domain .
Crawling the web looks like this :
ruby def crawl_web ( urls , depth=2 , page_limit = 100 ) depth.times do next_urls = [ ] urls. each do |url| url_object = open_url ( url ) next if url_object == nil url = update_url_if_redirected ( url , url_object ) parsed_url = parse_url ( url_object ) next if parsed_url == nil @already_visited [ url ] =true if @already_visited[url ] == nil return if @already_visited.size == page_limit next_urls += ( find_urls_on_page( parsed_url , url ) [ email protected ]_visited.keys ) next_urls.uniq !
end urls = next_urls end end
As you can see it is not recursive as this makes it easier to limit the depth of the crawl .
You can also tell that we take special care to handle server side redirects .
The class also keeps the urls already visited in memory , so as to guard against us getting into loops visiting the same several pages over and over .
This is not the most efficient way , obviously , and will not scale anywhere past a few thousand pages , but for our simple crawler this is fine .
We can improve this later .
Crawling a domain looks like this :
ruby def crawl_domain ( url , page_limit = 100 ) return if @already_visited.size == page_limit url_object = open_url ( url ) return if url_object == nil parsed_url = parse_url ( url_object ) return if parsed_url == nil @already_visited [ url ] =true if @already_visited[url ] == nil page_urls = find_urls_on_page ( parsed_url , url ) page_urls .each do | page_url| if urls_on_same_domain ?( url , page_url ) and @already_visited [ page_url ] == nil crawl_domain ( page_url ) end end end
This time the algorithm is recursive as it is easier to crawl a domain this way and we do n’t need to limit the depth .
Everything else is pretty much the same except we take special care to only crawl links on the same domain and we no longer need to care about redirection .
To get the links from the page I use Hpricot .
I know I said I did n’t want to use too many libraries , but parsing html by hand would just be torture :) .
Here how I find all the links :
ruby def find_urls_on_page ( parsed_url , current_url ) urls_list = [ ] parsed_url.search ( 'a [ @href ] ' ) . map do |x| new_url = x [ ' href ' ] .split ( '# ' ) [ 0 ] unless new_url == nil if relative ? ( new_url ) new_url = make_absolute ( current_url , new_url ) end urls_list.push ( new_url ) end end return urls_list end
The challenging part here is handling the relative urls and making them absolute .
I did n’t do anything fancy here .
There is a helper module that I created ( UrlUtils – yeah I know , great name :) ) , this does n’t have anything too interesting , just blood , sweat and string handling code .
That ’s pretty much all there is to it .
Now there are a few points that we need to note about this crawler .
It is not an ‘ enterprise strength ’ type of crawler , so do n’t go trying to unleash it on the whole of the web , do make liberal use of the depth and page limiters , I would n’t try to get it to handle more than a few thousand pages at a time ( for reasons I noted above ) .
Some other limitations are as follows :
wo n’t work behind proxy
wo n’t handle ftp , https ( maybe ) etc. properly
client side redirects – you ’re out of luck
if link not in href attribute , i.e. javascript – no good
relative url handling could probably be improved some more
will not respect no - follow and similar rules that other bots will e.g. robots.
txt
if list of starting urls too big , can grind it too a halt
probably a whole bunch of other limitations that I have n’t even begun thinking of
Of course there is an easy way to make this guy a little bit more scalable and useful – introduce indexing .
This would be the next thing to do cause , even a simple little search engine would need some indexing .
This would allow us to stop storing so much stuff in memory and also retain more info about pages which would let us potentially make better decisions , but that ’s a story for another time :) .
Finally it probably goes without saying that I did n’t test this guy exhaustively and I only ran it on XP ( too lazy to boot into my Linux : ) ) .
Anyway , have a play with it if you like , and feel free to suggest improvements and point out issues ( or just say hello in general ) while I start thinking about an indexer .

The plane has been found to have had a number of faults A Yemeni airliner with more than 150 people on board has crashed in the Indian Ocean near the Comoros islands .
Some bodies have been found and a child rescued alive , officials from the carrier , Yemenia , said .
The Airbus 310 flight IY626 was flying from the Yemeni capital Sanaa , but many passengers on the plane began their journey in France .
The cause of the crash is not clear .
A French minister said faults were found on the plane during a check in 2007 .
" The A310 in question was inspected in 2007 by the DGAC [ French transport authorities ] and they noticed a certain number of faults .
Since then the plane had not returned to France , " Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau was quoted as telling French TV .
RECENT AIR CRASHES 1 June : An Air France Airbus plane travelling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappears in the Atlantic with 228 people on board 20 May : An Indonesian army C - 130 Hercules transport plane crashes into a village on eastern Java , killing at least 97 people 12 February : A plane crashes into a house in Buffalo , New York , killing all 49 people on board and one person on the ground
Timeline of air disasters " The company was not on the black list but was subject to stricter checks on our part , and was due to be interviewed shortly by the European Union 's safety committee . "
An EU official told Reuters news agency there were concerns about the airline 's " incomplete reporting procedure and incomplete follow - up " following the 2007 tests but that its record was now improving .
Yemeni Transport Minister Khaled Ibrahim al - Wazeer told Reutersthat the plane had undergone a thorough inspection and conformed to international standards .
See a map of the plane 's route Following the crash , the EU Transport Commissioner Antonio Tajani said he would propose setting up a worldwide blacklist of airlines deemed to be unsafe .
The EU already has its own list .
Second tragedy Reports say the plane was due in the Comoros capital Moroni at about 0230 ( 2230 GMT on Monday ) .
Most of the passengers had travelled to Sanaa from Paris or Marseille on a different aircraft .
The flight on to Moroni , on the island of Njazidja ( Grande Comore ) , was also thought to have made a stop in Djibouti .
There were more than 150 people on board , including three babies and 11 crew .

An airport source told AFP news agency that 66 of the passengers were French , although many are thought to have dual French - Comoran citizenship .
This is the second air tragedy this month involving large numbers of French citizens .
On 1 June an Air France Airbus 330 travelling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris plunged into the Atlantic , killing all 228 people on board .
' Aborted landing ' Gen Bruno de Bourdoncle de Saint - Salvy , French naval commander in the Indian Ocean , said the plane came down about 15 km ( eight nautical miles ) north of the Comoran coast .
A search is under way , with the French military assisting with the operation .
As well as the rescued child , three bodies and some wreckage of the plane have been recovered .
French military are assisting with the search operation " The weather conditions were rough ; strong wind and high seas , " Yemenia official Mohammad al - Sumairi told Reuters news agency .
The three Comoros islands are about 300 km ( 190 miles ) northwest of Madagascar in the Mozambique channel .
A resident near the airport told the BBC about 100 people were trying to get into the airport to find out more information , but without much success .
Relatives also gathered at Paris Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport and Marseille Marignane airport to wait for news , some expressing anger at the state of the airline 's planes .
" They put us aboard wrecks , they put us aboard coffins .
That 's where they put us .

Rack has finally seen its 1.0 release a few weeks ago , introducing some backwards - incompatible changes to its specification and several updates and bug fixes since the last version .
Rack has become an important cornerstone of the Ruby web server and framework landscape .
Before Rack , frameworks and servers had to be adapted to each others interfaces to work together .
With Rack , there 's a minimal API that wraps HTTP requests and responses , making the life of framework , server and application developers much more comfortable .
Rack has been widely adopted by the Ruby community , which reflects in the list of support servers :
Mongrel
EventedMongrel
Swiftiplied Mongrel
WEBrick
FCGI
CGI
SCGI
LiteSpeed
Thin
Ebb
Fuzed
Phusion Passenger ( which is mod_rack for Apache and for nginx )
Unicorn
These frameworks include Rack adapters in their distributions : Camping
Coset
Halcyon
Mack
Maveric
Merb
Racktools :: SimpleApplication
Ramaze
Ruby on Rails
Rum
Sinatra
Sin
Vintage
Waves
Wee
Rack also provides a basis for other software to provide features independently of frameworks , for example Rack : : Cache .
We talked to Christian Neukirchen , the original developer of Rack to find out what he has in mind for Rack 's future .
For the near future , we mostly will be bugfixing with only slight improvements to the specification .
It is important that Rack stays stable and can be relied upon .
Are there other things that can be factored out of frameworks and be put into Rack ?
I try to keep Rack small and focused , libraries and middleware related to special needs are better off as separate projects with their own maintainers and active community .
Also , Rack should not restrict the frameworks in their ways of doing things .
More on Rack can be found on the Rack web site and in the 1.0 release announcement .
' Me and You and Everyone We Know ' is a poetic and penetrating observation of how people struggle to connect with one another in an isolating and contemporary world .
Christine Jesperson is a lonely artist and " Eldercab " driver who uses her fantastical artistic visions to draw her aspirations and objects of desire closer to her .
Richard Swersey , a newly single shoe salesman and father of two boys , is prepared for amazing things to happen .
But when he meets the captivating Christine , he panics .
Life is not so oblique for Richard 's six - year - old Robby , who is having a risqué Internet romance with a stranger , and his fourteen - year - old brother Peter who becomes the guinea pig for neighborhood girls -- practicing for their future of romance and marriage .

I have a few posts in the pipeline ( after long absence ! ) , and had n’t planned to post today , but then I saw it was National Cheesecake Day , so had to share !
This was something I threw together for our 4th of July party – I had fresh blueberries , raspberry jam , and cream cheese left over from another project – so of course this came to mind !
Fourth of July Cheesecake
Adapted from ‘ Raspberry - Almond Cheesecake ’ , in Cheesecake Madness , by John J. Segreto
Crust
1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/2 cup finely chopped mixed nuts
1/4 cup granulated sugar
6 TB ( 3 oz ) sweet butter , softened
Filling
1 1/2 pounds cream cheese , softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/8 tsp salt
1 tsp almond extract
Topping
1 cup raspberry preserves ( I used seedless )
2 cups fresh blueberries
Equipment : 9 - inch springform pan
Crust : Combine all ingredients and blend well with fingers , fork , or pastry blender .
Press or pat the mixture onto the bottom and sides of a well - buttered springform pan .
Chill in fridge or freezer for about 30 minutes .
Filling :
In a large bowl , beat all ingredients until very smooth and creamy .
Pour into chilled pan .
The recipe recommends a water bath ( waterproof the bottom of the springform pan and place it into a larger pan containing 1 ″ hot water ) , but I think this time I just used cake strips .
Bake in preheated 325 F oven for 1.5 hours .
Transfer the cake to a wire rack and allow to cool for 2 hours .
Topping : Spread preserves evenly over top of cake , then decorate with blueberries .
Carefully remove cake from pan and transfer to a serving dish .
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving .
I ’ve had this cookbook for years , and have found many winners in it ( especially the cheesecake base in ‘ Cranberry Cheesecake ’ , page 56 .
Oh my gosh , is that a fantastically light and fluffy cheesecake ) .
I ’ve been meaning to stretch out and try new recipes , so chose this one .
I ’d have to say it ’s more toward the New York end of things ( dense and kind of … dense ) than I prefer .
I like cheesecake light and creamy – almost airy .
Otherwise , who can eat a whole slice ?
This was a little dense and had that almost chalky feel to it that NY style cheesecake gets .
So if that ’s your thing , go for it !
Otherwise , use the cranberry cheesecake recipe 🙂
And yet thousands of Americans are busted for pot each year , even now in 2009 , ironically arrested by cops who ( let 's call this a safe guess ) may have smoked a joint or two themselves in their time .
But let us not give up hope .
We are also creeping , if ever so slowly , toward a more honest and workable approach toward regulating pot .
Case in point :
The Cook County Board on Tuesday , to its credit , voted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana -- 10 grams or less -- in unincorporated areas of Cook County .
The Cook County sheriff 's police , when patrolling those areas , would give first - time offenders a $ 200 ticket rather than charge them with a misdemeanor , which carries a penalty of up to 30 days in jail .
The County Board 's measure , which must be signed by board President Todd Stroger , came out of the blue on Tuesday , and some wary officials -- most notably Sheriff Tom Dart -- said the measure should be suspended until public hearings are held .
But we see no overriding reason to wait .
We urge President Stroger to approve the measure now .
The county measure is essentially a variation of pot decriminalization laws that have been popping up across the country , and reportedly working well .
In Illinois , Sugar Grove , Springfield , Carbondale , Normal and a number of other towns have decriminalized pot , lightening the load of our overburdened court systems and bringing in extra revenue .
Last year , more than 40,000 people were charged under state law with misdemeanor pot possession -- less than 2.5 grams .
Springfield , for example , decriminalized pot in February to alleviate crowding at the Sangamon County Jail , but also to get a greater part of the fines offenders are paying .
In Sangamon County last year , the courts collected $ 46,000 in fines for misdemeanor pot possession .
Sugar Grove in Kane County started issuing tickets for the small pot violations 10 years ago , largely because the return on so much paperwork seemed absurdly small .
" You arrest somebody for murder and it's not as bad , " Sugar Grove Police Chief Brad Sauer said , talking about the hassle of processing a pot arrest .
" And for such small amounts .
It was ridiculous , time - consuming . "
And ultimately , Sauer said , the courts imposed " such little fines . "
Last year , Sugar Grove police wrote six pot tickets .
Decriminalizing first - time and second - time pot possessions , the chief said , also keeps the offense off a young person 's record , which he said he believes is only fair .
" It 's a warning on steroids , " he said , " but if you 're trying to join the military and going for a job , it does n't show up on your record . "
All new laws , admittedly , have unintended consequences , and the Cook County measure is no exception .
It creates another headache for Dart , whose deputies would have to hand out tickets in unincorporated areas , but make arrests for the same offense , according to state law , in incorporated communities patrolled by the sheriff 's office , such as Ford Heights .
How big a burden that would be is questionable .
In all of 2008 , the Cook County sheriff 's police charged only about 150 people with misdemeanor pot possession .
A more troubling unintended consequence , however , is that decriminalizing pot could create an even bigger customer base for pot sellers .
But rather than try to enforce the unenforceable , the solution to that problem might be to decriminalize , regulate and even tax the production and sale of pot .
How far should America go down the path of marijuana decriminalization ?
Incremental experimentation , such as Cook County 's new pot policy , will help us find our way .

Police surveillance of a peaceful campaigner was deemed to be unlawful today in a ruling that liberty campaigners say could change the way officers are allowed to monitor protesters .
The court of appeal ordered the Metropolitan police to destroy photographs its surveillance teams had taken of arms - trade campaigner Andrew Wood , ruling that they breached his rights under the European convention on human rights .
The judgment is a serious blow for the Met , which has faced increasing criticism over the way it polices protests since the G20 demonstrations and the death of newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson .
Wood , a member of the Campaign Against Arms Trade , had been photographed by a Met surveillance unit in 2005 as he left a meeting in London .
His initial claim that the police action had breached his rights was dismissed by the high court in May last year .
But today at the court of appeal in London two out of three judges agreed there had been a " disproportionate interference in the human right to privacy " .
Lord Justice Dyson said : " The retention by the police of photographs taken of persons who have not committed an offence , and who are not even suspected of having committed an offence , is always a serious matter . "
Lord Collins said : " There was a very substantial police presence … when I first read the papers on this appeal , I was struck by the chilling effect on the exercise of lawful rights such a deployment would have . "
The case follows an investigation by the Guardian that revealed police had been targeting thousands of political campaigners in surveillance operations and storing their details on a database for at least seven years .
Human rights groups said the decision could have implications for future use of photography by the police , a tactic which they said was being used more frequently , particularly when policing protests .
Wood , who was a media co-ordinator for Caat at the time the photographs were taken , said : " The Human Rights
Act is part of the essential checks and balances which help to ensure that we can properly participate in a democratic society without repressive state intervention .
It would be a blow for liberty and democracy if , as some have suggested , it were to be abolished . "
The photographs were taken in April 2005 as Wood emerged from London 's Millennium hotel where he had attended the annual general meeting of Reed Elsevier plc , parent company of Spearhead Exhibitions which runs trade fairs for the arms industry .
He had gained access to the meeting by lawfully purchasing a share in the company .
Wood has no criminal convictions and has never been arrested as a result of any campaigning activities .
Alain Robert , known as ' French Spiderman ' always insists on the best possible view and is happy to scale some of the world 's most teetering skyscrapers to secure it .
One of his latest visits was at the 185 metre - high Abu Dhabi Investment Authority Building and , opting for the al fresco route , scuttled up the 35 storeys in a record 63 minutes , as tens of thousands of spectators craned their necks far below .
He has also been in Hong Kong , Madrid and many other buildings around the world .
General Motors was proud to sponsor a " Gay Day at the Movies " screening of " Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen " last month in Los Angeles , but apparently they 're not proud of a popular " Bumble Bee Boys in Briefs " promotional video that remained on YouTube .
USA Today reports that General Motors asked YouTube to pull the video and quotes a spokesman as saying the video " was not appropriate and not in good taste .
"
The video features two " go - go boys " wearing yellow underwear with CAMARO stitched on the back washing a Chevy Camaro .
The automaker did n't pay for the ad , but Chevy did supply the Camaro .
GM earlier this year released a limited edition Bumblebee Camaro , which is featured prominently in the latest " Transformers " movie .

LOUIS  Commissioner Bud Selig , mystified by the fan support Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Manny Ramirez received during his drug suspension , wants the punishment to be stiffer .
Ramirez drew sellout crowds in five minor league games before returning July 3 to the Dodgers .
Selig would like to prevent players from playing on rehabilitation assignments before the 50 - game ban expires .
" I believe that ( rule ) should be changed , " Selig said Tuesday in a question - and - answer session with the Baseball Writers ' Association of America .
" Their logic was OK — guys get hurt , they can go out on rehab , and so and so forth .
ROSE REINSTATEMENT : Selig still reviewing Pete Rose application
" But I think that 's something we need to really change in the next labor negotiation . "
Rob Manfred , Major League Baseball 's executive vice president of labor relations , said baseball will not ask the players union for the rule to be modified before the labor agreement expires in December 2011 .
Union general counsel Michael Weiner said he still wants to permit players to have a rehab assignment so they are ready to play when the suspension ends .
" A player suspended for 50 games should be able to return to play after the 50 games are served , " he said .
Said Selig , " It ( should be ) 50 games and then go do what you got to do . "
Although Ramirez has denied using steroids , he was suspended for violating baseball 's drug policy .
The substance that prompted the ban has since been reported as hCG , a female fertility drug popular with steroid users to mitigate the side effects .
But Ramirez was treated by an outpouring of support when he returned .
" I think it surprises a lot of people , the positiveness of it , " Selig said .
" But you always get back to fans :
They want their team to win .
And this player has now been disciplined .
He 's back .
They 're in first place .
He can help them win .
And I think that 's what you 're seeing there . "
Our friends at Popped Culture have put together the ultimate collection of Last Supper Images , including over 100 versions of the famous painting .
Apparently artists on the internet have taken to customizing the Last Supper with their own favorite characters .
The practice has even expanded to television shows , using the image both on screen , and in advertising .
Popped Culture has collected them all , and documented each of the characters that you see depicted .
“ Leonardo da Vinci ’s 15th century depiction of Jesus announcing that one of his 12 disciples would betray him is so ingrained in our culture that it has been co-opted by those wishing to give weight to their parodies , tributes and caricatures . ”
We have selected some of our favorites to share with you here , but make sure you check out their entire collection .
The guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain is docked at a port in Inchon , 40 km ( 25 miles ) west of Seoul , in this March 19 , 2004 file photo .
REUTERS / You Sung-Ho
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Chinese submarine accidentally collided with an underwater sonar array being towed by a U.S. military ship , CNN reported on Friday , quoting an unnamed military official .
The incident occurred on Thursday near Subic Bay off the coast of the Philippines , according to the CNN report .
The destroyer USS John S. McCain was towing the array , deployed to track underwater sounds .
“ The John S. McCain did have a problem with its towed array sonar .
It was damaged ” on Thursday in Subic Bay , a Pentagon spokesman told Reuters in a telephone interview .
The spokesman , who asked not to be identified , would not confirm other details of the CNN report , including whether the array collided with a Chinese submarine .
He said the U.S. destroyer was not damaged and was not hit by another vessel .
The U.S. Navy does not view the incident as a deliberate move by Beijing to harass military ships operating in the region , CNN reported .
[ Bhautik ] is on version 2 of his tilt - shift lens , and wrote in to share what he has learned .
Some aspects of the design on version 1 made it a bit quirky to use .
You had to hold the lens in place , manually adjusting the focus .
This meant that no two shots were the same .
Since [ Bhautik ] wanted to do time lapse with it , he needed to re design it .
He kept it simple and cheap , around $ 22 total .
Version two takes a lot longer to setup for the shot , but the result is reproducible .
This means he can make his tilt - shift time lapse videos .
A vast swath of the coastal lands around New Orleans will be underwater by the dawn of the next century because the rate of sediment deposit in the Mississippi delta can not keep up with rising sea levels , according to a study published today .
Between 10,000 and 13,500 square kilometres of coastal lands will drown due to rising sea levels and subsidence by 2100 , a far greater loss than previous estimates .
For New Orleans , and other low - lying areas of Louisiana whose vulnerability was exposed by hurricane Katrina , the findings could bring some hard choices about how to defend the coast against the future sea level rises that will be produced by climate change .
They also revive the debate about the long - term sustainability of New Orleans and other low - lying areas .
Scientists say New Orleans and the barrier islands to the south will be severely affected by climate change by the end of this century , with sea level rise and growing intensity of hurricanes .
Much of the land mass of the barrier island chain sheltering New Orleans was lost in the 2005 storm .
But the extent of the land that will be lost is far greater than earlier forecasts suggest , said Dr Michael Blum and Prof Harry Roberts , the authors of the study .
" When you look at the numbers you come to the conclusion that the resources are just not there to restore all the coast , and that is one of the major points of this paper , " said Roberts , a professor emeritus of marine geology at Louisiana State University .
Blum , who was formerly at Louisiana State University , now works at Exxon .
" I think every geologist that has worked on this problem realises the future does not look very bright unless we can come up with some innovative ways to get that sediment in the right spot , " said Roberts .
" For managers and people who are squarely in the restoration business , this is going to force them to make some very hard decisions about which areas to save and which areas you can't save . "
Efforts to keep pace with the accelerated rate of sea level rise due to global warming are compromised by the Mississippi 's declining ability to bear sediments downstream into the delta .
The authors used sediment data from the Mississippi flood plain to estimate the amount of sediment deposited on the river delta during the past 12,000 years .
They then compared this with sediment deposition today .
In paper published in Nature Geoscience they calculate that due to dam and levee building on the Mississippi the sediment carried by the river has been reduced significantly .
There are now about 8,000 dams on the Mississippi river system .
Roberts said such constructions and the system of levees in Louisiana had cut in half the sediment carried down to the delta , inhibiting the river 's ability to compensate for the land lost to rising seas .
Sustaining the existing delta size would require 18 to 24bn tonnes of sediment , which the authors say is significantly more than can be drawn from the river in its current state .
" We conclude that significant drowning is inevitable , " the authors wrote .
" In the absence of sediment input , land surfaces that are now below 1 m in elevation will be converted to open water or marsh . "
IT'S QUITE refreshing to wake up in London to Australia making headlines on BBC News .
But if the country is coming under attack for being racist , for not one but three separate incidents in a matter of a week , it 's quite something else .
First it was the " chk- chk - boom " girl , Clare Werbeloff , whose fake account to Channel Nine of witnessing a shooting in Sydney became an international sensation .
Promptly uploaded on Youtube , the video at last count has had more than 700,000 viewings .
Three things stay in your mind long after you 've watched the video and had your laugh .
First , Clare 's pretty .
Second , Clare 's funny .
Third , Clare 's racist .
" Wog " may be a socially acceptable way of addressing members of a certain community in Australia ( as one of my Sydney - based Italian friends tells me , " It 's OK , I would often tell my Italian mate at uni , ' Do n't be such a wog ' " ) , but on this side of the pond , where words like " Paki " , " Paddy " and " wop " are almost defunct , the utterance of " wog " in public , let alone on national television , is seen as a racist slur .
Next up was Sol Trujillo 's parting swipe , describing living in Australia as " stepping back in time " .
Being an Indian national , I would n't particularly take offence , let alone racist offence , to Kevin Rudd greeting me with his hands folded into a namaste , but Trujillo chose to cite Rudd's " adios " as inappropriately racist .
The final nail was , of course , the Indian student being bashed on a Melbourne train .
Word spreads and at quite a pace when it includes " Australia " and " racist " mentioned in the same sentence .
Even before I could discover the news for myself as part of my ritual virtual news surfing , I had an email from a friend in London .
All it contained were links to two news websites reporting the incident and two words : " Be careful . "
When Sean Carroll was a graduate student at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston , he found himself seduced by spectacular new studies of the humble fruit fly .
That work , which eventually won a Nobel Prize for its principals , showed that modifying a single gene during a fly ’s embryonic development could transform the insect ’s body plan : Instead of becoming an antenna , a body extension could develop into a leg .
Carroll continued to study these genes and , some years later , found that they were not restricted to fruit flies ; they turned out to be part of a master tool kit that sculpts the body structures of all animals , ranging from humans to nematode worms .
The discovery of this small set of universal body - building genes gave Carroll and others a fresh way to explore the inner workings of evolution .
By observing how the genes changed during the course of embryonic development , scientists could track the emergence of a novel physical trait , the first step toward the creation of a new species .
For the first time , researchers had direct access to the machinery of evolution and could actually watch it in the act .
A new science , known as evolutionary developmental biology , or evo devo , was born .
One of the great triumphs of modern evolutionary science , evo devo addresses many of the key questions that were unanswerable when Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 , and Carroll has become a leader in this nascent field .
Now a professor of molecular biology and genetics at the University of Wisconsin , he continues to decode the genes that control life ’s physical forms and to explore how mutations in those genes drive evolutionary change .
These days , Carroll also devotes increasing energy to telling the public about his field ’s remarkable discoveries through a series of books —
Endless Forms Most Beautiful , The Making of the Fittest , and the brand - new Remarkable Creatures .
He spoke with DISCOVER senior editor Pamela Weintraub about what his work has taught him about Darwin , the nature of evolution , and how life really works .
It has been 150 years since Charles Darwin proposed his theory of evolution in On the Origin of Species , yet in some ways the concept of evolution seems more controversial than ever today .
Why do you think that is ?
It is a cultural issue , not a scientific one .
On the science side our confidence grows yearly because we see independent lines of evidence converge .
What we ’ve learned from the fossil record is confirmed by the DNA record and confirmed again by embryology .
But people have been raised to disbelieve evolution and to hold other ideas more precious than this knowledge .
At the same time , we routinely rely on DNA to convict and exonerate criminals .
We rely on DNA science for things like paternity .
We rely on DNA science in the clinic to weigh our disease risks or maybe even to look at prognoses for things like cancer .
DNA science surrounds us , but in this one realm we seem unwilling to accept its facts .
Juries are willing to put people to death based upon the variations in DNA , but they ’re not willing to understand the mechanism that creates that variation and shapes what makes humans different from other things .
It ’s a blindness .
I think this is a phase that we ’ll eventually get through .
Other countries have come to peace with DNA .
I do n’t know how many decades or centuries it ’s going to take us .
In your new book , Remarkable Creatures , you relate how Darwin arrived at his theory of evolution .
Can you connect the dots ?
As a college student Darwin collected beetles .
He was looking for more opportunities to collect when there came this opportunity to be a naturalist on the British ship the HMS Beagle .
It was seductive .
He could go to faraway places — visit the tropics , places of incredible richness of life relative to cold , damp , gray England .
It was difficult to persuade his father to allow him to go — he was just 22 — but he got the chance .
Two stops in this five - year journey were pivotal .
The first came early in the voyage when he arrived on the coast of Argentina and unearthed fossils of many species , including some unknown to science — for instance , fossils of giant , extinct sloths that had been enormous compared with the living sloths he saw in the South American forests .
So it planted the seed in his mind that life had changed .
Then Darwin got to the Galápagos Islands .
He went from island to island collecting birds — mockingbirds and then finches — and realized that even when the birds appeared to be similar , on each island they were slightly different .
After he left the Galápagos , on his way home to England , the lightbulb went on .
He realized that if these birds lived on such similar islands but were slightly different from one another , there could be just one explanation :
They had started out as a single species , but over time and with separation they had drifted apart and changed .
This insight was widely regarded as heresy , but why ?
The prevailing idea was called special creation : that every species was created by a supernatural power and put in place on the earth for a specified role in a specified time by a completely mysterious process .
It was n’t open to natural science .
Instead , Darwin said no , species are changeable , and the introduction of new species is a completely natural process that follows natural laws just the way physics does .
A fundamental aspect of human existence has been to ask how we got here .
Evolution is the big answer to that big question .
Obviously there are alternative answers that have prevailed for a very long time , but evolution has replaced a supernatural explanation of human origins with a naturalistic one .
Is that why Darwin waited more than 20 years to publish his theory of evolution ?
Darwin was a pretty insecure 22 - year - old when he boarded the ship .
As these thoughts started to occur to him by the time he was about 27 , he was just getting his feet under himself back in England .
He realized what these thoughts meant , but he was just being accepted into scientific circles , just getting a lot of attaboys .
Why risk that ?
This was not a time to challenge the establishment .
You have to look at Darwin the human being to understand why he would not spill the beans .
What piqued your own interest in evolution ?
As a kid , I was fascinated by zebras and giraffes and leopards .
I kept snakes , and I loved their color patterns .
As I got older I asked deeper questions — mainly , how are pattern and form generated ?
One of the most spectacular pageants on earth involves a complex creature developing from a single fertilized egg .
Anyone who ’s a parent is still amazed that it works .
When I was a graduate student , we could watch this happen , but we did n’t understand the mechanics .
What was going on inside that would put limbs in the right place , put eyes in the right place , carve the circulatory system and the backbone ?
It was an irresistible mystery , made even more irresistible with the realization that what makes a snake different from a lizard , what makes a zebra different from a giraffe , are changes within that developmental process .
Understanding development was a passport to two fundamental questions :
How does a complex creature form from an egg , and how have different types of creatures evolved ?

These seem like two very disparate ideas : the embryonic development of a single specimen and the evolution of a whole species .
How did they get connected ?
At first paleontologists were studying evolution on vast timescales through fossils .
Then geneticists came on the scene , and they were studying small - scale differences within species based on mutations in genes .
What has been called the modern synthesis of the two fields emerged in the 1940s with the idea that the sorts of genetic differences you could observe in populations , right out your window , when compounded and extrapolated over vast periods of time , could account for the large - scale changes we see in the fossil record .
So the modern synthesis was a harmonization of those two scales .
But the modern synthesis did not explain evolution in full .
It was still just a theory .
Where was the empirical evidence ?
Darwin ’s theory of descent was a black box .
You could not see exactly what kinds of changes were taking place to account for the differences in forms .
But the study of embryonic development has allowed us to peer into the machinery of making these creatures .
We can study their DNA text and their developing embryos and ask , where do the differences arise ?
That gave us the empirical data for the theory .
You ca n’t necessarily see the change happening in the adult , but you can see that if you change that nucleic acid base right there in that gene , at that particular point in embryonic development , that animal is darker .
If you change those three bases over there , that limb is longer .
This is the fundamental basis of evolution : changes in DNA .
By experimenting with it and visualizing it all the way up the ladder of differences , we now understand that the modern synthesis is correct .
You ’ve said evolution is like compounding interest .
How so ?
Just like a good money market account , evolution works through incremental change .
If variants within a species provide an advantage , no matter how slight , then that form , that capacity , will be favored .
If evolving spots on wings makes you more attractive to mates or more evasive to predators , those patterns will dominate .
Those varieties will have more offspring .
Added up over centuries , millennia , and longer periods of time , natural selection — the competition that takes place in nature between variant forms — is powerful enough to forge all the changes that we ’ve seen on the face of the earth .
It is hard for most people to wrap their brains around such vast stretches of time .
A century ago , Teddy Roosevelt was president and cars were barely in use .
That seems like an unimaginable amount of time ago , but biologically and geologically speaking , it was a split second .
A million years is just a fraction of the time that upright hominids have had to evolve .
It takes time for sea levels to rise , for rivers to cut their course .
As temperatures change , as rain forests grow up or deserts emerge , the creatures that live in these regions are adapting and changing too .
You call the combination of evolution and embryonic development evo devo .
What is that , exactly ?
It is just shorthand for “ evolutionary developmental biology , ” a mini-syllabic description of this field that ’s concerned with the evolution of development .
It ’s related probably to Devo , the new - wave band of the early 1980s — those were the guys who played with dog dishes on their heads .
Before then you could describe evolution as change over time , but we did not have any grip on that process until the 1980s .
And that ’s when you entered the scene ?
Right .
I was in graduate school doing research in immunology at Tufts University in Boston .
I would just hop on the subway and go to seminars at three or four different schools .
It ’s stimulation , right ?
It ’s hard to know how all the dots got connected , but I kept hearing that things were not well understood in evolution and things were not well understood in development , and I started thinking :
How can I get at the meat ?
I was looking around for insights when I came across the very thin literature on the genes that sculpt fruit fly bodies , including the study of spectacular mutants .
In these mutants , or Frankenflies , a single gene could put legs on the head in place of antennae .
Other single - gene mutations gave the flies an extra set of wings or removed its eyes or wings completely .
The fact that single - gene mutations could have such dramatic effects raised the question :
What were these genes , and what were they meant to do ?
The quest was to figure out how these genes sculpted the fruit fly body form .
You saw the fruit fly as a window into evolution and development .
How did you make the connection ?
It was not an obvious call , because the expectation was that fruit flies did n’t have anything to do with the development of furry creatures .
But in 1983 I found a laboratory where I could do the work , with Matt Scott at the University of Colorado at Boulder .
Just as we were getting started , it became clear from our research and others ’ that these body - building genes were not restricted to fruit flies ; they were shared throughout the animal kingdom .
It was a real jolt .
All of a sudden we could do deep experiments at the most fundamental level to understand how form actually evolved .
So scientists were seeing the same master genes at work in many different species ?
Yes .
One shocking discovery was the relationship between our eyes and bug eyes .
You would n’t think they had anything in common , right ?
Bug eyes , with 800 facets , work by different optical principles than human eyes .
For almost a century and a half , biologists thought that they had evolved independently , from scratch , and that eyes had been invented many times in the animal kingdom by completely different means — different recipes in different groups of animals .
We have now discovered that these eyes are formed by what is recognizable as the same gene , even though those animals have been evolving separately for 500 million years .
When we took the mouse version of this gene — the same gene we find in the human — and put it in the fly and tweaked it , we induced fly eye tissue .
Our team showed that the same common gene is critical to building limbs in humans and fruit flies .
It turns out that this gene is critical to building virtually everything that sticks out of the body : antennae , legs , horns , whatever .
These kinds of experiments shattered our preconceptions and forced people to think differently .
Beneath these extremely diverse exteriors was a deeply shared common genetic tool kit .
If I had five minutes with Charles Darwin , I ’d start right there .
It would blow his mind .
Clearly we have entered the age of experimental Darwinism .
What are the experiments like , specifically ?
We look at lots of species to figure out the ancestral form of a particular molecule .
We can reconstruct that ancestral molecule and then retrace the steps that must have taken place to forge the new forms and functions we see today .
If you think that the difference between two species involves changes in certain genes , you can swap those genes between the species .
We ’re doing those experiments trait by trait .
There ’s a powerful set of experiments that people have done on vision .
Lots of animals differ in the parts of the color spectrum that they see best because of how they are tuned to their environments — whether they live in the deep sea or in caves , whether they mostly go out in the day or at night , or whether they ’re trying to pick up ultraviolet patterns on flowers or on prey .
Sight is really important in helping animals live , and since animals live in lots of different habitats , vision has evolved a lot .
Experiments that look at these changes are very doable in the lab .
You can swap genes and change the retinal proteins that detect light .
Then you can make very clear predictions about what certain changes mean and verify those things experimentally .
For example , mice have been given an extra color vision gene in the lab , and it has been shown that the protein manufactured by that gene expands the scope of their vision by enhancing their ability to see longer - wavelength light without any other changes in the brain .
Can we apply these discoveries to the human realm ?
We now know that the human genome and the chimp genome differ by only about 1 percent .
Yet our bodies and brains are so different .
How can we be so different from other primates if our genes are so much the same ?
How did we get the dexterity in our hands ?
How do we walk upright ?
How are we able to hold this conversation ?
How did we get big brains ?
Once you identify the meaningful functional changes that have taken place between us and chimps , you realize that pretty big differences in anatomy and behavior can result from a small degree of genetic divergence .
Evo devo has given us the tools to explore this mystery :
The same genes are being regulated and then used in a different way .
Something is happening a little earlier or in another place or is staying on a little bit longer .
These are the time and space dimensions of development .
It ’s like choreography .
You ’ve got the same dancers , but the ballet is different based on different cues .
In your book Endless Forms Most Beautiful , you refer to the Cambrian explosion , a time when a vast number of new life - forms appeared at nearly the same time .
Evolutionary skeptics often point to this kind of abrupt shift — does n’t such rapid change contradict your description of a single master tool kit and slow evolution over long stretches of time ?
Prior to about 543 million years ago , you saw things like jellyfish and spongelike creatures , but you did n’t see bilateral creatures : worms and trilobites and things like this .
Then in the Cambrian explosion , large and complex animal forms erupted .
These forms in the Cambrian represent a lot of the major divisions of the animal kingdom we see today .
The Cambrian explosion looks abrupt in the fossil record , but the surprising message from evo devo is that all the genes for building big , complex animal bodies long predated the appearance of those bodies .
Most of what was needed to create this incredible complexity already existed .
The genes were expressed prior to the Cambrian in those more modest , soft - bodied creatures , but they had fewer jobs to do .
Complexity evolved by expanding the uses of these genes rather than inventing lots more of them .
It makes you wonder what kind of potential is just waiting to burst out today .
Dinosaurs were the dominant vertebrates right up until the end of the Cretaceous .
Mammals existed , but they were smaller , carving lifestyles out of the dinosaurs ’ way .
Take out the dinosaurs and in 10 or 15 million years mammals had evolved into all sorts of large forms and dominated terrestrial ecosystems .
When genetic potential met ecological opportunity , you got elephants and bison and giraffes .
Think about ecology as corking the bottle ; take the cork out and things explode .
You mention in your book The Making of the Fittestthat every species contains fossil genes .
These are remnants that are no longer used , and the integrity of the genetic text starts to erode .
One of my favorite stories concerns the ice fish of Bouvet Island .
These creatures live in the cold waters of the Antarctic .
They are the only vertebrates without red blood cells to carry oxygen to nourish their tissues .
If you look at the genes for hemoglobin , the oxygen - carrying proteins in red blood , one of those genes is completely gone and another is a broken remnant , rotting away .
From this we understand that the ancestors of these fish had red blood , but these guys have left that red- blooded lifestyle behind .
The explanation is ecological .
The ice fish are living in this extremely cold water , and it may well be that red blood cells are really hard to pump around capillaries in such cold water .
Instead , the fish have larger gills and pretty much a scaleless skin .
So they ’re just getting their oxygen passively from the surrounding ocean water .
They ’ve abandoned a way of life that has nourished vertebrates for some 500 million years .
As for us , humans have junked about 800 genes in the course of our evolution from mammalian and earlier ancestors going back millions of years .
Who knows , those lost genes might be useful to us 1,000 years from now , but there ’s no way to preserve them .
I guess we could always try to engineer some things back in .
By contrast , you ’ve said that some genes are immortal .
These genes date back to the early origin of life on the planet , and they ’re so essential that their text has been preserved for more than 3 billion years .
They ’re involved in very fundamental ways with the decoding of the genetic machinery shared among all organisms .
Without these genes you could n’t express your genetic information and produce the proteins you need to live .
You ’ve presented an avalanche of irrefutable evidence , yet opponents of evolution seem to refute it all .
How do you respond ?
You can hear me almost chuckling , because it ’s not reasonable , it ’s not rational , and as the years click by , it ’s ever more preposterous , but people still stick to their guns .
Is there anything we can do to help persuade the skeptical public to accept the evolutionary way of looking at life ?
Seriously , teach evolution as a core theme in science from the early grades .
The universe changes , the earth changes , and life changes with the evolving earth .
Where do you see evolutionary biology going next ?
Today we ’re in a second golden age .
We ’re not collecting the menagerie of critters that Darwin did or hauling them back to a museum .
Instead , we ’re collecting the genetic recipes of creatures across the planet and trying to figure out how they came to be .
We ’re looking right into the text of evolution , and even into the text of extinct creatures like woolly mammoths and Neanderthals , and we ’re asking what made them similar to or different from elephants or from us .
A third golden age will come when we understand life beyond earth .
How many times has life evolved , and how many origins have there been ?
Has life moved from planet to planet ?
Is the chemistry of extraterrestrial life different from that of life on earth ?
This will be difficult work , but we have to look ahead .
Finding life elsewhere in the universe would bring a scientific revolution as big as any we ’ve ever had .

Dear organized far - right :
by Jeremy Hooper
Can you all please stop acting like today was some sort of miraculous " win " for your side ?
Because for you all , there was nothing at all to win -- only something to lose .
And while we 'll fully admit that you did n't lose , your takeaway winnings from today 's CA court decision are less than that of a ghost who plays blackjack in a mirage casino with Monopoly money .
The only team with anything to gain via today 's decision was the pro-equality side , and it unfortunately was n't meant to be .
But our loss does nothing to less the cruel , indelible stain of discrimination that you all have willingly placed upon your good name .
You already stripped away our marriage right in November .
You already forced an $ 80 million dollar fight upon California .
You already secured your place in the annals of unfortunate civil rights history .
You stuck your knives out there , and you chopped off the necks of those who chose to stick up for basic fairness .
Your side lost .
Already .
Ultimately .
Irreversibly .
We know that after the worst April of your organized existence , you all are eager to mine victory out of even the most stubborn of stones .
But those of us who were unable to marry in California on 5/25 , and who are still unable to marry in California on 5 /26 , know that today 's ruling does n't advance the anti-gay cause even one iota .
Your biased cause is only capable of traveling in reverse , and your only hope for victory is if / when you choose to hop off the regressive boomerang and instead come aboard equality 's indefatigable train .
Love ,
Is What You Denied To Us ( and by ' Us ' we mean humanity as a whole )
Your thoughts
I 'm waiting for the day ... when all of those who have said , " the people have spoken " have to come to the realization , that they are now in the minority .
And that new voice they hear that is speaking about equal rights for everyone is the new majority .
It may take a few years for it to happen .
But , happen it will .
Keep fighting !

Well said .
I , personally , am going to remember the names of everyone on their side who prolonged this pointless , draining mess , from Frank Schubert to Maggie Gallagher , from Brian Brown to Peter LaBarbera .
These will be names synonymous with institutionalized bigotry in the future .

EXPENSIVE surgery to repair worn - out joints could become a thing of the past as Welsh experts have made a discovery that could transform the treatment of arthritic conditions .
Professors John Fairclough and Charlie Archer have shown for the first time that the knee has the ability to heal itself .
And they believe that the knee could be capable of re-growing any damaged part of its surface .
The breakthrough could eventually mean that patients do not need to undergo major surgery to have their knees resurfaced or replaced with artificial joints .
Instead the knee could be encouraged to heal itself internally with some help from orthopaedic experts .
Prof Fairclough , based at the University of Wales Institute Cardiff ’s school of sport , said : “ As we all know , growing old is not easy – the athletic body of our youth transforms , no longer able to tolerate the vigorous exercise of our early years .
“ We get stiffer , we slow down we begin to ache .
For many our joints begin to become painful and start to first reduce our ability to exercise easily and then cause pain and limit function .
“ Each year in the UK there are more than five million consultations related to knee pain and the Holy Grail for all medical and sports participants is to be able to measure joint wear and to stop its progression and as a goal re-grow any damaged part of the joint surface . ”
Damage to knees is caused when the surface of the joint wears away , and bone rubs on bone .
It was always assumed that once the joint surface had worn away , it could not be replaced naturally by the body .
But the research , conducted at Uwic and at Cardiff University , found that the bone , instead of being completely dead , still contained living pieces of cartilage .
Prof Fairclough , who is also a consultant orthopaedic knee and sports surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff , said : “ Through a combination of work at Uwic and Cardiff University , we have discovered these cells can regrow the surface that was lost .
“ We now know that it is possible that joints which are wearing away have the potential to recover .
This is the first time that we have shown that a knee can do this . ”
But instead of growing these cells in a laboratory and implanting them back into the knee , it is thought that the joint will be able to re-heal itself , provided that the bones and muscles are properly aligned .
“ We have been able to look at the muscles and have shown that the problems seem to start with the way that the bones are angled .
“ The object of the research that myself and Prof Archer are undertaking is to show that these cells can regrow if we can alter the environment in the knee .
“ We are now aware how important the muscles and the bone angles are in the wearing process of the knee ; hopefully we can now show that we can resurface the knee by altering the angle of the bone .
“ In the future we should be seeing people early enough so we can unlock the potential of their knee to repair itself , by doing something to alter the biomechanics of the joint . ”
England rugby star Jonny Wilkinson , whose career has been plagued by injuries , has been seen by Prof Fairclough and his team in Cardiff recently to have his damaged knee realigned .
Prof Fairclough , who also works at the Spire Hospital in Cardiff , said the number 10 is recovering .
Here are some recent examples of the stupid , suspicious society we are creating .
What they reveal is a state of mind that reveres regulations and authority over common sense .
This is not something that has been imposed on Britain .
Rather we have succumbed to a climate of fear and unreason in the belief that we will somehow be safer .
Read these links and mourn the loss of something essential to the national character .

Why are n't birds larger ?
Fifteen - kilogram swans hold the current upper size record for flying birds , although the extinct Argentavis of the Miocene Epoch in Argentina is estimated to have weighed 70 kilograms , the size of an average human .
In a forthcoming article in PLoS Biology , Sievert Rohwer , and his colleagues at the Burke Museum at the University of Washington , provide evidence that maximum body size in birds is constrained by the amount of time it takes to replace the flight feathers during molt .
As bird size increases , feather growth rate fails to keep up with feather length until , eventually ; feathers wear out before they can be replaced .
This fundamental relationship requires basic changes in the molt strategy as size increases , ultimately limiting the size of flying birds .
Feathers deteriorate with continued exposure to ultra-violet light and bacterial decomposition , and must be replaced periodically to maintain adequate aerodynamic support for flight .
Small birds accomplish this in an annual or twice - annual molt , during which the 9 or 10 primary flight feathers are replaced sequentially , taking about three weeks for each feather .
Large species of birds need different approaches to feather replacement .
These involve several alternative strategies : prolonging the total molt to two or even three years ; simultaneously replacing multiple feathers from different molt - origination points in the feather sequence ; and , in species that do not require flight to feed or escape enemies ( ducks and geese , for example ) , replacing all feathers simultaneously .
With increasing body size , the length of the primary feathers increases as the one - third power of mass , approximately doubling with each 10 - fold increase in mass .
However , the rate of feather growth increases only as the one - sixth power of mass , meaning that the time required to replace each feather increases by a factor of about 1.5 for each 10 - fold increase in mass , until 56 days are required to replace a single flight feather in a 10 - kg bird .
The cause of this discrepancy is not known , but the authors speculate that it probably depends on the geometry of producing a two - dimensional feather structure from a one - dimensional growing zone in the feather shaft .
The avian feather is one of the most striking adaptations in the animal world , and yet its growth dynamics are poorly understood .
It might be possible to achieve more rapid feather growth with a larger growth zone , but this could also weaken the structure of the growing feather , resulting in frequent breakage in large birds .
Understanding the engineering complexities of the growing feather will require further study of the dynamics and structure of the growing zone .
And what about Argentavis ?
The authors speculate that this giant bird most likely molted all its feathers simultaneously during a long fast , fueled by accumulated fat deposits much in the same way as emperor penguins do today .

There are thousands of sites out there offering tips and tricks for using CSS .
But how do you know where that information is coming from ?
Who says the people writing these “ tips ” know what they ’re talking about ?
For all you know , it could be someone who has not clue what CSS even stands for , let alone how to use it effectively .
But that ’s not the case with the experts below .
They ’re all well - known for their mastery of CSS and all that goes along with it .
Read on for their tips and tricks with regards to everything from avoiding hacks to understanding the box model .
As web design has progressed , the endlessly nested table has transformed into the endlessly complicated CSS hack .
In many cases , CSS hacks solve one bug by exploiting another one ; not exactly the most stable way to fix something .
When the next version of the browser is released , it might fix neither or both bugs , or it might fix one but not the other .
In any case , it ’s likely your hack might end up not working , or not being necessary any longer .
To keep your style sheets as short and condensed as possible , avoid repeating yourself by only specifying the minimum number of selectors .
In other words , do you really need to specify UL and LI ?
Why not just specify the UL ?
The same goes for other elements likely to be nested .
Just specify the upper - most level and leave the rest to inherit those styles .
Creating an elastic layout that do n’t specify a maximum width in anything other than em units is a quick way to make a very uncomfortable site .
As your visitors increase the text size , your layout gets wider .
But what happens when they increase the size by more than one or two em units ?
Your layout just gets wider and wider and pretty soon they have to scroll horizontally in order to read an entire line .
Specify a maximum width to avoid that problem and make your site more user - friendly .
By setting your base font size at 62.5 % , you end up with a font size of 10 pixels .
This makes 1 em equal to 10 pixels .
1.2 em is then equal to 12 pixels .
It simplifies font sizing in all of your selectors thereafter .
/>
Using negative margins can greatly simplify your code .
Instead of specifying positive margins for a dozen or more elements , why not just specify a negative margin for one ?
It makes your style sheets shorter and less complex .
When transitioning from table - based layouts , many designers are tempted to add in an abundance of container elements .
But CSS is n’t the same as tables .
Thinking through your design ahead of time is one way to avoid this , as is focusing on the information first .
Try to only use divs and spans for content elements that share a common purpose or classification and are repeated across multiple pages .
Forget about creating separate printer - friendly pages for your content .
Use CSS to create media - specific styles for your documents instead .
Printer - friendly style sheets are easy to create and avoid problems designers used to encounter regarding the regular version and printer - friendly version being slightly different from each other .
After all , with this method you ’re not touching the page markup at all .
For people just starting out with CSS , centering an entire website can sometimes seem like an impossibility .
But it ’s definitely possible and actually relatively easy to achieve .
With more and more people browsing the web primarily through mobile devices , it ’s important to make sure your website is optimized for those visitors .
While most handhelds will render pages reasonably well using standard CSS , it ’s still not the best user experience on a 3 ″ screen .
Create a separate mobile style sheet to optimize the experience for mobile users .
There are four different values available for the CSS overflow property : hidden , visible , scroll , and auto .
By understanding what each of these does and how each behaves , you open up a lot more options for your site ’s layout .
The idea of creating a fluid grid design , especially with CSS , is likely to send shivers down the spines of many web designers .
But it is possible , and is definitely preferable to creating them with tables .
Using shorthand is another way to simplify and shorten your stylesheets .
Instead of declaring separate styles for each margin ( margin - left , margin - right , margin - top , margin - bottom ) , just declare them for all four at one time .
The same goes for other elements , such as font , border , or background .
Everything element in CSS is a rectangular box .
Padding , margins , height , width and borders all interact with these rectangular boxes .
Gaining a real understanding of how these things interact will make life as a designer infinitely easier .
It ’s tempting when you want to hide an element on your page to use “ display : none . ”
The problem with this , though , is that this particular declaration means that the contents within that element are completely hidden — they are n’t printed , displayed , or spoken .
This can cause issues for those using screen readers as opposed to viewing your website .
It can also cause issues when you ’re going to hide something until a user performs a certain action ( most likely with JavaScript ) .
Strict mode and quirks mode apply to the two different ways modern browsers use to interpret CSS .
By understanding what each one does and then implementing the correct one for your design , you can greatly improve your site ’s functionality .

While still good , President Barack Obama 's political health is deteriorating , threatened by what he thought would be balm -- his ambitious plan for a government takeover of health care .
Mr. Obama remains slightly more popular than most presidents have been in their opening months .
But his job approval rating has drifted down to 60 % in the RealClearPolitics.com average .
His disapproval numbers have nearly doubled to 33 % .
More troubling to Team Obama is the growing gap between the president 's approval rating and declining support for major items on his policy agenda .
Independents are increasingly joining Republicans in opposition to administration initiatives that range from reviving the economy to closing the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo .
Things will likely get worse in the coming months as the congressional stage comes to be dominated by health care .
A new poll by Resurgent Republic ( a nonprofit , right - of - center education organization whose creation I helped spur ) , reveals some of the president 's challenges .
By a 60 % - to - 31 % margin , Americans prefer getting their health coverage through private insurance rather than the federal government .
Mr. Obama 's record - setting spending binge has also made Americans more sensitive to deficits and higher taxes .
Thirty - nine percent said they supported " a health - care plan that raises taxes in order to provide health insurance to all Americans , " while 52 % preferred " a plan that does not provide health insurance to all Americans but keeps taxes at current levels . "
By a 58 % - to - 37 % margin , American prefer reforming health care " without raising taxes or increasing the deficit " to government investing " new resources to make sure it is done right . "
Yes , really …
This is very odd and brilliant …
Is The Prada Transformer an art exhibit , a fashion show stage or a movie theater ?
Yes , yes and yes , we think .
In Seoul Korea , designed by Koolhaas in collaboration with the Prada fashion house , the Prada Transformer has four sides , each with a different shape : a hexagon , a cross , a rectangle and a circle .
Costing over 10 million dollars ( what recession , right ? ) , it is currently the home for a Film Festival .
A pavilion , called Prada Transformer , designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas for Italy 's fashion house Prada , is seen on the ground of the 16th - century Gyeonghui royal palace in Seoul , South Korea , Friday , June 26 , 2009 .
The two - week film festival curated by Oscar - nominated movie director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu opened Saturday with a South Korean spaghetti western inside the Prada Transformer .
The Prada Transformer has four different shapes - a hexagon , cross , rectangle and circle - and , with the help of construction cranes , could change its facade by lifting or rotating its structures depending on projects like fashion , art and film events .
( AP Photo / Lee Jin-man )
After opening in April with a fashion show on the hexagon , four cranes swooped down on the 180 tons ( 160 metric tons ) of steel earlier this month , taking 30 minutes to lift the Transformer and turn it onto a new side : the rectangle .
The Prada structure will be picked up and rotated to create a rectangle that will show movies from June 26 to July 12 selected by the Mexican film director Alejandro González Iñárritu .
Art will then be shown when the structure is rotated again to create a floor plan in the form of a cross .
Finally , the Transformer will be picked up once again and rotated to form a circle for a fashion show .
All shows are open to the public and free of charge .

Beer - Sheva , December 28 , 2000 - Scientists at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have shown that an unusual nuclear fuel could speed space vehicles from Earth to Mars in as little as two weeks .
Standard chemical propulsion used in existing spacecraft currently takes from between eight to ten months to make the same trip .
Calculations supporting this conclusion were reported in this month 's issue of Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A ( 455 : 442-451 , 2000 ) by Prof.
Yigal Ronen , of BGU 's Department of Nuclear Engineering and graduate student Eugene Shwagerous .
In the article , the researchers demonstrate that the fairly rare nuclear material americium - 242 m ( Am - 242 m ) can maintain sustained nuclear fission as an extremely thin metallic film , less than a thousandth of a millimeter thick .
In this form , the extremely high - energy , high - temperature fission products can escape the fuel elements and be used for propulsion in space .
Obtaining fission - fragments is not possible with the better - known uranium - 235 and plutonium - 239 nuclear fuels : they require large fuel rods , which absorb fission products .
Ronen became interested in nuclear reactors for space vehicles some 15 years ago at a conference dedicated to this subject .
Speaker - after - speaker stressed that whatever the approach , the mass ( weight ) of the reactor had to be as light as possible for efficient space travel .
At a more recent meeting , Prof. Carlo Rubbia of CERN ( Nobel Laureate in Physics , 1984 ) brought up the novel concept of utilizing the highly energetic fragments produced by nuclear fission to heat a gas ; the extremely high temperatures produced would enable faster interplanetary travel .
To meet the challenge of a light nuclear reactor , Ronen examined one element of reactor design , the nuclear fuel itself .
He found at the time that of the known fission fuels , Am - 242 m is the front - runner , requiring only 1 percent of the mass ( or weight ) of uranium or plutonium to reach its critical state .
The recent study examined various theoretical structures for positioning Am - 242 m metal and control materials for space reactors .
He determined that this fuel could indeed sustain fission in the form of thin films that release high - energy fission products .
Moreover , he showed how these fission products could be used themselves as a propellant , or to heat a gas for propulsion , or to fuel a special generator that produces electricity .
" There are still many hurtles to overcome before americium - 242 m can be used in space , " Ronen says .
" There is the problem of producing the fuel in large enough quantities from plutonium - 241 and americium - 241 , which requires several steps and is expensive .
But the material is already available in fairly small amounts .
In addition , actual reactor design , refueling , heat removal , and safety provisions for manned vehicles have not yet been examined .
" However , I am sure that americium - 242 m will eventually be implemented for space travel , as it is the only proven material whose fission products can be made available for high speed propulsion .
Indeed , Carlo Rubbia has also recognized that this is the most probable fuel that will be getting us to Mars and back .
I think that we are now far enough advanced to interest international space programs in taking a closer look at americium - based space vehicles . "
The following morning I rose early , had breakfast and re-checked my kit ready for the 08.00 leave .
Having met the platoon commander and getting a brief overview of the patrol , we were to move North along a road with one section moving to the West along compounds which have been used for firing points .
We were heading for Green 1 , a junction of both road and canal and a point which I was told Taliban used regularly .
The first twenty mins were the worst .
It is the uncertainty of not knowing when it will happen which plays on your mind .
Almost nothing did happen .
I am sure that as soon as a contact happens , you soon forget about the sickly fear and concentrate on more important things .
We held a mins ' shura [ consultation , meeting ] with three Afghans and moved back to the FOB .
It really is true that they have nothing .
The children are all smiling with beautiful faces .
The men are more guarded and generally stand - offish .
However they are willing to talk which goes against all the briefs I have been given .
Overpopulation .
It is the problem no one wants to talk about , much less tackle , The Dominion Post says .
It is also the problem that lies behind many of the issues that do grab the headlines - global warming , rising pollution levels and food shortages .
The United States census bureau estimated that , as the clock ticked over to 2008 , there were 6,641,114,623 people in the world .
By 2050 it estimates the world population will be 9.4 billion .
The growth rate has been slowing in recent years , but only slightly .
There are ominous signs that the world might be reaching capacity , and even that it has gone beyond what is sustainable .
Last month the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation called for immediate help for poor countries hit by spiralling food prices .
Those countries were spending 25 per cent more on food imports in 2007 than they had in 2006 , it noted , with " unprecedented price hikes for basic food , driven by historically low food stocks , droughts and floods linked to climate change , high oil prices and growing demand for bio- fuels " .
Others have been pointing out that the Green Revolution , which through the introduction of new techniques and new hybrids enabled countries such as India to feed their growing populations , might have reached its end .
They fear increases in production in the next 50 years will not match those in the past four decades .
The FAO report came hard on the heels of one from the UN 's global environmental outlook .
That painted a grim picture of over - consumption .
Among other things , it pointed to a collapse of the world 's fish stocks by 2050 , through overfishing , with 212 - times more fish being caught than the oceans could produce in a sustainable manner , and the increasing number of dead zones in the ocean where pollution , including fertiliser run-offs , has depleted oxygen .
The report also pointed out that , since 1987 , the world 's population has grown 34 per cent .
Then the land available to each person was 2.6 hectares .
Now , it is just a whisker above 2ha .
By 2050 , that will be down to 1.63ha .
Achim Steiner , the executive director of the UN programme that produced the report , told the New York Times , " life would be easier if we did n't have the kind of population growth rates that we have at the moment " .
Like most others , he shied from the next step , saying instead that forcing people to stop having children would be a simplistic answer .
The issue of population control is fraught with difficulty .
There is something unpalatable about the rich nations of the world , which do not have rapidly increasing populations but which do gobble up an indefensibly large share of resources , suggesting that the teeming nations of the developing world should curtail their population growth .
It is also surrounded by cultural and religious issues .
There is unease , too , in China over the one - child policy , some suggesting it has created a selfish generation that is causing social disruption and others arguing that it will hinder future development by limiting the size of China 's labour force .
However , the pressure from an ever - expanding population on a world that is finite cannot be ignored forever .
Breakthrough Discovery : Microbes that Generate Methane from Renewable Energy
June 4th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
In a surprising find , scientists have discovered a microbe that can efficiently convert direct electrical current into methane .
That may be good news for wind and solar power enthusiasts , who have long been faced with the dilemma of how to store energy when the wind is n’t blowing and the sun is n’t shining .
This discovery opens the door for generating methane from those renewable power sources ; the energy could then be stored as fuel for later use .
But is storing renewable energy in the form of a greenhouse gas like methane a solution , or just another problem ?
[ social_buttons ]
The remarkable microbe , Methanobacterium palustre , is the first to be found which can biochemically synthesize methane using electrons directly from current in combination with hydrogen gas .
Most significantly , it appears to transform the energy at 80 % efficiency .
That ’s pretty darn good , according to researchers .
Before this discovery , the options were limited regarding how to store energy generated from wind or solar sources .
Storing it in large capacitors and batteries offered the most practical solution , since converting the energy into a fuel like hydrogen made it difficult to compress and store .
But that problem does n’t exist for methane , which is the main component for natural gas .
Natural gas is already carried around the world in pipelines , and it ’s used in conventional engines .
Though despite the good news , utilizing this process may overlook some of the bigger reasons for switching to renewable energy .
Specifically , if the primary benefit for using wind and solar energy is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , then would n’t converting that energy into methane miss the point ?
Yes and no .
Methane is a very clean burning fuel , and compared to other hydrocarbons , burning methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released .
In other words , if the choice is between storing excess wind or solar energy as methane or having to use traditional , dirtier fuels like gas or coal to pick up the leftover energy burden , then converting clean energy into methane– while perhaps not the ideal solution– is still a significant step forward .
More research needs to be conducted to determine the exact molecular mechanism of the biochemical process , and practical means for employing the technology have yet to be worked out .
But the exciting discovery does shed some creative light on the potential for renewable sources to supply all of our energy needs .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Pennsylvania lawyer H. Beatty Chadwick either could not or really did not want to hand over the $ 2.5 million his ex-wife was awarded after their divorce , and he was prepared to go to jail for contempt rather than do so .
That was 14 years ago .
Chadwick has consistently claimed that he could not and cannot pay because he lost the money in " bad investments . "
But the judge that jailed him did not believe that , and neither did the judge who let him go last week .
Judge Joseph Cronin said he agreed with previous rulings that Chadwick had the ability to comply with the order to pay but had " willfully refused to do so . "
He released Chadwick , though , because he found that continued imprisonment would be legal only if there was some likelihood that ultimately he would comply with the order ; otherwise , the confinement would be merely punitive instead of coercive .
Apparently 14 years of incarcerated non-compliance – believed to be the longest sentence served for contempt of court in U.S. history – is enough to support a finding that future compliance is unlikely .
Albert Momjian , the ex-wife 's lawyer , was not happy with the ruling .
" Here 's a guy who thumbed his nose at a court order for 14 years , " he was quoted as saying .
" There should be some kind of sanctions for doing that . "
Good point – the guy should serve some jail time , or something .
Momjian said he still thought Chadwick had the money to pay , pointing out that if he was broke , " how does he pay all these lawyers ? "
( The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Chadwick 's attorney has been working pro bono for the past six years , though Momjian 's question might be relevant to the first eight . )
Others were not sure what to think , like John Reilly , the prison superintendent who has hosted Chadwick since 1995 .
Reilly noted that Chadwick had done more time than many murderers do , and found it hard to imagine that anyone " in his right mind " would defy a court for that long if he was actually able to comply .
He also noted that Chadwick had been a " model inmate , " apparently so much so that he became good friends with guards and administrators , many of whom , according to the Philadelphia Daily News , were " crying and hugging " Chadwick as he departed .
( On the other hand , the Daily News also said that Chadwick , at least in his life before prison , had " reportedly [ been ] a control freak who would ration his spouse 's toilet - paper usage and designate specific times for sex . "
So there 's that .
Prison probably cures a man of control - freak habits , though . )
Ultimately , Reilly was n't sure what to think .
" To me , he 's an enigma , " he said .
" I ca n't get a read on the guy . "
Chadwick , now 73 , said he was n't yet sure what he would do with the rest of his life , but that it would probably include trying to get his law license reinstated .
I 'd guess it will probably not include paying his ex-wife $ 2.5 million , but time will tell .

Doctor
Who is human after all : Matt Smith clutches hot water bottle to keeps warm during filming
When he bursts onto screens in the new series of Doctor Who , actor Matt Smith will play a seemingly invincible alien lifeform .
But in reality he is just as susceptible to the cold as anyone else , and needed a hot water bottle to keep warm as he filmed scenes on a chilly Welsh beach today .
The 26 - year - old actor and the doctor 's assistant Karen Gillan , 21 , were spotted wrapped up in padded coats on location near Cardiff as they filmed their first scenes together .
Keeping warm :
The new Doctor Who , Matt Smith , and his companion try to shake off the chills with huge coats and hot water bottles
Freezing :
The cold weather has changed Matt 's hands red A sneak peek of the new show , which wo n't be broadcast on BBC until 2010 , gives fans a chance to see the Doctor 's new costume .
While departing Doctor David Tennant normally wore a plain brown suit with a long trenchcoat , Matt 's uniform is more retro and slightly Science teacher - esque .
The new Doctor 's costume is a brown tweed jacket with tweed elbow patches , bow tie , rolled up trousers and black boots .
Karen , who plays Amy Pond , looked more modern in a baggy green jumper , grey tights and Converse baseball boots .
New cast : Matt Smith ( right ) and Karen Gillan go through their lines on the location of Doctor Who in Cardiff , Wales
Getting to know you : Karen and Matt chat outside the tardis
Matt and Karen began filming the new series this week , and it will be broadcast on BBC1 next Spring .
Arriving on set , Matt enthused : ' I feel very privileged and proud to be part of this iconic show .
' The scripts are brilliant - I 'm excited about the future and all the brilliant adventures I get to go on as the Doctor . '
The show 's new writer Stephen Moffatt , who is taking over from Russell T. Davies , is equally enthusiastic .
Science teacher chic :
The new doctor wears a tweed jacket , rose - coloured shift and rolled - up trousers
He said : ' Matt and Karen are going to be incredible , and Doctor Who is going to come alive on Saturday nights in a whole new way . '
Departing David filmed his last scenes of Doctor Who in May , where he was reunited with former assistant Billie Piper , as well as his current helper Catherine Tate .
His final two episodes will be broadcast at Christmas , with viewers seeing David regenerate into Matt .
Departing : David Tennant and Catherine Tate will leave the show at Christmas
Matt was announced as the 11th Doctor in January after David announced his decision to depart .
The Northampton - born actor has signed a £ 600,000 three - year deal , nearly half the amount of David 's £ 1 million deal .
Scottish actress Karen was only unveiled as his new companion in May , amid reports ex-EastEnder Michelle Ryan and model Kelly Brook may take the coveted role .
Karen has featured in ITV ’s Rebus and hospital drama Harley Street , as well as Channel 4 comedy The Kevin Bishop Show .
The young actress , who is 5ft 11in , has also modelled for designer Allegra Hicks at London Fashion Week .
She briefly appeared in Doctor Who in 2008 appearing as a soothsayer in the episode entitled The Fires of Pompeii .

Michael Jordan Shares NBC Air Time With Inflatable Penis
Total Pro Sports –
While watching sports , we often become fixated on what is happening in the field of play , but sometimes a simple gaze beyond the athletes and into the crowd will uncover great things .
In some instances you may catch a woman flashing the players , or maybe a horny husband grabbing at his wife ’s breasts .
And then there are those crazy guys behind home plate at Blue Jay games .
Well this weekend we were confronted with another great spectator moment at the American Century Celebrity Championship in Tahoe .
Michael Jordan is one of the most popular sports figures of the century , and with that being the case , you would expect him to attract a rather large gallery .
Among those in attendance at the par 3 17th was everyone ’s favorite …
The inflatable penis !
Is it me or does the woman hoisting the large male member seem to know how to handle it quite well .
Let the search begin for the lovely lady with the large inflatable penis .
Update : Thanks to our friends over at Busted Coverage who interviewed Elizabeth The Giant Penis Holder .
Im christian and go to church pretty regularly ..
I love Jesus … you know , so this is VERY unlike me , to the point that people do not believe that I would be caught hold a giant wee wee !
Plus
Im going to be a teacher .
judgers .
It was funny though .
I was chased on the beach by a woman sherriff who told me to hand over the “ inflatable penis ” , this was AFTER the bachelorette , Sam , rushed MJ on the green with the inflatable penis .
MJ was hysterically laughing .
We ran back to where we were standing and a male cop was coming over to talk to us so the bachelorette handed it over to me and everyone started yelling “ RUN ” so I ran over to where MJ was putting and started to jump up and down .
That was the shot that you got and was on tv .
I guess the network called the sheriff to get that inflatable penis !!.
I went back over to where the bachelorette was and they told me to run away again because I was really being pursued and out of no where a woman cop starts chasing me , so I run down to the water to throw it in the water , and at this moment everyone on the beach is watching and yelling at me to throw it in the water !
So I do !!
I am soooo not a rebel but I was under pressure and the cop was like ” I could arrest you for that ” and I said oh please dont !
so she tells me to grab it out of the water and deflate it … which I start to do , but I am taking my time .. and just as I was about to open the hole to let the air out a friend runs up to us and takes it from me and jumps in the water and swims back to the boat .
!!
That was HILARIOUS ..
SO the cop and I and another girl are just standing there and I apologize to her and tell her how good she looks with a gun and we walk back to heckle tony romo .
I am married and it was my future sister in law ’s bachelorette party .
Meanwhile back at the boat , where the rest of 24 girl bachelorette party was , harbor police comes up the to 5 boat barge and tells the girls that “ they might as well have a sign that says stupid bachelorette party ” and that we are all ” stupid dumb girls ” all becuz of the inflatable penis ” and that people have been calling in and complaining .
HE THREATEND to breathalize the people on the boat if we didnt deflate it .
SO the girls ont he boat had to deflate it and by that time we had to return the boats to the rental place .
We were the talk of the town .!

You may or may not have heard about a campaign on Facebook , the social networking site , to convince President Barack Obama to spend some summer vacation time in Michigan .
He can even bring his dog , Bo , according to the invitation .
The latest discussion on the Facebook group is " Where should the Obama 's stay in Michigan ? "
Which made
The Mudpuppy wonder , " Would anyone invite Barack to the Saginaw Bay watershed ? "
At least one of 14 posters ( so far ) suggests Caseville .
What would you suggest ?
Traverse City seems to be the most popular destination .
I knew and you should have known …
That the Seahawks were going to lose .
That the S&P 500 was going to rally double digits in 2014 .
Surely , someone knew this was going to happen and profited from it .
We probably all have heard similar statements .
It makes us wonder if anyone is aware of the havoc hindsight bias can play on an investor ’s portfolio .
What is hindsight bias ?
Wikipedia describes it as the “ I - knew - it - all - along ” effect .
Psychologically speaking , it is the inclination , after an event has occurred , to see the event as having been predictable – despite the fact that there was little or no objective basis for predicting the outcome .
It ’s a common memory distortion that can lead us to find casual connections where none exist and these errors can affect how we interpret not only a past event but future events as well .
Hindsight bias can lead investors to buy high and sell low .
The danger of hindsight bias is n’t just that it affects one bad call .
The real danger is that believing somebody “ should have known ” can lead investors to make decisions and design portfolios with too little consideration for their own risk or goals .
How ?
Overestimating the accuracy of our past forecasts may lead to overconfidence in our future forecasts ( “ Hey , I was right before ! ” ) and hence to taking excessive risks .
Hindsight bias also can affect relationships between investors and their advisors ; if an investor believes his or her advisor should have been able to accurately forecast market performance , they could lose confidence in their advisor ’s abilities and advice .
Hindsight Bias Can Affect Everyone .
After the fact , events often seem “ obvious ” and “ inevitable . ”
Most people forget what they were thinking before the event occurred .
For example , a globally diversified portfolio , one that contains both international and U.S. investments , looks silly ( or worse ) since the U.S. market has outperformed the international markets by 100 % over the past six years .
When we feel the first “ But this was so obvious ! ” thoughts creeping in , this is when we should pause and think about not only what did happen but what could have happened .
Still not convinced ?
Let ’s take a broader look at how U.S. markets performed in comparison to international markets .
If you remember , in the 1990 ’s , the U.S. outperformed international markets essentially throughout the entire decade .
By the time the dot.com market became the dot.com bubble , most Americans considered it foolish to invest in overseas companies .
Do you remember what happened next ?
The chart shows International markets regained the lead over domestic markets around the bottom of the bear market ; beginning in 2002 , and they outperformed U.S. markets for six consecutive years – until the subprime crisis ( likewise unpredicted ) hit in 2008 .
Do you now feel more or less confident about predicting which one will lead this year ?
Hindsight bias can make any tactic employed to defend against potential bear market scenarios in the past look silly when viewed from the perspective of the current U.S. market leader .
The future is not as predictable as we might like to believe .
Who predicted that oil would fall 50 % from its recent highs ?
Or that the Swiss Franc would rise 41 % in a single day ?
When you start to think you could have or should have predicted it , remember , everyone else thinks they can , too .
Someone is always wrong , and most of us ca n’t remember times when we were wrong because it ’s part of the memory distortion that comes with hindsight bias .
Invest for an unpredictable future .
We recommend making investment decisions based on what you need an investment to do for you , not based on what you think is going to happen Acknowledging what we cannot control helps us stay focused on what we can control .
Life does not always play out according to even our best - laid plans .
Expect the unexpected .
Ask yourself what could go wrong and manage for that possibility , rather than focusing exclusively on what you believe will go right .
Remember the importance of diversification .
It ’s not to increase portfolio returns ; rather , diversification is designed to protect you should events not turn out exactly as you would like .
The West Australian Coroner has given his findings in the case of a man who was effectively cooked to death in the back of a prison van .
Last January an Aboriginal elder known as Mr Ward was being driven in the back of the van through the searing temperatures of The Goldfields .
The air - conditioning unit was not working and the temperature inside reached 50 degrees Celsius .
Before he died , the 46 - year - old from Warburton suffered third - degree burns where his body touched the hot metal floor .
Coroner Alistair
Hope handed down his long - awaited findings on Friday .
Mr Hope said Mr Ward died as a result of heat stroke which was caused by grossly excessive heat in the pod in the transit van taking him from Laverton to Kalgoorlie .
He said Mr Ward suffered a " terrible death " that was " wholly unnecessary and avoidable " and he died as a result of a " litany of errors " .
He accused the people driving the prison van of collusion and giving false evidence .
He also said the fact the prison van did not have a spare tyre was an indication of the transport company 's " reckless " approach to prisoner safety .
He said it was a disgrace that a prisoner in the 21st Century , particularly someone who was not convicted , was transported such a distance in such a compartment .
The Coroner expressed his disgust at the state of the compartment , saying it had all - metal surfaces , very little light , and no restraints to protect the person inside if the vehicle had come to grief in some way .
There was a lack of air flow and there was no proper method of communication between the pod and the drivers .
He said there was a panic button in the back but it was not prominent and only set off a light in the driver 's compartment which could not be seen in daytime .
The fan did not work when it was tested , the air - conditioning was not working , and in any case the air - conditioning was not appropriate to be driving people such long distances in remote areas .
He said it was difficult to imagine a more uncomfortable environment .
West Australian Attorney General Christian Porter has called the incident tragic and avoidable .
Mr Porter says he expects Mr Ward 's family will apply to him for a compensation payment but would not say how much would be offered .
He also has not ruled out a $ 100,000 contractual penalty against the prison transport company , GSL .
" The contractors have moved those two employees from Kalgoorlie to Perth , and they are no longer involved in prisoner transport , " he said .
" Perhaps if that $ 100,000 penalty was applied , that might go to Mr Ward 's family in the nature of a compensatory payment . "
Arbitrary and inflexible
The Coroner said there were two pods on the vehicle ; one directly behind the cabin , which was not so bad - there was cushioning on the seats and there was the possibility of opening windows .
But there was an " arbitrary and inflexible " rule that all prisoners should be considered high risk in the case when there is only one person being transported , and should be placed further away from the cabin .
In their evidence , the officers driving the van had said that they thought the air - conditioning was working .
No action was taken against the officers by their company GSL .
A GSL representative said they had not broken any of the procedures or rules .
The officers said they did not know why they did not check on Mr Ward during the four - hour journey .
When they heard what sounded like a fall , when Mr Ward hit the bottom of the pod , they realised that something was wrong .
The Coroner said that it appeared that Mr Ward died fairly early in the trip because he was given around 600 mls of water to drink and there was still some water in the bottle when he was found unconscious in the back of the van .
Some GSL staff had been complaining for some time that the vehicles were not roadworthy for such long distances .
Dennis Eggington from the West Australian Aboriginal Legal Service says the Coroner conducted a thorough investigation into Mr Ward 's death .
" His investigation and findings have proven that there 's alot to be answered and people really need to be aware there are a couple of departments that have got blood on their hands at the moment , " he said .
For environmental activists like Jessica Miller , 31 , the passage of a major climate bill by the House last month should have been cause for euphoria .
Instead she felt cheated .
Ms. Miller , an activist with Greenpeace , had worked hard on her own time to elect Barack Obama because he directly and urgently addressed the issue nearest her heart : climate change .
But over the last few months , as the ambitious climate legislation was watered down in the House without criticism from the president , Ms. Miller became disillusioned .
She worried that the bill had been rendered meaningless  or had even undermined some goals Greenpeace had fought for .
And she felt that the man she had thought of as her champion seemed oddly prone to compromise .
“ I voted for the president , I canvassed for him , but we just have n’t seen leadership from him , ” said Ms. Miller , who rappelled down Mount Rushmore on Wednesday with colleagues to unfurl a banner protesting what they called President Obama ’s acquiescence to the compromises .
( They were arrested and charged with trespassing . )

DOSE :
1.5 hits oral LSD ( pill / tablet ) 0.5 hits insufflated LSD ( pill / tablet ) 200 mg smoked Cannabis - Hash ( tar / resin )
BODY WEIGHT : 200 lb
If LSD or another Psychedelic has left you dangled , confused , afraid and tormented ; Breathe
In time the trauma will unravel
You have found a difficult path , but you are OK .
Living will still have beauty .
You are not alone .
I have seen total eclipse without hope of day .
It took years but I am happy with a loving partner and a healthy sane life .
I am a better , more aware , more caring and happier person than I would have been without these experiences .
I would not change the choices Ive made :
It started with 2 hits of Blue Microdot .
The 16 hours or more of tripping was only the beginning .
It took years for me to stitch myself back together .
I ate 1 and a Half hits of LSD , and I insufillated another half .
Then I smoked about .2 grams of Hash .
All ready I felt uneasy , that something wasnt right .
It didnt take long before nothing was right .
It is unexplainable Beyond a thought , or feeling , or sense .
A door opened I was flooded with a new seeing .
I was unprepared and resisted .
This is when I met with insanity .
I wont go into the details of my complex and confused mind .
It still give me shivers .
Ill just say that without a doubt that I was now insane , and going to stay that way for the rest of my life .
Metaphors grew out of nothing .
A string of strange coincidences and some strong acid made me believe that I was suddenly in on some syndicate that operated on a psychic level . , through metaphors and feelings .
I was being welcomed into the circle .
Insanity was a network .
I didnt want to be a part of but it was too late .
Then I realized  I wasnt insane but dead  I had Overdosed on LSD ( I now know this is impossible ) and I was riding in limbo needing to choose heaven or hell .
My cousin who I was close to all my life was cool with smoking cigarettes , weed and was high on the same LSD ( having a great time with it I might add ) became to me , a manifestation of Satan .
My older brother who was as clean as they come and totally naive to drugs became to me a manifestation of Jesus .
Of course I followed him around all night bugging the shit out of him to take me to heaven .
This scared the ever living shit out of him .
At one point I pissed my pants on purpose to try and convince myself I was still alive
But the trip had roots and that was not enough to snap me out of it .
I was willing to do anything he suggested However with his inexperience he would tell me to do things like go to sleep
Go lay down in my room with the lights off .
There my body would feel as though it was disappearing ..
That I was slipping into hell .
( I wish now that I would have let go and experienced my inner workings ) .
I lept out of bed and did anything I could think of to get to heaven .
I even tried calling my parents who were away on vacation .
I went through my peak doing these random and frantic things as I was certain I was going to fall into hell at any moment .
That night was long .
As my cousin and I came down from our trips he ultimately talked me into finally going to bed and getting some sleep I dont recall if I actually ever slept .
He left the next afternoon .
What is most formative and important is the week , and then , years afterward .
A journey few people will ever make in this life .
The first week I spent afraid , confused , unable to eat or sleep .
Alone in a true dementia .
Id watch Television and it would be spewing messages directly to me .
EVERYTHING was a metaphor for heaven or hell , or a message from this syndicate .
I began to believe this blanket of metaphor was a secret code that the world spoke and I was getting hip to it .
Going down to Strawberry fields .
Still , nothing really made sense all a jumble .
One night that week I went to a friends house and believed every sentence they said to one another was linked to my dementia .
Another close friend , who definitely knew I was in trouble said that he believed life was a test and that everything had a reasonable and rational answer .
Dunno if that s absolutely true , but it snapped me into my first taste of reality in over a week .
I decide it was time to drive home to my parents house to reconcile my mind .
I entered the house not really knowing what to say or do I began telling them about this experience I had Telling them that I had achieved a higher state of consciousness etc .
They looked frightened and confused .
I realized that so was I . Suddenly I broke down Began telling them about my use of LSD , Marijuana and other Drugs , how I was out of my mind , paranoid and afraid .
Just the facts .
My mother cried and my Father listened stone silent .
That night was the most relieving and uplifting of my life .
Likely the most difficult for my parents all they could do was listen and hug me
This ladies and gents was way out of there league .
I knew it I knew I was teaching them .
What mattered was that I was in a place where I was loved and accepted .
I was 16 years old and I slept on the floor at the foot of their bed .
I released all my secrets .
If there is a sacred confession .
This was it I was cleansed by fire .
I felt as though I rose from ashes and I did .
That night I was utterly humbled and humiliated by existence .
I was a child again but also evolved .
The next week I didnt leave my parents house I helped them with various jobs and house projects
If I found spare time , I d find something to fill it .
It was like every day I died .. and re-awoke .
Every day I teetered between heaven and hell .
Small decisions like  Which juice shall I buy and drink ?  were wrapped in meaning and metaphor that extended beyond daily life , seemingly deciding my eternal fate .
Just under everything was a mechanism , a test or a plot Unraveling .
I saw powers that we are all capable of The power to live or to die any moment I began seeing through the facades of judgment and morality .
My learned belief systems eroded and were replaced with experience .
Id raise my concerns with a close friend who had had similar experiences .
He would console me , encourage me to believe in what was in front of me , work with what I knew and be wise not to open up these thoughts to the wrong people , as most would just label me insane and become afraid of me .
He was of course totally right and a good friend for his patience and protection .
For a time I lived my life shadowing my true thoughts and feelings about daily situations .
I made some stunning life decisions .
I traveled overseas alone to search my soul and mind .
I shed all my addictions , tobacco , TV , caffeine , sex , all drugs , and even meat / processed foods .
This was all between the ages of 16 and 23 .
It took me over a year till I could even talk to my cousin again .
Many more till I could truly trust him .
I wish that databases such as Erowid , The Shroomery etc. existed when I went through this journey .
Their help could have turned this vicious , horrific and difficult experience into something meaning full and useful from the beginning .
Much of my delusions  werent so at all .
This life , this existence is a blanket of meaning and metaphor .
Everything we see , touch , hear is a creation of our own perceptions .
This can drive you mad , or make you powerful , exalted and blissful .
I am 27 as I write this .
The lessons and impressions left by the LSD trip , the full week of dementia and the years of re-evaluating evolved me to a state of consciousness few ever reach .
I am at peace with myself and my existence .
I dont want to die , but I am virtually unafraid of it .
I see through the bullshit of war , violence and destruction .
I seek and participate in peace .
I believe we all wish to .
LSD helped push these to the front of my consciousness .
I had to go through hell .
But these moments I now live are truly awake and free .
To this day I wonder if I 'm actually alive or if I m alone - A drifting consciousness lingering in an endless construct of my own imagination -
It doesnt matter really .
I found peace .
The report included allegations that women were taken from the camps A Channel 4 News team has been deported from Sri Lanka after reporting claims of abuse in camps for displaced Tamils , the UK Foreign Office has confirmed .
The Sri Lankan Defence Minister ordered Asia correspondent Nick Paton - Walsh , cameraman Matt Jasper and producer Bessie Du to leave the country .
The TV report contained claims that dead bodies were left where they fell and allegations of sexual abuse .
The Sri Lankan government has denied the allegations in Tuesday 's report .
' Deeply disappointing '
A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said all three journalists were receiving consular assistance .
She added : " This is a deeply disappointing decision when the case for more transparency , not less , is overwhelming . "
Police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekera told reporters the trio were arrested in the eastern city of Trincomalee on Saturday .
He said investigations were continuing .
Lakshman Hulugalle , the head of the Sri Lankan government security information centre , said the journalists had admitted that they had " done something wrong " , according to the Associated Press .
But Mr Paton - Walsh told the agency that any suggestions he had given a statement to the police or admitted wrongdoing were " complete rubbish " .
He said the crew had been driven to Sri Lanka 's capital , Colombo , with a police escort .
A spokesperson for ITN , which produces Channel 4 News , said : " We will be seeking an explanation from the Sri Lankan government for this decision . "
The Channel 4 team had been covering fighting between the government and the Tamil Tiger rebels .
Its report looked at the conditions in camps that had been set up by the government for the refugees who had fled the northern war zone .
It explored allegations of sexual abuse as well as shortages of food and water .
The United Nations estimates that about 50,000 civilians are trapped by fighting as government troops attempt to oust the Tamil Tigers from their strongholds across the north .
The rebels have been driven back into a small pocket of land on the north - eastern coast .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war .

I do n’t think this changes the larger issue .
But I ’d be very curious to hear more about this , from TPM Reader EC …
You ’re missing the point on AIGFP ’s bonuses .
The reason the government has no bargaining power is that failure to pay the bonuses — which , like it or not , AIG is contractually obligated to pay — would constitute a “ cross - default ” under AIG ’s derivative contracts .
Cross - default is considered an “ event of default ” under the standard ISDA Master Agreement ( see sec . ( 5 ) ( a ) ( vi ) ) , which means that failure to pay the bonuses would allow AIG ’s counterparties to terminate the CDS contracts and demand a full payout from AIG .
With a derivatives portfolio of over $ 1.5 trillion , this is no small deal .
Venting over AIGFP ’s bonuses is fine , but urging the government to take an action which would result in hundreds of billions in losses to AIG ( and thus the taxpayer ) just because it would make you feel better is bad policy .
Do n’t let cheap populism become expensive populism .
If that ’s the case , I cannot think of a business rationale for having the whole thing wired to explode if the CDS seller does n’t get his bonus other than a time bomb set by the sellers .
Late Update : TPM Reader KJ , who ’s a knowledgeable player in the industry , ai n’t buying it …
I ’m by no means an expert on the ISDA Master Agreement , but I think EC overstates the risk .
The cross - default provision is not about employment agreements or other non-material contracts , it ’s about derivative transactions and other funding arrangements .
So if for example , AIG defaulted on repaying its loan under a credit agreement , that would likely trigger a cross - default under its ISDA Master Agreement .
The idea that an alleged breach of its bonus plan or an employment agreement could trigger its default under its swap arrangements is , well , laughable .
The link below gives a nice summary of the cross default features .
And TPM Reader BK , who has even more on - point industry expertise , is even more sure …
This is simply not true .
The bonuses are owed to AIG ’s employees , not its counterparties .
AIG ’s employees are not parties to its ISDA agreements .
Furthermore conditions such as the payment of bonuses are not anywhere near what a “ cross default ” is .
A “ cross - default ” would be if AIG failed to satisfy its obligations to Counterparty A , then Counterparty B could claim it was in default even if technically it was n’t .
The contractual obligations that AIG are under are employee contracts … not ISDAs .
There ’s no doomsday scenario here .
The worst that can happen to AIG is that its
employees could sue it to obtain their promised bonuses .
Late Finance Scammers Bleeding Us Dry Update :
Whether it ’s true or not is one thing .
But Marcy
Wheeler posted the white paper AIG used to convince Geithner that the bonuses had to be paid .
And I think she ’s right , that this is what AIG is arguing — that refusing to pay these bonuses could constitute a “ default event ” that would leave the US taxpayer on the line for as much as hundreds of billions of dollars .
( Here ’s the actual white paper . )
Whether that ’s true or not is another matter .
But that does seem to be what they ’re telling us : pay us a billion or our counter - parties a trillion .
You decide .
Further Clarifying Update : As TPM Reader JG points out , there ’s an extra step in there .
AIG is n’t arguing that refusing to pay the bonuses will constitute a ‘ default event ’ but that failing to pay the bonuses will lead to the AIGFP worthies quitting and that will amount to a ‘ default event ’ .
JG picks up the thread in mid-nonsense …
i Phone apps can find just about anything .
They can help you find a job , locate your friends , or just pinpoint a gas station .
But a new app is promising to find you something far more controversial : marijuana .
Apple has approved a new $ 2.99 iPhone app , aptly named Cannabis [ iTunes link ] .
It 's made by the also appropriately - named Ajnag.com .
The purpose of the app is to help locate legal medical marijuana in states and locations where it can be found .
Will this app lead thousands of iPhone users to cannabis , or is it a tool of a movement in favor of marijuana legalization ?
The answer , surprisingly , is both :
Locating more than just pot
The application is a location - based service , pure and simple .
It takes the known locations of medical collectives , doctors , clinics , and organizations from three sources and aggregates them on a Google Map .
When you activate the app , it will determine your location and provide you with the nearest location where you can acquire marijuana .
Thus , if you can legally purchase cannabis , you can use this app to find it .
But what if you do n't have a license or live in an area where medical marijuana is not legalized ?
This app also has an answer - it will show you the nearest cannabis organizations in your area so you can promote reform .
It even covers international travel by showing you legal cannabis coffee shops .
As you would expect , Cannabis has a strong message about its social responsibility and that it does not promote illegal cannabis use without a physician 's recommendation .
And this app does n't help you find dealers or anything shady of the sort .
Its smart to add the location of activist groups , as most states do n't legalize marijuana .
While its current features are n't all that exciting or revolutionary , it promises to have news updates , videos , and reviews in the near future .
It looks like marijuana smokers everywhere finally have an app they can rally behind .

Our group of seven all passed without incident through the metal detectors except for my 88 - year old father - in - law , a refugee from Jaffa , a once thriving , cosmopolitan Palestinian port city , now an urban slum on the outskirts of Tel Aviv .
He and 700,000 other Palestinians were forced out of their homes in the Nakba or Catastrophe of 1948 .
My father - in - law was asked to go to a small room with a blue curtain .
Inside , Israeli military asked him to strip down to his underwear , and he was searched .
He was touched familiarly , one might say .
Later we joked that his balls had been deemed non-threatening to the state of Israel .
At passport control , a young Israeli soldier inspected my family ’s passports .
We asked politely that our passports not be stamped because we had plans to visit countries that would not accept a passport that showed evidence of a visit to Israel .
Then she left her stool and walked away with our documents for about a half hour .
We waited knowing that we would not pass through easily or quickly .
We were finally asked to take a seat and wait for our names to be called .
In the waiting area ( a small , dirty space with some metal chairs ) , we met several Palestinian families .
An old woman from Jerusalem told us she had left Amman at 7 am and had been waiting on the bus for five hours before being told to wait yet again .
We offered her some mint tea from the snack shop and some pita bread with Laughing Cow cheese that we had brought along for the kids .
It was as if we offered her the moon .
She insisted we come to Jerusalem to have lunch at her house .
We met a young couple from Indianapolis arriving to see family with their seven - month old baby .
The baby was uncomfortable and sweating , and we worried about how long this family would be forced to wait .
We met a young man who was traveling on his American passport but because he also had a West Bank ID and did not reveal that fact at first , he was forced back to Jordan and refused entry .
The young man who came to interview my father asked who he was planning to visit .
He gave him the name and phone number of his cousin in Ramallah whom the Israeli authorities immediately called to confirm my dad ’s story .
They demanded the ID number of our cousin when they spoke with him on the phone which he was obliged to provide .
I wonder what the Israelis do with this information .
My father - in - law ’s interviewer spoke perfect English and we learned he grew up in Virginia .
He was kind and offered to facilitate a visa stamp on a separate piece of paper to keep our passports “ clean ” .
His kindness brought some light to the situation .
He added some dignity and humanity to a system that values neither of these .
My husband noticed the irony of the situation .
A kid from Norfolk had the power to decide if his father , a native of the land , would be allowed into the country .
All in all , we waited some seven hours to be cleared through the border .
We were hungry , hot and tired when our passports were finally returned to us .
We said goodbye to the people we had gotten to know during the wait and distributed the last of our snacks to the families with young children .
When we stepped out to find a taxi , we learned that only one taxi company has rights to transport passengers from the bridge .
It is an Israeli firm and we wondered how Israeli drivers would go to our destination in Ramallah .
The prices were double the usual , but we had no other options .
We did n’t have a Palestinian sim card for our mobile yet , , and since we did n’t know when we would clear the border , we did n’t ask family to meet us .
We paid the hefty price and loaded ourselves into the waiting cars .
We were driven about 500 meters down the road and were asked to switch cars belonging to Palestinian drivers from Jerusalem for the remainder of the journey .
We learned later that our Palestinian drivers are forbidden to pick up passengers from the bridge , but collect a 40 % cut from the Israeli taxi company to drive customers to the West Bank .
So , the Israeli company , it turns out , earns about $ 100 per car to drive 500 meters .
Nice work if you can get it .
As we were leaving we saw the young Indianapolis couple with their baby come out of the border facility .
I was so happy they were getting their child out of that hellish situation that I cried .
So much emotion poured through me , relief for that young family , relief that my kids had n’t been stripped - searched , anger at the humiliation of innocent people , sadness that young , vibrant Israelis were compelled to participate in such an unjust regime .
Finally , I cried for the hundreds of Palestinians we left behind and wondered how long they would continue to wait .
" Technical measures " will be used to tackle persistent pirates
The government has all but ruled out using a " three strikes " law to tackle persistent net pirates .
Using warnings and disconnection to tackle pirates was thought to be in the final Digital Britain report due to be published on 16 June .
Cutting people off was not the government 's " preferred option " , said culture secretary Andy Burnham in a music industry conference keynote .
Instead , he said , the report will back " technical solutions " as a deterrent .
Mr Burnham made his comments during a keynote speech at Music Week 's Making Online Music Pay conference .
The interim Digital Britain report was released on 29 January , 2009 .
The wide - ranging review looked at everything from broadband speeds to internet regulation and public service broadcasting .
The final review was widely expected to back a so - called three strikes law that music companies have called for .
This would see a person 's net connection terminated if they ignored official warnings about pirating digital content .
A spokesman for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport , said this was not the government 's preferred option now that net access was as valuable as other utilities such as water and electricity .
Although unwilling to give exact details , the spokesman said : " The Digital Britain report coming out soon will build on last year 's Memorandum of Understanding between content holders and ISPs to tackle illegal file sharing . "
" It is likely to include an obligation on ISPs to send out letters to people who are infringing copyright , " he said .
" What Mr Burnham also said was there was the likelihood that the MoU would be backed up by new powers for Ofcom to impose ' technical solutions ' for repeat offenders if that process of sending out letters was not effective enough , " added the spokesman .
It is not yet clear what those " technical solutions " would be though Mr Burnham said they would involve ways to " limit or restrict " file - sharing activity .
Mar Mulligan , vice president at Forrester Research , took this to mean that pirates would gradually have their connection speed dialled down .
" It instinctively sounds like a decent compromise , " said Mr Mulligan .
" We know that ISPs currently use a mix of technical solutions to manage traffic at peak times , " he said .
" The ISPs already have the technical infrastructure to implement this kind of stuff . "
" The sign of a good compromise is one that going to annoy both sides , " he said .
" I think ISPs will have an issue with it and so will the music labels . "

Julius Shulman , whose luminous photographs of homes and buildings brought fame to a number of mid-20th century modernist architects and made him a household name in the architectural world , has died .
He was 98 .
Shulman , who had been in declining health , died Wednesday night at his home in Los Angeles , according to his daughter Judy McKee .
Starting with Richard Neutra in 1936 , Shulman ’s roster of clients read like a who ’s who of pioneering contemporary architecture : Rudolf M. Schindler , Gregory Ain , Frank Lloyd Wright , Charles Eames , Raphael S. Soriano , John Lautner , Eero Saarinen , Albert Frey , Pierre Koenig , Harwell Harris and many others .
His work was contained in virtually every book published on modernist architects .
FOR THE RECORD :
Julius Shulman obituary :
The obituary of photographer Julius Shulman in the July 17 Section A said that his image of Case Study House # 22 first appeared in the Sunday Pictorial section of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner two months after it was taken on May 9 , 1960 .
The Sunday Pictorial was a feature of the Los Angeles Examiner newspaper , which merged with the Herald Express in 1962 .
However , according to the Getty Research Institute , where Shulman ’s archives are kept , the photo first appeared in the June 1960 issue of Arts & Architecture magazine . —
“ He has a sense of visual bravura of composition , ” wrote the late Robert Sobieszek , photography curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , “ so that he can take a rather mundane house and make it look exciting , and take a spectacular house and make it look triply spectacular . ”
Shulman had “ a profound effect on the writing and teaching of architectural history and understanding architecture , especially Southern California modernism , ” Thomas Hines , UCLA professor emeritus of architecture and urban design , once said .
And Newsweek magazine ’s Cathleen McGuigan wrote that some of Shulman ’s photographs of modern glass houses in Palm Springs and Los Angeles “ are so redolent of the era in which they were built you can practically hear the Sinatra tunes wafting in the air and the ice clinking in the cocktail glasses . ”
After the Depression , Shulman ’s studio was one of three in the United States to which Arts & Architecture , Architectural Forum and other magazines turned to document the exciting new work being done in architecture .
Shulman ’s 1960 photograph of Koenig ’s Case Study House No. 22 -- a glass - walled , cantilevered structure hovering above the lights of Los Angeles , became one of the most famous architectural pictures ever taken in the United States .
It was , as architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote in the New York Times , “ one of those singular images that sum up an entire city at a moment in time . ”
But Shulman ’s work went well beyond merely taking beautiful pictures of houses and buildings .
His mission was to use his photography to build the reputation of the architects who were bringing innovative design to the West .
Indeed , his photographs were , by and large , all that most people would ever see of noted architects ’ works , many of which were later destroyed .
Neutra , whose association with Shulman lasted 34 years until the architect ’s death in 1970 , acknowledged this .
“ Film [ is ] stronger , and good glossy prints are easier [ to ] ship than brute concrete , stainless steel or even ideas , ” Neutra said .
Shulman was born Oct. 10 , 1910 , in Brooklyn , N.Y. , the son of Russian Jewish immigrants .
The family moved to a farm in Connecticut , where Shulman first developed a love of nature that , he said , awakened him to light and shadow and influenced his life ’s course .
When Julius was 10 , his father moved the family to the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles , which at that time was predominantly Jewish , and opened the New York Dry Goods Store .
His father died of tuberculosis in 1923 , leaving Julius ’ mother to run the business and raise five children .
After graduating from Roosevelt High School -- where he took what would be his only course in photography -- Shulman spent seven years as what he called an “ academic drifter , ” auditing geology , philosophy and other courses at UCLA and UC Berkeley .
He returned to Los Angeles without a degree and still unsure what he wanted to do .
He was by then , however , earning rent money from pictures he took at Berkeley with an Eastman box camera .
And one photograph of the 6th Street Bridge over the L.A. River had won first prize in a national magazine competition .
It was a chance meeting with Neutra in March 1936 -- two weeks after Shulman left Berkeley -- that would open up the possibility of becoming an architectural photographer .
A man who was renting a room from Shulman ’s sister , and who was working as a draftsman for Neutra , invited Shulman along one day to see Neutra ’s Kun house , which was under construction near Fairfax Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard .
As was his habit by then , Shulman took along a vest - pocket camera that was equipped with a bellows that unfolded .
“ I had never seen a modern house before , ” Shulman said .
It “ intrigued me with its strange forms -- beyond any previous identity of a house in my experience . ”
Shulman developed a few of the pictures and sent them to the draftsman , who showed them to Neutra .
The architect , then in his mid-40s , sent for young Shulman and ordered up more prints .
With Neutra ’s invitation to photograph other projects , Shulman was suddenly a professional architecture photographer .
“ He had an eye for different angles , ” Neutra ’s son , Dion , told The Times in 2003 .
“ My dad immediately saw that and mentored him into the field . ”
Shulman throughout his life would refer to this turn in the road as “ fate ” or “ karma . ”
“ I was lucky to be doing the right thing at the right place at the right time , ” he told The Times in 1994 .
“ So any time anybody wanted a photograph of a modern house , Uncle Julius provided the picture . ”
Through Neutra , Shulman met other prominent architects of the time , including Schindler and Soriano , from whom he would learn his craft .
Schindler , for example , taught Shulman about lighting photographs when he asked him , “ Why on your interiors is the lighting equal in intensity on adjacent walls ? ”
“ What a lesson ! ” Shulman said .
“ In my use of floodlights it had not occurred to me that illumination need not be uniform . ”
His sense of light became instinctual ; he stopped working with a light meter a year after he started taking photos for Neutra .
Shulman spent two years in the Army during World War II taking photographs -- mostly of surgical procedures -- before returning to his business in 1945 to find himself in even greater demand .
It was during the postwar housing boom that John Entenza ’s Arts & Architecture magazine launched its Case Study housing program , hoping to promote good quality , low - cost housing in the modernist idiom .
Of the two dozen Case Study homes designed by such architects as Charles Eames , Craig Ellwood , A. Quincy Jones , Koenig , Neutra and Soriano , Shulman took photographs of 18 .
But the image that would secure Shulman ’s reputation was of Koenig ’s Case Study House No. 22 , a glass and steel - frame home built for Carlotta and Buck Stahl in the Hollywood Hills .
Shulman shot the photo as the sun was setting May 9 , 1960 .
The black - and - white photograph is taken from outside the cantilevered house , shooting through glass walls to the grid of sparkling city lights below .
In the living room are two pretty women dressed for a special night out but , for the moment , sitting quietly and chatting .
The strong horizontal pattern of the ceiling over their heads extends outside to the house ’s overhang .
The effect , though Hollywood gorgeous , is casual , a snapshot of the good life .
But , as with all of Shulman ’s work , nothing about taking this photograph was casual .
“ He was doing a rush job of shooting the house the day before it was to have its debut , ” said Philip Ethington , a USC professor of history who interviewed Shulman extensively for an oral history .
“ He turned around and saw this scene . ”
To capture the image in the camera , however , Shulman had to essentially take two photographs at once -- one of the vista below , which required a time exposure , and one of the house , which required a flash .
Working quickly and without a light meter , Shulman shot a 7 ½ - minute exposure of the city lights with his 4 - by - 5 camera .
“ Then , when I felt I had given enough time for the exposure , and I wanted to flash the interior , I called to the girls , ” Shulman told Taina Rikala De Noriega for the Archives of American Art / Smithsonian Institution .
“ I said , ‘ Girls , sit up now and look pleasant .
Look toward each other as if you ’re talking and hold still for just a second and the flash will go off . ’
I pressed the release .
All this time the shutter was open and the flash illuminated the interior . ”
The result is , as UCLA ’s Hines said , a photograph that is both time - specific and timeless .
With its scenic setting , romantic sensibility and strong perspective , it seems to capture the best of modernism .
“ Modernism really was about a belief in a promising future , a belief that our problems could be solved easily by progress , ” said Craig Krull , whose gallery at Bergamot Station in Santa Monica represents Shulman ’s work .
Krull said he saw the uplifting diagonal of Shulman ’s photograph , much like the fins on 1950s cars , as having an “ optimistic flair . ”
Others , including Ethington , have seen something darker .
While conceding that the photo is both “ comfortable and thrilling , ” he said it also has a “ portentous feel of white , well - to - do women encased in a glass box above a dark and teeming city . ”
Shulman knew he had taken a great picture , but he could not have known how enduring it would be .
First published on the cover of the Sunday Pictorial section of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner two months after it was taken , it would make architectural stars of both Shulman and Koenig .
It has been reproduced countless times in books , magazines and newspapers .
“ And suddenly Pierre Koenig becomes a hero , based on one picture , ” Shulman said of the photo he called “ one of my masterpieces . ”
In time , the scene - stealing fame that came to Shulman with the picture grew to rankle the architect , who later became a professor at USC ’s School of Architecture and who died in April 2003 .
“ It ’s not just a photograph , it ’s the house too , ” said Koenig , who said he very consciously designed the house so its horizontal lines would echo the city ’s grid below .
Shulman ’s photographs were not without controversy .
Some believed he made the structures look too beautiful .
He rearranged furniture to suit his perspective , brought in props and posed models in the frame .
Sometimes he used filters or infrared film to make his photos look more dramatic and full of contrast .
He also would shoot through cut branches or pots of nursery plants to give the impression that a newly completed home was more fully landscaped .
Shulman was unapologetic about these tactics , saying he was n’t just taking pictures , he was “ selling modernism . ”
“ I sell architecture better and more directly and more vividly than the architect does , ” he said .
In his later years , the value of Shulman ’s photographs increased dramatically .
Photos that in the past he had sold for $ 35 or $ 50 apiece began fetching , on the art market , $ 2,000 to $ 20,000 each .
Always generous with what he knew about his profession , Shulman for decades conducted seminars in photography at USC , UCLA and other universities .
He was awarded the American Institute of Architecture ’s Gold Medal for architectural photography in 1969 .
Shulman ’s home in the Hollywood Hills , designed by Soriano , was designated a monument by the L.A. Cultural Heritage Commission in 1987 as the only remaining unaltered steel - frame structure by the architect .
Though his shooting slowed down in his later years , Shulman continued taking assignments , working with his collaborator , Juergen Nogai , into his late 90s .
In 2005 , the Getty Center announced that it had acquired Shulman ’s archive of 260,000 negatives , prints and transparencies .
Shulman ’s first wife , Emma , died in 1973 , and his second , Olga , died in 1999 .
He is survived by his daughter and a grandson , Timothy , both of Santa Barbara .
Services are pending .
His family suggests donations to the Los Angeles Conservancy or the Friends of the Los Angeles River .

It should be obvious to readers of the Division by Zer0 that I am a frequent user of Reddit for my source of news and online interaction .
You may have also noticed that I am also generally hanging out a lot in the Anarchism subreddit as I find the community there quite vibrant and interesting to discuss with .
Recently I ’ve also been promoted to a moderator as this particular subreddit has a different policy on this issue to get around the potential abuse .
This is a complex issue so I wo n’t go into it at this point as I simply wanted to mention that I ended up getting mod powers .
Now , there ’s also a frequent topic of discussion on the subject of “ Anarcho ” - Capitalists who often come over from other parts of reddit , complain about the anti-capitalist sentiment of the Anarchism subreddit and usually proceed to downvote all pro-socialist articles and submit pro-capitalist articles which are quickly downvoted .
Nobody has ever been banned or moderated in any other way for doing this as we prefer to let the moderation happen naturally through the reddit system by the community .
We always had the possibility of moderation in case obvious problems occurred , such as spam accounts .
Fortunately , the automated moderation of reddit never made this an issue , so most that the mods ever did was to unban people and posts mistakenly caught by the spam - filter .
However just yesterday , this exact dilemma presented itself to me , as I caught one of the latest “ Anarcho ” - Capitalists to join had been obviously gaming the reddit system for his own purposes .
Now I had three options .
The easy one would be to simply start banning his accounts from /r / Anarchism using my moderator powers .
Another one would be to report the user to the Reddit moderators themselves for them to take action .
However none of them felt right .
Using either , would mean that I would have to use authoritarian means to solve the problem and this is something I wanted to avoid .
So what is left for an Anarchist to do ?
Name & Shame .
Why use this method ?
Simply because I believe that someone who is so interested in making his position look right to an unsuspecting audience will be particularly susceptible to public humiliation once his underhanded tactics were brought to the fore .
Not only that , but it would also provide the evidence to use against him pointing to his “ public approval ” in the form of upvotes as an argument as he was known to do .
And it did n’t take long .
Just today I noticed all his accounts have been deleted along with his main one .
True , I cannot know for sure that it was indeed him and not the Reddit moderators that finally caught up with him , but as he stopped writing soon after I called him out on the sockpuppetry and he also received scolding PMs from his fellow AnCaps I believe it must have been his own decision .
For me , this was a great example of how moderation of a community can happen even without authoritarian means such as moderation or banning .
It shows that even in an online forum with anonymous aliases , where very little outside IRL crimes can get back to bite you in the arse , peer - pressure can be enough to force someone who misbehaved to voluntary “ exile ” .
It shows that simply by public condemnation or activities we wish to discourage , the community can moderate itself and avoid “ benevolent dictators ” or a bureaucracy .
The sad part in all of this , is all the people who , when reported , jumped in to his defence .
Accusations of me bring an “ Alarmist ” , “ Propagandist ” and whatnot started flying , even in the face of undeniable evidence of wrongdoing and no actual “ force ” from my end .
It is sad that the simple act of trying to direct peer pressure to a good cause ( ie , stopping abuse of the system ) must be labeled as “ Propaganda ” or other such nonsense .
This is like the fear of public opinion I was talking about before which in my mind is an excuse for wanting to act like a jerk or of preferring to use authoritarian means .
For me , this experiment in libertarian action has been a success and gives me faith that if this can work even in an environment where peer - pressure is weak by design , it can surely work wonders in real life .

A self - assembling molecule synthesized in a laboratory may resemble the earliest form of information - carrying biological material , a transitional stage between lifeless chemicals and the complex genetic architectures of life .
Called tPNA , short for thioester peptide nucleic acids , the molecules spontaneously mimic the shape of DNA and RNA when mixed together .
Left on their own , they gather in shape - shifting strands that morph into stable configurations .
The molecules have n't yet achieved self - replication , the ultimate benchmark of life , but they hint at it .
Best of all , their activities require no enzymes — molecules that facilitate chemical reactions , but did n't yet exist in the primordial world modeled by scientists seeking insight into life 's murky origins .
" There have been many test tube experiments of evolving chemical sequences , but there has n't been a system that on its own can form under enzyme - free conditions , " said Reza Ghadiri , a Scripps Research Institute biochemist .
" We satisfy some of the requirements of the long - term goal of having a purely chemical system that is capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution . "
Among the co-authors of the paper describing tPNA , published Thursday in Science , is the late Leslie Orgel , a pioneering biochemist who hypothesized that DNA evolved from RNA , a simple information - carrying molecule that today forms the genomes of viruses and facilitates protein manufacture in organismal cells .
The so - called RNA world hypothesis is widely accepted among scientists , but requires several critical steps that have been satisfactorily explained in a laboratory only recently , if at all .
One such step is the formation of RNA 's chemical precursors .
Another step involves their accumulation into RNA , which despite its relative simplicity , has resisted the attempts of scientists to synthesize it in primordial conditions .
A experiment published several weeks ago in Nature , in which a cycle of evaporation and condensation distilled a mix of primordial chemicals into several key RNA ingredients , has provided a plausible early answer to the problem of precursor formation .
And the tPNA molecule in the current study may illuminate , at least in principle , how RNA might have emerged from these ingredients : in multiple stages , through a process of evolution .
" It 's the pre-RNA world .
There 's a hypothesis that says RNA is so complicated , it could n't have arisen de novo " — from scratch — " on early Earth , " said study co-author Luke Leman , also a Scripps Research Institute biochemist .
" So you need some more primitive genetic system that nature fiddled around with and finally decided to evolve into RNA . "
Other researchers have tried to manufacture a similarly proto- genetic material , but their efforts have proved inefficient and relied on the chemical reaction - enhancing presence of enzymes which probably did not exist in Earth 's early conditions .
But according to the researchers , these experiments assumed that RNA — which resembles one - half the spiraling ladder form made famous by DNA — would assemble block by block , with each segment containing a fully - formed rung - and - backbone piece .
Instead , the researchers searched for a complete chemical spine to which the rungs , or nucleobases — A , T , C and G in the genetic code — could then attach .
Rather than using the sugar - and - phosphate backbone found in RNA and DNA , they identified a peptide , or a small molecule composed of primordially present amino acids , that also functioned as a backbone .
" In terms of prebiotic chemistry , this is a conceptually different way of forming that genetic polymer , " said Leman .
The nucleobases automatically adhered to the peptide in a loose fashion , detaching and attaching themselves until stable .
When mixed with single strands of DNA or RNA in water at room temperature , the tPNA molecules arranged themselves in complementary strands , perhaps echoing the eventual ability of those genetic materials to duplicate themselves .
Ghadiri cautioned that tPNA should n't be seen as a direct analog of early life , but as demonstrating the plausibility of a similar system .
" If you 're thinking that at some point these types of molecules are going to hand off to the RNA world , they should have cross-pairing interactions , and be capable of interacting with RNA , " he said .
" We show both . "
Antonio Lazcano , a National Autonomous University of Mexico biologist and expert in early Earth chemistry who was not involved in the study , called the work a synthetic biology breakthrough , but repeated Ghadiri 's caveat that chemical bridges between the pre-RNA and RNA worlds are " completely unknown and can only be surmised . "
According to University of Manchester organic chemist John Sutherland , who co-authored the * Nature * study showing how RNA 's ingredients could have formed , the new research is less important in providing primordial insight than in furthering the eventual creation of life in a laboratory .
" Ghadiri 's important and highly innovative new work potentially relates to the origin of life as we do n't yet know it , " said Sutherland .
Life 's emergence took billions of years , a process now being compressed into the passage of a few human generations .
" The possibility that humans could come up with an alternative biology that outdoes that which produced us is a mind - freeing and mind - bending concept , " he said .
The researchers are now searching for different types of peptide backbones that could support more complex and stable genetic structures .
" The next phase is to see whether these molecules are capable of self - replication , " said Ghadiri .
" That 's another two or three years of work . "
Asked how long it would take before fully synthetic life could be coaxed from an inert chemical mixture , Ghadiri said , " Soon .
If not in our lifetime , then the next .
In my opinion , it should n't be longer than that . "

SAT Solvers : Is SAT Hard or Easy ?
Are practical SAT problems easy or hard ?
Ed Clarke , a Turing Award winner , was at the recent NSF workshop on design automation and theory .
Ed has , for approximately three decades , worked successfully on advancing the state of the art of verification , especially that of hardware .
Today I want to talk about a discussion that came up at the workshop .
Ed and others stated that in “ practice ” all the instances of SAT that arise naturally are easily handled by their SAT solvers .
The questions are simple : why is this true ?
Does P=NP ?
What is going on here ?
I have know Ed since he presented his first paper at the 1977 POPL , a conference that I used to attend regularly .
He proved a wonderful theorem about an approach to program correctness that was created by Steve Cook .
I worked on extending Steve ’s and Ed ’s work , my work appeared later that year at the FOCS .
Cook had a clever–not surprising it was clever–idea on how to circumvent the inherent undecidability of determining anything interesting about programs .
I will try to motivate his idea by the following program :
Search all natural numbers x , y , z ordered by the value of x+y+z , and if f( x , y , z ) =0 , then print x , y , z and stop .
Here is some polynomial .
Steve ’s insight was the reason this program is hard to understand has nothing to do with the complexity of the program .
Rather , it is all due to the domain complexity of the natural numbers .
Cook ’s brilliant idea was to figure out a way to “ factor ” out the domain complexity .
He did this by adding an oracle that would answer any question about the domain .
In the above program , this ability means that telling if the program halts is easy : just ask the oracle “ is there an so that ? ”
Sounds like a trivial idea .
But , wait .
If you have access to an oracle for the natural numbers , then anything is easy to determine about any program .
This would lead to a trivial theory .
Cook had to rule out the possibility that the oracle would be asked “ unnatural questions . ”
By this I mean that you might be able to use the fact the arithmetic is very powerful and encode the analysis of your program into an arithmetic formula .
Cook did not want to allow this .
The way he did this is cool : the analysis of the program has access to the domain oracle , but the analysis must be correct for all oracles .
Thus , if you try to encode information in some “ funny way ” , then for some domain (s ) your analysis is wrong .
This was the clever insight of Cook .
Steve showed that certain kind types of programs could be analyzed with such an oracle and any domain , while Ed proved that certain more powerful type programs could not .
I proved a necessary and sufficient condition on the type of programs for which Steve ’s method works .
My proof is quite complex –I try not to say that about my own work–but it really is tricky .
Look at the papers if you are interested , or perhaps I will do a full post on this work in the future .
Thanks Paul
Before we turn to SAT solvers , I want to thank Paul Beame who has helped tremendously with this post .
I thank him profusely for his time and effort .
Think of this a guest post , but all the errors and mistakes are mine .
Anything deep is due to Paul .
SAT is hard , SAT is easy , SAT is hard ,
There is something fundamentally strange going on .
The theory community is sure that P NP , and so SAT is hard .
The solver community is sure that they can solve most , if not all , of the problems that they get from real applications , and so SAT is easy .
What is going on here ?
In my post on P=NP is Ill - posed , I raised some of the many ways that the P=NP question could play out .
There are plenty of ways that both the theorists and the solvers could be right .
As you know I like to question conventional wisdom , and in particular I am not convinced that P=NP is impossible .
But , I also question the conventional wisdom of the solvers that practical SAT problems are all easy .
So I feel a bit like we are living in Wonderland with Alice : ( with apologies to Lutwidge Dodgson aka Lewis Carroll . )
“ There is no use trying ; one ca n’t believe impossible things , like P=NP . ”
Alice says .
“ I dare say you have n’t had much practice .
When I was your age , I always did it for half an hour a day .
Why , sometimes I ’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast , like L=P , P=NP , NP=QBP , and ” The Queen replies .
SAT Solvers
In order to start to understand the situation let me first discuss the state of the art in SAT solvers .
I have used many comments from Paul , and also have relied on the pretty survey paper of Carla Gomes , Henry Kautz , Ashish Sabharwal , and Bart Selman .
This is definitely not my area of expertise , but I hope I can get the main points right .
As always all the errors are mine , and all the correct stuff is due to Paul or my ability to transfer the facts correctly from the survey .
Please let me know if I made any mistakes .
My understanding is SAT solvers divide roughly into two classes : complete and incomplete .
Complete means that the algorithm always finds an assignment if the problem is satisfiable ; incomplete means the algorithm may not .
The complete ones all use Martin Davis , Hilary Putnam , George Logemann , and Donald Loveland ( DPLL ) as a basis , but usually add sophisticated methods to make the algorithm go faster .
The incomplete methods tend to be different variations on random walk methods .
I known the D and second L well in DPLL : I known Davis for a long time and Loveland taught me logic while I was a graduate student at CMU .
The DPLL method is based on a backtracking method .
It assigns literal values and makes recursive calls to the simplified set of clauses .
If it gets stuck , then it backtracks and continues searching .
This method was initially called the DP method , until Logemann and Loveland who added two additional insights : take advantage of unit clauses and “ pure ” literals .
If a literal occurs , for example , always as and never as , then all clauses with can be removed .
Such a literal is called pure .
Paul points out the history and relationship from DP to DPLL is more complex , but I will leave that out .
Paul says that there are three keys to fast solvers today .
Branching heuristics that take into account where the action is based on the learned clauses .
One method is called VSADS and uses a weighted majority algorithm .
Clause learning which is a way of adding new clauses to the formula based on failed branching .
This can potentially help avoid large segments of the search .
Watched literals that allow the modified formula to be kept implicit .
This makes the propagation of the updates fast and tends to keep everything in the cache .
Like all backtracking methods , the selection ( 1 ) of which literal to set next is extremely important .
The same is true , for many other search algorithms .
For instance , linear programming with a good pivot rule seems to take polynomial time in practice .
Another example , is searching game trees with search .
If the “ best ” move is always used first , then the search tree is dramatically decreased in size .
There are many additional ideas that are covered in the survey .
One key idea is to make random decisions when to restart the backtracking .
The method is restarted even if it is not stuck .
The methods usually keeps the clauses already set to guide the next restart ( 2 ) of the backtrack algorithm .
Finally , note that idea ( 3 ) is an implementation one , which is of great importance on modern computers .
No doubt similar methods will soon be needed due to the rise of many - core processors .
The second class of SAT solvers is based on random walk technology .
These algorithms start at a random assignment and then use various local moves to change the assignment , hopefully toward the correct one .
Some algorithms make local improvements , some allow plateau type moves , others use more complex types of random walks .
There is evidence that these methods can work well on random SAT problems as well as some of those from real applications .
There also are methods that are random , but are fundamentally different .
A relatively new one is called Survey Propagation ( SP ) , which was discovered in 2002 by Marc Mézard , Giorgio Parisi , and Riccardo Zecchina .
The solvers based on SP are like belief propagation methods that are used for decoding error - correcting codes .
In each iteration about of the literals are set .
When the formula density gets too low , SP switches to a random local search algorithm .
Paul points out that the survey seems to not say anything about this part of SP .
Why are Real SAT Problems Easy ?
The solvers know well that any DPLL type method cannot be fast on all SAT problems , based on known lower bounds for resolution .
However , that still does not explain why these methods seem to work so well in practice .
Even the contests–see this site–which are held regularly on solving SAT divide the problems given to the solvers into three classes :
randomly generated sets of clauses ;
hand crafted sets of clauses ;
examples from “ real ” applications .
Paul points out that he would take Ed Clarke ’s contention that “ SAT is easy in practice ” with a grain of salt .
First , before SAT the verification community was trying to solve PSPACE - hard problems , so SAT is a great advantage since is only NP - complete .
Second , the SAT solvers work except when they fail –reminds me of an Amazing ( James ) Randi story , for another time .
The real difficulty is that no one understands what causes a SAT solver to fail .
Tools that have this type of unpredictable behavior tend to create problems for users .
Many studies of human behavior show that it ’s the variance that makes tools hard to use .
Paul goes on to say that one of the research directions is the discovery of why SAT solvers fail .
One problem is symmetry in the problem , since large amounts of symmetry tend to mess up backtracking algorithms .
This is why the Pigeon Hole Principle is a “ worst case ” for many SAT methods .
Even if solvers cannot do as well as Ed claims , I still think that one of the most interesting open questions for a theorist is why do the algorithms do so well on many real problems ?
There seem to be a number of possible reasons why this behavior is true .
I would love to hear about other potential reasons .
The real problems may have sufficient entropy to behave like actual random SAT problems .
Mike Mitzenmacher suggested this idea to me .
For example the SP method can handle over one million clauses of randomly generated sparse clauses , according to Selman .
The real problems may have small tree width .
More precisely the graph that describes the interaction of the literals has small tree width .
If you do not know this concept please check here .
Suffice it for now that many search problems with tree width and size can be solved in time order .
See this paper for results that relate to this .
The real problems may have some modular structure .
Clearly , if a problem comes from modeling a hardware circuit , the SAT clauses may have special structure .
They may not have small tree width , but they should have some additional structure .
What this structure is and how it interacts with the SAT solvers is unclear .
Luca Trevisan suggested this idea to me .
One problem that I pointed out is that many crypto-systems , such as AES , have a very structured hardware circuit .
Yet the folklore , and published papers , suggest that SAT solvers do not break these systems .
So the notion of modular SAT problems is perhaps yet to be found .
The real problems may have been selected to be easy to solve .
A hardware designer at Intel , for example , may iteratively refine her design so that the SAT solver can succeed in checking that it satisfies its specification .
This is a kind of “ natural selection ” : perhaps designs that cannot be checked by the solvers are modified .
The closest thing that theorists study that has a bit of this flavor is famous smooth analysis technology of Dan Spielman and Shang - Hua Teng .
Maybe for every practical design there is one “ nearby ” that can be checked efficiently .
Suresh Venkatasubramanian suggested this idea to me .
I think it raises some nice questions of how to model smooth analysis in a discrete domain .
The real problems may have More ideas needed .
Please feel free to suggest some other ideas .
Open Problems
I keep quoting Alan Perlis about the power of exponential algorithms .
I will soon start to quote Paul Beame who has made some great comments on this issue .
Somehow we teach our theory students that exponential algorithms are “ bad . ”
This seems quite narrow and theorists should look at the design and analysis of more clever algorithms that run in exponential time .
I also think another issue raised here is the reliance we place on the worst case model of complexity .
As I stated in an earlier post there is something fundamentally too narrow about worst case complexity .
The fact that SAT solvers seem to do so well on real problems suggests to me a problem with the worst case model .
How can we close this gap between theory and practice ?
Perhaps the main open problem is to get theorists and solvers more engaged so that we can begin to build up an understanding of what makes a SAT problem easy , and what makes it hard .
And what are the best algorithms for “ real ” SAT problems .
A woman has been attacked with bleach in front of her family by a group of youths she had asked to be quiet during a showing of the new Harry Potter film .
It happened as the woman , her husband and two children ate in a restaurant after leaving the Vue Cinema on Kirkstall Road in Leeds on Sunday .
It is feared that the 46 - year - old , who suffered burns , may have permanent damage to her eyes , police said .
She had asked a group of five or six youths to stop talking during the film .
West Yorkshire Police said the same group shouted abuse at the family as they left the cinema .
The family then went to Frankie and Benny 's restaurant , where two of the youths came in and threw the bleach on to the woman 's head and back .
They ran away and got into a waiting car .
' Totally unprovoked '
The woman was taken to Leeds General Infirmary where she received treatment for burns .
She has since been released , but is being assessed for any signs of permanent eye damage .
Det Insp Richard Baildon of West Yorkshire Police said : " This was a completely unwarranted attack on a mother out with her family , the consequences of which could have been much worse .
" It was a deliberate act designed to cause pain and injury and it was totally unprovoked and unnecessary . "
Police described the attackers as a light - skinned , mixed - race male , aged about 19 and of athletic build , and a " fat " Asian boy , aged about 14 .
The driver of the car was described as white , aged 17 to 18 , with light - coloured crew - cut hair .
A black girl , aged about 14 , was also with the group , police said .
( CNN ) -- Portugal striker Cristiano Ronaldo has been unveiled as Real Madrid 's new number 9 , in front of 80,000 passionate fans at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium , after his world record $ 130 million move from Manchester United .
Cristiano Ronaldo is paraded in front of 80,000 passionate supporters at a packed Bernabeu stadium .
The event marked the culmination of a two - year pursuit of the player by the Spanish club , which defied the global downturn with exorbitant spending to capture the man voted the world 's best footballer by world governing body FIFA .
" I have made my childhood dream a reality -- to play for Real Madrid , " Ronaldo told the packed stands .
" I am just so happy to be here , " he said to a rapturous reception from the gathered thousands .
" I really did n't expect a jam - packed stadium -- this is truly impressive . "
Watch tens of thousands greet Ronaldo »
Ronaldo is the fourth major signing of the close season by Real , as the club , fueled by the financial muscle of returning president and property magnate Florentino Perez , aims to recapture the glory that has seen them win more European Cups than any other side .
The transfer of Brazil 's Kaka and defender Raul Albiol was followed by the arrival of French striker Karim Benzema from Lyon on Thursday , as Perez assembles a second wave of " galacticos , " following his previous success with big-names such as David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane .
Benzema 's transfer fee is reported to be in the region of $ 60 million , taking Madrid 's spending to an astonishing $ 300 million this in recent months .
Perez claimed Monday 's event " might not have a precedent . "
" We are very satisfied to know that you made the firm decision to play for Real Madrid , " Perez said .
He told Ronaldo what to expect from his new adoring fans , adding : " They will ask of you the very best , but will also give you their all . "
The attendance at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium swamped the estimated 55,000 that watched Kaka 's unveiling last Tuesday , and is believed to be the biggest turnout for a presentation since a reported 75,000 saw the arrival of Diego Maradona at Napoli from Barcelona in 1984 .
Watch fans line up before Ronaldo 's unveiling »
Earlier , Ronaldo successfully completed his medical with Madrid after landing in the Spanish capital just after midday .
Carlos Diez , Real Madrid 's medical chief , told teh club 's Web site : " ( Ronaldo ) is in perfect condition and very eager to start the season as soon as possible . "
Ronaldo had already undergone initial medical tests with the Spanish giants while on holiday in Portugal last month , which the player claimed at the time had gone " perfectly " .
Diez added : " He has an extraordinary cardiac and lung capacity .
We have complemented everything that we already did in Portugal and done all the specific tests .
" Now we will be able to start working using an individual plan in order to improve his performance .
For him ( Ronaldo ) , it 's a dream , and this dream starts to convert into reality from now . "
The number nine jersey was recently vacated by Argentine striker Javier Saviola who joined Portuguese side Benfica last month .
Mafia - busting Italian magistrates have launched a major investigation into crooked windfarm projects in Sicily , according to reports .
It is suggested that large sums in government support have been collected for wind power stations which in many cases produce no electricity .
The Financial Times reported ( subscription required ) on the green energy scandals in Sicily over the weekend .
Italy has a very strong system of incentives for wind power , in which guaranteed prices of € 180 ( $ 240 , £ 160 ) per kilowatt - hour are offered to producers .
A normal European retail price for electricity is in the region of 10p .
These highly lucrative prices must often be paid even if no electricity is actually being produced - as when a wind farm exists but has no grid connection , or ( in the case of Sicily ) when power cannot be sold on the Italian mainland owing to limited capacity on undersea cables .
Meanwhile , with large sums of money at stake , no need in some cases to build a genuinely functional plant to qualify for the cash - and every project heavily dependent on local - government permits and votes - wind power is seen as a perfect Mafia opportunity .
“ It is a refined system of connections to business and politicians .
A handful of people control the wind sector .
Many companies exist but it is the same people behind them , ” Palermo anti-corruption prosecutor Roberto Scarpinato told the FT .
" Developers got public money to build wind farms which did not produce electricity . ”
“ Enough ! ” adds Rossana Interlandi , head of the Sicilian environment department .
“ Many speculators [ have ] made money on the backs of the government . ”
The FT reports that the Mafia have ways of ensuring that nobody else gets in on the green - power bonanza in their territory .
It appears that two wind towers were mysteriously destroyed after being shipped into the Sicilian port of Trapani from Northern Europe .
Along with Cosa Nostra in Sicily , equivalent groups such as the ' Ndrangheta in neighbouring Calabria are though to have achieved a similar grip on the wind industry across the Italian south .
The situation is now perceived as being so corrupt that there is a freeze on all new wind farms in Sicily , Calabria and Basilicata , and now a major Sicilian investigation is under way .
“ Sicily is blessed with sun and wind , " a nameless local official told the pink 'un , " but it is also cursed by the Mafia . ”
Local businessman Salvatore Moncada put it differently : “ The south has wind and sun but no proper rules . " . ®
Rumors are swelling that some parties may have taken Apple ’s secrecy policy to the extreme , causing one 25 - year - old employee at Foxconn , the manufacturing company for the iPhone , to commit suicide .
According to ND Daily , Sun Danyong , who had been handling a shipment of 16 iPhone prototypes , was set upon by Foxconn ’s Central Security Division after one of the prototypes went missing .
Unable to take the “ unbearable interrogation techniques , ” he jumped from a 12 - story building on July 16 .
Foxconn has already issued a statement apologizing for the incident and admitting that ah section chief of the Central Security Division , surnamed Gu , may have used “ inappropriate interrogation methods ” such as searching Sun ’s house , holding Sun in solitary confinement and possibly beatings .
Gu has been suspended without pay and the company is internally investigating the Central Security Division .
Sun ’s classmates ( he had just graduated from university and joined Foxconn in 2008 ) , said that before his suicide , he had talked to them about the interrogation techniques Foxconn ’s security guys had used – including “ laying hands ” on him , though he did not specify how .
Security officers that worked with Gu argued that it was unlikely – the security office is one large room staffed by 60 to 70 people .
While Sun had been taken behind a screen that obscured the rest of the room ’s view , witnesses would have been able to hear if he had been beaten .
But one of Sun ’s friends contended that he had never been a liar , and besides , “ the man had decided to die .
It ’s not like he would tell lies right before he did . ”
Foxconn spokesperson Li Jinming told reporters “ regardless of the reason of Sun ’s suicide , it is to some extent a reflection of Foxconn ’s internal management deficiencies , especially in how to help young workers cope with the psychological pressures of working life at the company . ”

In accordance with tradition , her father went to bury the bloody birth linens .
As he dug a hole , he suddenly shouted , “ Gold ! ” From that moment on , she wrote , her parents said , “ You do n’t belong to us ; you belong to the people . ”
What is indisputable is that from early on she was a determined and shrewd businesswoman willing to sell goods from a sack at the side of the road when necessary , buying and selling thousands of sheepskins or logs when she saw the chance .
As China ’s economy opened up in the 1980s , she expanded into real estate and flourished .
By the 1990s she was running trading companies all over Central Asia , had built a famous women ’s bazaar and then a seven - story department store in Urumqi , the capital of the region of Xinjiang , and ran a charity for Uighur women .
Her career had personal costs .
In an unthinkable violation of Uighur custom , and angering her relatives , she traveled for months at a time , leaving young children with a working husband or relatives .
“ Of course it was difficult for me as a woman to leave my children , ” she said .
“ But I found out that money is very important to the destiny of a nation , and I decided to find that money . ”
Five of her children are now in the United States , and have been working computers and phones night and day this week , she said .
Another five , including the two in prison , remain in China , and one lives in Australia .
In the mid-1990s , as Chinese officials heralded her as an example of ethnic success and even made her a member of the national legislature , she tried to work for change and never lost sight of her political dream , Ms. Kadeer said .
“ I was sincere in my interactions with the Chinese government .
I was hoping to solve the problems of the Uighurs , ” she said .
“ I still believe we can solve the problems . ”
But she started speaking out about Uighur grievances and she kept ties with her husband , by then a dissident living in the United States .
In 1999 she was imprisoned .

Climate scientists have warned of wild weather in the year ahead as the start of the global " El Niño " climate phenomenon exacerbates the impacts of global warming .
As well as droughts , floods and other extreme events , the next few years are also likely to be the hottest on record , scientists say .
In the UK , a Met office spokesman said yesterday that the El Niño event was likely to cause a hot , dry summer , following a warm June , but said could have other unpredictable effects on weather in Britain and north west Europe .
" Much depends on how much the El Nino deepens in the next few months . "
El Niño - " the child " in Spanish - was named by fishermen in Peru and Ecuador because the phenomenon arrives at Christmas there .
It is part of a natural meteorological cycle that happens roughly every 3 - 7 years and affects weather worldwide for a year or more .
It is caused by changes in ocean temperatures , with the first sign being abnormal warming in the Pacific .
Sea surface temperatures across an area of the Pacific ocean almost the size of Europe have now been increasing for six months and will inevitably trigger worldwide weather turbulence for the next year , said a spokesman for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) .
" An El Niño has started .
It has a significant influence on global weather , ocean conditions and marine fisheries .
Its impacts have included damaging storms , severe flooding and drought in Indonesia " , he said .
El Niño is also strongly linked to droughts in Africa , Australia and Asia , and wetter - than - normal weather in much of the US and South America .
There are growing concerns that its intensity and frequency may be affected by climate change .
At this stage , both US and Australian climate scientists say this may be a medium - strength El Niño , but they have warned the temperatures in the eastern Pacfic are still rising and it could develop further .
" Temperatures in the Pacific are around 1 °C above average , and sub - surface temperatures up to 4 °C warmer than normal . " said a spokesman for Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology .
The last major El Niño in 1998 killed over 2,000 people and caused billions of dollars worth of damage to crops , infrastructure and mines in Australia and Asia .
It led directly to forest fires in South East Asia , to a collapse of fish stocks in South America and a drought threatening 700,000 people in Papua New Guinea .
Strong El Niños frequently have long - lasting social and economic effects on countries .
The 1991 - 92 event led to the major droughts in Africa and food shortages that left 30 million people at risk of malnutrition and set back development for a decade .
Development groups yesterday said the arrival of a new El Niñowas worrying because it will add to the effects of climate change and the worldwide economic recession , which has led to hundreds of millions extra hungry people .
Oxfam said it had alerted its teams around the world .
" This could be the hottest year in known history .
Poverty and climate change is enough of a challenge : an El Niño will only make things harder , " said Steve Jennings , Oxfam 's disaster risk reduction manager .
" We are really concerned it will result in intense droughts in Southern Africa and floods in Eastern Africa . "
2009 has already been marked by an unusual weather patterns in SE Asia , and stubborn droughts and major floods in Australia , the US , China and Latin America .
India has been experiencing much weaker annual monsoon rains this year and searing temperatures .
Rains have been up to two weeks late with temperatures reaching the high 40 C in some areas .
Water levels in the Ganges , Indus , Narmada , Sabarmati , Godavari and other rivers of the Kutch were this week at dangerously low levels .
Droughts in Australia , Argentina and Northern China , some of the worst ever recorded , have reduced food supplies and led to major water problems .
A recent academic study of El Niño patterns even suggests the French Revolution was caused in part by an unusually strong El - Niño effect between 1789 - 93 , which resulted in poor crop yields Europe .
But the Noaa spokesman said not all not all effects of El Niño are negative .
" On the positive side , El Niño can help to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity .
In the US , it typically brings beneficial winter precipitation to the arid Southwest , less wintry weather across the North , and a reduced risk of Florida wildfires . "
Major recent El Niños :
1972 - 73 Peru :
The world 's largest fishery collapsed
1991 - 1992 : Southern Africa experienced one of its worst droughts , affecting close to 100 million people .
1994 - 5 : The US was hit with two of the most severe floods and storms ever recorded .
1997 - 8 : Africa experienced a major drought , Ecuador and Peru suffered over 10 times more rainfall than usual .
Malaysia , Indonesia and Brazil were hit by droughts leading to huge numbers of forest fires .
2002 -3 : The rise in sea surafce temperature was lower than other years but Australia suffered some of its worst ever droughts .

Mobile technology is finally starting to get really impressive .
But before things spin out of control , someone , please , figure out a better battery .
I had one of those " holy crap ! " moments yesterday during my quarterly visit to the gym .
With little effort , I was able to watch the Cubs game live on my iPhone , with impressive video quality , using MLB's At Bat app and AT&T's 3G network .
Finally , I thought , an advanced mobile operating system , a gorgeous screen , a great app , and AT&T working together as promised .
( Previously , I could n't get an AT&T signal even strong enough to check email from the gym , so for video to squeeze its way through , something good must be going on . )
An hour later , I was ready to leave , and I shut down the app. 30 % battery left !
Sure , this is a year - old iPhone , and I was doing probably the most processor - and battery - intense activity possible -- streaming live video , fullscreen , at full brightness .
But that 's just not going to work .
Someone , somewhere , needs to figure out a way to pack more power into tiny batteries so the promise of mobile computing and entertainment becomes feasible for more than two hours without having to tote around a charging cable and extension cord .
Sure , a lot of the battery efficiency is going to come from the rest of the gadget -- companies making processors and displays more energy efficient , etc .
But surely the battery concept could use help , too .
So who 's going to do it ?
Let us know if it 's you .
• Riot police move to break up crowds in Urumqi • Hundreds take to the streets wielding sticks and shovels
This article is more than 11 years old

A new wave of violence hit the capital of the Chinese region of Xinjiang today as thousands of angry Han Chinese rampaged through Urumqi , many smashing up Uighur stores and seeking vengeance for Han deaths at the weekend .
The authorities swiftly imposed a curfew on the restive city in an attempt to quell what the government has already described as the worst riots since the foundation of the People 's Republic 60 years ago .
Police attempted to disperse today 's mob with teargas as they headed towards a predominantly Uighur area , but many were still on the streets armed with whatever came to hand : wooden staves , iron bars , metal chains , nunchuks , shovels and axes .
Rioters smashed Uighur restaurants , threw rocks at a mosque and threatened residents of Uighur areas , although moderates in the crowd attempted to restrain them .
" They attacked us .
Now it 's our turn to attack them , " one protester told Reuters .
Another said : " We 're here to demand security for ourselves .
They killed children in cold blood . "
" It 's your time to suffer , " they shouted at some of the five - and six - storey apartment blocks lining Xinfu Road .
At least 156 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured since ethnic clashes broke out at the weekend .
Navi Pillay , the UN high commissioner for human rights , called for " great restraint " on all sides " so as not to spark further violence and loss of life " .
" This is a major tragedy , " she said .
There is no official breakdown yet of fatalities and casualties from Sunday 's violence , when an Uighur protest at mistreatment turned into full - scale ethnic clashes .
But witnesses described vicious and apparently indiscriminate attacks on Han Chinese people , although substantial numbers of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities were also injured .
Crowd members today told the Guardian that they believed Uighurs were coming back to attack them .
A respectable - looking middle - class woman carried a plank with a nail sticking out of it ; a young woman in a colourful , patterned top and white diamante mules clutched a piece of metal pipe .
A father held his young son in one hand and a length of wood in the other .
" We just want to defend our stuff , " said one man .
Few people seemed to know where rumours of further attacks had come from , but witnesses told Reuters that earlier in the day groups of around 10 Uighur men armed with bricks and knives had attacked Han Chinese passersby and shop owners until police arrived .
" They were using everything for weapons , like bricks , sticks and cleavers , " said Ma , an employee at a nearby fastfood restaurant .
" Whenever the rioters saw someone on the street , they would ask ' are you a Uighur ? '
If they kept silent or could n't answer in the Uighur language , they would get beaten or killed . "
It was not clear if anyone died in those reported attacks .
Authorities were initially slow to react as large numbers of Han Chinese gathered on the streets around the People 's Square in the centre of the city from around 2 pm .
But the city 's Communist party chief , Li Zhi , later took to the streets , using a bullhorn from the top of a police four - wheel drive to beg protesters to calm down and go home .
Police stopped the crowd entering an Uighur neighbourhood , but even teargas could not disperse them .
Journalists who tried to follow the crowd were bundled away from the scene " for their own safety " , as protesters turned angrily on some cameramen , shoving and shouting at them .
Elsewhere in the capital , officers pleaded with gangs to go home .
One told protesters holding wooden and metal bars : " Please stand away .
We are a nation united . "
A man replied : " Our brothers and sisters have been bloodied . "
Another officer told the mob : " We need to protect the law .
Please retreat .
Please trust us . "
Banks closed their doors and staff crouched inside , some holding staves , while hotel staff taped up windows .
Earlier in the day Chinese armed police and Uighurs clashed as residents erupted into protests during an official media tour of the riot zone , in the face of hundreds of officers .
Women in the marketplace burst into wailing and chanting as foreign reporters arrived , complaining that police had taken away Uighur men .
Authorities have arrested 1,434 people in connection with Sunday 's unrest .
Some hidden gems about America ’s most beloved faux - Mexican restaurant chain .
Taco Bell is a fascinating place .
Obviously .
Lets dig deeper into it than anyone ever has before …
1 | The Taco Bell Chihuahua was a failure
One of Taco Bell ’s most famous advertising campaigns ever … quite possibly their single most famous one … was the Taco Bell Chihuahua .
He ’d say “ Yo quiero Taco Bell ” and people loved him .
Well … they loved him enough to quote him … but NOT enough to actually go to Taco Bell .
During the Chihuahua era , 1997 to 2000 , Taco Bell sales slipped .
Finally , in 2000 , Taco Bell decided they needed to send the Chihuahua to doggy heaven ( as opposed to doggy hell , where you find Hitler ’s dog , Nixon ’s dog and one of the Lassies ) … and go back to marketing to the one demographic that keeps the chain alive : Young , kinda stupid men .
2 | Higher-ups at Taco Bell actually say “ Think outside the bun ” in meetings
I got this fact after having a discussion with a friend , who worked as an executive at Taco Bell for a few years .
You know how their ads used to use the slogan “ Think outside the bun ” ?
Well … that sentence actually found its way into their exec - level corporate - speak .
The bosses would ask for innovative ideas by saying , with absolutely zero sense of irony , “ Think outside the bun on this one . ”
It ’s a good thing Taco Bell did n’t have a tagline about paradigms or synergy , or the executives ’ entire jargon roster would ’ve been co-opted .
3 | Taco Bell was cut out of international versions of Demolition Man
Anyone who ’s a fan of Demolition Man… and I ’d venture to say that ’s a big Venn diagram overlap with fans of this website … remembers the gratuitous Taco Bell product placement in that movie .
For those who do n’t , in Demolition Man , Sylvester Stallone and Sandra Bullock discuss how , in the post - apocalyptic future , only one fast food chain has survived the “ fast food wars ” : Taco Bell .
It ’s not clear how much T - Bell paid for that kind of shout - out … but it ’s got to be pretty significant .
BUT … in the European versions of the film , Taco Bell did n’t get that shout out .
It went to Pizza Hut instead .
( At the time both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell were owned by PepsiCo . )
It ’s probably because there were n’t any Taco Bells in Europe .
4 | Taco Bell is trying to succeed … in Mexico
Back in the early ’90s , Taco Bell tried to expand to Mexico .
And it got laughed out of the country .
They regrouped and , about a year ago , made a run back across the border .
And in case you needed more proof that Taco Bell does n’t serve authentic Mexican food , this is it :
To succeed this time around , they ’re marketing themselves in Mexico as an AMERICAN food restaurant .
They ’re calling their tacos “ tacostadas ” , because calling them tacos would be insulting to authentic tacos … and to Mexican culture .
And … they have fries and soft - serve ice cream on the menu .
The goal with all this : Make Taco Bell an elite brand that appeals to rich Mexicans who want to associate themselves with anything considered American .
5 | You can get free Taco Bell for life if you ’re in one of their commercials
About five or six years back , a comedian I used to work with a lot , Daniel , got a role in a national Taco Bell commercial .
( It was the one where the guy sneaks onto a golf course . )
He told his agent that , as part of the deal , he wanted free Taco Bell for life .
They agreed .
So whenever he wants , he can call up and they ’ll send him stacks of Taco Bucks .
( More on those later in this column . )
Then , a few months ago , another friend of mine , Reggie , got yet another role in a national Taco Bell commercial .
( The one where guys in a boardroom distract people with melts . )
He did n’t know to ask for unlimited Taco Bell for life , so he did not receive this .
Therefore , I disseminate this first - hand information to let you know :
Should you become an actor and should that lead you to a role in a national Taco Bell commercial … ask for free Bell for life .
Please .
6 | Taco Bell uses at least 600,000 cows ’ worth of beef per year
According to Taco Bell ’s own website , they serve an average of 295 million pounds of ground beef every year .
So let ’s do some math .
The average beef steer yields approximately 570 pounds usable cuts ( the rest of his 1,150 or so pounds are unusable parts like bone and organs ) .
So , 295 million pounds of beef divided by 570 pounds of beef per cow comes out to … about 517,543 cows .
Per year .
For Taco Bell .
I ’m by NO means a vegetarian or trying to promote an anti-meat agenda … but does n’t something feel a little unsettling about Taco Bell requiring half a million cows to die every year ?
7 | Taco Bell changed its logo because of “ Demolition Man ”
Here ’s one more on “ Demolition Man ” .
When the movie came out in 1993 and prominently featured Taco Bell , it did n’t feature their traditional logo and colors ( brown , plus a red / green / yellow rainbow ) … it featured a pink and purple “ future ” logo .
Taco Bell took advantage of that to make the one and only logo color scheme change in their company history .
After “ Demolition Man ” is when Taco Bells started rolling out the new pink and purple logo .
It ’s not quite the same as the futuristic one …
I mean , look at the space - age font and bar code - looking bell !… but I guess it ’s the step in between the old logo and the future one .
8 | The least healthy Taco Bell menu item is the only one with the word “ salad ” in its name
There is one item on the Taco Bell that dwarfs all others in terms of unhealthiness .
And it ’s the one called a salad .
The Fiesta Taco Salad has 840 calories and 45 grams of fat .
A solid 370 of those calories and 21 of those grams of fat come from the fried taco shell in which it ’s served .
9 | The “ Bell ” in Taco Bell comes from the founder ’s last name
I never knew this .
In the early 1960s , a guy named Glen Bell wanted to open a miniature golf course .
But it fell through .
So he opened a hamburger restaurant .
But it did n’t do well .
But he kept Tin Cupping his entrepreneurial ventures and finally , in 1962 , he opened a restaurant in Downey , California , called Taco Bell .
And this idea worked .
Two years later he sold his first franchise and five years after that the company went public .
In 1978 , Pepsi bought the chain .
10 | Most Taco Bells no longer sell gift certificates
Two weekends ago , I was at my friend Noah ’s wedding .
[ My roommate ]
Paul was also there , and , following our policy of not buying our friends terrible gifts off their registry , Paul had the idea to buy Noah $ 100 worth of Taco Bell Bucks .
Noah loves Taco Bell as much as or more than almost anyone else we know ( I say almost because our friend Nathan loves it slightly more ) , so we agreed that this was a fantastic present .
Paul went to Taco Bell to buy the gift certificates … and was denied .
They did n’t sell them .
And this marked the third time in the past few months I ’d heard of someone trying to get a Taco Bell gift certificate and being turned away .
So this made my list because either ( 1 ) Taco Bell has stopped selling Bucks in their restaurants , and the public should be alerted or ( 2 ) someone from Taco Bell corporate will find this list , realize their restaurants are running amok and not selling gift certificates like they ’re supposed to , and crack some heads .
Either way , I ’ve done a good public service today .
11 | Taco Bell ’s free chalupa campaign has completely changed the Cleveland Cavaliers fans
I ’m from Cleveland , and I ’m a Cavs fan .
And I can tell you , if you talk to any fan at a home Cavs game and ask him what his priorities for the team are , he ’ll say ( 2 ) do whatever it takes to make LeBron happy so he stays when his contract is up in a few years and , more importantly ( 1 ) will the Cavs to score over 100 points tonight so he can get a free chalupa .
See , a few years back , Taco Bell started a promotion in Cleveland ( and , according to Wikipedia , in Portland as well ) where , if the home team scores 100 or more points , everyone in the stands gets a coupon for a free chalupa at Taco Bell .
And for some reason …
I have no idea why … people lose their freaking minds over this chalupa .
If you ever watch a Cavs game , pay careful attention to the last few minutes .
Whether the Cavs are up or down , if someone hits a shot to take them into triple - digits , the fans go INSANE .
It ’s completely illogical to me .
Chalupas cost like $ 2. NBA tickets cost like $ 40 .
That ’s like paying to go to a Billy Joel concert , having a good time … but going NUTS at the end because of some promotion where , like , if he plays Scenes From an Italian Restaurant as the second encore you get a free air freshener from Bed , Bath and Beyond .
And yet the Cavs fans live and die for that chalupa .
So thank you , Taco Bell , for completely scrambling the brains of the fan base .
The city ’s screwed up enough without you mindhumping us .

The 100 Greatest Writers of All Time : 100-76
by WILL HUBBARD and ALEX CARNEVALE
Other lists of this kind have been attempted , none very successfully .
We would like to stress that there is a crucial difference between " an important writer " and " a great writer " ; the latter is at this time our sole interest .
We will account for some of the names that did not make this list in a later dispatch .
There is nothing bad to say about anyone we list here , except in some cases that they were anti-Semitic or racist , hated women or hated men .
Literary crimes are usually relative , the caveats of which we shall enumerate :
100 . Joseph Conrad
Prose stylist nonpareil , he addressed the dichotomy of race , the loneliness of existence .
Heart of Darkness became a paradigmatic work .
It is hard to read today , but no less important .
Conrad was born to a family of Polish nobles .
He did quite a bit of gunrunning — see The Arrow of Gold .
You 've got to be batshit crazy to have an ambition , as a child , to visit Central Africa .
Recommended reading : The Secret Agent .
99 . Honoré de Balzac
The gestamtkunstwerk ( ' total work of art ' ) was all the rage in Europe early in the last century , but Balzac was on the case almost a hundred years before .
The man started writing just before midnight and worked until the sun went down the next day , eventually producing 100 novels and plays he called La Comedie Humaine .
We 've never really liked realism , but Le Pere Goriot is one of the mode 's best .
His mother came from a family of haberdashers .
There had to be a realism before there could be anything else , probably .
Recommended reading : " The Girl With The Golden Eye " , " The Marriage Contract " from La Comedie Humaine .
98 . Czeslaw Milosz
The greatest artist Poland would ever spawn , Milosz was still composing vital poetry until his death in 2004 .
He was constantly reinventing himself as a writer , but remained pretty much the same person after he took home the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1980 .
Born a Lithuanian , he became a U.S. citizen eventually , and dissected the intellectual attraction to communism in his masterpiece The Captive Mind .
97 . George Bernard Shaw
When we speak of ' wit ' in the theater we owe a debt to G. B. Shaw .
In fact , his scripts are so funny there 's hardly any reason to see them performed .
Pygmalion 's a great play , but his writing after WWI , most notably Heartbreak House , is darker and better .
96 . Wallace Stevens
Anti-semite ?
Sure .
A little old - fashioned ?
No doubt .
Was he one of the greatest poets of the twentienth century ?
No question .
You might say that Stevens never quite seems like himself , which is a towering accomplishment , because he never quite sounds like anyone else either .
Recommended Reading : ' Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird , ' ' Anecdote of the Jar , ' ' Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction ' .
95 . Rumi
We prefer to keep our religion , poetry , and booze in separate containers , but we know a lot of ex-hippie poets who swear by this guy .
The Coleman Barks translations are the gold - standard .
Born in modern - day Afghanistan , Rumi might as well have been a god .
94 . W.G. Sebald
No writer so little acclaimed in the first part of his life lived a second one in literary style in the West .
Sebald can reasonably contend to have invented much of this country 's creative nonfiction , and that is simply a glint of his admirers .
It is for good reason that he is taught in every graduate writing program in America : his novels of half - remembrance are brilliant interlocking art pieces ; seen whole they completely explain the violence in the middle half of the 20th century .
Recommended reading : The Rings of Saturn , The Emigrants .
93 . Robert Hayden
Hayden 's reputation is sure to be burnished by time .
Sure , he had influence on an entire generation of African - American poets ; but it is the sustained quality of his verses that we now have to contend with .
His was an intellect of constant seriousness , mapping the tragedy of his own heart .
His vision of language and life , in elegy or eulogy , is among the most impressive achievements in the arts .
Recommended reading : " Those Winter Sundays " , " October , " Selected Poems .
92 . Henry Miller
It 's fun to talk about Henry Miller at parties , and it took us a long time to realize that those who denounce him first made their acquaintance with Miller 's least representative work , Tropic of Cancer .
It 's an important book , but mainly for the history of American censorship .
The correct way to fall in love with Miller is through his exquisite nonfiction , most notably The Collosus of Maroussi and Big Sur and the Oranges of Heironymous Bosch .
91 . Robert Heinlein
Morality without end , purpose in the unreal .
He got so much better as a writer you can imagine him as one of his humble characters , toiling endlessly at something larger than himself and maybe impossible .
Is there any more fun you can have than Stranger in a Strange Land ?
To Sail Beyond Sunset ?
The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress ?
Starship Troopers ?
His juveniles are in some ways even more brilliant , bringing his dream of the stars to audience poised to inherit it .
Recommended reading : Farmer in the Sky , Tunnel in the Sky , Between Planets , Citizen of the Galaxy
90 . Lorine Niedecker
She was a recluse from Wisconsin who loved the Imagists .
She wrote to Louis Zukofsky , she kept writing in her bizarre island home .
Her nature poetry is better than anyone else 's nature poetry , her confessional poetry is fresher and more accessible than Plath or Sexton .
She was funny , and could be so sad .
She is the marvelous product of a strange and relentless world .
Recommended reading : " For Paul " , Collected Poems .
89 . George Eliot
Born Mary Anne Evans in 1819 , she wrote Middlemarch , Daniel Deronda , and Silas Marner , a threesome that must rank with any of the finer achievements of realism in fiction .
Yet her breadth of character and theme took on so much more .
This is a writer that had common sense , verve and intricate knowledge about the unfolding of human events .
Eliot 's ouvre is astonishingly mature for its time , and remains readable today .
88 . David Mamet
The quintessentially Jewish - American dramatist , his conquests of poetry and fiction were minor .
But he exploded the idea of the American play , creating an exciting new vernacular that brought crowds , excitement and controversy to the stage .
Famous for shutting down an all - female production of his masterpiece Glengarry Glen Ross , Mamet is an able theoretician , and maybe the most important Chicago Jew of all time .
Recommended reading : American Buffalo , The Duck Variations , Boston Marriage .
87 . Derek Walcott
Born on the island of St. Lucia in 1930 , Walcott is the most important poet of the Carribean , and an enduring voice in international letters .
His epic poems , bringing classicism to new places and forms , are major , and his command of the short poem is as adept as Auden's , a man Walcott admired greatly .
His " Eulogy to W.H. Auden " gets us every time .
Also , Walcott 's achievements in the theatrical realm are not to be overlooked .
Recommended reading : Omeros , The Arkansas Testament .
86 . Isak Dinesen
Denmark 's greatest writer , she was born Karen Dinesen , and she would write about the strangeness of her life in Kenya with her husband .
Carson McCullers arranged for her to meet Marilyn Monroe ; they danced on a tabletop together .
She wrote " Out of Africa " about her time with her husband in Kenya ; " Babette 's Feast " was her finest story .
She was more delicate with her prose than her storytelling , but both are worthy of a place here in this best of all possible lists .
85 . Maryse Conde
She is to the novel what Walcott is to the long poem .
Her intricate templates for Carribean novels are massively impactful reimaginings of Western themes , replete with other places and attitudes that she experienced .
Better than John Irving or Richard Price , her chronicling of the French attitude towards its possessions is her very autobiography .
Recommended reading : I , Tituba : Black Witch of Salem , Crossing the Mangrove , Segu .
84 . Joyce Cary
Relentlessly funny , incredibly inventive , and one hell of a writer .
His comic trilogy was the height of modernism at the time .
A voice that comes from the future , born with knowledge of the past , buoyed by the good humor of the present .
The much - traveled Irishman wrote the most sterling address to colonialism we ever had .
But mainly , he loved being an artist , and he was one of the finest his country would ever produce .
Recommended reading : The Horse 's Mouth , To Be A Pilgrim , Mister Johnson .
83 . Frank O'Hara
The gay American New York poet whose confessional and addictive personality made him funny and fast .
He wrote some of his poems in a room with his friends ; he fucked well and seriously ; he redefined the modern by looking in the mirror .
Sure he has a few misfires , but he 's so fearless , never afraid to take chances , to say something more revealing of himself than is absolutely necessary .
Recommended reading : " A Step Away From Them " , " Autobiographia Literaria " , the new Selected Poems .
82 . Gabriel Garcia Marquez
His story A Very Old Man With Enormous
Wings is a great relief to high school kids everywhere , its magic remedy to the stale fare of English authors overstuffing their textbooks .
Not sure what his master fiction 100 Years of Solitude is meant to remedy , but every college kid from Los Angeles to Prague has a copy .
Amazingly he is still alive , although he does not write anymore .
He said his piece .
Recommended reading : The Story of A Shipwrecked Sailor , An Evil Hour , The Autumn of the Patriarch .
81 . Ernest Hemingway
He was a talented novelist and short - story writer who was larger than life .
Like his less talented peer F. Scott Fitzgerald , his writing can occassionally seem dated and stale , but there is no denying his influence , and his finer work ranks with the supreme achievements of American fiction .
" Hills Like White Elephants " is great the first time you read it , but only the first time .
This remains true of much of his works .
We find it strange to think he was made of flesh and bone , and not smelted parts of several decrepit Civil War era bronze statues .
Recommended reading : A Moveable Feast , A Farewell to Arms .
80 . Carson McCullers
Her masterpiece The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was an immediate literary sensation .
Rarely is an important work so quickly recognized as such .
She wrote in a distinctly American idiom but her characters and themes were flawless and important .
After World War II , she lived mostly in Paris .
The Member of the Wedding is a slip of genius , a novel in which we can believe .
79 . Flann O'Brien
The Irish novel was never the same after this man conquered it .
Between At Swim Two Birds and The Third Policeman , O'Brien wrote the road map for experimental fiction , pulling the language apart before putting it back together again .
Born Brian O'Nolan , he married a typist .
He is the mad master , and his influence and import reigns supreme today , where his novels are still among the funniest , most inventive things ever to appear in English .
Recommended reading : Flann O'Brien At War : Myles na gCopaleen 1940 - 1945 .
78 . Julio Cortazar
Half - Belgian , half - Argentinian , he was the modern master of the experimental novel .
Hopscotch is the most infuriating , the funniest , most inventive .
His parents split up , he dropped out of school .
He later died of leukemia .
His titantic efforts in the short story genre have little competition in any era of history .
Cortazar gives the lie to the idea that there are many different literatures by making one of them all .
77 . Saul Bellow
The greatest novel of the 1950s begins , " I am an American , Chicago - born . "
The Adventures of Augie March makes The Catcher in the Rye look like a fucking children 's book .
He followed it up with a lively collection of novels that rank with the modern masters .
A little less success might have challenged him better , but as it is , he 's the greatest Jewish novelist of the 20th century , and that ain't bad .
76 . Jonathan Swift
He survives among his satirist peers for distinctiveness of vision and the impact of his classic essay A Modest Proposal , and the wonderfully still - readable Gulliver 's Travels , which basically foretold all of modernity better than anyone else ever would or could .

Almost from the moment the first atomic bomb was detonated in New Mexico in July 1945 , the menacing aura of the nuclear age has inspired visions of a world free of nuclear weapons .
Never more so than now , with the prospect that the Taliban could someday control Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons , North Korea might develop nuclear - tipped missiles , Iran may soon become a nuclear power and terrorists could get a bomb .
A growing army of nuclear abolitionists , concerned that proliferation could catch fire at any moment , is advancing the cause , led by Barack Obama , the first president to make nuclear disarmament a centerpiece of American defense policy .
Last week , Mr. Obama was mired in the gritty business of trying to coax Pakistan ’s president , Asif Ali Zardari , and the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , into a more cooperative relationship and a more determined fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Administration officials did not sound sanguine about the prospects , and the White House meeting might well have left Mr. Obama yearning for a more promising long - term strategy to keep the Taliban away from nuclear weapons .
Yet even as the allure of disarmament grows , the obstacles seem as daunting as ever .
Going to zero , as the nuclear cognoscenti put it , is a deceptively simple notion ; just about everyone who knows nuclear weapons agrees it would be wickedly difficult to achieve .
I was having an issue with the javascript innerText property today .
I was to lazy to convert the legacy code that I was working on to use proper DOM so I did some reading on the issue .
Turns out that FireFox does n’t use innerText at all .
Apparently the proper DOM property to use is textContent .
textContent does basically the same thing as innerText .
A not so pretty solution to this issue is to check at the start of the script whether the browser supports innerText or textContent .
I found a few resources that allowed me to copy and paste a few lines to make everything work .
This one which I found on coderlab is a little bulky but it gets the job done .
It checks which property is available and then forces the programmer to check that flag every time he wants to use the property .
var has InnerText = ( document.getElementsByTagName( " body " ) [ 0].innerText\ != undefined ) ?
true : false ; var elem = document.getElementById( 'id ' ) ; if (!hasInnerText ) { elem.textContent = value ; } else { elem.innerText = value ; }
This is the method I actually used .
I just or ’d the two different properties together and it seemed to work .
I guess one will always be undefined .
var message = elem.innerText || elem.textContent || " " ;
At least FireFox is following the standards unlike Internet Explorer which always needs special css and javascript .
Making everything work in Internet Explorer always adds hours onto development time …

Basically , the HCI literature is full of studies that have found that messaging ( in the broadest sense ) accounts for a significant percentage of user task interruptions .
But at the same time , messaging ( especially instant messaging ) is one of the most important applications for personal computing devices today .
One of the most fun too .
As we connect to an increasing number of information sources and friends , managing disruptions has become a real challenge .
The primary goal of the Message Tray is to provide the user with enough information to quickly assess an event but limit the severity and duration of the preemption .
Another important goal is to allow but not compel the user to respond to the event – again quickly and with limited disruption .
Another side effect of information overload and frequent disruption is that it far too easy to forget what we are doing and what we want to do .
So , the tray also provides an important reminding function for messages that the user has deferred addressing .
More specific goals include :
permit the user to stay focused on the primary task
provide awareness of new notifications
remind for unseen messages
direct attention to high priority messages and alerts
use an unobtrusive display
provide a uniform interface for messages , notifications , and alerts
allow the user to control the information display
As you can see from the mockup , the design of the Message Tray supports four modes of operation :
Hidden mode – tray is normally hidden off the bottom of the screen and remains hidden if the user is marked as “ busy ” Notification mode – shows a one line summary of the notification or message along with an icon Summary mode – a peripheral awareness ( or low detail ) mode showing an icon for each Message Source Detail mode – an interactive mode showing more detail about each Message Source
One of the major advantages this system will have over any other that I ’m aware of is the ability to quickly respond to messages from friends and coworkers without breaking my primary focus or switching away from my current application .
In fact , it becomes much easier to talk about your primary task .
We will be able to integrate chat deeply into the core GNOME experience .
At least for me , and pretty much everyone I know , that will be pretty damn cool .
You can read more about this and the rest of the GNOME Shell design concepts in a document I ’ve put together to try to explain it to myself and others .
I should emphasize that this is a living document that we ’ll try to keep up - to - date as things evolve .
Check it out and let me know what you think .
If you want to help or become involved in this evolution we ’d love to talk to you anytime this week and especially at the GNOME Shell design BoF on Thursday .
Please see Marina ’s blog post for some details of that .
Or drop by # gnome - shell on IRC or jump on the mailing list .
Are you a designer ?
A messaging and chat expert ?
A hacker extraordinaire ?
We need you !
Please stay tuned for more previews and design discussions in forthcoming posts .
Sir David Attenborough calls for UK baby limit to stop ' frightening ' population growth
Campaign : Sir David Attenborough says couples in the UK need to limit the number of children they have
Sir David Attenborough has warned British couples to limit the number of children they have to help quell the ' frightening ' growth in the world 's population .
The veteran broadcaster said the planet is under ' mounting pressure ' from an ' explosion in human numbers ' .
Sir David , 82 , said families in the UK need to control their number of offspring - a policy already adopted by China where parents are allowed just one child .
He said the environmental problems associated with an increasing population needed to be spelled out ' loud and clear ' before it was too late .
Sir David 's warning comes as the world 's population is predicted to hit 9.1 billion by 2050 - a 40 per cent increase from the current 6.8 billion total .
The UK population currently stands at 61 million .
Speaking on behalf of the Optimum Population Trust ( OPT ) , a campaign group that lobbies for tougher immigration laws and sterilisation , Sir David said : ' I 've seen wildlife under mounting pressure and it's not just from human economy or technology but behind every threat is the frightening explosion in human numbers .
' I 've never seen a problem that would n't be easier to solve with fewer people .
The same problem becomes harder , or ultimately impossible , when more people are involved .
' I support the Optimum Population Trust and their policies and I just wish the environmental groups would follow their lead and spell out this central problem of too many people , loud and clear . '
The father - of - two has campaigned for a number of years with the group for stricter measures to reduce the population of the UK and the world .
Warning : Sir David has spoken out on behalf of the Optimum Population Trust .
He is a patron of the organisation ( file picture )
Chairman of the OPT Roger Martin said Sir David had finally ' broken a taboo ' by speaking out about population growth .
' Implying that our numbers can continue to grow forever is a silent lie that encourages us to ignore the vital need to stabilise our numbers , ' Mr Martin said .
" This absurd taboo betrays our children because eventually nature will reduce the population for us by natural means such as famine , disease and war .
" David 's breaking of the taboo should encourage others in the green organisations and the government to follow suit before it 's too late .
Founded in 1991 , the OPT campaigns for a voluntary decrease in the UK population by not less than 0.25 per cent a year .
It has launched a ' Stop At Two ' online pledge to encourage couples to limit their family 's size .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Increasingly acidic oceans and warming water temperatures due to carbon dioxide emissions could kill off the world ’s ocean reefs by the end of this century , scientists warned on Monday .
Corals are seen at the Great Barrier Reef in this January 2002 handout photo .
REUTERS / Centre for Marine Studies , The University of Queensland / Ove Hoegh - Guldberg / Handout
The experts told a meeting in London the predicted pace of emissions means a level of 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere will be reached by 2050 , putting corals on a path to extinction in the following decades .
The two dozen coral reef specialists and climate change exerts represented universities , government research offices and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
“ The kitchen is on fire and it ’s spreading around the house , ” Alex Rogers of the Zoological Society of London and the International Program on the State of the Ocean , said in a statement .
“ If we act quickly and decisively we may be able to put it out before the damage becomes irreversible . ”
Oceans absorb large amounts of CO2 emitted by the burning of fossil fuels .
But scientists say the oceans are acidifying as they absorb more carbon , disrupting the process of calcification used by sea creatures to build shells as well as coral reefs .
Researchers around the world have been urging governments to take more account of such threats to the oceans in a new U.N. treaty on fighting global warming due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
Coral reefs -- delicate undersea structures resembling rocky gardens made by tiny animals called coral polyps -- are important nurseries and shelters for fish and other sea life .
They also protect coastlines , provide a critical source of food for millions of people , attract tourists and are potential storehouse of medicines for cancer and other diseases .
PATH TO MAJOR DEGRADATION
“ If CO2 is allowed to reach 450 ppm , as is currently widely regarded as being the most optimistic threshold target for world leaders to agree at Copenhagen , we will have put the world ’s reefs on a path to major degradation and ultimate extinction , ” John Veron , the former chief scientist of the Australian Institute of Marine Science , told the meeting .
“ Such a catastrophe poses a dire threat to the future wellbeing of all humanity . ”
The scientists agreed that governments should strive for a level of 320 parts per million of carbon dioxide , saying 360 was a breaking point for reefs to survive .
At the current level of 387 parts per million of carbon dioxide , reefs are in serious decline , they said .
This will have a future knock - effect that threatens other marine and coastal ecosystems .
Coral covers about 400,000 square km of tropical ocean floor , but needs sustained sunlight , warmer waters and high levels of carbonate to flourish .
The biggest is the Great Barrier Reef , a collection of 2,900 reefs along 2,100 km of Australia ’s north east coast in a marine park the size of Germany .

POLAND , June 19 , 2009 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) – The Polish newspaper " Rzeczpospolita " , a major conservative Polish daily , has caused a commotion among homosexualist groups in the country by running a cartoon in its paper edition on Monday , June 15 .
The cartoon shows two men getting “ married ” in the background , while in the foreground a man tells a goat , “ We 'll just wait until these two gentlemen get married and then it 's our turn . ” ( see the cartoon here )
“ We were used to the homophobia of your paper , but this time the border of rudeness has been crossed , ” said Homiki.pl , a homosexualist website in a letter to the editor of Rzeczpospolita .
“ We demand an apology on the pages of your paper .
We have our dignity and we also deserve respect . ”
The letter also threatens Rzeczpospolita with lawsuits , saying , “ Let us remind you that in 2006 , at a court in Poznañ , four lesbians forced city council members to apologize for comparing homosexuality to zoophilia . ”
The cartoon was drawn by Andrzej Krauze , a Polish cartoonist living in the UK .
Upon learning of the threats from the pro-homosexual groups , he laughed , saying , “ This only proves that the cartoon message was correct and that I was able to represent the whole absurdity of so - called civil unions . ”
He also pointed out that many countries have registered associations of zoophiles and pedophiles that wish to have their perversions legalized .
“ I am sure that in coming years , some of these groups , especially animal lovers will achieve their goals , ” Krauze said .
The reference may be to a registered Dutch political party called PNVD , a Dutch acronym that translates into " brotherly love , freedom and diversity , ” whose party planks consist of working towards the legalization and acceptance of pedophilia , pornography , bestiality and easy availability of soft / hard drugs .
The party also lobbies for private possession of child pornography , the right of children to smoke , drink and vote at the age of 12 , to use " soft " drugs like marijuana at 12 and " hard drugs " like cocaine and heroin at 16 .
( see : A Look Into the Future ? : Dutch Party Pushes Pedophilia , Pornography , Bestiality , Soft / Hard Drugs )
LifeSiteNews.com has also reported in the past on the encroachment of the approval of bestiality into the mainstream , and the rise of bestiality in jurisdictions that have embraced homosexual " marriage . "
Bestiality has in recent years been explicitly endorsed by well - known Princeton " bioethicist " Peter Singer and by PETA .
( See below for links to coverage )
Krauze says he does not fear any legal repercussions because of his cartoon : “ I live and work in the UK .
Here , satirical cartoons , with the exception of those pertaining to Muslims , are treated like satire , not a battlefield , ” said the artist .
Other Polish journalists have reacted to the tizzy created by the cartoon , writing satirical essays and poking fun at the homosexualists who are threatening legal action against the newspaper .
Well - known opinion journalist Maciej Rybinski published a mock letter to the editor in today 's Rzeczpospolita , impersonating a female goat who is offended by the cartoon , because it suggests that human - goat sexual relationships are homosexual in nature .
Rybinski writes :
" Dear Editor in Chief
" It was with outrage that I myself and our whole community saw the cartoon by Andrzej Krauze published in RZECZPOSPOLITA .
To suggest that shegoats in stable relations with men should have any homosexual tendencies is a scandal , an offence and slander .
Putting an equation sign between gays and goats is a testimony to the author 's ignorance and bad will .
" Leading sexologists have long ago established that relations between female goats and men - inter - species sexual relations - are heterosexual in nature .
Such relations have a long historical tradition and are mentioned in the oldest written sources , including the Bible .
To ridicule them is barbaric obscuration and backwardness .
" Also in our community , sex between male goats and men is treated as an abuse of the norm , at least a promiscuous perversion .
That 's why we think that mixed human - goat marriages , as opposite - sex institutions , are in accordance with nature .
To consider them equal or even worse to homosexual marriages is irresponsible and reprehensible .
" Your paper has discredited itself by publishing this image hostile to goats .
I regret to inform you that the Association of Liberated Goats has made a decision to eat up the whole circulation of the incriminated issue of RZECZPOSPOLITA , at the same time reserving the right to pursue legal action .
We also have the support of sheep on this issue .
" Regretfully and without respect to you , shegoat Mecka from Polonina "

Woman holds knife to boy in Vallejo market
A 7 - year - old boy was accosted by a woman with a steak knife in a Vallejo grocery store before his parents fought her off , police said today .
The boy was standing with his family in the produce aisle of the Grocery Outlet at 66 Admiral Callaghan Lane ( links.sfgate.com / ZHTC ) when 47 - year - old Dana Stevenson of Vallejo walked up to him about 12:10 p.m.
Saturday , police said .
Stevenson grabbed the boy around his neck in a chokehold , produced a steak knife and began rambling about the Chinese Mafia and Michael Jackson , police Lt. Lee Horton said .
Stevenson then began dragging the boy from one end of the produce aisle to the other , Horton said .
The boy 's father grabbed Stevenson from behind and forced her arms up and away from the child , police said .
The boy 's mother grabbed her son and took hold of the assailant 's hand at the same time .
The mother suffered a laceration to the palm of one of her hands while struggling with Stevenson , Horton said .
Store employees and other shoppers helped to detain Stevenson until police arrived .
The boy suffered abrasions and redness to his neck and was " quite shaken up , " Horton said .
The family did not know Stevenson , police said .
She was arrested on suspicion of felony child endangerment , kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon .
There is something about a baby that gets a mothering response from people .
And when a baby is in distress , a mom 's instinct is to rush over and help the little one .
Meet Anjana , a chimp who lives at TIGERS ( The Institute of Greatly Endangered Species ) in South Carolina .
Anjana stepped in to help zookeeper China York care for a pair of rare white tiger cubs after their mother became spooked and dangerous following hurricane Hanna 's visit to the area .
This is a role Anjana knows well .
She 's been nurturing and fostering many of the Institutes 's babies as China 's unofficial ' assistant ' .
TIGERS founder Dr Bhagavan
Antle said : " Anjana has joined China in caring for baby animals and she helps China raise them . "
" She has acted as a surrogate mother to leopards , lions and orangutans and has done the same with these baby white tigers . "
" She gives them a bottle and lies with them - she is a great assistant . "
TIGERS has bred and reared many rare and talented animals .
This year they unveiled their latest " liger " cub - bred from a lion father and a tiger mother .
The institute has 45 big cats , including white - and - red - striped golden tabby tigers - one of the rarest big cat breeds .
There are also bears , other primates and an African elephant .
Dr Antle concludes : " People think it is dangerous to get so close to wild animals but the handlers have been with them since they were cubs and have developed a special friendship based on love and respect . "

Many fathers these days are well acquainted with carpooling kids to after - school sports , changing diapers and other stereotypically “ mom ” duties .
But the do - it - all dad is not happy with his performance , and he lags behind mom and even the household pet in terms of closeness to the kids .
He 's lucky if he even gets a card on Father 's Day , statistics show .
For respect , the modern family guy has to turn to his wife .
A recent survey finds that while it ’s tougher being a dad today than it was a generation ago , most moms give them gold stars for their domestic work .
The researchers suggest the rise in dual - income families provides much of the push to get dads onboard in family matters .
“ Dads used to just have to go to work , come home , dinner was on the table , ” said researcher Kim Parker of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press in Washington , D.C.
“ They did n’t have to get as involved in the nitty - gritty of parenting as they do now ; that ’s my instinct . ”
Dad scores
The results are based on the Pew Research Center ’s Social Trends Survey conducted between February and March of this year , which included more than 2,000 telephone interviews with a nationally - representative group of U.S. adults ages 18 and older .
About 60 percent said fathers have it tougher now than they did 20 or 30 years ago .
Dads ’ biggest fans are working moms .
More than 70 percent of married women who work at least part - time and raise young children said fathers are doing as good a job or better at childrearing compared with a generation ago .
Men are their own harshest critics , with 55 percent of those surveyed believing they are doing a worse job parenting today than in the past .
Mom ( and pets ) rule
Domestic dads have yet to edge out their wives when it comes to “ motherly love . ”
In a 2005 Pew survey , twice as many respondents reported they would turn to their mothers in times of crises as opposed to their fathers .
Nearly 90 percent reported close ties with their mothers compared with less than 75 percent reporting the same for dads .
The sentiment ( or lack thereof ) could be reflected in kid turnout on parent ’s special days .
While Mother ’s Day is the second most popular holiday for gift - giving ( following Christmas ) and the third - largest card - sending holiday , Father ’s Day ranks fourth on the card - sending list , according to Hallmark research and the National Retail Federation .
Pets outrank dads , too .
On average , pet owners gave higher relationship ratings to their cats and dogs compared with those given to fathers .
Men may not care much , though , because they do n’t base their personal wellbeing on bonds with their kids .
“ Men ’s relationships with their kids are less central to their own happiness , ” Parker told LiveScience , “ whereas women are so wrapped up in their relationships with their kids . ”
Men generally say the most important aspect of their personal happiness involves their relationships with their wives , not with their kids .
The opposite is true for women , who place more stock in mom-child ties than husband - wife relationships .
Jim Quinn , the lawyer representing CBS , called it “ a minor skirmish in a long battle ” and predicted that the fraud charge would be dismissed again because “ it ’s frivolous . ”
Image Dan Rather was anchor of the CBS Evening News .  Credit ... Saul Loeb / A.F.P. — Getty Images
He added of Mr. Rather ’s day in court , “ Was it favorable for him ?
Yes .
Was it meaningful ?
No . ”
CBS said in a statement : “ Today ’s rulings by Judge Gammerman were on technical and procedural issues , not on the merits of Mr. Rather ’s allegations .
Most of Mr. Rather ’s claims already have been rejected by the court and that has not changed .
We are similarly confident that Mr. Rather ’s re-pleaded fraud claim will be dismissed once the court reaches the actual merits .
We also await the appellate division ’s decisions on pending motions which , we believe will further curtail his claims . ”
The judge in the case , Ira Gammerman , of the New York State Supreme Court , ruled in Mr. Rather ’s favor on three motions , all of which could end up aiding his pursuit of background information about the panel of experts that CBS selected to look into “ 60 Minutes ” report .
Most significant may be documents that include e-mail messages between the panel members and a law firm it hired to do investigative work on the case .
The firm , K&L Gates , had opposed turning the documents over to Mr. Rather ’s lawyers on the grounds of lawyer - client privilege .
But Judge Gammerman ruled that the work done by the firm was not covered by privilege and ordered the documents be turned over to Mr. Rather ’s side within 10 days .
While some freethinkers have made contributions to science , the arts or the humanities , others are best known for exemplifying a sea change in human history – showing , by their lives , that one age was passing and another would soon dawn .
Just so is today ’s post on the life of an American freethinker who has the unique distinction of being the last man imprisoned in America for blasphemy : a courageous reformer and patriot by the name of Abner Kneeland .
Kneeland was born in Massachusetts in 1774 , the sixth of ten children and the son of a carpenter .
In 1801 , he became a convert to the Baptist church , underwent immersion baptism and began to preach .
But he soon got embroiled in doctrinal clashes with fellow believers , and his flirtation with Baptism did n’t last long .
By 1803 , he had decided he was no longer a Baptist , but a Universalist – an early liberal Christian denomination that did n’t believe in Hell .
He continued his work as a lay preacher , but now in the service of Universalism .
Kneeland continued as a traveling preacher for several years , but eventually settled down at a Universalist church in New Hampshire .
He served as an officer of the New England Universalist General Convention and helped to compile a new hymnal , though some of his verses , like this one , met with a lukewarm reception :
As ancient bigots disagree ,
The Stoic and the Pharisee ,
So is the modern Christian world
In superstitious error hurl’d .
He moved around over the next several years , from Massachusetts to Philadelphia to New York , and though he continued his work as a Universalist minister , his skeptical side was beginning to assert itself .
He read the writings of some of the era ’s most prominent religious skeptics , including the famous chemist Joseph Priestley and the Scottish utopian Robert Owen , and preached from the pulpit that he reserved the right to interpret the principles of Universalism in his own way .
Slowly but surely , he began drifting away from Christianity entirely .
The last straw came in 1829 when Kneeland willingly loaned out his church as a platform for a controversial guest speaker , someone we ’ve met before – the trailblazing freethinker and feminist Frances Wright .
No one else in New York City would give Wright a place to speak , and the appearance of the “ Red Harlot of Infidelity ” in a church was too much even for the liberal Universalists .
Kneeland was disfellowshipped by them and soon renounced Christianity altogether .
He published a book that same year , A Review of the Evidences of Christianity , which made it clear just how far his theological position had shifted :
Like many others , I once thought that a belief in future existence was absolutely necessary to present happiness .
I have discovered my mistake .
Time , a thousand years hence , is no more to me now , than time a thousand years past .
As no event could have harmed me , when I existed not , so no event can possibly harm me when I am no more .
By anticipating and calculating too much on future felicity , and dreading , or at least fearing , future misery , man often loses sight of present enjoyments , and neglects present duties .
When men shall discover that nothing can be known beyond this life , and that there is no rational ground for any such belief , they will begin to think more of improving the condition of the human species .
Their whole thoughts will then be turned upon what man has done , and what he can still do , for the benefit of man .
In 1831 Kneeland moved to Boston , where he became a lecturer at the newly formed First Society of Free Enquirers and started his own newspaper , the Boston Investigator , whose motto was : “ Truth , perseverence , union , justice – the means ; happiness – the end .
Hear all sides – then decide . ”
His weekly lectures , which drew as many as two thousand people , denounced the influence of religion on society and advocated the full equality of women , arguing that they should be permitted to use birth control , obtain a divorce , be paid equally for equal work , and be allowed to vote .
He also argued for the equality of the races and , most shockingly , in favor of interracial marriage .
He also made the acquaintance of some influential people , most notably the radical abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison .
Garrison had just arrived in Boston and was searching for a church or hall to rent to deliver lectures against slavery , but as with Frances Wright , seemingly no one was willing to give him the space .
Kneeland again came to the rescue , offering Garrison the use of Julien Hall , where he delivered his own lectures .
Garrison would later write , “ It was left for a society of avowed infidels to save the city from the shame of sealing all its doors against the slave ’s advocate . ”
But despite its political and philosophical ferment , Massachusetts in this era was no friend to freethinkers .
A still - enforced anti-blasphemy law from 1782 outlawed “ denying , cursing , or contumeliously reproaching God ” , and it was under this law that Abner Kneeland was arrested and charged for making statements like this :
1. Universalists believe in a god which I do not : but believe that their god , with all his moral attributes is nothing more than a chimera of their own imagination .
2. Universalists believe in Christ , which I do not : but believe that the whole story concerning him is as much a fable and fiction , as that of the god Prometheus …
3. Universalists believe in miracles , which I do not ; but believe that every pretension to them can either be accounted for on natural principles or else is to be attributed to mere trick and imposture .
4. Universalists believe in the resurrection of the dead , in immortality and eternal life , which I do not ; but believe that all life is mortal , that death is an eternal extinction of life to the individual who possesses it , and that no individual life is , ever was , or ever will be eternal .
Kneeland argued , unsuccessfully , in court that he was not an atheist but a pantheist .
The prosecuting attorney , meanwhile , argued that if he were not punished for his opinions , “ marriages [ will be ] dissolved , prostitution made easy and safe , moral and religious restraints removed , property invaded , and the foundations of society broken up ” .
( See any parallels ? )
In 1838 , he was found guilty and sentenced to sixty days in jail .
After serving his prison term , Kneeland moved to Iowa with the intent of forming a utopian community similar to Owen ’s and Wright ’s , but it did not survive after his own death in 1844 .
Nevertheless , his life had left its mark .
The uproar in Boston over his conviction , including numerous newspaper editorials defending the First Amendment and a petition to the governor signed by over a hundred prominent citizens , made such an impact that never again , in Massachusetts or anywhere else in America , was a freethinker imprisoned for violating blasphemy laws .
Although there were a few more sporadic trials ( most notably the 1886 Reynolds trial defended by Robert Ingersoll ) , Abner Kneeland ’s greatest accomplishment was to show clearly that laws protecting religious feelings were archaic and incompatible with an increasingly modern and enlightened society .

Bond is on a mission , as usual .
This time it ’s to make custom autocompletion dead easy in Irb .
Simply order Bond to complete arguments , methods or your own twisted regular expressions and they will be executed .
No questions asked .
Bond ’s Coordinates
Bond ’s getting old nowadays , regardless of what Hollywood says .
So old that I even got his coordinates :
gem install bond
Debrief
Let ’s say you want to autocomplete some quoted arguments for a couple of methods .
Here ’s how you could do that in Irb :
# Get rid of space and quotes as word delimiters in order to read the full line Readline .
basic_word_break_characters = " \t
`><=; |&{ ( " Readline .
completion_proc = proc { | input | begin case input when / ^\s * ( method1 ) \s * ( [ ' " ] ? ) (.*) $/ meth , quote = $ 1 , $ 2 % w {some args to autocomplete} .
grep ( /^ #{ $ 3 } / ) . map { | e | " # { meth } #{ quote } " + e } when / ^\s * ( method2 ) \s * ( [ ' " ] ? ) (.*) $/ meth , quote = $ 1 , $ 2 % w{more args to autocomplete} .
grep ( /^ #{ $ 3 } / ) . map { | e | " # { meth } #{ quote } " + e } else #
Default to irb's default autocompletion IRB : : InputCompletor :: CompletionProc . call ( input ) end # irb does n't handle failed completions nicely rescue Exception IRB : : InputCompletor :: CompletionProc . call ( input ) end }
In irb , this would look like :
bash > irb - rirb / completion >> # Copy and paste the above code # Autocompleting method1 >> method1 [ TAB ] method1 args method1 autocomplete method1 some method1 to >> method1 ' a [ TAB ] method1 ' args method1 ' autocomplete >> method1 ' au [ TAB ] >> method1 ' autocomplete
So is the above completion_proc horrible ?
No , as long as you do n’t mind the way the autocompletion looks and playing with Readline and Irb configuration .
Assuming you do , what happens when you start adding more completion cases ?
Do you really want to string together a long chain of case statements as irb does ?
Let ’s have Bond take a shot at the above :
# We are loading irb / completion to match the above .
Bond can work fine without it in irb. bash > irb - rirb / completion - rubygems #
This loads
Bond but it does n't take over completion yet . >> require ' bond ' # For Bond to handle completions , we must explicitly define a completion mission .
#
Order matters since the order they 're declared in is the order they 're searched .
>> Bond.complete ( : method= >' method1 ') { |input| %w {some args to autocomplete} } => true >> Bond.complete( : method=>' method2 ') { |input| %w{more args to autocomplete} } => true #
Works as above >> method1 [ TAB ] args autocomplete some to >> method1 ' a [ TAB ] args autocomplete >> method1 ' au [ TAB ] >> method1 ' autocomplete ' #
Anything not matched by the above completion missions defaults to irb completion >> $ std [ TAB ] $ stderr $ stdin $ stdout
Nice , autocompletion actually looks like it does in normal shells !
Note that Bond. complete searches your input for you by default .
We ’ll talk more about this later .
For Completion Geeks :
In the first example above , notice that the possible completions are the full lines of input .
This happens because we have to change the definition of a word to get the full line .
We have to hack the word definition because none of the stable Ruby versions have a method to fetch Readline ’s full line buffer .
Thankfully , Csaba
Henk wrote up a C extension for this in his Irb enhancements .
Bond comes armed with this C extension .
As a side note , future versions of Ruby will come with this Readline enhancement thanks to Takao Kouji ’s recent commit .
Autocompleting Files as Arguments
So we know Bond can handle irb ’s basic methods .
What about class methods ?
# Autocomplete with files / directories in the current directory >> Bond.complete ( : method= >" File.read " ) { |e| Dir.entries ( Dir.pwd ) } => true #
Let 's use it >> File.read '[ TAB ] .git/ LICENSE.txt README.rdoc Rakefile VERSION.yml bond.gemspec ext/ lib/ test / >> File.read ' L [ TAB ] >> File.read ' LICENSE.txt '
That ’s pretty easy .
Now what if we want to autocomplete through directories like we do in our shells ?
We could write one ourself or just use Readline :: FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC
:
# Pass : search= > false to turn off
Bond searching since FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC does it for us . >> Bond.recomplete ( : method= >" File.read " , : search= > false ) { |input| Readline :: FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC.call( input ) || [ ] } => true #
Test drive it >> File.read '[ TAB ] .git/ LICENSE.txt README.rdoc Rakefile VERSION.yml bond.gemspec ext/ lib/ test / >> File.read ' l [ TAB ] >>
File.read ' lib / >>
File .read ' lib / bond .[ TAB ] >> File.read ' lib/bond.rb ' # Since File.read does n't understand ~ , let 's improve the above completion proc >> file_completion = proc {|input| ( Readline : : FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC.call( input ) || [ ] ) .map {|f| f =~ /^~/ ? File.expand_path(f ) : f } } => #< Proc : [ email protected ] ( irb ) : 20 > >> Bond.recomplete : method= >" File.read " , : search= > false , & file_completion => true # Tilda test driving >> File.read " ~/[ TAB ] >> File.read " / Users/bozo / >> File.read " / Users/bozo/.alias . [ TAB ] >> File.read " / Users/bozo/.alias.yml "
Nice !
Now that we have a decent file autocompletion let ’s add it to all our File methods :
>> Bond.reset ; Bond.complete : method= >/ File\.(#{Regexp.union(*File.methods( false ) ) } ) / , : search= > false , & file_completion => true # Normal irb method autocompletion still works >> File .f[ TAB ] File.file ?
File.fnmatch File.fnmatch ?
File.for_fd File.foreach File.freeze File.frozen ?
File.ftype #
File autocompletion just works >> File.file ? '[ TAB ] .git/ LICENSE.txt README.rdoc Rakefile VERSION.yml bond.gemspec ext/ lib/ test / >> File.file ? ' V [ TAB ] >> File.file ? ' VERSION.yml '
Method Autocompletion
Autocompleting an object ’s methods is Irb ’s sweet spot .
It achieves this by evaling the object you ’ve typed and getting the methods it responds to via methods ( ) .
Bond gives you access to your currently typed object and let ’s you autocomplete as you see fit .
For this example , let ’s say we want to explore Bond : : Agent ’s functionality :
>> ba = Bond.agent ; nil => nil #
Irb let 's you autocomplete everything that an object responds to for better or worse . >> ba. [ TAB ] ba.__id__ ba.eql ?
ba.instance_eval ba.method ba.send ba.to_yaml ba.__send__ ba.equal ? ba.instance_of ?
ba.methods ba.setup ba.to_yaml_properties ba.call ba.extend ba.instance_variable_defined ?
ba.missions ba.singleton_methods ba.to_yaml_style ba.class ba.find_mission ba.instance_variable_get ba.nil ?
ba.taguri ba.type ba.clone ba.freeze ba.instance_variable_set ba.object_id ba.taguri= ba.untaint ba.complete ba.frozen ?
ba.instance_variables ba.private_methods ba.taint ba.default_mission ba.hash ba.is_a ? ba.protected_methods ba.tainted ?
ba.display ba.id ba.kind_of ? ba.public_methods ba.to_a ba.dup ba.inspect ba.line_buffer ba.respond_to ?
ba.to_s #
Since it 's hard to see Bond :: Agent 's functionality amidst all the Object and Kernel methods , # let 's autocomplete just it 's instance methods .
>> Bond.complete(:object= >Bond:: Agent ) { |input| input.object.class.instance_methods ( false ) } => true #
A less cluttered display of Bond :: Agent 's functionality . >> ba. [ TAB ] ba.call ba.complete ba.default_mission ba.find_mission ba.missions #
Let 's have all Bond ::* objects do this . >>
Bond.reset ; Bond.complete( : object= >/ ^Bond ::/) { |input| input.object.class.instance_methods ( false ) } => true #
Let 's revert method autocompletion back to irb's defaults for Bond : :* objects . >>
Bond.recomplete :object= >/^Bond::/
Note that access in the completion proc to the current object you ’ve typed is made available via input.object .
Custom Searching of Completions
As we ’ve seen Bond defaults to traditional autocompletion searching i.e. possible_completions.grep(/^#{input}/) .
But Bond can often be anything but traditional .
Let ’s revisit the first example :
# Let 's have autocompletion search anywhere within possible completions , >> Bond.complete( : method=>' method1 ' , : search= > false ) { |input| %w{some args to autocomplete}.grep(/#{input} /) } => true #
Crazy anywhere completion ( not really ) >> method1 ' com [ TAB ] >> method1 ' autocomplete ' #
Let 's redefine the anywhere completion .
This way we can reuse the anywhere search in other completions . >> anywhere = proc { |input , list | list.grep(/#{input}/) } => #< Proc : [ email protected ] ( irb ) :3 > >> Bond.recomplete ( : method=>' method1 ' , : search= > anywhere ) { |input| %w {some args to autocomplete} } => true
Meh .
Is there really any search of possible completions that could improve on the traditional way ?
Perhaps .
Bond comes armed with an underscore search aka textmate - like instant aliasing of underscored words :
# Firing up a rails console bash > script / console >> require ' bond ' => true #
Set all ActiveRecord : : Base descendants to use the predefined underscore search >> Bond.complete :object= >ActiveRecord :: Base , : search=>:underscore => true #
With this search we can still autocomplete the traditional way .
#
Url is a model object >> Url.first.tag_ [ TAB ]
Url.first.tag_add_and_remove Url.first.tag_and_save Url.first.tag_ids= Url.first.tag_list= Url.first.tag_add_and_save Url.first.tag_ids Url.first.tag_list Url.first.tag_remove_and_save >> Url.tag_ad [ TAB ] >> Url.tag_add_and_ >> Url.tag_add_and_[ TAB ]
Url.first.tag_add_and_remove Url.first.tag_add_and_save >> Url.tag_add_and_s[ TAB ] >> Url.tag_add_and_save #
But this search goes the extra mile with textmate - like searching .
#
Type just the first letter of each underscored word separated by ' _ ' >> Url.first.t_a_a_s[ TAB ] >> Url.first.tag_add_and_save #
With this search , most multi- worded methods are just a few keystrokes away .
#
If multiple methods match the underscore alias , it still autocompletes the beginning of the method : >> Url.first .p[ TAB ] Url.first.partial_updates Url.first.pretty_inspect Url.first.pretty_print_instance_variables Url.first.public_methods Url.first.partial_updates ?
Url.first.pretty_print Url.first.primary_key_prefix_type Url.first.pluralize_table_names Url.first.pretty_print_cycle Url.first.private_methods Url.first.present ?
Url.first.pretty_print_inspect Url.first.protected_methods >> Url.first.p_p[ TAB ] >> Url.first.pretty_print >> Url.first.pretty_print_c[ TAB ] >> Url.first.pretty_print_cycle
As you can see , customizing the way we search possible completions brings a new twist to autocompletion .
Custom Autocompletions
So far we ’ve seen how easy Bond makes autocompletion of methods and arguments .
It ’s easy because Bond handles the regular expressions .
But if you have your own regex ’s , Bond is ready :
bash > irb - rirb / completion - rubygems - rbond #
Let 's reuse the file completion from above >> file_completion = proc {|input| ( Readline : : FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC.call( input ) || [ ] ) .map {|f| f =~ /^~/ ? File.expand_path(f ) : f } } => #< Proc : [ email protected ] ( irb ) :1> #
But this time let 's trigger it whenever the last word in the line is quoted # fyi this is default behavior if you use irb without requiring irb/ completion >> Bond.complete(:on=>/\S+\s *[ " ' ] ( [ ^' " . ]*) $ / , :search=> false ) { |input| file_completion.call(input.matched [ 1 ] ) } => true #
Now it does n't matter what methods come before .
If the last word is quoted we get file completion : >> Dir.entries '[ TAB ] .git/ LICENSE.txt README.rdoc Rakefile VERSION.yml bond.gemspec ext/ lib/ test / >> Dir.entries ' l [ TAB ] >>
Dir.entries ' lib/ >> `ls ' t [ TAB ] >> `ls ' test / >> `ls ' test /'` # String method completion still works >> ' 007 ' . [ TAB ] Display all 137 possibilities ?
( y or n )
Note the completion proc gets access to regex matches via input . matched .
This is the MatchData object that results from matching the given regex with the current line .
If you ’re not familiar with a MatchData object , the relevant thing to know is that you can access matches as you would array elements i.e. input.matched [ 1 ] == $ 1 , input. matched [ 2 ] == $ 2 .
If you look at the above regex for : on , you ’ll see that the first match is what we want to autocomplete and hence input. matched [ 1 ] is passed in the completion proc .
With custom autocompletions you can do some surprisingly useful things .
Here ’s one to make typing known constants and classes oh so easy :
def alias_constants ( input ) fetch_constants = proc { | klass , klass_alias | klass .
constants . grep ( /^ #{ klass_alias } /i ) . map { | f | klass .
const_get ( f ) } } fetch_string_constants = proc { | klass , klass_alias | klass .
constants . grep ( /^ #{ klass_alias } /i ) . map { | f | ( val = klass .
const_get ( f ) ) && val .
is_a ? ( Module ) ? val .
to_s : " #{ klass } :: #{ f } " } } index = 1 aliases = input .
split ( " : " ) aliases .
inject ( [ Object ] ) do | completions , a | completions = completions .
select { | e | e . is_a ? ( Module ) } . map { | klass | aliases .
size != index ?
fetch_constants .
call ( klass , a ) : fetch_string_constants . call ( klass , a ) } . flatten index += 1 ; completions end end
This completion proc allows us to refer to any constants / classes by the first few unique letters of each namespace .
The letters can be in lowercase and are separated by a colon .
Let ’s try it :
>> # Copy and paste the above method >> Bond.complete :on= >/^( ( ( [ a - z ] [ ^ :. \ ( ] * ) + ) : )+/ , : search= > false , &method(:alias_constants ) => true #
First some easy ones >> b:a[ TAB ] >>
Bond :: Agent >> b:d:m[ TAB ] >>
Bond :: Missions :: DefaultMission #
If we hit multiple matches we just resort to normal completion >> i:i[ TAB ] >> IRB : I >> IRB : Il [ TAB ] >>
IRB :: IllegalParameter
The Name is Bond
To use Bond or have Bond in your irbrc , you only need to require it and then Bond. complete to your Bond content .
Remember that the order you define completions is the order they ’re searched in .
Be careful when using custom completions .
Having something like Bond.complete :on=>/.*/ , &mah_search will swallow up any completions defined after it .

Functional .NET - LINQ or Language Integrated Monads ?
Monday , October 13 , 2008
As part of my talk at the Richmond Code Camp earlier in October , I had the opportunity to talk about how to implement functional aspects in C# 3.0 .
This talk revolved around such concepts as from mutable to immutable , from inheritance to functional composition , and the mind shift that is required .
Part of this discussion involved very briefly a talk about monads .
It 's a very misunderstood part of computer science and one of the most powerful concepts to learn .
Much like continuation passing style , this style is often maligned as a result .
But , let 's work to change that .
What Is a Monad ?
Monads come to us originally from category theory .
When monads applied to functional programming , they simply are a construction , given an underlying type system , embeds a corresponding monadic type system .
Simply put , the values you have become amplified values that are to be interpreted by the matching monadic type .
The formulation of a monad comes in three parts :
A type construction that defines for every underlying type , how to obtain a corresponding monadic type .
If the given type in F# is 'a , then the corresponding monadic type for an Identity monad would be I <'a > .
I 'll cover more of what that means below .
A unit function that maps the underlying type to a value in the corresponding monadic type .
In F# parlance , this maps to a Return function .
A binding operation of polymorphic type , in F# parlance , ( I <'a > ) => ( ' a => I <'b > ) => ( I <'b > ) .
This maps to a Bind function given your monad builder .
If you look carefully at the signature of this , you might also note that the LINQ SelectMany follows this syntax .
Gee , what could that mean ?
The bind operation follows four steps :
The monadic structure exposes the underlying value of type 'a .
The given function is applied to the underlying value to obtain values of type I <'b >
The monadic structure exposes the underlying value of type 'b .
The monadic structure is reassembled over the results , given a single value of type I <'b >
Simply put , a monad , unlike your normal function results , stores function results and side - effect representations .
This allows side effects to be propagated through the return values of functions without breaking the pure functional model .
This is what makes it so powerful that it is a way to manage side effects .
Given a pure language such as Haskell , this is the way that any side effecting operation should be done .
Granted , there are impure ways of doing IO , but let 's not go there .
There are some good sources of information on what monads are , including some great stuff from Brian Beckman :
Some examples of monads that are used frequently are such things as the maybe monad , identity monad , IO , collections and so on .
Let 's move onto implementing some of these monads in .NET , whether it be F# or even C# .
Implementing in .NET
To implement the above mentioned monads , we 'll take examples in both F# and C# to see that both can do the job .
Although I 'll admit my preference for F# , C# can monads quite nicely using LINQ syntax .
But that sometimes means that the from and select keywords might be confusing .
But what people might not realize is that you are not limited to IEnumerable < T > inside LINQ .
Instead , you could have any backing type you want .
For example , I could have the identity type , maybe type , async type and so on .
We 'll cover each one of those in detail in the following sections .
Anyhow , let 's get started with the identity monad .
The Identity Monad
The easiest monad to understand is the identity monad .
This attaches no information to the underlying value , and instead only returns and transforms it .
Implementing in F #
To implement in F# , we need to remember what 's required for any monad builder .
That is the Bind , Return , Delay and Let functions .
Let 's define our builder first with the given functions .
# light
type I <'a > = 'a
let bindI i f = f i
let resultI i = i
let delayI f = f ( )
type IdentityBuilder ( ) =
member x .
Bind ( i , f ) = bindI i f
member x .
Return ( i ) = resultI i
member x .
Delay ( f ) = delayI f
member x .
Let ( i , f ) = bindI ( resultI i ) f
Now that our builder is defined , F# has a special way of representing monads in that you wrap them in curly braces with the given instance name of the monad builder .
In this case , I 'll call it ident .
let ident = Identity Builder ( )
let iValue = ident {
let ! x = 5
let ! y = 42
return ! x + y
}
printfn " %i " iValue
The above code allows me to define x and y and add them together .
The end result ends up being 47 .
This looks pretty simple using this syntax , although this is what it ends up being behind the scenes :
let iValue = ident .
Delay ( fun ( ) ->
ident .
Bind ( 5 , fun x ->
ident .
Bind ( 42 , fun y ->
ident .
Return ( x + y ) ) ) )
As you can see , the syntax is much more simplified with the syntactic sugar that they give us .
This almost looks like LINQ in a way .
Implementing in C# 3.0
Now , what about C# ?
What can we do there ?
Actually , the answer is , that it 's quite simple .
If you notice one thing about LINQ is the signature of the SelectMany method .
Let 's look at the definition on the Enumerable class .
public static IEnumerable <U> SelectMany<T , U > (
this IEnumerable <T> s ,
Func<T , IEnumerable <U >> f )
And if you look at the bind syntax that we used in our F# example , it 's exactly the same signature .
That should tell us something that LINQ expressions can indeed be monads .
Now , let 's implement the identity monad by first identifying the class and then the extension methods that make this work .
public class Identity <T >
{
public Identity ( T value ) {
Value = value ; }
public T Value { get ; private set ; }
}
public static class IdentityExtensions
{
public static Identity < T> ToIdentity <T>( this T value )
{
return new Identity < T>( value ) ;
}
public static Identity < U> SelectMany<T , U > (
this Identity < T> id ,
Func<T , Identity <U >> k)
{
return k( id.Value ) ;
}
public static Identity < V> SelectMany<T , U , V >(
this Identity < T> id ,
Func<T , Identity <U >> k ,
Func<T , U , V > s)
{
return id.SelectMany(x => k( x ) .SelectMany(y => s(x , y ) .
ToIdentity ( ) ) ) ;
}
}
When we implement things for LINQ , we must be cognizant for the need of two SelectMany methods for various performance reasons to allow us to combine values .
Now that we 've defined these methods , we can now use LINQ expressions to express our identity monad .
var identResult = from x in 5 . ToIdentity ( )
from y in 42 . ToIdentity ( )
select x + y ;
Console.WriteLine(identResult.Value ) ;
As above the answer comes out to 47 .
Let 's move onto the maybe monad .
The Maybe Monad
The maybe monad is another popular monad type .
A maybe monad is very similar to the identity , yet a value may be missing .
In F# parlance , this translates to the Option < ' a > type .
Let 's go ahead and implement this in F# using our given option type .
Implementing in F #
Implementing the maybe monad is very similar to the identity monad .
The only difference being is the to differentiate between some value and no value specified .
We will determine that through pattern matching , as always .
# light
type M< 'a > = option <'a >
let bindM d f =
match d with
| None ->
None
| Some ( v ) -> f v
let resultM v = Some ( v )
let delayM f = f ( )
type MaybeBuilder ( ) =
member x .
Bind ( v , d ) = bindM v d
member x .
Return ( v ) = resultM v
member x .
Delay ( f ) = delayM f
member x .
Let ( v , f ) = bindM ( resultM v ) f
Once defined , we can now use our MaybeBuilder to define a simple use of our maybe monad .
Let 's make sure we use
None to denote that we are missing a value .
let maybe = MaybeBuilder ( )
let mValue = maybe {
let ! x = Some ( 5 )
let ! y = None
return x + y
}
let option_to_string = function
| None -> " Undefined "
| Some v -> v . ToString ( )
printfn " %s " ( mValue | > option_to_string )
The result of course is " Undefined " because our y value is the None option type .
But , how might this work in C# ?
Implementing in C# 3.0
We can reuse a lot of our ideas from implementing this via extension methods .
I will go ahead and use the Option type that I 've defined in my Functional C# project on MSDN Code Gallery .
From there , we can implement our SelectMany operations .
public static class MaybeExtensions
{
public static Option < T> ToMaybe <T >( this T value )
{
return Option < T>.Some ( value ) ;
}
public static Option <U> SelectMany<T , U > (
this Option < T> m ,
Func<T , Option <U >> k)
{
return !m. IsNone ?
Option < U>. None : k( m.Value ) ;
}
public static Option <V> SelectMany<T , U , V >(
this Option < T> m ,
Func<T , Option <U >> k ,
Func<T , U , V > s)
{
return m.SelectMany(x => k( x ) .SelectMany(y => s(x , y ) . ToMaybe ( ) ) ) ;
}
}
Now that we defined our binding operations , we can move onto actually using the maybe monad .
Let 's use the template that we defined up above for our identity monad and craft it to use our maybes .
var maybeResult = from x in 5 . ToMaybe ( )
from y in Option < int >.
None
select x + y ;
Console .
WriteLine (
maybeResult .IsSome ? maybeResult.Value.ToString ( ) : " Undefined " ) ;
Once again , our result will be undefined as our y value has no real value at all .
Clear so far ?
Let 's move onto the List Monad .
The Collection Monad
The collection monad is another important monad type .
This monad is the heart and soul of LINQ and the way we use it to compute our lazily evaluated lists .
This monad strikes home as one of the most important to .NET developers .
Using LINQ to SQL , XML and such uses collections of various sorts to transform the data into other forms .
Implementing in F #
As before , we need to define our basic bind , let , return and delay functions in order for the monad to work in F#. Let 's define the list monad to use seq < 'a > .
This way , I can lazily evaluate my results and yield them when I need to .
For the bind and result statements , I 'm using a sequence expression to yield the appropriate values .
# light
let bindL l f =
seq { for x in l do
for y in f x do
yield y }
let resultL l = seq { yield l }
let delayL f = f ( )
type SeqBuilder ( ) =
member x .
Bind ( l , f ) = bindL l f
member x .
Return ( l ) = resultL l
member x .
Delay ( f ) = delayL f
member x .
Let ( l , f ) = bindL ( resultL l ) f
Now that we 've defined our monad builder , let 's implement this to add the values from each collection to each other .
let seqMonad = new SeqBuilder ( )
let sValue = seqMonad {
let ! x = { 1 . .3 }
let ! y = { 4 . .6 }
return x + y
}
sValue | >
Seq .
iter ( fun x -> printfn " %i " x )
Our results will be the addition of each number in each list to each other .
So , in turn , I will get 9 numbers in total with a value of 5 6 7 6 7 8 7 8 9 .
Implementing in C# 3.0
To view the bind methods , simply open the Enumerable class to view the SelectMany implementations .
This will get us started in looking at a C# equivalent to the list monad we did above .
A simple representation might look like this .
var sValues = from x in Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 3 )
from y in Enumerable .
Range ( 4 , 3 )
select x + y ;
foreach ( var sValue in sValues ) Console.
WriteLine( sValue ) ;
And we now realize the answers between the two are exactly the same .
No special magic required for list monads .
The Asynchronous Monad
One of the most often used monads in F# is the asynchronous computation expression .
This allows us to use non-blocking calls to download resources , whether it be files , web request , WCF calls and so on .
This is where monads become really useful for .NET developers who want to explore a little outside the box in ways of thinking about monads .
Implementing in F #
We get the asynchronous computation expressions out of the box with F# .
This allows us to easily create asynchronous computation expressions which I talked about earlier here .
But , let 's look at one example of downloading the HTML from various web sites in parallel with non-blocking calls .
What might that look like ?
# light
open System .
IO
open System .
Net
open Microsoft .
FSharp .
Control
open Microsoft .
FSharp .
Control .
CommonExtensions
let get_html_async ( url : string ) =
async {
let request = WebRequest .
Create ( url )
let !
response = request .
AsyncGetResponse ( )
let stream = response .
GetResponseStream ( )
let reader = new StreamReader ( stream )
let !
text = reader .
AsyncReadToEnd ( )
return text
}
let urls = [ " http://live.com " ; " http://google.com " ; " http://codebetter.com " ]
let textResults =
Async .
Run ( Async .
Parallel [ for url in urls -> get_html_async url ] )
textResults | > Seq . iter ( fun textResult -> printfn " %s " text Result )
As you can see , we 're creating a request , getting the response , creating a reader , and reading all the way to the end asynchronously .
As you may note , there is a difference between let ! and let .
The let ! uses the Bind method whereas the let uses the Let method of AsyncBuilder .
What I 'm able to do here is take three websites , and download their HTML and display within a short amount of time .
Imagine if I had to write that using IAsyncResult classes and such .
That would n't be ideal !
But , can C# partake in this ?
Implementing in C# 3.0
The question I asked is that can we take advantage of the F# asynchronous computation expressions in C# ?
The answer , surprisingly is YES !
I had the opportunity to talk to F# developer , Brian McNamara , on this very subject .
Back in May , he posted a quick example of using the F# libraries from C# .
There is a bit of work required to do this , but it pays off handily .
I 'll cover the exact details in my next post of how to do it .
But , in the mean time , imagine if we could download HTML from three websites simultaneously using LINQ ?
Here 's what the code that does exactly that looks like .
Func < string , Async < string >> get_html_async = url =>
from _ in AsyncExtensions .StartWorkflow
from request in WebExtensions.AsyncCreateWebRequest( url )
from response in request .
AsyncGetResponse ()
let reader = new StreamReader ( response.GetResponseStream ( ) )
from urlText in reader .
AsyncReadToEnd ( )
select urlText ;
var urls = new [ ] { " http://live.com/ " , " http://www.google.com/ " , " http://codebetter.com/ " } ;
var urlTexts = Async.Run (
Async. Parallel ( from url in urls select get_html_async ( url ) ) , Option < int >.
None , Option < bool >. None ) ;
Array.ForEach( urlTexts , Console. WriteLine ) ;
How simple is that ?
Well , we have to put some backing to some of these methods in order to make them asynchronous , and I will cover exactly what that is in the next post .
Wrapping it Up
What about such things as the IO monad ?
Well , that 's more of a language construct that is enforced by the compiler .
I would like to see something similar to this in F# going forward , so that we could better manage our side effects .
Using such technologies as Spec# to statically verify the behavior is important .
But , once again , that 's another post .
I hope I helped to alleviate some of the confusion around monads .
More importantly , I hope you know more of how and when to use them .
In the next post , I 'll follow up with the actual implementation of the asynchronous computation expressions in C# 3.0 .
Giving us the ability to have parity with F# is really powerful and attests to the power of LINQ ( and monads of course ) .
Stay tuned !
Coral is the canary in the cage as damage can be seen most quickly , veteran naturalist tells Royal Society
David Attenborough joined scientists yesterday to warn that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is already above the level which condemns coral reefs to extinction in the future , with catastrophic effects for the oceans and the people who depend upon them .
Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine life including more than 4,000 species of fish .
They also provide spawning , nursery , refuge and feeding areas for creatures such as lobsters , crabs , starfish and sea turtles .
This makes them crucial in supporting a healthy marine ecosystem upon which more than 1bn people depend for food .
Reefs also play a crucial role as natural breakwaters , protecting coastlines from storms .
Attenborough said the world had a " moral responsibility " to save corals .
He was speaking yesterday at the Royal Society in London , following a meeting of marine biologists .
At the current rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 , they said , coral would become extinct within a few decades .
" A coral reef is the canary in the cage as far as the oceans are concerned , " said Attenborough .
" They are the places where the damage is most easily and quickly seen .
It is more difficult for us to see what is happening in , for example , the deep ocean or the central expanses of ocean . "
" Anybody 's who 's had the privilege of diving on a coral reef will have seen the natural world at its most glorious , diverse and beautiful , " said Attenborough .
" [ There is a ] moral responsibility one has to the natural world .
Also you have responsibility to future generations , to your future grandchildren and great grandchildren . "
Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a double effect on coral .
Global warming means warmer seas , which causes the corals to to bleach , where the creatures lose the symbiotic algae they need to survive .
Carbon dioxide also makes seas more acidic , which means the corals find it difficult to prevent their exoskeletons from dissolving .
" We 've already passed a safe threshold for coral reef ecosystems in terms of climate change .
We believe that a safe level for CO2 is below 350 parts per million , " said Alex Rogers of the Zoological Society of London and International Programme on the State of the Ocean , who helped organise yesterday 's meeting .
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen from 280 ppm before the industrial revolution to around 387 ppm today .
Environmentalists say that any new global deal on climate must restrict the growth of CO2 levels to 450 ppm , though more pessimistic scientists say that the world is heading for 550 ppm or even 650 ppm .
" When we get up to and above 450 ppm , that really means we 're into the realms of catastrophic destruction of coral reefs and we 'll be moving into a planetary - wide global extinction , " said Rogers .
" The only way to get to 350 ppm or below is not only to have major cuts in CO2 emissions but also to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere through measures such as geo-engineering . "
Attenborough said the plight of the corals was another example of why the control of carbon was so important to the world 's inhabitants .
" Each ecological disaster or problem traces its cause back to carbon .
To quibble about this is really fiddling while Rome burns .
If we do not control the emission of carbon , this world is heading for a major catastrophe and this is one of the first to be staring us straight in the face . "

A robotic submarine named Nereus has become the third craft in history to reach the deepest part of the world ’s oceans , at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean .
The dive to Challenger Deep , an abyss within the Mariana Trench that reaches 11,000 metres beneath the waves , was completed on 31 May by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) , Massachussetts , US .
For the expedition , the team had to build a new breed of remotely - operated submarine , called Nereus , which is capable of going deeper than any other while still filming and collecting samples .
Sunday ’s dive makes it the world ’s deepest - diving vehicle , and the first vehicle to explore the Mariana Trench since 1998 .
So far only a single picture taken by Nereus at the bottom of the trench has been released , see image , right .
Vast explorations
“ Nereus is like no other deep submergence vehicle , ” says oceanographer Tim Shank of WHOI .
“ It allows vast areas to be explored with great effectiveness .
Our true achievement is not just getting to the deepest point in our ocean , but unleashing a capability that enables deep exploration , unencumbered by a heavy tether and surface ship , to investigate some of the richest systems on Earth . ”
“ With a robot like Nereus , we can now explore virtually anywhere in the ocean , ” adds project manager Andy Bowen .
Third in line
Only two other vehicles have ever reached the bottom of Challenger Deep : US bathyscaphe Trieste , which carried Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh in 1960 , and the Japanese robot Kaiko , which made three unmanned expeditions to the trench between 1995 and 1998 .
Trieste was retired in 1966 , and Kaiko was lost at sea in 2003 .
“ The samples collected by the vehicle include sediment from the subducting and overriding tectonic plates that meet at the trench , ” says WHOI geologist Patty Fryer .
See a gallery of images about the bathyscaphe Trieste and its creator , Jacques Piccard , whose work on underwater exploration influenced NASA ’s spacecraft designs .

Three Breathing Exercises And Techniques
“ Practicing a regular , mindful breathing exercise can be calming and energizing and can even help with stress - related health problems ranging from panic attacks to digestive disorders . ”
Andrew Weil , M.D .
Since breathing is something we can control and regulate , it is a useful tool for achieving a relaxed and clear state of mind .
I recommend three breathing exercises and techniques to help relax and reduce stress : The Stimulating Breath , The 4 - 7 - 8 Breathing Exercise ( also called the Relaxing Breath ) , and Breath Counting .
Try each of these breathing exercises and techniques and see how they affect your stress and anxiety levels .
Breathing Exercise 1 :
The Stimulating Breath ( also called the Bellows Breath )
The Stimulating Breath is adapted from yogic breathing techniques .
Its aim is to raise vital energy and increase alertness .
Inhale and exhale rapidly through your nose , keeping your mouth closed but relaxed .
Your breaths in and out should be equal in duration , but as short as possible .
This is a noisy breathing exercise .
Try for three in - and - out breath cycles per second .
This produces a quick movement of the diaphragm , suggesting a bellows .
Breathe normally after each cycle .
Do not do for more than 15 seconds on your first try .
Each time you practice the Stimulating Breath , you can increase your time by five seconds or so , until you reach a full minute .
If done properly , you may feel invigorated , comparable to the heightened awareness you feel after a good workout .
You should feel the effort at the back of the neck , the diaphragm , the chest and the abdomen .
Try this diaphragmatic breathing exercise the next time you need an energy boost and feel yourself reaching for a cup of coffee .
Watch a video of Dr. Weil demonstrating the Stimulating Breath .
Breathing Exercise 2 :
The 4 - 7 - 8 ( or Relaxing Breath ) Exercise
The 4 - 7 - 8 breathing exercise is utterly simple , takes almost no time , requires no equipment and can be done anywhere .
Although you can do the exercise in any position , sit with your back straight while learning the exercise .
Place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue just behind your upper front teeth , and keep it there through the entire exercise .
You will be exhaling through your mouth around your tongue ; try pursing your lips slightly if this seems awkward .
Exhale completely through your mouth , making a whoosh sound .
Close your mouth and inhale quietly through your nose to a mental count of four .
.
Hold your breath for a count of seven .
.
Exhale completely through your mouth , making a whoosh sound to a count of eight .
.
This is one breath .
Now inhale again and repeat the cycle three more times for a total of four breaths .
Note that with this breathing technique , you always inhale quietly through your nose and exhale audibly through your mouth .
The tip of your tongue stays in position the whole time .
Exhalation takes twice as long as inhalation .
The absolute time you spend on each phase is not important ; the ratio of 4:7:8 is important .
If you have trouble holding your breath , speed the exercise up but keep to the ratio of 4:7:8 for the three phases .
With practice you can slow it all down and get used to inhaling and exhaling more and more deeply .
This breathing exercise is a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system .
Unlike tranquilizing drugs , which are often effective when you first take them but then lose their power over time , this exercise is subtle when you first try it , but gains in power with repetition and practice .
Do it at least twice a day .
You can not do it too frequently .
Do not do more than four breaths at one time for the first month of practice .
Later , if you wish , you can extend it to eight breaths .
If you feel a little lightheaded when you first breathe this way , do not be concerned ; it will pass .
Once you develop this technique by practicing it every day , it will be a very useful tool that you will always have with you .
Use it whenever anything upsetting happens – before you react .
Use it whenever you are aware of internal tension or stress .
Use it to help you fall asleep .
This exercise cannot be recommended too highly .
Everyone can benefit from it .
Watch a video of Dr. Weil demonstrating the 4 - 7 - 8 Breath .
Breathing Exercise 3 :
Breath Counting
If you want to get a feel for this challenging work , try your hand at breath counting , a deceptively simple breathing technique much used in Zen practice .
Sit in a comfortable position with the spine straight and head inclined slightly forward .
Gently close your eyes and take a few deep breaths .
Then let the breath come naturally without trying to influence it .
Ideally it will be quiet and slow , but depth and rhythm may vary .
To begin the exercise , count “ one ” to yourself as you exhale .
The next time you exhale , count “ two , ” and so on up to “ five . ”
Then begin a new cycle , counting “ one ” on the next exhalation .
Never count higher than “ five , ” and count only when you exhale .
You will know your attention has wandered when you find yourself up to “ eight , ” “ 12 , ” even “ 19 . ”
Try to do 10 minutes of this form of meditation .
Watch a video of Dr. Weil demonstrating Breath Counting .

Jakarta , Indonesia
IN the days and weeks after the April 9 parliamentary elections in Indonesia , employees at the mental hospital in Surakarta , in Central Java , have been working double shifts .
“ We ’ve been overwhelmed with 200 patients a day , ” said the hospital spokeswoman , Dyah Srimarwati .
Other mental institutions are reporting a similar surge .
Losing candidates in the election apparently account for the bulk of new patients .
All sorts of sad stories have emerged : a losing candidate in West Java hanged herself ; another on Bali died of a heart attack after the polling stations announced the results ; and when one man on Sulawesi discovered that most of his neighbors had not voted for him , he cut off public access to a well on his property .
About one million people from 44 parties were contesting up to 50,000 seats in the national , provincial and local legislatures .
So you had an average of a 1 in 20 chance of winning .
And you could n’t expect help from your political party .
You recruited your own volunteers , organized your own town hall meetings and raised your own money .
If you were of limited means , this meant selling everything you had  your house , your car , your lifetime savings , even your parents - in - law ’s property if you could persuade them .
Or you just went deep into debt .
No wonder people got very depressed as soon as they learned they had lost .

This is only Indonesia ’s third free and fair election since General Suharto resigned in 1998 , but April ’s election , along with those in 1999 and 2004 , have proven to skeptics that democracy can be practiced here , in the world ’s largest Muslim nation .
Over the past decade , Islamist parties have not done particularly well ; most Indonesians , including the majority of Muslims , obviously feel more comfortable with the secular parties .
( Preliminary counts indicate three secular - centrist parties , including the Democratic Party of the incumbent president , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , will dominate the national Parliament . )

Update : WebKit team responds to this post .
Admits error , downplays importance .
When a web browser make a request it sends information to the server about what it is looking for in headers .
One of these headers is the Accept header .
The Accept header tells the server what file formats , or more correctly MIME - types , the browser is looking for .
Let 's take a look at Firefox 's Accept header :
GET / page / routing - in- recess - screencast HTTP/1.1 Host : RecessFramework.org Accept:text/html , application/xhtml+xml ,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Let 's translate Firefox 's request to English :
Dear RecessFramework.org ,
I want the resource " / page/routing - in- recess - screencast " and I want it in an HTML or XHTML format .
If you cannot serve me this way , I 'll take " / page/routing - in- recess - screencast " in an XML instead .
If you can't even give it to me in XML , well , I 'll take anything you 've got !
Love ,
Firefox
The Accepts header gives the browser a chance to tell the server which format it wants for a resource .
By giving a list of options this content negotiation happens in a single request .
One of the key design goals of the HTTP spec is to minimize back - and - forth communication .
The browser could ask for each of these formats one at a time but it would be wasteful .
How does the browser specify the preference Give me HTML / XHTML before XML before *?
Preference is indicated by the " relative quality parameter " ( q ) and its value ( qvalue ) , seen in application / xml ; q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 .
Here 's how the HTTP spec defines it :
Each media - range MAY be followed by one or more accept - params , beginning with the " q " parameter for indicating a relative quality factor .
The first " q " parameter ( if any ) separates the media - range parameter (s ) from the accept - params .
Quality factors allow the user or user agent to indicate the relative degree of preference for that media - range , using the qvalue scale from 0 to 1 ( section 3.9 ) .
The default value is q=1 .
For as brilliant as the spec is , it is a terrible read .
What 's going on is simple :
Everything item 's default preference value is 1 .
1 : html , xhtml , xml , * If an item specifies q=X , its preference value is X .
0.9 : xml
0.8 : */*
1 : html , xhtml Order by preference value in descending order .
1 : html , xhtml
0.9 : xml
0.8 : *
The only other major detail is in cases where there are ambiguities the more specific one wins .
For example if both application / xml and */* had a preference of 0.9 application / xml would still come first .
Firefox chooses to make it explicit that */* is less preferred by giving it a preference of 0.8 .
Firefox 's Accept header is sensible and well thought out .
Opera 's is too .
Other browsers : not so much .
What in The Header Were You Thinking WebKit ?
Do n't relax yet IE , you 're up next , and you 're even more egregious .
So , what 's wrong with WebKit , the lauded engine behind Safari and Google 's Chrome ?
Let 's take a look :
GET / page / restful - php - framework HTTP /1.1 Host : RecessFramework.org
Accept : application / xml , application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9 , text / plain;q=0.8 , image/png,*/*;q=0.5
Note : Accept split to two lines for width .
On quick glance it does n't look too different from Firefox's .
Let 's try it again in English just to be sure .
Dear RecessFramework.org ,
I want the resource " / page/restful - php - framework " and I want it in an XML , XHTML , or PNG format .
If you cannot serve me this way , I 'll take " / page/routing - in- recess - screencast " in HTML or plain text instead .
If you can't do that for me I 'll take whatever !
Thanks ,
WebKit
Really WebKit ?
The browsing engine most responsible for killing XHTML prefers XHTML over HTML !
It would also prefer PNG over HTML .
That 's a little embarrassing , but what is worse : Safari and Chrome accept XML over HTML ( and , ambiguously , over XHTML , too ) .
WebKit 's Accept header forces web developers to work against the HTTP spec .
Suppose you are Twitter and want to be a good RESTful internet citizens following the HTTP spec .
You 've got a resource called a tweet that can be represented as XML or JSON or HTML .
You would n't want Safari users to get an XML copy of a Tweet by browsing around , so you have to actively ignore WebKit 's Accept header preferring XML above all else .
Aside :
It turns out Twitter 's REST API ignores many REST / HTTP best practices like the Accept header , anyway , but that 's another story for another post . )
Update from Maciej Stachowiak of Apple 's WebKit team :
Most WebKit - based browsers ( and Safari in particular ) would probably do a better job rendering HTML than XHTML or generic XML , if only because the code paths are much better tested .
So the Accept header is somewhat in error .
On the other hand , this is n't a hugely important bug , and we design our Accept header mainly to give the best compatibility on Web sites , since content negotiation is not really used much in the wild .
Our current header was copied from an old version of Firefox .
Internet Explorer Accepts Polluting the Internet
We 've covered the good and the bad .
Now let 's talk about Internet Explorer .
The IE team made great strides with being a nicer player on the web .
Unfortunately , its Accepts header is downright ugly :
GET / book / html/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host : RecessFramework.org
Accept : image / jpeg , application / x- ms- application , image / gif , application / xaml+xml , image / pjpeg , application / x- ms-xbap , application / x- shockwave - flash , application / msword , */*
This is the Accepts header for IE8 on a Windows 7 machine .
One peculiarity is the " application / msword " MIME - type .
Office is n't installed but the Word Document Viewer is .
This made me wonder , what does IE 's Accept header look like on a machine with Office installed ?
Brace yourlselves :
GET / book / html/index.html HTTP/1.1 Host : RecessFramework.org
Accept : image / gif , image / jpeg , image / pjpeg , application /x-ms-application , application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument , application/xaml+xml , application/x-ms-xbap , application/x-shockwave-flash , application/x-silverlight-2-b2 , application/x-silverlight , application/vnd.ms-excel , application/vnd.ms-powerpoint , application / msword , */*
Ok , now let 's translate to English :
Dear RecessFramework.org ,
I want the resource " /book/html/index.html " .
Now , bear with me , I 'm Internet Explorer and Office is installed so I can accept this resource in a lot of formats , in this order of preference : GIF , JPG , Progressive JPG , Click Once App , Microsoft XPS Document , XAML , XAML Browser App , Flash , Silverlight 2 , Silverlight 1 , Excel Document , Powerpoint Document , or a Word Document .
If you can't give me " /book/html/index.html " in any of those formats then give me anything you 've got !
Thanks ,
Internet Explorer
There are two things wrong with this picture .
The lesser evil : IE has a hook for other applications to insert new MIME - types into its Accept header .
This means if a resource could be represented on the server as a Word Document or as an HTML document , Word as an application can inject behavior into IE so that it always has higher precedence than HTML .
All an application has to do is modify the registry ( HKLM / Software / Microsoft / Windows / CurrentVersion / Internet Settings / Accepted Documents ) .
( Hear that Cisco ?
You could increase internet consumption if you stuck a couple 255 character WebEx MIME - types in IE 's Accept header . )
The greater evil is that IE sends this ~200 - 300 byte Accept header for every single browsing request .
250 bytes is n't much , but on internet scale per every request of the most popular browser , it adds up .
Internet Explorer 's Accept header emissions pollute the information superhighway .
Lets do some back - of - napkin calculation .
Google gets 294 million searches a day now .
If IE has roughly 55 % market share thats 162 million IE requests on Google a day for 38 GB worth of garbage internet traffic .
On Google searches alone , IE pollutes the internet with over a terabyte of traffic every month in its Accept header .
Anyone want to estimate what this number looks like across the rest of the internet ?
Update 1 : IE team Program Manager Eric Lawrence
" I strongly recommend that developers not list MIME types here . "
Yet Silverlight and Office do .
Whoops .
Update 2 : IE does n't send the extended header on * every * request , it sends */* for refreshes and some subsequent visits .
[ IEBlog ]
It is not just wasted bandwidth that is the problem , it is wasted server processing , too .
If a server or framework wants to follow through on the HTTP protocol the server must be sure it can't respond with any of the requested formats before it can respond with HTML .
Bottom line : IE 's Accept header is extremely ugly .
If WebKit is Foolish and IE is Prodigal how valuable is the Accept header ?
This was the question I asked myself about half - way through writing the Accept parsing and content - negotiation code going into the next release of Recess , a RESTful PHP framework .
Content - negotiation with the Accept header is an interesting idea in principle that is hard to use properly in practice because browsers misuse it .
As stated , Twitter 's REST API does n't use the Accept header for content - negotiation , they use extensions on the URL '.json ' and '.xml ' .
Rails disables the Accept header by default .
Frameworks can enhance performance by ignoring the Accept header and relying on '.xml ' - like extensions .
As such the next release of the Recess Framework , too , will disable Accept header based content - negotiation by default .
So , when would you want to parse Accept headers for content negotiation ?
When your consumers are respectful of HTTP and REST ( RESpecTful ! ) .
This could mean RIAs written in javascript , Flash , or Silverlight .
It could also mean other other servers consuming your RESTful API .
Bottom line :
If you 're building APIs for other developers to consume , consider using Accept - based content - negotiation .
If you 're building consumer facing web apps : ignore the Accept header until WebKit and IE get their acts together .
