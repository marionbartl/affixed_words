It was boring to type the letters in the upper row of my typewriter keyboard 20 times , then go on to the next row .
But it was even more boring to lie in bed and do nothing .
So when the chicken pox forced me to stay home from school for two weeks , I used the time to learn touch typing .
At age ten I , like millions of Americans each year , memorized the QWERTY keyboard ( as it is called from its starting arrangement of letters ) .
At the time , I did n’t wonder about its arbitrariness and never asked myself why our standard keyboard uses the QWERTY arrangement instead of alphabetical order or any other obviously advantageous arrangement .
Whatever the original reasons for our adopting QWERTY , however , we now seem firmly committed to it .
The typewriter , and its successor the computer , are among the most widely used office machines in the Western world , and keyboard - related repetitive - strain injuries are among our most common industrial accidents .
Commitment is incessantly urged upon us fin de siècle twentieth - century Americans .
Commitment to our spouses , our children , and our careers is held to be virtuous ; lack of commitment is a common criticism .
Yet commitment should be seen as morally neutral .
After all , what one is committed to might be either good or bad ; commitment to a destructive relationship , an unsatisfying job , or alcoholism deserves no praise .
Often , commitment can mean nothing more than an involvement that has outlived its original justification .
All of us have at one time or another felt trapped by such a commitment , longing for a happier , though uncertain , state of existence but fearing the short - term pain required to reach it .
Commitment is a big issue not only for us as individuals , but for us as a culture as well .
All human societies have many apparently arbitrary practices that persist for centuries or even millennia -- writing systems , counting systems , sets of number signs , and calendars , to name just a few examples .
At one time there existed alternatives to the system that we eventually adopted .
Were some of these alternatives better than others ?
Did we in fact end up committed to the best ones ?
Are our alphabets , decimal counting , Arabic numerals , and Gregorian calendar really superior to Chinese logograms , Babylonian base - 60 counting , Roman numerals , and the Mayan calendar ?
Those questions are hard to answer for some of these choices -- counting systems , for instance -- to which we became committed in the remote past .
But the QWERTY keyboard is a modern - day commitment , dating back only to the late nineteenth century , and thus it is one whose history we can reconstruct .
We know that QWERTY is the dominant survivor of dozens of keyboard designs that competed during the early years of the typewriter .
Hence we can ask , with the expectation of finding an answer , to what advantages does it owe its triumph ?
Studies of the consequences of keyboard design were pioneered by the industrial engineers Frank and Lillian Gilbreth , who were made famous by a biography , Cheaper by the Dozen , written by 2 of their 12 children .
The Gilbreths sought to decrease worker fatigue and increase the efficiency of many industrial processes ( as well as of surgical operations and buttoning a shirt ) by time - and - motion studies and slowed - down motion pictures .
Applied to keyboard design , such studies showed that typing fatigue , errors , and slow speed depend especially on bad design in allocating letters among keyboard rows , among fingers , and between the left and right hands .
When you prepare to type , you rest your fingers on QWERTY ’s second - from - the - bottom row , called the home row .
Obviously , the more typing you can do without having to move your fingers from the home row , the faster you ’ll be able to type , the fewer errors you ’ll make , and the less you ’ll strain your fingers .
Confirming that straightforward prediction , motion - picture studies prove that typing is fastest on the home row and slowest on the bottom row .
You might then naively expect that the QWERTY keyboard was designed so that most typing is done on the home row .
You would be wrong .
Only 32 percent of strokes are on the home row ; most strokes ( 52 percent ) are on the upper row ; and a full 16 percent are on the bottom row , which you should be avoiding like the plague .
Not more than 100 English words can be typed without leaving the home row .
The reason for this disaster is simple : QWERTY perversely puts the most common English letters on other rows .
The home row of nine letters includes two of the least used ( J and K ) but none of the three most frequently used ( E , T , and O , which are relegated to the upper row ) and only one of the five vowels ( A ) , even though 40 percent of all letters in a typical English text are vowels .
To appreciate the consequences of that misdesigning , just remind yourself of how it feels to type pumpkin or minimum on your QWERTY keyboard .
Your fingers must not only reach from the home row to the top or bottom but must at times hurdle completely over the home row , moving directly from top to bottom and back again .
Those awkward hurdles and reaches slow you and introduce typing errors and finger strain .
Unfortunately , out of any 100 pairs of consecutive letters in a typical English text , six require a reach and four a hurdle on the QWERTY keyboard .
These inconveniences are minimized by any of the numerous competing keyboard designs that concentrate the most common English letters onto the home row .
For instance , the Dvorak keyboard devotes the home row to nine of the 12 most common English letters -- including all five vowels and the three most common consonants ( T , H , N ) -- while the six rarest letters ( V , K , J , X , Q , and Z ) are relegated to the bottom row .
As a result , 70 percent of typing strokes remain on the home row , only 22 percent are on the upper row , and a mere 8 percent are on the hated bottom row ; thousands of words can be typed with the home row alone ; reaches are five times less frequent than in QWERTY typing , and hurdles hardly ever happen .
Another easily understood vice of the QWERTY keyboard has to do with alternation of hands .
Whenever the left and right hands type alternate letters , one hand can be getting into position for the next letter while the other hand is typing the previous one .
You can thereby fall into a steady rhythm and type quickly .
In reality , though , even a good typist ’s speed is seldom steadily maintained .
It repeatedly shifts between fast bursts and slow stutters within even a few seconds , and many of the stutters arise from strings of consecutive letters typed by the same hand .
The longer the string , the slower the typing rate and the more frequent the errors .
Yet QWERTY typing tends to degenerate into long one - handed strings of letters , especially strings for the weak left hand .
More than 3,000 English words utilize QWERTY ’s left hand alone , and about 300 the right hand alone .
( Try typing exaggerated and greatest , then try million and monopoly ) .
The underlying reason for this shortcoming is that most English syllables contain both vowels and consonants , but QWERTY assigns some vowels ( A and E ) as well as some common consonants ( R , S , and D ) to the left hand , and others ( I , O , and U , plus H , L , and N ) to the right hand .
Hence , for about half of all digraphs ( two consecutive letters ) in a typical English text , QWERTY allocates both letters to the same hand .
The Dvorak keyboard instead forces you to alternate hands frequently .
It does so by placing all vowels plus Y in the left hand , but the 13 most common consonants in the right .
As a result , not a single word or even a single syllable can be typed with the right hand alone ( no , grr is n’t a word ) , and only a few words can be typed with the left hand alone .
QWERTY ’s many words and letter strings for the left hand are especially unfortunate when you consider that most people are right - handed .
Yet QWERTY allocates to the weaker left hand the most common English letter ( E ) , the second most common ( T ) , and the fourth most common ( A ) , thus making the left hand perform more than half of all typing strokes ( 56 percent ) .
We are condemned to struggle with a left - handed typewriter in a right - handed world .
The Dvorak keyboard instead gives 56 percent of all strokes to the right hand .
QWERTY ’s overuse of our weaker hand extends to our weaker fingers .
On each hand , the pinkie ( fifth finger ) is the weakest , and finger strength increases from the fifth to the second finger ( index finger ) .
Yet QWERTY makes almost as much use of our weakest finger ( left fifth ) as of our second strongest ( right third ) .
In contrast , the rank sequence of finger use on the Dvorak keyboard is identical to the rank sequence of finger strength , and the typing load on each finger is proportional to its strength .
The QWERTY keyboard also condemns us to awkward finger sequences .
As we already know , strokes that alternate between hands are faster than successive strokes of the same hand .
But if you must type two successive strokes with the same hand , it ’s fastest to do so with two remote fingers ( such as at , left fifth to second finger ) , next fastest with two adjacent fingers ( as , left fifth to fourth finger ) , slower with the same finger on the same row ( ee , left third finger ) , and slowest of all with the same finger on different rows ( ed , left third finger ) .
Yet with the QWERTY keyboard , 20 percent of all English digraphs are typed by adjacent fingers , and more than 4 percent ( such as the common ed ) by the same finger ; corresponding numbers for the Dvorak keyboard are only 2 percent and 1 percent , respectively .
The result of all these shortcomings is that typing on a QWERTY keyboard is unnecessarily tiring , slow , inaccurate , hard to learn , and hard to remember .
In a normal workday a good typist ’s fingers cover up to 20 miles on a QWERTY keyboard , but only one mile on a Dvorak keyboard .
QWERTY typists achieve barely half the speed of Dvorak typists , who hold most world records for typing speed .
QWERTY typists make about twice the errors that Dvorak typists make .
For a beginner to reach a speed of 40 words per minute , the person would need 56 hours of training on a QWERTY keyboard ( an average of four hours per day during my two weeks of chicken pox ) but only 18 hours on a Dvorak keyboard .
How , then , did the QWERTY keyboard arise ?
Why was it adopted , despite all its failings ?
And why in the world have we continued to stick with it ?
The first recorded typewriter patent was filed in 1714 by the British engineer Henry Mill , for an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another , as in writing . . . so neat and exact as not to be distinguished from print .
But there ’s no evidence that Mill actually built his proposed machine .
It was not until around 1808 that an Italian named Pellegrino Turri constructed a typewriter , which allowed a blind woman to write letters .
Over the next six decades , several dozen inventors filed patents or built prototypes , but none of the machines entered mass production or attained commercial success .
That had to wait until April 1874 , when the American gun manufacturer E. Remington & Sons , which had already branched out into sewing machines and farm tools , shipped its first Type Writer , based on a prototype by the American inventor Christopher Sholes .
From about 1880 to 1920 , an incredible diversity of competing models poured forth from numerous inventors ( including Thomas Edison ) and manufacturers .
Some of those early machines resembled pianos , some ( including Remington ’s first product ) looked like sewing machines , others were the recognizable ancestors of modern typewriters , and still others resembled no machine you have ever seen .
Letters were variously mounted on separate type bars , on a single ball , or on a single wheel , strip , or plate .
If separate type bars were used , they struck up , down , or sideways , behind or in front of the paper , which was mounted on a flat or curved carriage .
What moved was the type ball carrier ( as in the later ibm Selectric ) , the type bars ( as in modern mechanical typewriters ) , or the machine itself .
Ink was applied to a ribbon or directly to the typeface .
The desired letter was chosen by striking a key or by turning a dial .
Among machines that opted for striking a key , some struck one key at a time , others up to three at a time , like playing chords on a piano .
The typist ’s left and right hands either typed on the same keyboard or on two separate keyboards .
We now have separate numeral keys , combine uppercase and lowercase letters on the same type bar , and choose between uppercase and lowercase forms of the same letter with a shift key .
But other machines added numerals to that same bar and used two shift keys ( one for uppercase , another for numerals ) , while still others had separate uppercase , lowercase , and numeral keys .
Naturally , keyboards were equally diverse -- straight , curved , or circular , with one to nine rows of keys .
QWERTY was devised by Christopher Sholes , who began his typewriter - building experiments in 1867 .
Sholes ’s first keyboard used piano keys in a single row , with the letters in alphabetical order .
But he was soon forced to change that arrangement , because his type bars responded sluggishly .
When he struck one key soon after another , the second key ’s type bar jammed the first bar before the first could fall back , and the first letter was printed again .
Key jamming was still an occasional problem some 80 years later , when I had chicken pox , but at least by then the type bars struck the paper from the front side , so you could immediately see what was happening and separate the keys with your fingers .
Alas , with Sholes ’s machine and most other typewriters until the early part of the century , the type bars struck the invisible rear side of the paper , and you did n’t know the bars had jammed until you pulled out the page and saw that you had typed 26 lines of uninterrupted E’s instead of the Gettysburg Address .
To overcome the problem of invisible jamming , Sholes applied antiengineering principles with the goal of slowing down the typist and thus preventing the second bar from jamming the falling first bar .
At that time , modern typing speeds were not yet a goal .
The idea of eight - finger touch typing was still unknown .
Typists rummaged around with one or two fingers while looking at the keyboard , and Sholes was ecstatic if the resulting typing rate reached a measly 20 or 30 words per minute , the rate of writing by hand .
Sholes began to redesign his keyboard by commissioning a study to determine the most common letters or letter combinations in English texts , then he scattered those common letters as widely as possible over the keyboard .
For example , the three most common letters ( E , T , O ) were placed in the top row , the next two most common ( A , H ) in the home row , and the next most common ( N ) on the bottom row , causing the common digraph on to require a hurdle from top row to bottom .
Remington engineers slightly modified Sholes ’s almost - QWERTY design by transferring the common consonant R to the upper row , thereby enabling typewriter salesmen to show off their machine to prospective buyers by typing the word typewriter very quickly ( all the letters were now in the same row ) .
That final resulting keyboard still betrays its origin as an alphabetical arrangement of piano keys , by the nearly alphabetical sequence fghjkl in the home row , with de just to the left and I just to the right of that sequence .
The QWERTY keyboard of 1874 was eventually joined by many competing keyboards , whose manufacturers often boasted of faster or less tiring typing .
For instance , the Hammond and Blickensderfer Ideal keyboard used only three rows and sensibly put the most common letters in the bottom row for easy access , in the sequence dhiatensor .
Why did QWERTY nevertheless prevail , even after improvements in typewriter technology ( reducing the jamming problem ) and the demand for fast typing had removed the original motivation for it ?
For one thing , QWERTY enjoyed a head start , as the keyboard layout of the first commercially successful typewriter .
That success , however , was due not so much to the layout as to the many other advantageous components that Sholes added , such as type bars , an inked ribbon , and a cylindrical paper carriage .
Those inventions helped Remington remain one of the leading typewriter manufacturers , and the company continued to use QWERTY even as its typewriters evolved in other respects .
QWERTY gained another undeserved advantage around 1893 , when Underwood , Remington ’s chief rival , introduced a typewriter with two big virtues : visible typing on the front side of the paper , and a component called an accelerating sublever that permitted faster speed .
Those features helped propel the Underwood Model No. 5 to the status of the most long - lived and widely sold office standard typewriter .
Underwood happened to use the QWERTY keyboard .
QWERTY ’s early dominance meant that typewriter users became committed to the layout .
From 1874 until 1881 , the only typewriters commercially available were Remington machines with QWERTY keyboards , and typists learned to use them .
Some of those typists set up typing schools , where they taught the QWERTY keyboard familiar to them .
Their pupils took jobs at offices with the keyboards they knew .
Many businesses newly equipping themselves with typewriters ordered QWERTY machines , because it was easy to find typists trained to operate them .
Nevertheless , QWERTY ’s apotheosis came slowly .
As of 1900 , many typewriter engineers still disliked shift keys .
But touch typing was prohibitively difficult with the alternative - - a double keyboard with eight or nine rows of keys and separate keys dedicated to uppercase and lowercase letters .
As touch typing gradually became the norm , sales of double - keyboard machines declined ; the last model was discontinued in 1921 .
The infinitely superior Dvorak keyboard is named for August Dvorak , a professor of education at the University of Washington in Seattle and a distant cousin of the famous Czech composer Antonin Dvo?rák .
Around 1914 , August ’s brother - in - law William Dealey attended some industrial efficiency seminars led by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth , watched their slow - motion films of typists , and reported what he saw to Dvorak .
The brothers - in - law then devoted almost two decades to enormously detailed studies of typing , typists ’ errors , previously designed keyboards , hand physiology and function , and the relative frequencies of letters , pairs of letters , and words in English .
Finally , in 1932 , they took what they had learned and designed a new keyboard .
Dvorak typists began to sweep typing speed contests two years later , and they have held most typing records ever since .
A large - scale comparative test of several thousand children , carried out in the Tacoma schools in the 1930s , showed that children learned Dvorak typing in one - third the time required to attain the same standard with QWERTY typing .
When the U.S. Navy faced a shortage of trained typists in World War II , it experimented with retraining QWERTY typists to use Dvorak .
The retraining quickly enabled the Navy ’s test typists to increase their typing accuracy by 68 percent and their speed by 74 percent .
Faced with these convincing results , the Navy ordered thousands of Dvorak typewriters .
They never got them .
The Treasury Department vetoed the Navy purchase order , probably for the same reason that has blocked acceptance of all improved , non-QWERTY keyboards for the last 80 years : the commitment to QWERTY of tens of millions of typists , teachers , salespeople , office managers , and manufacturers .
Even when daisy wheels and computer printers replaced type bars , forever banishing the jamming problem that had originally motivated QWERTY , manufacturers of the efficient new technologies carried on the inefficient old keyboard .
August Dvorak died in 1975 , a bitter man : I ’m tired of trying to do something worthwhile for the human race , he complained .
They simply do n’t want to change !
QWERTY ’s saga illustrates a much broader phenomenon : how commitment shapes the history of technology and culture , often selecting which innovations become entrenched and which are rejected .
In the nineteenth - century United States , for example , those who profited from canals , barges , stagecoaches , and the pony express resisted the construction of railroads ; in England , electric street lighting spread slowly , partly because of opposition from local governments with heavy investments in gas lighting .
Even today , commitment influences railroad gauges and television technology , and whether we mark our rulers with centimeters or inches and drive on the right or the left .
Some of those choices , of course , make no real difference .
But others do .
The transistor was invented and patented in the United States in the 1940s .
So why does Japan today dominate the world market for transistorized consumer electronics products ?
Because the company that became
Sony bought transistor licensing rights from Western Electric at a time when the American consumer electronics industry was committed to churning out vacuum tube models and reluctant to compete with its own products .
The origins of many other commitments are now lost in remote history .
How did China become committed to its beautiful but hard - to- memorize writing system ?
Chinese children can master pinyin ( a Roman alphabet adapted to Chinese ) in one - tenth the time required to learn the traditional writing system .
Why do Americans cling to the awkward English measuring system of pounds , inches , and gallons ?
How did we become committed to decimal counting and a 24 - hour clock ?
Would we have been better off with other choices ?
Those questions are tantalizing but perhaps academic , because there is no prospect of our abolishing the 60 - minute hour or reverting to base - 60 counting , even if such changes did prove advantageous .
But we do have the choice of discarding QWERTY in favor of the Dvorak keyboard .
For QWERTY typists , learning the Dvorak keyboard is quick and painless , since they ’ve already mastered the hard part of typing -- coordinating finger movements .
A common but specious objection is that it would be prohibitively expensive to convert existing QWERTY office machinery .
In reality , mechanical typewriters are vanishing anyway , and the keyboard of any word processor or computer can be converted -- or changed back -- merely by pressing buttons .
The only real obstacle to our adoption of the Dvorak keyboard is that familiar fear of abandoning a long - held commitment .
But if we were to overcome that fear , millions of our children would be able to learn to type with increased speed , greatly lowered finger fatigue , greater accuracy , and a reduced sense of frustration .
That seems reason enough to end our commitment to QWERTY , a bad marriage that has long outlived its original justification .
Combating music piracy at Tennessee 's public university system is more important than hiring teachers and keeping down tuition costs .
Just - signed legislation requires the 222,000 - student system to spend an estimated $ 9.5 million ( .pdf ) for file sharing " monitoring software , " " monitoring hardware " and an additional " recurring cost of $ 1,575,000 for 21 staff positions and benefits ( @75,000 each ) to monitor network traffic " of its students .
Tennessee 's measure , ( .pdf ) approved Wednesday by Gov. Phil Bredesen , was the nation 's first in a bid to combat online file sharing within state - funded universities .
The law , similar versions of which the Recording Industry Association of America wants throughout the United States , comes as the Tennessee public university system is increasing tuition , laying off teachers and leaving unfilled vacant instructor positions to battle a $ 43.7 million shortfall .
" This bill , the first of its kind in the nation , addressed the issue of campus music theft in a state where the impact is felt more harshly than most , " said Mitch Bainwol , the RIAA 's chairman and CEO .
Bredesen , governor of the nation 's country music capital , said " The illegal downloading of music has a profoundly negative effect on the music industry .
As home to so many record companies , music publishers , writers and artists , I am proud that Tennessee is taking action to prevent it . "
The governor signed the bill the same day the Country Music Association doled out its annual music awards in Tennessee .
Cara Duckworth , an RIAA spokeswoman , said in an e-mail that the music companies ' lobbying and litigation arm would be " happy to talk to any policymaker about these issues .
It 's up to them to decide appropriate action . "
Tennessee 's law demands the state 's public universities " implement a policy " that " prohibits the infringement of copyrighted works over the school 's computer and network resources . "
Still , it 's likely the state 's output of public resources for the anti-piracy program could end up a boondoggle if students move to encrypted ( . pdf ) file sharing programs .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation added that , even if the filtering technology " magically " worked , students are gonna swap music .
The students may have more time to pilfer copyrighted works because their classes might be canceled for lack of funding .
Using conservative estimates , the piracy measure is equal to the price of about 100 Tennessee professors ' wages and benefits .

SACRAMENTO 
Less than two weeks before Election Day , the chief strategist behind a ballot measure outlawing same - sex marriage in California called an emergency meeting here .
“ We ’re going to lose this campaign if we do n’t get more money , ” the strategist , Frank Schubert , recalled telling leaders of Protect Marriage , the main group behind the ban .
The campaign issued an urgent appeal , and in a matter of days , it raised more than $ 5 million , including a $ 1 million donation from Alan C. Ashton , the grandson of a former president of the Mormon Church .
The money allowed the drive to intensify a sharp - elbowed advertising campaign , and support for the measure was catapulted ahead ; it ultimately won with 52 percent of the vote .
As proponents of same - sex marriage across the country planned protests on Saturday against the ban , interviews with the main forces behind the ballot measure showed how close its backers believe it came to defeat  and the extraordinary role Mormons played in helping to pass it with money , institutional support and dedicated volunteers .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The domino nature of the looming hedge fund crisis is neatly illustrated by the troubles of a high - flying New York fund with a niche that was supposed to be recession proof .
Laurus Capital Management , which manages $ 1.6 billion and has posted nearly 16 % annual returns since 2001 , is shuttering an $ 800 million portfolio after its largest investor said it would withdraw $ 300 million .
While investors are fleeing capital markets globally as both credit and equity investments falter , Laurus ' strategy of making private investments in public entities , known as PIPEs , was thought to be largely immune from this cycle .
The fund buys bonds and warrants convertible into equity in small companies whose stocks trade for pennies a share .
In a credit crunch , a PIPEs fund should be able to find attractive would - be debtors in need of capital .
And to a point , the PIPEs strategy has worked , with Laurus returning about 2.7 % through the end of August while hedge funds generally have shown losses this year .
The problem is that big institutional investors are growing unsure about hedge funds in general , and the big investor in the Laurus fund , the alternative strategies unit of Northwestern Mutual 's Russell Investments , has suffered losses in its hedge fund portfolio .
Russell 's plan to pull out its stake will force Laurus , run by a pair of Ukranian immigrant brothers , Eugene and David Grin , to make difficult decisions .
In an environment where money is tight , liquidating a portfolio of stakes in small companies wo n't be easy .
According to industry newsletter Hedge Fund Alert , which first reported Russell 's departure , Laurus might have a hard time unwinding its positions quickly without sustaining sharp losses .
Laurus is suspending redemptions for now to ensure that it is n't forced into a fire sale of assets , with the hope that all investors will eventually get their capital returned , said fund investor relations executive Dennis Pollack .
" We do n't have $ 300 million in cash on hand , " said Pollack , " And PIPEs are not the most liquid [ instrument ] in the market .
But we hired a firm to liquidate the portfolio and as we raise cash , it will be returned in an orderly fashion . "
Pollack added : " It 's really a shame since we were seeing some really good companies come to us for financing after their banks turned them down . "
A wider problem
The Russell unit invests in hedge funds on behalf of pensions , endowments and wealthy individuals .
It saw its $ 200 million investment in SageCrest LLC , a Greenwich , Conn . - based real estate lending fund , jeopardized last year when that fund wrote down 55 % of its portfolio .
In August , two of SageCrest 's funds filed for bankruptcy protection .
A call to Russell was not returned .
Last year , the Russell unit posted a 4.8 % loss and received a wave of redemption requests .
In turn , this led to the decision to shut two of its largest funds , with a combined $ 5.2 billion under management .
As for the Laurus fund , it 's rare that a fund with more than $ 200 million in assets or a long operating history has so much of its assets coming from one investor .
Pollack told Fortune.com that the reason Russell became such a disproportionately large percentage of Laurus is that it kept its stake in the fund while many investors chose to invest in a new Laurus offering , the Valens fund , which remains open .
Overview
The financial markets did not observe the August anniversary of the onset of turmoil with even a hint of fondness .
1
Instead , market participants seemed to mark the occasion as a kind of coming - of - age opportunity to act out .
The subsequent despair among market participants , disrepair in credit markets , and disregard for proper market functioning was more pronounced than witnessed in generations .
Significant market dislocations disrupted credit flows to households and firms and impaired economic growth .
All and all , these conditions demanded -- and received - - a forceful response from monetary , fiscal , and financial policymakers .
There are some notable signs of improvement .
Short - term funding spreads are retreating from extremely elevated levels .
Funding maturities are being extended beyond the very near term .
Money market funds and commercial paper markets are showing signs of stabilization .
And credit default swap spreads of banking institutions are narrowing significantly .
Nonetheless , financial markets overall remain strained .
Risk spreads remain quite high and lending standards appear strict .
Indications of economic activity in the United States have turned decidedly negative .
The economy contracted slightly in the third quarter , and the recent data on sales and production suggest that the fourth quarter will be weak .
Still , the depth and duration of this period of weak economic activity remain highly uncertain .
The financial turmoil revealed that the old financial architecture is broken .
But its successor is not yet established .
2
In my view , the prospects for robust economic growth over the intermediate term are likely to be determined , not principally by the trajectory of housing prices , but by the speed with which a new financial architecture emerges and the form that it takes .
This challenge of creating a new financial architecture is hardly unique to the United States .
The difficult choices made by policymakers and market participants around the globe will have real implications for future growth prospects .
What do I mean by a new financial architecture ?
Recent travails contributed to a consensus that the financial regulatory framework requires fundamental reform .
But , in my view , the financial architecture is necessarily broader than the government 's regulatory and supervisory response .
The new financial architecture , properly understood , must account for the dynamic relationship between private - market actions and public - sector strictures .
The economy 's financial architecture is a function of the relationship among financial institutions and market participants that transfer capital and risk between borrowers and savers .
But the architecture is also informed by the mix of prescriptions and postures of the Congress , the Administration , and the financial regulators , including the Federal Reserve .
This circumstance is particularly the case during times of financial turmoil .
In my remarks today , I will first advance a plain assessment of what is afflicting global financial markets .
Many observers judge that weaknesses in housing finance , and the associated boom and bust in the housing sector , are the principal cause of the market turmoil and economic malaise .
In my view , however , recent market developments -- in the United States and abroad -- strongly indicate that the causes of the turmoil are broader and more fundamental than the problems in the mortgage markets .
Second , I will highlight actions by financial market participants in the transition to a new financial architecture .
Financial institutions are being fundamentally transformed by the events of the last several quarters .
Massive changes in business models , corporate forms , and funding sources are taking place faster than could be imagined even a few months ago .
There is no going back to the old arrangements , nor should there be .
And a new equilibrium will take shape only when financial institutions seize new opportunities and the changes in the rules of engagement and the relationship with the official sector are more clearly understood .
Third , I will discuss actions of the official sector during this period of turmoil .
Most of these policy actions have been taken in vigorous pursuit of financial stability -- that is , to reduce financial stresses , shore up credit intermediation , and thereby support economic activity .
And that makes good sense .
Some material lessening of financial instability is essential so that markets can function properly and the economy can avoid more substantial weakness .
But stability in and of itself should not be the be-all and end - all of policy .
Rather , actions fostering financial stability should be temporary , providing a bridge to a new , more effective financial architecture .
And that architecture should aspire to increase , not decrease , potential output through an economic cycle .
The Nature of the Financial Market Turmoil
Many observers maintain that the boom and bust in the housing market are the root cause of the current turmoil .
No doubt housing - related losses are negatively affecting household wealth and spending .
Moreover , the weakness in housing markets and uncertainty about its path have caused financial institution balance sheets to deteriorate .
This situation has further accelerated the deleveraging process and tightened credit conditions for businesses and households .
When liquidity pulled back dramatically in August 2007 , housing suffered mightily .
3
For reasons well documented , including expectations that home prices would invariably increase , housing proved to be a highly vulnerable asset class .
Many homeowners , particularly those that purchased properties during 2005 through 2007 , are suffering .
And many banks and other financial firms that extended mortgage credit or purchased mortgage - related assets have written down sharply the value of those assets .
Public and private policy actions have been taken to help cushion the blow to many homeowners and financial firms .
4
While housing may well have been the trigger for the onset of the broader financial turmoil , I have long believed it is not the fundamental cause .
5
Indeed , recent financial market developments strongly indicate that housing , as an asset class , does not stand alone .
Indeed , the problems associated with housing finance reveal broader failings , including inadequate market discipline , excessive reliance on credit ratings , and poor credit and liquidity risk - management practices by many financial firms .
During the past several months , this domestic housing - centric diagnosis has also been subjected to a natural experiment .
Among U.S. financial institutions , asset quality concerns are no longer confined to the mortgage sector .
At the same time , non-U.S. financial institutions -- including some with relatively modest exposures to the United States or their own domestic housing markets -- appear to be suffering substantial losses .
Equity prices of European banks declined more on average during 2008 year - to - date than their U.S. counterparts .
Moreover , economic weakness among our advanced foreign trading partners is increasingly evident , even among economies with more modest exposures to the housing sector .
If the challenges to the economy were predominantly about the value of the housing stock , my focus today would be far narrower than the establishment of a new financial architecture .
So , what diagnosis , beyond housing weakness , is consistent with the unprecedented levels of volatility and dramatic financial market and economic distress ?
I would advance the following :
We are witnessing a fundamental reassessment of the value of virtually every asset everywhere in the world .
Short - term funding markets have become suspect .
Roll - overs of existing maturities reveal systematic underpricing of once seemingly benign risks -- credit , liquidity , counterparty , and even sovereign risks -- which demand reassessment and recalibration .
Indeed , wide - ranging assessments of these risks are being crudely incorporated into the pricing of virtually all assets .
In some cases , at present , the risks do not appear to be reliably quantifiable , and trading has become impaired .
Until these assessments are more cleanly refined and more broadly understood , we are likely to observe elevated levels of volatility and unwillingness by many investors to participate in certain asset markets virtually at any price .
This phenomenon is proving quite detrimental to global economic growth .
In my view , the speed and success of a new financial architecture is likely to be more consequential to economic growth than the design and implementation of well - intended housing policies alone .
The establishment of a new financial architecture , thus , is the essential policy response to the greatest economic challenge of our time .
Financial Institution Response in Pursuit of Survival and Success
In a speech about seven months ago , I noted that the transformation of financial institutions would be among the key variables that would affect the path of the real economy , but " the changing paradigm of financial intermediation " is happening even more abruptly .
6
The largest investment banks chose a different fate , or had one chosen for them .
Many of the largest nonbank financial companies are no doubt reviewing their regulatory status .
Large numbers of hedge funds , recently perceived as central to a well - diversified asset allocation program , are struggling for survival .
Their investors are being rudely reminded that alpha- returns cannot , by definition , be universally achieved .
Large money center banks are casting a keen eye on their sources and uses of funding .
And traditional community - based banks are adapting to a dramatically different competitive dynamic with respect to deposits and lending opportunities alike .
The business of banking -- and credit intermediation , more broadly -- is fundamentally changing .
Wholesale funding models are severely stressed .
Heavy reliance on interbank funding and short - term indebtedness is proving highly detrimental to a financial institutions ' health and society 's welfare .
Some of the highest - rated financial products , ironically , are suffering the greatest diminutions in value .
Selling volatility and insuring tail risks are far riskier propositions than many imagined .
These products and practices are proving to be a significant source of large , uncapped losses threatening to impair once - hearty franchises .
We are witnessing perhaps the fastest , most significant structural shift in the history of the financial services sector .
The direct share of value added in the finance and insurance sector approximated 8 percent of U.S. gross domestic produce ( GDP ) in recent years .
This is about 3 percentage points higher than the contribution of financial services to GDP only a generation ago .
Similarly , profits of the Standard & Poor 's 500 attributable to the finance sector peaked at more than 21 percent during this cycle , 5 - 1/ 2 percentage points greater than a decade ago .
As the financial sector continues to delever and many financial products disappear altogether , the sector 's shares of GDP and profits will shrink further .
This reduction could involve many firms shrinking largely in tandem or , more likely , the orderly unwinding or sale of inefficient or unwise firms .
7
The markets are fearful , in part I suspect , because of the swiftness of the reallocation of resources in the financial sector .
The Official Sector Response in Pursuit of Financial Stability
The turmoil of the past several quarters coincides with further erosion of confidence in what financial institutions and other market participants knew - - or thought they knew - - about the environment in which they were operating .
It is no surprise , then , that those bearing the brunt of the turmoil are pining for calmer times , a period of less volatility , when market prices again comport with historical regressions and newfangled financial models .
To wit , a return to financial stability .
Government officials , in the U.S. and abroad , are not unsympathetic to this aspiration for calmer times .
8
But policymakers are prudent to balance the near - term imperative to take actions to achieve financial stability with the objective -- just over the horizon -- of facilitating the development of a new financial architecture in which market participants re-engage , provide credit to the real economy , and yes , succeed or fail .
The Fed has a long and proud tradition , not solely as the monetary authority , but also as a regulator , supervisor , and lender of last resort to help foster financial stability .
9
The Fed is in the financial stability business .
But it 's not our only business .
The Federal Reserve 's financial stability responsibilities are not , in my view , an independent goal of policy .
They are best understood through the lens of our broader objectives for the economy .
The conduct of monetary policy , banking supervision and regulation , and the provision of liquidity are regular Federal Reserve activities that contribute to financial stability , and in so doing , help achieve improved macroeconomic performance .
During this period of turmoil , the Fed has increasingly been called upon to be a steadying influence .
When appropriate , and after due consideration , the Fed has chosen to employ its balance sheet , authority , and credibility to lessen the harm to the real economy .
That is our role and responsibility .
But we should resist the temptation to play a larger role than statutorily mandated or economically prudent .
Good - faith pleas for relief in the name of financial stability will continue for some time , and the Fed should carefully consider the facts and circumstances .
That period of consideration may require us , however , to be cognizant of the perils of popularity and decline to take action , including when it may be more properly considered or better addressed by the fiscal authorities .
So it is , financial stability has become the watchword of the global economy .
But its frequency in our lexicon should not be confused with clarity as to its meaning or the timing of its achievement .
Nor should it be construed as the sole beacon of policy .
What is financial stability ?
It is perhaps easier to define by its absence .
10 Financial instability is a situation in which stresses on markets and institutions are sufficiently severe that the intermediation between borrowers and savers is threatened , with the prospect of significant risks to the broader economy .
Financial stability , moreover , should not be equated with an absence of volatility .
If some unexpected news arrives , markets adjust , often sharply .
Generally , these adjustments are not cases of financial instability .
A healthy and well - functioning financial system will reward well - managed risk - taking and punish imprudence , sometimes harshly .
Such outcomes are not pretty and can be marked by large and pervasive losses , but most do not necessitate extraordinary policy interventions .
Nonetheless , circumstances of pronounced financial instability , while rare , do arise .
In the most recent episode , we policymakers deemed it necessary to take significant actions to mitigate the risks to the real economy .
Financial firms became highly protective of their balance sheets and sought to disengage en masse from the provision of credit .
The Fed responded , introducing lending facilities designed to support liquidity in overnight and short - term funding markets .
With the approval of the Congress , Treasury also took significant action , making large capital injections directly into banks to help jump - start the credit intermediation process .
This action was supplemented by various forms of government guarantees .
But bold official policy responses , even when successful in combating financial instability , may not be enough to support the resumption of trend economic growth over the medium term .
Why is government action aimed at financial stability not sufficient to usher in a new era of prosperity ?
Because the broader financial architecture remains in substantial flux , as is sometimes unavoidable .
Confidence in markets and institutions cannot be demanded or forced by edict .
Confidence in a new architecture cannot be jury - rigged , even by well - designed government actions .
Nor can confidence be rushed .
Comprehensive policy prescriptions to address financial instability are now being delivered to the ailing patient .
But a dose of patience itself may be equally important to help the recuperative process .
Time is required for the medicines to be administered and their efficacy to be judged .
New prescriptions , however well intentioned , can prove unsettling to a patient who is searching to find his footing .
Of course , policy must respond to serious situations as they arise ; and , during the past 15 months , these developments have been difficult to anticipate with precision .
But , if the framework for policy decisions is not viewed as clear , consistent , and predictable by market participants , the resulting actions run the risk of contributing to , rather than reducing , market volatility -- at the most inauspicious of times .
Finally , actions intended to help achieve financial stability should not be allowed to interfere with the establishment of a sturdy , new financial architecture .
Concluding Remarks
I am reminded of a certain Omaha - based investor who says that his investment style is to be greedy when other investors are fearful , and be fearful when others are greedy .
11 I would modify the advice somewhat to make it applicable to policymakers :
We should be steady when financial market participants are fearful , and fearful when markets appear steady .
This call for steadiness is not some nostrum , implying that the government should be passive during times of significant economic turmoil .
Quite the contrary .
But comprehensive policy prescriptions are most effective when they establish new rules of engagement that are clear in intent , consistent in application , and reasonably predictable in effect .
This policy formulation should allow financial firms to regain their footing and market participants , more broadly , to take new , constructive actions to facilitate the availability of credit .
Perhaps in this way , policymakers and market participants alike can best contribute to the development of a reformed and robust financial architecture .
I see more promise than peril over the horizon .
The speed of these changes in the financial architecture understandably brings fear to some market participants , but it may equally sow the seeds of recovery .
Policymakers are keenly observing the pulse of private financial institutions and other market participants to gauge their ability to take up the cause of reform and renewal .
If financial institutions readily and steadily approach new ways of intermediating credit , the real economy might recover sooner and with more vigor than expected .
If not , if private market participants prove unable or unwilling to establish new business models , then the effects of the current financial market turmoil may be a significant drag on economic growth long after stability is ostensibly achieved .
Getting the architecture right is essential to address the central challenge facing our economy .

A grand jury in rural Louisiana considers Tuesday whether to bring murder charges against a Taser - wielding police officer in what may become a seminal case in the hotly debated history of stun guns .
No US jury has ever convicted a police officer in connection with a death related to use of an electroshock weapon .
But the number of deaths in which the guns have played a role has been growing , along with their use in law enforcement agencies .
Now , the coroner in Winnfield , La. , has found the death of one Baron " Scooter " Pikes to be homicide by Taser , intensifying a simmering controversy over the devices and exposing the tense tug of war between police and young black men in rural Louisiana .
After Winnfield Parish police took Mr. Pikes , who is black , into custody one January morning , a white police officer fired a Taser , jolting Pikes nine times in the span of 14 minutes .
Pikes never woke up .
Police said the 21 - year - old Pikes was on drugs and uncooperative , but coroner Randolph Williams took a different view .
In a report last month , he said he found no signs of a physical struggle , of drugs , or of any medical condition that could have exacerbated the jolts ' effect .
As police departments across the US look for nonlethal ways to subdue out - of - control people , a big question is whether such devices reduce violence or , in effect , can increase the likelihood of violence , even torture .
The Pikes death is just one case , but it appears to show that the combination of simmering racial tensions and insufficient police training can be lethal when injected with a 50,000 - volt jolt .
" If the Taser was indeed the cause of death , this could be an interesting case , " says Andrew Scott , former police chief of Boca Raton , Fla. , who has testified on the behalf of officers in stun - gun cases .
" Given the historical corruption of law enforcement in the area , and the fact that the young man was tased nine times , something is definitely wrong with this picture . "
Two - thirds of all police departments in the US own at least one electroshock weapon .
The guns have played a role in nearly 300 deaths in the US and Canada since their introduction in 1998 , Amnesty International reported in June .
Yet most wrongful - death lawsuits have gone the Taser 's way , with juries finding that factors ranging from hard drugs in a person 's system to existing medical conditions were responsible for or contributed to their deaths .
The weapons , also called electronic control devices , are part of a transformation in policing , away from bullets and guns and toward " Star Trek " - like devices that can , from a law - enforcement standpoint , safely and quickly defuse volatile situations .
" We did n't get this [ negative ] reaction when nightsticks were used to split heads open , but because of the technology and what it does , the media have really exacerbated the issue of the Taser , " says Mr. Scott .
" The upside of the Taser far outweighs the unfortunate abuse or downside . "
But with some 260,000 units in the hands of law enforcement officials , and with no major federal regulation governing their use , stun - gun use in cases like the one in Louisiana is revealing unintended drawbacks of this particular tool of policing , says Thomas Luka , a defense attorney in Orlando , Fla .
Used most often before officers are physically threatened , the devices are changing the relationship between police and the populace , especially on the streets .
" We 're seeing injuries that would n't normally happen on a routine traffic stop , and all of a sudden they 're happening , " says Mr. Luka .
The American Civil Liberties Union has not called for a ban on devices such as Tasers .
But in the light of studies that show potential health effects of getting jolted and a general lack of training , national standards , and federal oversight , the ACLU says the devices have created a troubling gray area for US civil rights .
" The Taser in many cases is going to be safe , but it 's those other cases , which actually are prevalent in the population that police interact with , that we have a lot of concerns about , " says Mark Schlosberg , an electroshock - weapons expert with the ACLU in San Francisco .
A federal National Institute of Justice study released in June drew this conclusion on devices such as Tasers : " Although exposure ... is not risk free , there is no conclusive medical evidence within the state of current medical research that indicates a high risk of serious injury or death from the direct effects of CED [ conducted - energy device ] exposure . "
Still , the public shows signs of souring on the devices .
Seven states have banned their use , and some police departments are reevaluating their stun - gun policies , specifically to wait for an imminent threat of physical violence before resorting to their use and to restrict officers to fewer than three jolts before moving on to hand - to - hand restraint .
But for many police departments , critics say , electroshock weapons are routinely and increasingly deployed in a variety of situations , with plenty of room for questionable improvisation .
" Police sometimes do things they 're not supposed to do , and if you put the temptation in front of them , if you tell 100 police officers that , ' Here 's your Tasers , and you 're not supposed to use them to punish , ' someone is going to use them to punish .
It 's predictable , " says Michael Baden , the former chief medical examiner for the New York State Police .
The Winnfield Parish case is likely to test all those aspects , highlighting racial tensions between blacks and police evident in many parts of the US .
Roughly corresponding to overall crime data , 46 percent of the people who died in stun - gun - related incidents were black and 36 percent were white .
Winnfield Parish , birthplace of famed Louisiana Gov. Huey Long , has a long history of police corruption .
The officer who administered the Taser to Pikes , Scott Nugent , was a rookie cop hired by a police chief who served time on a drug charge but was pardoned by former Gov. Edwin Edwards , who himself is now in federal prison .
A first cousin of Mychal Bell – the main defendant in the Jena 6 case that last year sparked the century 's largest civil rights march – Pikes at the time of his arrest , on an outstanding warrant , struggled with police and then fell sick , complaining of asthma and the effects of PCP , police said after his death .
But bystanders said Pikes , who knew the officers , pleaded with them , " Do n't tase me again , please . "
The Police Department has admitted no wrongdoing , though the City Council fired Nugent in May .
The medical examiner is risking his relationship with the police department by listing the death as a homicide , but his autopsy was sound , according to Mr. Baden , who reviewed the findings .
" This is a major case , " says Carol Powell - Lexing , a lawyer representing Pikes 's family .
" It 's significant in the sense it shows how this young officer exceeded his authority and use of force , and it shows how dangerous those Tasers are .
The community wo n't rest until they see appropriate relief in regards to this situation . "

Exclusive to STR
Recently an " Editor 's Pick " here recommended a no-charge Flash presentation by Chris Martenson about the next 20 years , appropriately called The Crash Course .
I endorse that ; it 's outstanding .
I 've seen many presentations , but never one more professionally delivered .
Further , its 2 ' hour total viewing time is split into 21 short parts , so as to make it easy to absorb over a few days if need be .
It is articulate , authoritative , and concise ; a delight to watch , and highly topical in the present dire situation .
I particularly enjoyed his segments on " Bubbles " and on " Fuzzy Numbers . "
In the latter , he details how the Feds deliberately mis-report some of their key statistics so as to look better and pay out less .
Given that most of the Course was made prior to this September 's unraveling , it may be considered prophetic .
As with anything else , though , it 's a good idea to keep one 's critical faculty alive and well ; and as I see it , not everything is correctly stated .
Its sections about the government 's shell - game for creating money are pretty sound and expressed with even greater clarity than the master himself , Murray Rothbard -- though the superb presentation tools available today were not around in the master 's time .
So it 's very well worth taking the time to watch .
Even on money , however , I saw a flaw , and write this to ensure the weaknesses are n't unobserved .
Dr. Martenson 's theme is threefold ; he examines Economy , Energy , and Environment .
After explaining what compounding and exponential growth mean , he shows that each of the three happen to have reached a highly critical phase right now , and are developing adversely in an exponential manner -- fast running out of control .
The facts that they are all doing so now together , and are closely interrelated , make the solutions especially challenging ; he avers that " massive change is upon us " and " the next 20 years will be completely different from the last 20 years . "
Since he shares some of the premises we hold on Strike The Root , including an endorsement of the Austrian economic school , it behooves us to give him at least the time of day .
Please watch his presentation yourself , but in a summary much too brief his argument is :
1 . On the economy , a debt - based money system is fast running amok at the very time that world population is doubling every four decades with a universal demand for equally rapid growth in prosperity .
Such prosperity can result only from savings , yet our savings rate has plummeted in the last 25 years and our debt ( personal as well as governmental ) already exceeds our ability to support it with income .
The current financial fiasco is a mere harbinger of far worse to come .
2 . About energy , of which half is oil - derived , the world has already passed the " peak " of availability .
There is plenty left , but from now on it will become much more expensive to extract , not just in money terms but in energy terms ; that is , the trend is to use more energy to extract new energy , and when as much as one unit is needed to extract one unit , game over : no more energy .
Some non-oil sources are nowhere close to that condition and never will be , but those sources ( wind , solar , etc. ) are so ill - developed that decades of development are needed before they can replace oil , and we do n't have decades available .
3 . Regarding the environment , he rightly passes by the alleged " global warming " problem as irrelevant , compared to what he calls the very acute and immediate problem of fast - diminishing resources of critical metals , minerals and even food .
Put those three together , as he says they are right now , and you have a sense of why his " Crash Course " deserves our attention .
My antennae twitched early in my first view of the Course , to suggest that Dr. Martenson might be some kind of Malthusian - - for right there in the second segment he portrays the dramatic growth in human population as some kind of a problem , not as an object of wonder and celebration .
Having watched it all twice now , I 'm fairly sure he is one .
But that is not a sound reason to dismiss his findings ; the mere fact that every prophet of doom from Jeremiah to Al Gore has so far been dead wrong does not mean that Martenson is wrong .
If they are to be dismissed , that should happen because his reasoning is wrong , not because we may find his conclusions unwelcome .
And since he is a very , very bright person who presents his findings brilliantly , that is no trivial task .
This article begins an assessment , and I hope and expect others will join in to offer something more profound .
Before considering each of Dr. Martenson 's " Three Es " , I 'll pick a nit , because it has later implications : he frequently describes the shape of an exponential curve as a " hockey stick " ' i.e. , one with a sharp elbow or inflection at some point .
That is simply misleading .
The slope of a graph of y=nx increases at a constant rate , with no inflection points , and if plotted on a logarithmic scale such a graph appears perfectly linear for that reason .
Okay , on to the first E .
Economy
One conclusion offered in the Course is that hyperinflation is inevitable , with a consequent dissolution of the economy , because each year at least enough new money must be created to pay the interest on past outstanding debts , of which a large part was incurred by previous acts of money creation .
I questioned this , and Dr. Martenson was kind enough to reply and remind me that he was speaking only of the US method , using the Federal Reserve Bank which charges interest for its service .
I can see his point .
If the creation of a hundred billion new " dollars " annually requires the future payment of $ 4 billion in interest , then next year it will need $ 104 billion , a year later $ 108.16 , then $ 112.5 billion , and so on until the money system explodes in hyperinflation .
I notice that has n't happened yet , despite 95 years of the Federal Reserve - - but it may ; he is right .
However , we have to be very careful with the logic here .
First , whatever mechanism is used to create new money cannot be free of all cost .
The Federal Reserve charges interest , usually about 4 % a year ; if some wholly - owned central bank did the job , it too would require funding and everything we know about government efficiency says it would not be cheap .
More than 4 % or less , who can tell -- but it would not be zero .
Next , I know of no reason ( except government profligacy , repeatedly spending more than it receives ) why any new " money " has to be created at all .
It is perfectly possible for the economy to operate on the present M3 supply ( about $ 12 trillion ) forever , with neither increase nor decrease .
For two centuries after America was colonized , a fixed money supply was close to what did prevail , for government was constrained by a gold standard -- and the economy did very well .
The fact that no government anywhere has withstood the temptation to monetize its debts since the 20th Century began is an indictment of all governments everywhere -- but not of the particular ways they do the monetizing .
All a government has to do , to avoid inflation , is to match taxes with spending , the latter to include payment of interest and principal on any loans previously incurred for any reason .
Third , two of the most spectacular examples of hyperinflation have been the German one of 1923 and the Zimbabwean one of the present time .
Neither of those governments used a debt - based money system ( each operated a central bank directly ) and the German one stopped the runaway cold by powering off the printing press , just as soon as it got up its nerve .
Mr Mugabe 's nerve has not yet arisen , as the nearby illustration shows .
The Course segments on the economy do contain some excellent material .
There 's a fine account of why the " Social Security " system is neither social nor secure , and of how in the last quarter century the US savings rate , on which all future investment depends , has plunged close to zero .
The progress of prices over the last 200 years is very well described , although the clear inflection in their growth curve , after the FedGov got its quasi- central bank , proves that their overall change has not been an exponential growth as stated .
But Dr. Martenson 's main claim here , that the use of an interest - charging Fed makes hyperinflation mathematically inevitable , is not correct in my opinion , for the reasons above .
The US economy may collapse , but if so the Federal Reserve will not be the prime culprit ; government will .
Clearly a zero - government society could not have inflation , for if any bank issued false , unbacked " certificates , " it would be out of business by week 's end -- yet that possibility , alas , earns no mention in the Crash Course .
The " Economy " section of the Course also considers demographics -- the exponentially growing world population .
However , I saw no rationale advanced to prove that the doubling of the last four decades will be repeated in the next four , let alone the four after that .
Against this expectation that it will go on increasing at a little over 1 % a year , there is the observation that when a society has become prosperous -- when members have some choice about how they will dispose of income surplus to what is required for survival -- people choose to have fewer kids .
In some ( e.g. Russia ) the growth is actually negative - - each couple has fewer than two children .
Currently a majority of the world 's population continues at the subsistence level that has prevailed for 50,000 years -- and in which every child is seen as a source of future security -- but that is changing fast .
As free - market ideas proliferate and governments retreat , that tendency to have two each or fewer will also spread , and the world 's population will likely stabilize -- but no such consideration appears in the Crash Course .
Even if it does not stabilize , however , it seems to me a classic Malthusian error to deny ( even by implication ) that ( a ) human life is immensely valuable by any measure or belief system except those of government and that ( b ) the more people , the more ingenuity can be expected , to produce good things to eat and drink .
No , we are not about to overcrowd this little planet and exhaust its ability to feed us ; the reverend doomster was wrong .
Energy
In some ways this is the most powerful and worrying part of the Crash Course , because the reserve of oil in the Earth 's crust really does n't care what humans do , with or without governments .
Martenson 's Peak Oil rationale , first enunciated by M. King Hubbert in 1956 , is well established .
The Crash Course does n't discuss how its supply might be prolonged by higher prices that also stimulate production of energy from alternative sources , which I regret ; but it is probably true that some time soon , oil will become too expensive in terms of energy required for extraction for more to be produced .
All the more reason to hurry to alternative sources of energy ; and all the more reason for government to get out of the way -- yet that urgent need does not surface in the Course , not even when the obvious first step of " drill , drill , drill " off the coast is subject to political debate .
That item alone cries out for private ownership of oceans , such as would prevail when governments have evaporated , but that too is a concept never mentioned .
Additionally , the understanding of energy that Huber & Wells present in their remarkable Bottomless Well , which was written at least two years before the Crash Course appeared , receives no consideration .
Those authors argue that " the cost of energy as we use it has less and less to do with the cost of fuel " and predict a bright , limitless future in which the " competitive advantage in manufacturing is now swinging decisively back toward the U.S. " because we are uniquely able to order our use of energy through hi-tech .
Huber & Wells also reason that humanity is destined to use more and more energy in our pursuit of prosperity and that if one source runs dry , we will rapidly find another .
This has indeed been our history ; it 's hard to see why it should not also be our future .
This omission in the Course illustrates what I think is its main and Malthusian failing : Martenson foresees the rapid multiplication of problems , often correctly , but seems to assume that man and his ingenuity in solving them will not progress .
That may be true if we are governed ; it is absolutely false if we are free .
Yet , again , Dr. Martenson makes no mention of what difference would be made to his outlook if the archaic institution of government were abolished altogether .
The Crash Course site incorporates Forums ( why not join and contribute ? ) and some writers there are challenging the doom - laden view about the future of energy .
" Majormoney " , for example , points out ( for " 17a " ) the abundance of energy sources other than oil , and that many of them are not exhaustible , or subject to any kind of " Peak X " -- solar , geothermal , wind , tide , etc .
Yes , there is urgent need to exploit them , but the steadily rising price of oil will furnish the incentive ; the main possible obstacle is government and its regulations , so once again the urgent need is to see it deep - sixed .
But of that , Martenson makes no mention .
Environment
Not just oil , but other resources too are reaching a " peak " in which the future cost of extraction ( copper , coal , even uranium ) will be much higher than in the past and in every case the energy needed to do so ( not just the money ) will rise exponentially ; that 's the theme of this segment of the Course .
Worst of all , food itself is approaching a peak , Martenson says , because after generations of ever - intensifying farming to feed an exponentially - increasing world population , the soil has been depleted ; and again , more energy is needed to grow and harvest food .
All this , at a moment when population seems poised to add another 150 million mouths a year whose owners all expect and demand that ample food and the wonders of affluent living will fast become theirs .
This is not a pretty picture .
Is this true ?
It 's worth a pause to reflect .
Obviously , it may be true that some important resources are running out ; I do not know , for example , how much copper remains in the Earth 's crust and if miners ( who have both the incentive and the skills to figure it out ) say that it 's becoming exhausted , then so it may be .
But the energy argument ( i.e. , that the energy needed for extraction is itself running short ) is false , as above ; there may be a short - term rise in cost but as soon as inexhaustible energy sources come on - line , that part of the problem will end .
As to resource R1 being literally and fully used up , replacement R2 will be discovered and exploited to take its place , pretty darn quick -- for the profit motive will kick in fast , provided only that government keeps out of the way .
One example , regarding copper : a generation ago there were no water pipes or telephones without copper , but today there are plastic pipes that are much cheaper and wireless telephones that are cheap enough for most every teenager to carry .
Once again , the inexhaustible resource that matters most is that of human ingenuity ; and the more humans , the more ingenuity .
The argument about soil depletion seems a worry -- but it was also a worry until the late Middle Ages , when crop rotation was invented .
Before that happy day , doomsayers may well have been predicting the kind of starvation scenario now envisaged in the Crash Course ; but necessity was the mother of invention , and she is still fertile .
What the particular solution will be , I do n't know -- but last time I took a flight , I saw that an enormous part of this land was covered with forest , and it does n't seem unlikely to me that in coming decades some of that renewable resource will be harvested for fuel and some of the land released , for growing food for the first time ever .
The speed with which that happens will relate directly to the degree to which the land owner is free to turn on a dime and respond to whatever price indications are given him by a free market .
The same , or similar , is true the world over ; soil for food production is abundant worldwide and the main obstacles are governments that prevent its profitable use .
Zimbabwe comes to mind in this connection too ; one generation ago , as Southern Rhodesia it was producing enough food and to spare , as the second most prosperous nation in Africa .
Then farm ownership was prohibited to the only people who knew how to farm . . . so now a loaf costs two billion of the units that , a few years ago , would exchange one for one with the US dollar .
Conclusion
The three acute problems identified in the Crash Course are real and challenging , but all three are significantly overstated as above ; so , therefore , is the resulting " perfect storm " that they will combine to produce .
Meanwhile , a fourth acute problem is that we have allowed all others to be addressed not by risk - taking innovators with a personal stake in the outcome , but by politicians with enormous power but no such personal stake at all , who have led this country and the world into one major disaster after another .
The " market " , which served early Americans so well even when restricted , has very largely been supplanted by a non-market , political apparatus called " government . "
That critical , fourth problem towers above the others in importance , yet receives no explicit mention at all .
The final , eagerly anticipated 22nd segment ( numbered 20 ) appeared while I was writing this review , under the title " What Should I Do ? " and some measure of the importance of the " Crash Course " is that it was watched more than 50,000 times in the first 24 hours .
I anticipated it might suggest battening down the hatches , or else taking political action ; I doubted that it would propose working to remove that great , fourth obstacle so that the other three have some hope of being solved , and unfortunately I was right .
No such advice is offered .
In fact , Dr. Martenson gives his very fine version of the first -- to batten down the hatches .
It suggests what action individuals can and should take to protect ourselves from the hard times to come , having systematically analyzed our own assessments of risks and impacts , and is very well worth watching .
He is right ; self - preservation must be the first priority .
Earlier in the Course , he hints that we may have to live much more simply ; and that he is " living proof " that a lower standard of life need not mean a lower quality of life , something Thoreau might applaud .
Some here may endorse that ; I for one do not .
I have not yet given up on the expectation of continuing vast ( and perhaps exponential ! ) growth in prosperity , health and happiness for all of mankind , not by a long shot ; the only serious obstacle is government itself , and the means to remove that is already in place .
So it 's really too bad that he did not bring it all together and conclude that all the dangers that face us were either created or exacerbated by government and that therefore government has to go .
Had he done so , I 'd have suggested he join TOLFA so as to help that job get done -- by an exponentially growing number of individuals acting without any collective organization at all , with close to zero cost , and inside the very 20 - year period he says will be so different from all before .
Dem infighting risks inaction on labor , global warming bills Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 25 , 2008
Print This Email This Democrats have expanded their majorities in Congress and are inching towards a filibuster - proof 60 votes in the Senate , but marshaling lock - step unity has never been a strong point for party leaders , raising the prospects that infighting among Democratic factions could slow or derail key legislation .
Politico outlined some of the key areas where Democrats are divided .
Unless Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) can whip their caucuses into unity , numerous fault lines will be revealed : Southern Democrats vs. Northern liberals on labor law ; California greens vs. Rust Belt Democrats on global warming ; socialized medicine adherents vs. go - slow health care reformers ; anti-war liberals vs. cautious centrists on national security .
And dont forget the anti-bailout crowd vs. the powerful Michigan Democrats in both chambers when it comes to money for Detroit .
The disagreements between different Democratic factions became clear as soon as the election ended , when Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) launched his ultimately successful coup to take over the chairmanship of the Energy & Commerce Committee , unseating Rep. John Dingell ( D - MI ) , the longest - serving current member of the House .
Waxman , a friend to environmentalists and progressives , will be well positioned to shepherd through the House dramatic overhauls to US energy and healthcare policy as chairman of the powerful committee .
Some Midwestern Democrats saw the ouster of Dingell as a snub to the interests of their manufacturing - heavy and economically depressed states .
The bigger struggle will come in the Senate , where some moderate Democrats oppose dramatic action on global warming and hence may not help the party garner 60 votes .
Republicans , for their part , are ready to sit back and enjoy the Democrats ' struggles .
 When you re playing with live ammunition and you have to actually live with the consequences of the policy , it s much , much tougher ,  Michael Steel , a spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - OH ) told Politico .
 Do Democrats really want to hamstring U.S. manufacturers with new climate change regulations in the current economic climate ?
To be sure , President - elect Barack Obama has indicated that finding pragmatic solutions is among his top priorities .
And , the Democrats certainly find themselves better off disagreeing amongst themselves than they were for the last eight years , where most proposals could n't get off the ground because of assured vetoes from President Bush .

Harry Reid To Punish Joe Lieberman for Supporting McCain
President - elect Barack Obama promised to heal the wounds of America .
He promised to get us past the partisan politics and usher in a new age of enlightenment .
He promised that he would work in a bipartisan manner and unite the country .
Nancy Pelosi said much the same thing when she claimed that if the Democrats had a larger majority they would actually be more bipartisan .
Elect us , hold us accountable , and make a judgment and then go from there .
But I do tell you that if the Democrats win , and have substantial majorities , Congress of the United States will be more bipartisan , ”
Now that the campaign is over and Barack Obama has won , the congress and senate have grown their majorities it is time to see if their actions match the words that they spewed prior to the election .
The early indications are just as I thought they would be .
Today Majority Leader Harry Reid sat down with Senator Joe Lieberman to discuss Lieberman ’s future as the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman ’s affiliation with Democrats was in question after a meeting Thursday with Majority Leader Harry Reid , steamed over the Connecticut independent ’s high - profile support of John McCain for president .
Reid , in a sternly worded statement after the 45 - minute meeting , said no official decisions have been made .
But an aide to the Nevada Democrat said Reid was leaning toward removing Lieberman as chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
Senator Lieberman is most likely going to lose his chairmanship and why ?
Because he acted in a bipartisan manner and supported the candidate of the Republican party .
While Barack Obama promised to work with Republicans and Nancy Pelosi claimed that Democrats would be more bipartisan if they grew their majority Joe Lieberman actually put words into action and broke party lines to support McCain .
He knew that this could cost him his committee but he did what he thought was right .
While Obama and Pelosi talk a good game , Lieberman actually did what the others claimed that they would do .
What does he get for being bipartisan ?
Punished .
While I understand that Sen. Lieberman has voted with Democrats a majority of the time , his comments and actions have raised serious concerns among many in our caucus , ” Reid said .
They say that actions speak louder than words and not only did Joe Lieberman ’s actions speak for him but they spoke for the Democrat leaders as well .
The reaction of Democrat leaders speak volumes about who they are .
When their majority was slim and they needed Lieberman they tolerated his bipartisanship on this one issue , but now that their majority has grown and they no longer need him they are willing to kick him to the curb .
So much for a larger Democrat majority being more bipartisan .
So much for Obama ’s promise to bring us together .
Campaign rhetoric has given way to political reality .
The more things “ change ” the more they stay the same .

These days , CSS development is a complex process .
You may be working on sites with large CSS files , multiple developers , and long development timelines .
The more complex your CSS files become , the more difficult it is to work with them .
This article will present some tips and tricks for keeping your CSS files organized and easy to work with .
Always remember that :
Note : the tips listed below are listed roughly in order of difficulty .
Basic techniques are described first .
Avoid using inline CSS or in - page CSS CSS can be applied to elements in three different ways : inline ( < p style = " margin - left : 20 px ; " )
) on page ( < style > block inside the page < head > )
block inside the page ) imported using @import or Using imported CSS is the best way of keeping your CSS separate and easily maintainable .
Only use inline CSS if you have no other choice , or it is a truly one - off situation that wo n’t be used elsewhere .
On page CSS should only be used for properties that only apply to the current page .
Even then , if there is a lot of CSS it ’s best to create a new .css file and import it .
Use classes and id ’s where appropriate Remember the difference between a class and an id .
An id is to be used only once on a page .
If something occurs once and only once on a page , use an id .
If it occurs multiple times , use a class .
Also consider future changes to the site — ask yourself : is there any chance that I would want to repeat this style on the page ?
If the answer is yes or maybe , use a class .
Use a consistent style
You may choose to write your CSS inline , like this : p {font - size : 10 px ; margin - bottom : 1em ;}
Or in block format , like this : p { font - size : 10 px ; margin - bottom : 1em ; } There are several variations of the block format , depending on where you put the opening { and whether the properties are indented or not .
This is largely a matter of personal preference ; some developers find that the inline method makes it easier to find selectors , while others find that the block method makes it easier to find properties .
Choose a format and stick to it throughout your CSS file .
If you encounter a CSS file that uses a different format from the one you prefer to use , you can use a CSS formatting tool to reformat it to suit your needs .
Do n’t specify the same selector more than once Poor organization or laziness may result in some selectors being specified more than once .
For example , you may specify some properties for lists at the top of your stylesheet , then decide later on to add some additional properties .
These new properties may get added in a new block at the bottom of the CSS file , rather than with the original selector earlier on .
Before adding a selector — particularly a generic element selector — make sure to check through you CSS first to make sure it has n’t already been used .
Use lower case selectors only Selectors are case sensitive , meaning that # Content is not the same as #content .
In order to avoid mistakes , it ’s best to always specify selectors in lower case .
It ’s also helpful to be consistent about other characters used in your selectors , e.g. use only underscores or dashes , not both .
Use standard conventions for common ids Web designers have come to an informal consensus about how to name certain elements .
The header is called #header , the footer is called # footer , and the main menu is #nav or #navbar .
There is some variation about container elements ( # container , # wrapper etc. ) .
It ’s best to follow what others are doing , rather than inventing your own names .
Sticking to conventions means other developers will be able to understand your code .
Use meaningful selector names
Whenever possible you should choose semantic ( or meaningful ) , names for your selectors .
Other developers should be able to tell by reading your CSS what the selectors are for .
In addition , class names should be able to account for changes in design .
For example , if you decide to change that red text to orange , you should n’t have to change the name of the class as well .
Instead , think about why that text is red .
Is it because it ’s important ?
Good , then call it .important .
The only time when you would use presentational names is when there really is no logical reason why this element is styled the way it is .
For example , if you have a class that aligns a photo to the left , there is no more meaningful way to label it than .
photo - left ( or .imgleft , or . figure - left , or whatever you prefer ) .
This is also a matter of balancing meaningfulness with clarity .
There may be a tendency to get too strict about semantics , to the point where people do n’t understand your code anymore .
For example , the id " footer " really describes the location on the page .
To be more semantic , you could call this " site - meta " or something like that .
However , in reality " footer " is a much clearer label .
Use shorthand wherever possible Instead of : ul { margin - left : 20 px ; margin - top : 10 px ; margin - bottom : 10 px ; } use : ul { margin : 10 px 0 10 px 20 px ; } For margins and padding , the order is always top , right , bottom , left .
You can further this shorthand by dropping the bottom and left values if they are the same as top and right .
For example : p { margin : 6 px 0 ; } is the same as : p { margin : 6 px 0 6px 0 ; } Webcredible has a good CSS shorthand reference .
Order properties within a selector
If a selector has a lot of properties it helps to keep them ordered in some way .
Some designers prefer to sort them alphabetically , like this : ul # navbar { background - color : # 600 ; color : # fff ; font - size : 12 px ; height : 24 px ; margin : 90 px auto 0 ; padding : 0 ; text - align : right ; width : 768 px ; } Personally , I like to sort things by purpose ( see how height and width are n’t placed together in the above example ? ) .
Colours and backgrounds go together ( color , background color , background image ) , box model properties go together ( height , width , margin , padding , position etc. ) , text properties go together ( font , text - align , line - height etc . ) .
It might look like this : ul # navbar { width : 768 px ; height : 24 px ; padding : 0 ; margin : 90 px auto 0 ; text - align : right ; font - size : 12 px ; background - color : # 600 ; color : # fff ; }
Use a CSS reset A CSS reset declaration overrides all of the browser ’s default settings .
All browsers come with default stylesheets that control how basic elements look .
Paragraphs have margins .
Unordered lists have round bullets and a left margin .
Usually , designers will want to override most of these values .
Instead of individually overriding every setting you want to change , it ’s often best to just wipe the slate clean and start over .
Eric Meyer has developed a good CSS reset that you can copy and paste into your CSS file .
Divide your CSS file into sections for particular tasks Useful common classes
There are several common classes that I usually like to include in my stylesheets .
They include : .important . fineprint . photo ( or . thumb ) . photo - left . photo - right .caption .update and / or .correction ( for a blog ) Arranging selectors into groups for different purposes helps to keep things together .
For example , it would n’t make sense if the ul selector was on line 25 while the li selector was on line 164 .
Keeping them together will ensure that you see related selectors and ensure that you do n’t accidentally call a selector more than once .
This is how I like to do mine : CSS Reset Basic elements ( body , paragraphs , lists etc. )
Commonly used classes ( these are things that I might need to reference frequently , such as classes that align images to the left or right )
Specific selectors for certain parts of pages ( e.g .
A special section of one page that creates a block around some text and an image )
Template layout : containers header navigation content footer Inside these groups , similar items are grouped together as well .
For example , all list related selectors would be put together in section # 2 .
Higher level selectors go first , so ul would precede li .
The reason I organize it in this way is mainly to support the CSS cascade but also for accessibility .
The CSS reset and basic elements need to go first so they can be overridden later by more specific selectors .
After that , I need to find those common classes and elements more frequently , while the template layout rarely changes .
Add a header for each section Many developers have a favourite way of marking sections in their CSS , such as : /* ------------ common classes
------------ */ /*======= common classes ====== */ /*
-----------------------------------------
common classes */
This makes it easy to find elements you need to work on .
The style you choose for these headings is up to you , just be consistent about which format you use .
Include a colour reference
How many times have you gone hunting for the correct hex value for the colours used in your design ?
Specifying the colours at the top make them easy to access .
All you need to do is scroll to the top and copy and paste .
It might look like this : /* Main medium green : # d7ecaa Lighter green : # f1 fcdb
Very light green : #e8f7c4 Medium brown : # a66c38 Lighter brown : # 632f00 */
Otherwise , use comments only when necessary
If you write your CSS well there should be little need to explain what you ’re doing .
Any designer who understands CSS will understand how and why you ’ve used certain properties .
Extra comments clutter the stylesheet and increase the file size .
The only exception to this would be cases where something you ’ve done really does n’t make sense .
For example , you had to include an extra property to correct a display problem in a particular browser .
Consider dividing your CSS into separate files
If you have very large CSS files , it might be worthwhile to separate it into two or more different files .
This way you can use different files for particular tasks .
I often separate the template layout into a different file since it does n’t change very much after the initial site launch .
The CSS reset could also go into a separate file .
In addition , you could create separate files for large sections of CSS used only on certain pages , such as forms .
This way all pages wo n’t be loading code that is only used on a few pages .
Your list of CSS files might look like this : reset.css content.css layout.css forms.css
Ensure @import declarations are written in the correct order , so that they cascade correctly .
Avoid using browser specific hacks
There are many ways to target particular browsers with CSS ( see Web Devout for some examples ) .
These usually involve exploiting bugs in a browser ’s rendering engine which cause it to ignore certain selectors or groups of characters .
The first problem is these hacks are not usually documented very well .
Months or years later you may not remember why that voice - family property was there .
Secondly , future versions of the browser being targeted may correct the very problem you are exploiting .
This is fine if they have also corrected the bug , but what if they have n’t ?
If you learn to write CSS well there should n’t be much of a need for hacks .
I find that there ’s usually a good method of solving the problem for standards - compliant browsers .
However , Internet Explorer is often an exception .
Target IE using conditional comments Internet Explorer ’s conditional comments make it easy to add code that can only been seen by IE .
Not only that , but you can target specific versions or ranges of versions , anything less than IE 6 for example .
There are two ways to serve different CSS to IE using conditional comments .
The first is to simply insert a different CSS file for IE :
For all versions of IE : <!--[ if IE ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " ie.css " type =" text /css " /> <![ endif ] -->
For versions less than and including than IE 6 : <!--[ if lte IE 6 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " ie6bugs.css " type =" text /css " /> <![ endif ] -->
For versions less than ( and not including ) IE 6 : <!--[ if lt IE 6 ] > < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " ie5bugs.css " type =" text /css " /> <![ endif ] -->
However , some designers believe that this is a problem because it separates the IE - only CSS from the rest .
When making a change to the regular stylesheet you may not realize that the same element is also adjusted in the IE - only stylesheet .
Instead , you could add a containing DIV around your page with an IE - only id .
After the body tag put : <!--[ if IE ] > < div id =” ieroot ” > <![ endif ] -->
And do n’t forget to close it at the bottom : <!--[ if IE ] > </div > <![ endif ] -->
Using this technique , you simply use your #IERoot selector in your regular CSS file to add extra rules for IE only .
This way you can keep the special IE - only CSS together with the main CSS for that selector .
Remember : any code targeted to IE only should only be used when the fix breaks the layout in other browsers .
Otherwise , there ’s nothing wrong with including a few extra properties if they have no effect on other browsers .
Some more advanced conditional comment techniques are described in Supporting IE with conditional comments at Dev. Opera .
Use minimal specificity
In CSS , more specific selectors will override more general selectors .
Let ’s say we want to add some padding to list items .
We could do it like this : div#wrapper ul li { padding : 4px 0 ; } If # wrapper is a containing div for the whole page , all lists will have 4px top and bottom padding .
Now , what if I wanted lists inside the #content div to have less padding .
I would have to do something like this : div#content ul li { padding : 2px 0 ; } You can see how this leads to more and more complex selectors over time .
The more selectors you add , the more you need to include to override those properties later on .
In order to avoid this problem it ’s best to minimize the specificity of your selectors ( use as few selectors as possible ) .
Instead of the above I could have simply done this : li { padding : 4px 0 ; } #content li { padding : 2px 0 ; } For more information on how specificity is calculated , try Specifics on CSS Specificity from CSS tricks .
Make full use of CSS selectors
You do n’t have to put a class or id on every element you want to style differently .
Instead , learn about all the different CSS selectors available to you .
You could , for example , create a navigation menu like this : < div id =" navbar " > < ul > < li class = " navitem " >< a href= " somewhere.html " class = " navlink " > link 1</a></li> < li class = " navitem " >< a href= " somewhere2.html " class = " navlink " > link 2</a></li> < li class = " navitem " >< a href= " somewhere3.html " class = " navlink " > link 3</a></li> </ul > </div >
Your CSS could look like this : #navbar ul { margin : 0 ; display : inline ; } #navbar .navitem { float : left ; } #navbar .navitem a.navlink { color : # fff ; background - color : # 600 ; text - decoration : none ; padding : 2px 10 px ; } #navbar .navitem a.navlink : hover { background - color : # 666 ; } The main problem with this is that you end up with a lot of extra classes in your html that really do n’t need to be there .
Instead , you could simply use descendent selectors to apply some CSS to the list items inside the navbar div .
While we ’re at it , we do n’t really need that div either .
Instead , we can apply the id to the ul instead : < ul id =" navbar " > < li >< a href= " somewhere.html " > link 1</a></li> < li >< a href=" somewhere2.html " > link 2</a></li> < li >< a href=" somewhere3.html " > link 3</a></li> </ul >
Your CSS could look like this : #navbar ul { margin : 0 ; display : inline ; } #navbar li { float : left ; } #navbar a { color : # fff ; background - color : # 600 ; text - decoration : none ; padding : 2px 10 px ; } #navbar a : hover { background - color : # 666 ; } This results in much cleaner and simpler HTML and CSS .
Roger Johansson has an excellent series of articles on CSS selectors : Part 1 – universal , type , id , and class selectors Part 2 – combinators , combined selectors , grouping , and attribute selectors Part 3 – pseudo - classes and pseudo - elements Remember that not all selectors are supported in all browsers .
Check this handy reference chart to make sure the selectors you want to use are supported in most browsers .
Less supported selectors can also be used in combination with the progressive enhancement techniques described below .
Consider progressive enhancement
With progressive enhancement you can take advantage of newer standards while still presenting an attractive and usable interface to older browsers .
Newer CSS properties and selectors are used for optional design elements , such as creating rounded corners .
Instead of creating multple nested divs with background images to create rounded corners , you could simply use the - moz - border - radius and - webkit - border - radius properties to create rounded corners in Firefox ( using the mozilla / gecko rendering engine ) and Safari ( using the webkit rendering engine ) : #mydiv { - moz - border - radius : 10 px ; - webkit - border - radius : 10 px ; } With techniques like this you can create additional effects and take advantage of new CSS without writing a lot of extra code or degrading the experience in older browsers .
That ’s why it ’s called progressive enhancement !
John McCain on Jay Leno - First Appearance Since Defeat ( Video )
made his first post election television appearance last night onseven days after his loss to .
He told the night show host that since the election he 's been sleeping like a baby - sleep two hours , wake up and cry .
McCain 's appearance landed on Veterans Day .
Jay seized the opportunity to say that he could n't think of a better person to have on the show on this day when we honor our servicemen and women .
He called McCain a true war hero .

Poking Around Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server December 29 , 2008
On December 19 I suggested that poking around source code can be a valuable learning experience , even if you know little about the language .
And , as I ’ve admitted , I ’m still learning this fine language , so I welcome any and all to fill in the gaps or correct the gaffes in the following exploration .
Just drop us a comment .
Here we ’ll poke around the source of Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Webserver :
http://www.sics.se/~joe/tutorials/web_server/web_server.html
Fortunately , in this case , we have Joe to provide guidance along the way .
If you ’re well up on Erlang , you may find the remainder of this post rather ho hum .
Stick around anyway to keep us honest .
f you ’re just tuning into Erlang , on the other hand , by all means call up Joe ’s source on your browser and poke along with me .
Joe factors the server - side process of serving up content and services into three layers :
Web Server < –> HTTP Driver < –> TCP Driver
We ’ll look at the Web Server layer in this post ; explication of the other two layers to follow .
The Web Server component of Joe ’s Simple Web Server is implemented in :
http://www.sics.se/~joe/tutorials/web_server/web_server.erl
First , we note the - export directive .
This tells us that the module web_server.erl makes four functions available to other modules : cover_start / 0 , cover_stop / 0 , start / 1 , stop /1 .
- export ( [ cover_start/0 , cover_stop/0 , start / 1 , stop /1 ] ) .
Why two versions of start and stop ?
Insight
If we scan down to the function cover_start ( ) , we note that first thing it calls is cover : start / 0 , e.g. the start / 0 function in the Erlang module cover .
Googling the search term “ Erlang + cover ” turns up the man page for cover with the summary “ A Coverage Analysis Tool for Erlang . ”
See it here : http://erlang.org/doc/man/cover.html
Evidently the functions cover_start /0 and cover_stop /0 are included in web_server.erl as testing or diagnostic functions .
In fact , Joe says just this in Section 3 at the bottom of :
http://www.sics.se/~joe/tutorials/web_server/web_server.html
So , right off we ’ve learned a valuable technique for developing more reliable Erlang code .
Let ’s tuck cover away for later experimentation and integration into our Erlang bag of tricks .
Imports
Note further that web_server.erl imports three functions from two modules :
- import ( http_driver , [ classify / 1 , header / 1 ] ) .
- import ( lists , [ map / 2 ] ) .
http_driver.erl is the second layer of Joe Armstrong ’s Simple Web Server , so we ’ll explore it later .
Here ’s where to find the man page for the lists module :
http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/ref_man_frame.html
Scan down the man page for documentation of map / 2 .
Looks pretty useful .
Let ’s tuck this too into our Erlang bag of tricks .
start /
1
Here ’s the code for start /1 :
start ( [ A ] ) ->
start_on_port(list_to_integer(atom_to_list ( A ) ) ) .
We see that start / 1 calls the internal function start_on_port / 1 .
The value of A is evidently a port address represented as an atom since it is transformed to a list of one element by the built - in function atom_to_list / 1 .
The list , in turn , is transformed to an integer by the built - in function start_on_port / 1 .
The resulting integer is then passed to start_on_port / 1 .
Newbie question :
Why must we pass an atom , rather than an integer , as parameter into serve / 1 when we can pass an integer directly into start_on_port /1 ?
If anyone knows the answer , please post .
start_on_port/1
Scanning down the web_server.erl source file , we see that start_on_port / 1 spawns server / 1 as a new process .
start_on_port( Port ) -> spawn_link ( fun ( ) -> server ( Port ) end ) .
server /
1
server ( Port ) -> S = self ( ) , process_flag ( trap_exit , true ) , http_driver : start ( Port , fun( Client ) -> server ( Client , S ) end , 15 ) , loop ( ) .
server / 1 assigns its own PID to the variable S , sets a process flag , calls start / 2 in the module http_driver and calls loop / 1 .
You see the clause “ process_flag ( trap_exit , true ) ” quite often in Erlang code .
Thanks to Matt McDonnell ( http://www.matt-mcdonnell.com/code/code_erl/erl_course/erl_course.html), we learn that the process_flag clause “ sets the current process to convert exit signals to exit messages that can be received as normal messages . ”
You can read more about the significance of this with respect to reliability in Matt ’s nifty Erlang course .
Check it out .
For more on error handling in general , see Chapter 9 in Joe Armstrong ’s book , Programming Erlang .
Moving on to the clause “ http_driver : start ( Port , fun( Client ) -> server ( Client , S ) end , 15 ) . ”
As you ’ll recall , the module http_driver.erl is the second component in Joe Armstong ’s Simple Web Server .
We ’ll defer poking into it until we have a better grasp on web_server.erl .
As we pointed out in an earlier post http_driver.erl translates bits coming through the network socket into Erlang messages .
And more it translates Erlang messages coming from web_server.erl into a bit stream suitable for transmission through the network socket .
It ’s essential to note , that the call to http_driver : start / 2 in server / 1 takes web_server : server / 2 as a client function .
As we ’ll note in a moment , server / 2 is the functional heart of web_server.erl .
There are subtleties here .
As we ’ll see when we look at http_driver.erl and tcp_driver , web_server : server / 2 gets passed down and started up somewhere , I think , in tcp_driver.erl .
I ’m guessing that a PID gets passed back as message to web_server : loop /0 .
( Someone , please , post clarification to get me out of deep water here . )
Scanning down to loop / 0 we see an endless loop ( note the tail recursion just before the end clause ) that prints out a message when it receives a message in Any .
loop ( ) -> receive Any -> io :format ( " server : ~p~n " , [ Any ] ) , loop ( ) end .
Poking into web_server : server / 2 , we see the classic web server loop described by Joe in http://www.sics.se/~joe/tutorials/web_server/web_server.html.
If the client sends the tuple ‘ closed ’ as a message , or 5000 ticks of the clock pass by , the loop returns true , my guess is to close down the process .
server ( Client , Master ) -> receive { Client , closed} -> true ; { Client , Request} -> Response = generate_response( Request ) , Client ! { self ( ) , Response} , server ( Client , Master ) after 5000 -> true end .
If the client sends a request in the variable Request , server / 2 generate_response prepares a response and sends it back to the client .
Again , note the tail recursive call just above the line “ after 5000 ->. ”
Here ’s generate_response/1 :
generate_response({_ , Vsn , F , Args , Env} ) -> F1 = " . " ++ F , case file : read_file ( F1 ) of {ok , Bin} -> case classify ( F ) of html -> { header ( html ) , [ Bin]} ; jpg -> { header ( jpg ) , [ Bin]} ; gif -> { header ( jpg ) , [ Bin ]} ; _ -> { header ( text ) , [ body ( " white " ) , " < pre > " , Bin , " < / pre > " ] } end ; _ -> show ({no_such_file , F,args , Args , cwd , file:get_cwd( ) } ) end .
The request is in the form of a tuple with five elements .
( With all due respect , Joe , speaking from the newbie gallery , we could really use some comments here to understand what these elements are . )
Best I can tell F is a filename .
The case statement in generate_response / 1 checks to see if the file F1 exists .
If so , it runs another case statement to determine whether we ’re looking at html , jpg , or gif file .
Depending upon the result , it returns a tuple that passes a function call to http_driver : header / 1 and the contents of the file represented by F1 ( Bin ) .
web_server : server / 2 then passes this tuple to the client as a message .
if http_driver : classify / 1 tells us that our content file is anything other than html , jpg , or gif , it tells http_driver : header / 1 to render it as text .
So , bottom line , if Request sends a file name , web_server.erl looks up the file and returns type and content as a Response to http_driver .
If the file does n’t exist , web_server : generate_response / 1 calls show / 1 , which sends off an error message .
Note the file function file : get_cwd ( ) .
I ’ll leave it to you to parse out show / 1 .

10 In Court Like most men , Donald Thompson , had needs ; itches that had to be scratched without delay .
Unlike most men , Donald Thompson was also a judge .
And , unlike most judges ( hopefully ) , Donald liked to sit behind the bench and jam his unit into a penis pump and go to town while presiding over cases .

" Whatever .
I just masturbated into this Dixie cup . "
According to testimony in the trial that ended with him getting four years in prison for indecent exposure and getting disbarred , Thompson used the pump at least four times and exposed himself 15 times during jury trials , apparently when shit got either really boring or incredibly sexy .
You know how murder trials can get sexy .
" Read the charges again , but slower ... and then tell me I 'm bad . "
As an added bonus , Thompson had purchased a rather noisy pump that made an audible wooshing sound .
It was loud enough that jurors during trials asked the judge what it was and presumably Thompson responded by groaning loudly then napping for a half hour or so .

9 In Church Sometimes people get infused with the Holy Spirit and feel moved to praise the Lord when in church .
Other times , people hop in the confessional and defile one another in a host of unseemly and sticky ways .
It is not our place to question the Lord .
In Cesena , Italy , during morning mass , a couple in their early 30s was lodged in a confessional booth when other people at church became aware of an off - putting rustling and groaning coming from the booth .
In public restrooms , that 's often the sound of hobos passing gin-soaked shoe leather from their bowels while masturbating ; and in mall photo booths it 's the sound of teen girls making hilarious and unique faces with their BFFs .
In churches , however , the first , best guess is the pastor trying to sober up before a service .
On this day , however , it was just a " goth rock " couple diddling each other .
For Jesus .

They could have at least closed the curtain .
The police were called and the couple , who were piss - tank drunk , were " cautioned " for obscene acts and disturbing a religious function which we think is like robbing a bank and then being told by the cops you can only spend the money on canned meat .
The local parish priest called the incident " an outrage of notable proportions which bespeaks unutterable squalor " which is Christian for " fucktarded . "
At home , in Alabama , a couple was caught having sex on the altar in a Baptist Church , because sometimes humping in a confessional booth just is n't sacrilegious enough .
The altar was covered in red wax and the male half was found hiding under the church when police arrived , as his escape plan included digging to China .

Plant closures , layoffs mount in US and Europe
By Patrick O’Connor
18 October 2008
Industrial and manufacturing firms in the US and Europe are sharply curtailing production and laying off workers as world economic growth stalls .
Layoffs and plant closings , combined with a series of economic reports released in recent days , indicate that the US and European economies are in a significantly worse state than economists had previously believed .
US car makers , teetering on the edge of bankruptcy , are stepping up their attacks on auto workers ' jobs .
General Motors announced Thursday that it would lay off 1,600 workers at three plants , one in Delaware and two in Michigan ( Pontiac and Detroit ) .
GM also announced this week it was bringing forward previously planned plant closures in Janesville , Wisconsin , Grand Rapids , Michigan and Moraine , Ohio .
The former industrial giant has slashed its US workforce by nearly half since 2000 , with the company 's unionized workers down from 133,000 to just 72,000 .
More layoffs within the next few months are expected to be announced .
Chrysler and GM have held a series of merger discussions in a desperate attempt to find a way out of their financial crises .
Chrysler is also considering other merger or partnership options with Renault - Nissan .
Cerebus Capital Management , Chrysler 's owner , has already eliminated 22,000 jobs since the beginning of 2007 and plans to cut at least 4,000 more next year , leaving the auto company with just over 60,000 workers .
Any merger involving Chrysler or GM would inevitably mean the elimination of tens of thousands more jobs .
Gerald Myers , a former auto company chief executive and now management professor at the University of Michigan , spoke to the Washington Post about a potential Chrysler - GM merger .
" It would be a bloodbath , " he declared .
" Chrysler would be cut up into small pieces .
GM would spit out the things it does n't want and hang onto the things it does want . "
A Federal Reserve report released Thursday showed US industrial production down 2.8 percent in September , the biggest decline since December 1974 and substantially higher than the 0.8 percent decline expected by economists .
For the third quarter as whole , industrial production was down 6 percent on an annualized basis .
A separate report issued by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a record decline in manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region .
The report followed the release earlier this week of similar data for New York State .
A survey released yesterday by the University of Michigan showed that US consumer spending has fallen more sharply this month than in any other month since records were first maintained in 1978 .
The housing market , another key indicator , continues to decline .
The Commerce Department released data yesterday showing that the construction of new homes fell by 6.3 percent last month , far higher than the anticipated 1.6 percent decrease .
Home construction is now at its slowest pace since January 1991 .
The contraction is not confined to the US .
In Germany , Europe 's largest economy , the government this week revised its anticipated 2009 gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth figures from 1.2 percent to 0.2 percent .
On Wednesday , the day before the official estimates were released , a report jointly issued by four leading German economic institutes also predicted a 0.2 growth rate , but warned that in a " worst - case scenario " the economy could shrink by 0.8 percent .
The survey warned that up to 400,000 German jobs could go in 2009 .
A report issued this week by the European Automobile Association found registration for new passenger vehicles in Europe down 8.2 percent last month compared to last year .
Two large auto parts makers in Germany this week announced " significant " layoffs of temporary workers , and the German auto giant Daimler said it would close its Sterling Trucks division , shuttering plants in Ontario , Canada and Oregon .
Other European countries have also reassessed their expected growth rates .
Reuters reported Thursday : " Italy has cut its 2009 growth forecast to 0.5 percent from 0.9 percent previously and French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said earlier this week that his country could undershoot an official projection for growth of 1.0 percent next year . "
The International Monetary Fund expects the Spanish economy to experience a severe recession next year , with minus 2 percent GDP growth .
A Reuters quarterly poll of 24 economists released this week found that 23 believed Britain was already in a recession ; the median GDP growth forecast for 2009 was just 0.2 percent .
Nissan announced this week it was cutting 1,680 jobs at its plant in Barcelona , Spain .
The Guardian reported that Volkswagen - owned Spanish car manufacturer Seat is planning to temporarily lay off 4,700 workers at one of its plants in Barcelona .
This follows the company 's earlier announcement that it was reducing annual production by 5 percent and laying off at least 750 workers .
Also in Spain , tire manufacturer Bridgestone is reportedly planning to cut 2,800 jobs out of a total of 3,300 in two plants .
Paul Betts , commentator with the Financial Times , noted on Thursday : " Not a single day has gone by this week without some large European company announcing a significant scaling down of earlier investment plans , the shelving of an important acquisition or all sorts of other cost- cutting and restructuring measures . "
The price of oil dropped below $ 70 a barrel this week for this first time in more than a year , reflecting slowing rates of world production and consumption .
The extreme volatility , mostly downward , on global stock markets , despite the series of bank bailouts announced in the US and Europe , reflects a growing awareness that the financial crisis is merely an expression of deeper contradictions wracking the world economy .
" Investors are recognizing that the financial crisis is not the fundamental problem , " an article in Thursday 's New York Times noted .
" It has merely amplified economic ailments that are now intensifying : vanishing paychecks , falling home prices and diminished spending .
And there is no relief in sight . "
It is now widely acknowledged that none of the financial bailout measures will prevent the spread of recession .
The trillions of dollars in public money being funneled into the world 's banking and financial institutions are aimed at insulating the financial elite from the consequences of the crisis for which they themselves are responsible .
No government has proposed an emergency rescue package aimed at the social catastrophe engulfing the working class .
There will be no bailout for the millions of ordinary people threatened with the loss of their jobs , savings or homes .
As the US presidential campaign enters its final two weeks amid the intensifying economic crisis , the gulf between the two major parties and the interests of the vast majority of the population has become ever starker .
Republican candidate John McCain has attempted to simultaneously engage in demagogic denunciations of the " greed and excess on Wall Street " while promising further corporate deregulation and a 10 percent cut in the corporate tax rate .
He has pledged to balance the federal budget in five years , but has not explained how this is to be done given that the Bush administration 's $ 2.25 trillion bailout package is now anticipated to raise the budget deficit as high as $ 2 trillion .
McCain has , however , said he would impose a one - year freeze on all non-military spending and " reform " Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
Democratic candidate Barack Obama 's economic agenda likewise calls for cuts in various business taxes .
His main concession to popular discontent is a promise to discontinue the Bush administration 's tax cuts for people who earn more than $ 250,000 a year .
At the same time he pledges to " scour the federal budget line - by - line " to eliminate social programs and reduce spending on other programs .
Congressional Democratic leaders are proposing a new $ 150 billion economic stimulus package , a mere drop in the bucket in relation to the social needs arising from the gathering slump .
They have enthusiastically backed the allocation of 15 times this sum to bail out Wall Street .
Neither the politicians nor the media offer a serious explanation of the roots of the economic crisis .
They cannot , because the crisis is an expression of the failure of the capitalist system which they defend .
Successive Democratic and Republican administrations over the last three decades have presided over the systematic dismantling of key sections of basic industry .
At the same time , financial speculation flourished as the key mechanism through which a narrow elite generated profits that were divorced from the productive process and the creation of real value .
The growth of financial parasitism , which took on an increasingly criminal character , saw enormous wealth transferred from the working class to the top 1 percent of the population .
An unprecedented degree of social inequality developed as the " real economy " was hollowed out .
No " stimulus package " or other palliative is capable of resolving this crisis .
The only answer is to be found in a socialist program .
The major banks and financial firms - together with the leading manufacturing , hi-tech , communications , transportation and health and pharmaceutical corporations - must be nationalized and converted into publicly - owned enterprises , with full compensation for small shareholders , and placed under the democratic control of the working class .
The fortunes accumulated by CEOs and financial speculators responsible for the crisis must be confiscated and placed in a public fund to compensate victims of predatory lending practices and home foreclosures .
A $ 3 trillion public works program must be launched to rebuild the country 's crumbling infrastructure , provide decent housing and schools , and provide well - paid , full - time jobs for the growing number of unemployed .
Such a program should be paid for through a progressive taxation system which shifts the burden from the working class to the ultra- wealthy , and through the dismantling of the US war machine .
This perspective can be realized only through the independent political mobilization of the American working class , in joint struggle with working people throughout the world , aimed at the establishment of a society based on social need , not profit and private wealth accumulation .
In the US , the first step is for the working class to make a conscious break with the Democratic Party and establish its own party to fight for a workers ' government .
This is the program advanced by the Socialist Equality Party .
We encourage all workers and youth to support the campaign of the SEP 's presidential and vice presidential candidates , Jerry White and Bill Van Auken , study our program and history , and make the decision to join the SEP and help build it as the new mass party of the working class .

" Hmmm , very interesting . . . "
Some years ago I had a colleague who was a trove of American political trivia .
He once asked me where I was from , and when I named my hometown in New Jersey , he proceeded to rattle off my home county ’s population , ethnic makeup , economic base , recent election history , and the names and party affiliations of the region ’s current power brokers .
He knew way more than I knew about my own stamping ground .
That was the point .
He was showing off .
But even so it was dizzying how much detail he had stored in his head , about pretty much any county in the country .
How did he do it ?
I mean , you could n’t pay someone to memorize that volume of trivia .
Well , the short answer is that what I ’m calling trivia was anything but trivial to him .
To the contrary , every red , blue and purple detail of the American political landscape was important , dynamic , and endlessly interesting to him .
But what does that mean exactly , that it was interesting to him ?
Is interest a universal emotion like fear or pride or bemusement ?
How does one person come to be fascinated by politics while others are equally entranced by baseball statistics or the early poems of Lord Byron ?
And if it ’s possible to find such esoterica absorbing , why not trigonometry and irregular verbs ?
Can interest be nurtured and channeled in the classroom ?
Scientists have shown surprisingly little interest in interest , given its obvious and fundamental connection to learning and education .
That ’s starting to change .
In the past few years a handful of psychologists have started exploring interest in the laboratory , and they are starting to piece together a theory about this curious emotion .
One of the most striking features of interest is that it ’s all over the map :
One person ’s passion for butterflies is another ’s huge yawn , according to psychologist Paul Silvia , who has been exploring interest in his lab at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro .
Interest also comes and goes ; a book you found mesmerizing just a few years ago might leave you bored to tears if you tried to reread it today .
Silvia has been trying to dissect this unpredictable mental state .
Much of his work involves exposing people to things in the real world that may or may not be interesting : contemporary poetry , abstract and classical artwork , and so forth .
In one experiment , for example , he had people read an abstract poem , but some were given a small hint about the poem ’s meaning while the others were left on their own .
When asked later to rate the poem , those who had been given the hint found the work much more interesting .
In a similar experiment , students who had studied a little about art history found a modern art gallery much more engaging than did students with no exposure to art .
Silvia thinks he knows what ’s going on in these simple experiments .
All of the people in these studies are appraising their experience , trying to make sense of it ; that ’s basic human nature , we make such appraisals all the time .
But as he describes in the February issue of Current Directions in Psychological Science , they are sizing up the same experience very differently depending on the knowledge they bring to the event .
All of them probably find the poem or artwork to be fresh , complex , mysterious — so they are at least curious enough to look more .
That ’s the first requirement for interest .
But only some find the experience also to be comprehensible .
That is , they have just enough knowledge that they believe they can “ cope ” intellectually with this complex and unexpected event ; it ’s not totally beyond their ken .
The combination of complexity and comprehensibility adds up to genuine interest , and genuine interest cannot exist without both .
At its best , genuine interest becomes fascination becomes absorption becomes enrapture .
Psychologists call such intensity " being in the flow , ” a state of mind so focused that not even time can intrude on the experience .
This sounds awfully like bliss to me , but Silvia is careful to distinguish even intense interest from happiness .
Interest motivates people to explore , to seek out novelty , where happiness serves to firm up existing attachments — whether to a favorite restaurant or a favorite person .
Interest and happiness also have different sources , as Silvia showed in another experiment .
He had people look at a variety of paintings , including serene landscapes by Claude Monet and the rather disturbing images of Francis Bacon .
The subjects rated both their interest in the paintings and their enjoyment , and then Silvia surveyed the range of their emotional reactions to the different works .
The paintings that made people happy were simple , positive and calm .
But they were consistently more intrigued by the works that they perceived as complicated , strange and upsetting .
Interest , in short , requires emotional and mental challenge .
So how do we stay challenged once we have begun to master a topic ?
Why not just move on to something else and learn a little bit about a lot of things ?
Well , it appears that interest in self - propelling .
Think of it this way :
My former colleague has the entire American political landscape burned into his neurons , so he can now perceive subtleties and nuances and contrasts that are completely lost on the rest of us .
So intellectual challenge motivates people to become experts , and expertise in turn allows them to stay interested in every new bit of knowledge , even if it ’s just a meaningless election in some political backwater somewhere .

ROME , December 23 , 2008 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) - The European Court of Human Rights is refusing to hear the case brought by Italian pro-life advocates asking that Eluana Englaro be protected from euthanasia by dehydration .
On Thursday , the Strasbourg Court announced that an attempt to appeal last month ’s decision by the Italy ’s highest appeals court lodged by a coalition of pro-life organisations was inadmissible because the groups had no direct legal link with Eluana .
Eluana Englaro is the young woman , frequently referred to as Italy ’s Terri Schiavo , who has been in a state of diminished consciousness since a car accident in 1992 .
Her father has been petitioning the courts for a decade , asking that her food and hydration tube be removed and that she be dehydrated to death .
In November , the Court of Cassation in Rome , highest appeals court of Italy , upheld a lower court ruling granting her father ’s petition .
The Court of Human Rights ruled that the decision to allow the removal of Eluana ’s food and water , regards " only the people directly involved " .
Monsignor Ignacio Barreiro , the head of the Rome office of Human Life International told LifeSiteNews.com that the Human Rights Court , by restricting its decision mainly to procedural issues , is " masking " the court ’s bias in favour of legalised euthanasia .
" Really it ’s not a surprise because we knew the substantial position of the court , that they would not recognise the right to life of Eluana Englaro , " he said .
" We know due to previous cases that they have a liberal position on euthanasia , " he said .
" They do not hold in high esteem the life of the handicapped .
They take a utilitarian position , that people like Eluana Englaro are ‘ useless mouths ’ .
Their life has no social value . "
Barreiro had previously warned that , given the clear biases of the Court , an attempt to bring an appeal there in favour of Eluana would fail .
" The fact that the European Court of Human Rights used procedural grounds to reject the case at the beginning does not mean that we had any hopes , " he said .
" The solution now is an action by the Italian government that they adopt a decree law saving her life . "
In the Italian legal system , so - called decree laws can be passed as an emergency measure and go into effect immediately and are subject to review by parliament .
With the announcement last week , that Eluana ’s father , Beppino Englaro , had found a clinic willing to participate in her killing , controversy in Italy has continued .
At that time , the health and welfare minister of the Italian government issued guidance saying that under Italian law , withdrawal of food and hydration from helpless disabled persons in the care of public health facilities is " illegal " .
Some legal experts have argued that this guideline does not apply to Eluana after the Cassation Court ruling .
The Cassation Court ’s deputy prosecutor general , Marcello Matera , said the health minister ’s guideline was not relevant in the case of Eluana Englaro
" There is no doubt : the minister ’s guideline cannot interfere with the sentence being carried out , " Matera said .
He added that in the event that no clinic is prepared to carry out the sentence , it would be " theoretically possible " to ask for police intervention .
" That kind of step would be decided by the Englaro family lawyers , " he told ANSA news service .
On Wednesday Milan Appeals Court judge Filippo Lamanna also said that the Cassation Court ruling was " definitive " and could not be legally challenged .
Both Beppino Englaro and the clinic director have said they will not proceed until the case is legally settled .

Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa halted payment on foreign bonds he calls “ illegal ” and “ illegitimate , ” putting the South American country in default for a second time in a decade .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The government wo n’t make a $ 30.6 million interest payment by Dec. 15 , when a monthlong grace period expires , Correa told reporters in his office in Guayaquil .
The $ 510 million bonds due in 2012 plunged to 23 cents on the dollar from 31 yesterday and 97.5 cents three months ago .
“ I have given the order that interest payments not be made , ” Correa said .
“ The country is in default . ”
By defaulting , Correa , a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , fulfills a threat he has made since a 2006 presidential campaign that ended in a landslide victory .
His decision comes as a deepening global economic slump throttles demand for oil , the country ’s biggest export .
Ecuador , which defaulted in 1999 , owes about $ 10 billion to bondholders , multilateral lenders and other countries .
“ I could n’t allow the continued payment of a debt that by all measures is immoral and illegitimate , ” Correa said .
“ It is now time to bring in justice and dignity . ”

I 've spent a long time in the closet , but it 's time to come out .
I 've tried to deny it .
I 've tried to suppress it .
Even now as I type this column my hands are trembling as I reveal a dirty secret .
I 've decided to identify myself as " rich . "
That 's right .
I 'm rich .
Well , not personally .
Right now I 'm a graduate student who makes well below the median household income of $ 44,000 .
I pay my own rent and such , but I still get occasional support from my parents — my mom , a New York City principal , and my dad , an administrator — who make about four times that .
They would never call themselves rich , but maybe they should .
I say this because presidential campaigns are full of bromides about the " middle class . "
John McCain has come under a lot of fire for his apparent reluctance to say the phrase in debates , probably because he thinks " rich " is someone who makes $ 5 million ( How much is he worth again ?
Including his wife ’s huge fortune , probably upwards of $ 50 million .
Obama is probably worth about $ 2 million , mostly from book sales ) .
The problem is everyone in America thinks they are middle class .
According to Pew Research , 53 percent of Americans identify as middle class , and 41 percent of those who make under $ 20,000 do .
Here 's the rub : many respondents who make over $ 100,000 will say they are middle class , or " upper middle class , " which is really " I 'm pretty rich , but I can't just buy Mercedes on a whim , and paying taxes is n't the easiest thing in the world .
Plus , ' rich ' does n't sound nice . "
They may euphemize and say " comfortable " or , at most , " well - to - do . "
Then , according to Pew , there are four " middle classes : " top , satisfied , anxious , and struggling .
Well , maybe I 'm weird , but I thought that if you 're " struggling " you 're probably not in the middle of anything but rather scraping on the bottom .
Who are " the rich " in America ?
Well , actually , they probably look at lot like John McCain , although perhaps he 's too likable .
They are mainly nameless CEOs , executives , lawyers , lobbyists who make gazillions of dollars and scheme to screw over the rest of the country for their own gain .
How do I know this is the caricature ?
You see , 64 percent of people who make over $ 150,000 think the " rich " have too much power in this country , and 77 percent of those who make under $ 30,000 do too , according a great study done by The New York Times three years ago .
Translation : everyone hates the rich !
Because nobody is rich .
The problem is some people really are rich .
It is much easier to live when you make over $ 100,000 , or even less than that , depending on your location .
Sure , my parents complain about money all time .
They pay ridiculous New York / New Jersey taxes .
They pay the alternative minimum tax .
But at the same time , even as the Dow plummets , I do n't have to worry about putting food on the table , or paying my bills , or even buying new clothes .
Neither do they .
They can pay for my brother 's tuition in cash .
They travel .
They are renovating the kitchen .
These are big luxuries , and as the economy gets worse , it 's important for Americans understand that many of them have been cheated .
Economists have for years complained about wage stagnation .
Even as Americans have become productive , their wages have barely kept up with inflation over the last 30 years or so .
The recent rise of the minimum wage was paltry , a mere correction ( why does n't it go up every year with inflation ? ) .
The real " rich , " on the other hand , have seen tremendous gains .
They 've benefitted from globalization , deindustrialization , and the rising importance of higher education .
They 've done well .
Meanwhile , our tax policy has not kept up .
A guy like Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary because his income is investment income .
( Buffett is awesome not only because he 's giving away his fortune to charity and singlehandedly saving GE , but also because he refuses to give his kids a huge inheritance , calling it " welfare . "
I love him .
He 's right .
They did n't work for it ) .
In an amazing documentary , Born Rich , the heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune talks to his rich and secretive friends — a
Trump , a Bloomberg , you get the idea .
It 's fascinating to see how ashamed they are about being extremely , obscenely wealthy .
The few Europeans he interviewed , on the other hand , were blatant : " there are rich people and poor people .
I 'm rich .
Deal with it . "
The Americans acted as if being rich was a big secret .
No wonder .
In America , everyone is supposed to be the same .
There is no class in America .
I could rattle off numbers about how many people believe they 'll be rich some day , versus how many actually end up rising up the ranks , and how years of bad policy have made it difficult to achieve success .
That 's another column .
But let 's just say this : in this current economic meltdown maybe Americans will finally realize we 're not all the same .
Some people have it easier than others .
We need to stop deluding ourselves .
Maybe I 'm late with this rant .
In fact , many Americans have probably woken up and realized how royally screwed they 've been .
No wonder John McCain is behind .
“ The man of system seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chessboard ”
– Adam Smith , The Theory of Moral Sentiments
One reason it has taken me so long to write my October column is that I have been busy writing ( here and here ) and arguing on radio ( here and here ) against the Bush - Paulson - Bernanke $ 700 billion bailout of various Wall Street companies ’ bad investments .
My main moral argument against the bailout is that the government is forcibly taking our resources and giving them to the government ’s favorites .
On a Denver radio station , I suggested that Hank Paulson ’s motives should not be assumed to be pure , given the huge amount of personal wealth he had at stake .
The interviewer asked me incredulously , “ Are you suggesting something sinister ? ” “ Actually , yes , ” I said .
My main pragmatic argument against the bailout is that the government , by choosing where $ 700 billion goes , is essentially engaging in central planning .
Government officials think they can do a better job than decentralized free markets can do at allocating resources .
Then I realized that there ’s a close connection between the U.S. government ’s domestic policy and its foreign policy .
In both cases , the government is forcibly taking our resources and , to the extent it finances its activities with deficits , our children ’s resources , and using them to pursue its own ends .
In the cases of Afghanistan and Iraq , the U.S. government brought down foreign governments that it disliked and replaced them with leaders that it likes .
In the case of the bailout , the government is putting resources into places where we consumers and investors , with our “ dollar votes , ” have decided we do n’t want to put them .
In short , the Bush administration has completed the philosophical journey it began with its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Bush believed that he could get rid of governments in Afghanistan and Iraq and come up with a better government .
He was like Adam Smith ’s “ man of system ” referenced in the above quote .
Bush thought he could plan what Smith called “ the great chessboard of human society ” in Afghanistan and Iraq .
But what he did n’t take account of is , in Smith ’s words , that “ every single piece has a principle of motion of its own , altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it . ”
Bush , along with his various appointees , thought he could be a central planner of other societies .
Well , as Dr. Phil would ask , “ How ’s that working for you , Mr. Bush ? ”
Although Bush ’s major step toward centralized economic planning of the U.S. economy appears  and , in fact , is  large , philosophically it is the logical next step .
Someone who believes that he can look “ the man in the eye ” and “ be able to get a sense of his soul ”  as George Bush said after meeting Vladimir Putin the first time  is not someone who has a lot of humility about his own abilities .
It ’s not surprising , therefore , that George Bush , with incredibly little knowledge of the Middle East and , apparently , no awareness of the animus between the Sunnis and the Shias , could be confident that he could bring a stable democratic government to Iraq .
Similarly , if he has that degree of confidence without ever having traveled to Afghanistan or Iraq before making war on them , it ’s not surprising that Bush would have the same confidence in Henry Paulson ’s being able to plan Wall Street and Main Street from the Treasury Building .
After all , Paulson used to work on Wall Street , and Bush has actually been in New York a few times .
So how difficult could it be , really , to plan an economy ?
The late Ludwig von Mises and the late Friedrich Hayek told us how difficult it would be : try impossible .
In 1974 , Hayek shared the Nobel prize in economics .
Part of what earned it for him was his insight on this issue .
Although it was von Mises who , in 1922 , had the original insight about information , Hayek elaborated and added to the argument .
In a series of essays in the 1930s and 1940s , Hayek drove the final intellectual nail into the coffin of socialism .
He pointed out that even if central planners had pure motives  so that we would n’t have to worry about their incentives  they simply could not have the information they would need to plan an economy well .
In any complex economy , there are hundreds of thousands of items , and central planners , having thrown out the free market , cannot know relative supplies and demands for these products .
This , wrote Hayek , is precisely what the market tells us .
The free market , he argued , works so well because the information that really matters in any economy exists in a decentralized form in the minds of the millions of participants in the market .
In his famous 1945 article , “ The Use of Knowledge in Society , ” which I have my students work through in every course I teach , Hayek writes :
“ [ P ] ractically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made , but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation . ”
The term that modern economists in Hayek ’s tradition use for this “ unique information ” is “ local knowledge . ”
Hayek goes on to argue that this local knowledge can’t possibly be aggregated in the minds of a few central planners , no matter how brilliant .
And if the government does not leave people free to act on their own local knowledge , most of it wo n’t be acted on .
The analogy between centrally planning an economy and centrally deciding to intervene in another country ’s affairs is not perfect .
Analogies seldom are .
The main difference is that a government that forswears central planning and leaves individuals free to make their own decisions within a system of property rights will typically end up being the government of a prosperous country .
A government that forswears planning other countries ’ affairs , by contrast , will not , by doing so , cause people in that other country to make good choices about their own governments .
But the point of the analogy is that a government that refuses to interfere with choices about another country ’s government will avoid making a bad choice , whereas a government that tries to meddle will almost inevitably make a bad choice .
Unfortunately , both of the major candidates running for president are what Adam Smith would call “ men of system . ”
McCain and Obama have shown that they believe they can plan affairs in Afghanistan ( both ) , Pakistan ( both ) , and Iraq ( McCain ) .
Both , but especially Obama , think they can move us Americans around on the domestic chessboard also .
Both are wrong .
Each of us has his or her own “ principle of motion . ”
Unfortunately , whoever gets elected , we will pay for what Hayek would have called their “ fatal conceit . ”

How can you tell when the economy is in really bad shape ?
Maybe when FBI special agents go on record saying that terrorism is less of a threat to the United States than rampant financial fraud .
Bloomberg :
The FBI has engaged in “ triage , ” taking agents off terror and other crimes to respond to a cascade of financial frauds such as the alleged Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme , the head of the bureau ’s New York criminal division said .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation was forced to reallocate its manpower in New York to deal with recent frauds involving subprime mortgages , auction - rate securities and Madoff , who prosecutors said confessed this month to bilking investors out of $ 50 billion , FBI official David Cardona said in an interview .
Sodomizing SOB NYPD cops get indicted , a New York Health Department narc gets in trouble , so does a Michigan State Police narc and a Texas jail guard , and Rod Blagojevich is n't the only thing crooked in Chicago .
Let 's get to it :
In New York City , three NYPD officers surrendered Tuesday to face felony charges for allegedly sodomizing with a police radio antenna a man they suspected of marijuana possession .
Officer Richard Kern is charged with aggravated sexual abuse and assault , while Officers Alex Cruz and Andrew Morales have been charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct .
All three were also charged with misdemeanors related to falsifying records .
They were indicted last week by a Brooklyn grand jury investigating charges by tattoo shop employee Michael Mineo that when he fled into a subway station after the trio accused him of smoking pot , they tackled and handcuffed him , pulled down his pants , and sodomized him .
Mineo was ticketed for disorderly conduct and upon release , and was hospitalized for several days for what hospital discharge papers diagnosed as " anal assault . "
In New York City , a state Health Department supervising narcotics investigator was accused in a report by the state inspector general of being a " rogue " officer .
According to the inspector general 's report , Louis Crisafi , 49 , had a yen for fentanyl lollipops , once fired his weapon accidentally while taking a prisoner to jail and never reported it , had lied about his credentials and employment history , staged amateurish and dangerous sting operations , interrogated suspects despite their protests they wanted lawyers , and conducted private self - defense counseling on state time .
Crisafi came to the attention of investigators when the New York Times published a photo of his illegally parked yellow Corvette in a story about the abuse of government - issued parking permits .
The report concluded : " Ths employee is clearly unfit for a law enforcement position , having shamelessly broken the laws and rules he was hired and pledged to uphold . "
Crisafi is currently on sick leave , but faces disciplinary action and possible criminal charges for violating suspects ' rights .
In Monroe , Michigan , a Michigan State Patrol narcotics officer was placed on paid leave December 4 after police searched his home .
Lt. Luke Davis was a member of the multi-jurisdictional Monroe narcotics investigation office .
It is unclear what , if anything , they found , but the State Police said they were investigating " an allegation of potential misconduct . "
Davis was quick to trumpet his non-involvement with possessing , using , or trafficking illegal drugs , although he has yet to be accused of that .
The results of the search and attendant investigation will be sent to the state Attorney General 's office .
In Brownsville , Texas , a former Cameron County Sheriff 's Department jail guard was arrested December 3 for allegedly smuggling drugs into county jails .
Gabel Jacques Gonzales is charged with Class B misdemeanor possession of marijuana and felony third degree attempted introduction of a prohibited substance into a correctional facility .
Gonzales went down after conspiring with two people to obtain an unspecified amount of marijuana to smuggle into county jails .
Unfortunately for him , his partners turned out to be a confidential informant and a DEA agent .
In Chicago , a former Chicago police officer was convicted December 3 of conspiracy for stealing thousands of dollars from drug dealers .
Mahmoud Shamah and his partner , Richard Doroniuk , were also accused of stealing $ 30,000 from a police evidence locker in 2006 .
Doroniuk testified that he and Shamah routinely carried crack cocaine to plant on suspects , paid informants for bad information , and even bribed a judge to approve an arrest warrant .
Dec. 19 , 2008  --
No good deed goes unpunished , or so goes the saying .
Such was the case with Lisa Torti , who is being sued for pulling a now - paralyzed friend from the wreckage of a Los Angeles car accident in 2004 .
The victim 's lawyers claim the Good Samaritan bumbled the rescue and caused injury by yanking her friend " like a rag doll " to safety .
But Torti -- now a 30 - year - old interior designer from Las Vegas -- said she thought she had seen smoke and feared the car would explode .
She claims she was only trying to help her friend , Alexandra Van Horn , and her own life has been adversely affected by the incident .
" I know [ Van Horn ] has a lot of financial issues and her life has changed , " she said .
" But it 's not my fault .
I can't be angry at her , only the path she has chosen to take .
I can only pray it helps her . "
" I do n't have any more fight left , " Torti told ABCNews.com , choking back tears .
" It 's really emotional . "
The California Supreme Court ruled this week that Van Horn may sue Torti for allegedly causing her friend 's paralysis .
The case -- the first of its kind -- challenges the state 's liability shield law that protects people who give emergency assistance .
Only Medical Workers Immune
The court ruled 4 - 3 that only those administering medical care have legal immunity , but not those like Torti , who merely take rescue action .
The justices said that the perceived danger to Van Horn in the wrecked car was not " medical . "
The court majority said the 1980 Emergency Medical Service Act , which Torti 's lawyers cited for protection , was intended only to encourage people to learn first aid and use it in emergencies , not to give Good Samaritans blanket immunity when they act negligently .
Van Horn 's lawsuit will go on to trial court to determine if Torti is to blame for Van Horn 's paralysis .
But some legal experts say the ruling may discourage people from trying to save lives .
" What they are saying is that if you pull someone out of a pool , if you provide CPR , you do have a defense , " said Torti 's lawyer , Jody Steinberg .
" It seems to defy logic , " he said .
" At a certain point anyone who instructs or educates [ in emergencies ] will advise that you must hesitate .
Those split - second decisions will be gone and someone could die . "
Emergency Trainers Worry
The Boy Scouts of America , which offers emergency training to youth , filed a " friend of the court " brief in the case .
But Van Horn 's lawyers said their argument is " nonsense . "
At the time of the accident , Torti and Van Horn , both make - up artists , were acquaintances at work .
They had been drinking with a group of friends and left a bar in suburban Chatsworth after a Halloween party , according to court papers .
The car in which Van Horn and another passenger were riding spun out of control and hit a telephone pole .
Torti said she was a passenger in another car that was following them .
Before emergency crews arrived , she allegedly offered to help Van Horn from the wreckage .
" There could be so many things that could happen and I obviously wanted to get her out of the car , " said Torti .
" She said she could n't move .
I did the best thing I could to move her from the situation and get her out of danger to a place that was a little safer . "
Torti said she put one arm under the victim 's legs and one behind her back , carrying her out of the car .
But Van
Horn testified that her friend grabbed her by the arm and pulled her from the car " like a rag doll , " allegedly causing injury to a vertebrae and a lacerated liver .
Jury to Decide What Caused Paralysis
Court documents showed that the question of whether she was paralyzed during the crash or when she was pulled out of the car is in dispute .
" She said she could n't move out of the car , " said Torti .
" They exaggerated it .
I would never drag someone out of anything or pull someone out like a rag doll . "
But Van Horn 's lawyer , Robert Hutchinson , told ABCNews.com that witnesses said there was never any danger of an explosion , and both the driver and a backseat passenger were still in the car when Torti took Van Horn from the vehicle .
" [ Van Horn ] got her seat belt off and was stunned , " said Hutchinson .
" She could n't open the door and without being asked Ms. Torti grabbed and pulled her out of the car .
It was her belief that the car was about to explode . "
Hutchinson argues that despite her belief that there had been an explosion , Torti pulled the victim at an angle and dumped her on a hard median next to the car , allegedly injuring Van Horn 's spine .
Victim ' Ruined for Life '
" We all know that anyone suspected of a spinal injury should not be moved , " he said .
" She was not bleeding and was conscious .
If the car had been on fire , why did n't she carry her 50 yards away ? "
Van Horn was taken to the hospital where she underwent surgery .
Now 26 , she has returned to her home in Minneapolis and is confined to a wheelchair .
" She is ruined for life , " said Hutchinson .
But Torti said her life , too , has also been changed forever , " jolting " her relationship with her parents , whose homeowner 's insurance will end up paying if she loses the case .
Peter Keane , a dean emeritus and professor of law at Golden Gate Law School , said the impact of the court ruling will " be a bad one " and have repercussions in about a dozen other states that have Good Samaritan laws .
Good Samaritans Will Now ' Hesitate '
He said the ruling will force ordinary people to be " reflective " before coming to the aid of a person in an emergency .
" It 's much too literal an interpretation of the immunity law for Good Samaritans , " he told ABCNews.com .
" Now it puts the onus on the lay person in an emergency situation to try to figure out the nuances of what medical care means , something that could subject them to liability later on . "
Meanwhile , Torti said she feels betrayed by a former colleague and is now shy about helping others .
" I am really shocked it turned out the way it did , " said Torti .
" How do you explain what you feel when someone you help is going after your money ? " she said .
" I am really sad because I have always known how to help people and now I always second guess myself .
You want to make sure you do the right thing , but you 're scared .
The world turns us into robots that do n't care . "

But how did they evolve ?

150 years after Darwin proposed it , evolution by natural selection continues to be both a battleground and a hotbed of ideas .
Scientists continue to respond to the latest attacks from creationists , and at the same time propose profound new ideas about evolution .
This year has seen perceptions of the virus change from disease - causing villain to evolutionary hero , and the emergence of a new force of evolution – the absence of natural selection .
Since its redesign in November , NewScientist.com is making the last 12 months ’ of articles free for everyone to read .

How trees changed the world
It ’s only when you try to imagine a world without trees that you realise how much we take them for granted .
Yet 450 million years ago there was no such thing as a tree : few plants grew more than a centimetre tall .
Between then and now , things happened to give another dimension to plant growth and to create the diversity we see today .
Reclaiming the peppered moth for science
The peppered moth used to be the textbook example of evolution in action .
Then , about a decade ago , creationists began an orchestrated a campaign to discredit it – and with it the entire edifice of evolution .
Now biologists are fighting to take it back …
Uncovering the evolution of the bacterial flagellum
The whip - like tail of some bacteria has become the cause célèbre of the “ intelligent design ” movement and a focal point in science ’s ongoing struggle against unreason .
It does n’t seem possible to come up with one via Darwin ’s “ numerous , successive , slight modifications ” , they say .
Now science is coming up with an answer …
Evolution :
What missing link ?
The fossil record used to be thought of as a patchy and unreliable record of evolutionary change .
Today , that record is much more dependable .
When it comes to “ transitional fossils ” – those that bridge the gap between major groups of organisms – we now have some excellent examples .
Evolution : 24 myths and misconceptions
Evolution is perhaps the best known yet least understood of all scientific theories .
Here , NewScientist.com , seeks out the facts behind common misunderstandings that have grown up around “ the blind watchmaker ” .
Rewriting Darwin :
The new non-genetic inheritance
We resemble our parents and can fall prey to the same diseases mainly because we inherit their genes .
Yet there is another form of inheritance that does not rely on genes , one that allows characteristics to be passed on that are acquired during a person ’s lifetime …
The Ordivician : Life ’s second big bang
The Cambrian period , starting about 540 million years ago , is famous for the appearance of all but one of the types of creatures we see around us today .

From goosebumps to wisdom teeth , vestigial organs have long perplexed biologists .
What was their original purpose and what happened to make them redundant ?
NewScientist.com presents its top five vestigial organs and explains how they differ from male nipples .
Viruses :
The unsung heroes of evolution
Viruses are often seen solely as carriers of death and disease .
In the light of genomics , however , they are being seen as critical evolutionary players .
Far from being a biological afterthought , they may be the most creative genetic entities we know of .
Freedom from selection lets genes get creative
Natural selection is seen as a tough master , constantly applying pressure to improve the fit between an organism and its niche .
Yet some researchers believe that when the pressure of natural selection lifts , genomes go wandering and unexpected effects can arise .
To see the impact , he argues , we have to look no further than ourselves …
I ’m simply not watching this game today until the Dallas Cowboys can proove to me that they want to play football .
I ’m tired of all of the prima donnas not being able to walk and chew gum at once .
Friends , Romo , countrymen , lend me your iPods .
The Giants have come to Bury The ‘ Boys , not to praise them .
Apologies to Julius Caesar and especially the legendary William Shakespeare , but no apologies to T.O. and the Cowboys , who have gone from Super Bowl favorites to a beat - up , controversy - infested team hanging on tight for its playoff life .
Dallas is depleted by injury and without franchise QB Tony Romo , who misses Sunday ’s game against the Giants with a broken pinkie – Jess could n’t kiss it and make it better ?
The Cowboys are bringing their JV team to Giants Stadium for what is no longer the game of the year in the NFC East .
It is a matter of survival for Dallas , which continues to be the NFL ’s glamour franchise even though it has not won a playoff game since 1996 .
The Department of the Treasury , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , and the Federal Reserve have recently put into place several programs designed to promote financial stability and to mitigate procyclical effects of the current market conditions .
These programs make new capital widely available to U.S. financial institutions , broaden and increase the guarantees on bank deposit accounts and certain liabilities , and provide backup liquidity to U.S. banking organizations .
These efforts are designed to strengthen the capital foundation of our financial system and improve the overall functioning of credit markets .
The ongoing financial and economic stress has highlighted the crucial role that prudent bank lending practices play in promoting the nation 's economic welfare .
The recent policy actions are designed to help support responsible lending activities of banking organizations , enhance their ability to fund such lending , and enable banking organizations to better meet the credit needs of households and business .
At this critical time , it is imperative that all banking organizations and their regulators work together to ensure that the needs of creditworthy borrowers are met .
As discussed below , to support this objective , consistent with safety and soundness principles and existing supervisory standards , each individual banking organization needs to ensure the adequacy of its capital base , engage in appropriate loss mitigation strategies and foreclosure prevention , and reassess the incentive implications of its compensation policies .
Lending to creditworthy borrowers
The agencies expect all banking organizations to fulfill their fundamental role in the economy as intermediaries of credit to businesses , consumers , and other creditworthy borrowers .
Moreover , as a result of problems in financial markets , the economy will likely become increasingly reliant on banking organizations to provide credit formerly provided or facilitated by purchasers of securities .
Lending to creditworthy borrowers provides sustainable returns for the lending organization and is constructive for the economy as a whole .
It is essential that banking organizations provide credit in a manner consistent with prudent lending practices and continue to ensure that they consider new lending opportunities on the basis of realistic asset valuations and a balanced assessment of borrowers ' repayment capacities .
However , if underwriting standards tighten excessively or banking organizations retreat from making sound credit decisions , the current market conditions may be exacerbated , leading to slower growth and potential damage to the economy as well as the long - term interests and profitability of individual banking organizations .
Banking organizations should strive to maintain healthy credit relationships with businesses , consumers , and other creditworthy borrowers to enhance their own financial well - being as well as to promote a sound economy .
The agencies have directed supervisory staffs to be mindful of the procyclical effects of an excessive tightening of credit availability and to encourage banking organizations to practice economically viable and appropriate lending activities .
Strengthening capital
Maintaining a strong capital position complements and facilitates a banking organization 's capacity and willingness to lend and bolsters its ability to withstand uncertain market conditions .
Banking organizations should focus on effective and efficient capital planning and longer - term capital maintenance .
An effective capital planning process requires a banking organization to assess both the risks to which it is exposed and the risk management processes in place to manage and mitigate those risks ; evaluate its capital adequacy relative to its risks ; and consider the potential impact on earnings and capital from economic downturns .
Further , an effective capital planning process requires a banking organization to recognize losses on bank assets and activities in a timely manner ; maintain adequate loan loss provisions ; and adhere to prudent dividend policies .
In particular , in setting dividend levels , a banking organization should consider its ongoing earnings capacity , the adequacy of its loan loss allowance , and the overall effect that a dividend payout would have on its cost of funding , its capital position , and , consequently , its ability to serve the expected needs of creditworthy borrowers .
Banking organizations should not maintain a level of cash dividends that is inconsistent with the organization 's capital position , that could weaken the organization 's overall financial health , or that could impair its ability to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers .
Supervisors will continue to review the dividend policies of individual banking organizations and will take action when dividend policies are found to be inconsistent with sound capital and lending policies .
Working with mortgage borrowers
The agencies expect banking organizations to work with existing borrowers to avoid preventable foreclosures , which can be costly to both the organizations and to the communities they serve , and to mitigate other potential mortgage - related losses .
To this end , banking organizations need to ensure that their mortgage servicing operations are sufficiently funded and staffed to work with borrowers while implementing effective risk - mitigation measures .
Given escalating mortgage foreclosures , the agencies urge all lenders and servicers to adopt systematic , proactive , and streamlined mortgage loan modification protocols and to review troubled loans using these protocols .
Lenders and servicers should first determine whether a loan modification would enhance the net present value of the loan before proceeding to foreclosure , and they should ensure that loans currently in foreclosure have been subject to such analysis .
Such practices are not only consistent with sound risk management but are also in the long - term interests of lenders and servicers , as well as borrowers .
Systematic efforts to address delinquent mortgages should seek to achieve modifications that result in mortgages that borrowers will be able to sustain over the remaining maturity of their loan .
Supervisors will fully support banking organizations as they work to implement effective and sound loan modification programs .
Banking organizations that experience challenges in implementing loss mitigation efforts on their mortgage portfolios or in making new loans to borrowers should work with their primary supervisors to address specific situations .
Structuring compensation
Poorly - designed management compensation policies can create perverse incentives that can ultimately jeopardize the health of the banking organization .
Management compensation policies should be aligned with the long - term prudential interests of the institution , should provide appropriate incentives for safe and sound behavior , and should structure compensation to prevent short - term payments for transactions with long - term horizons .
Management compensation practices should balance the ongoing earnings capacity and financial resources of the banking organization , such as capital levels and reserves , with the need to retain and provide proper incentives for strong management .
Further , it is important for banking organizations to have independent risk management and control functions .
The agencies expect banking organizations to regularly review their management compensation policies to ensure they are consistent with the longer - run objectives of the organization and sound lending and risk management practices .
The agencies will continue to take steps to promote programs that foster financial stability and mitigate procyclical effects of the current market conditions .
However , regardless of their participation in particular programs , all banking organizations are expected to adhere to the principles in this statement .
We will work with banking organizations to facilitate their active participation in those programs , consistent with safe and sound banking practices , and thus to support their central role in providing credit to support the health of the U.S. economy .
( CNN ) --
The chairman of the Republican National Committee said he was " appalled " by a song called " Barack the Magic Negro " on a CD distributed by one of his political rivals .
Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan is first party member to criticize " Barack the Magic Negro . "
" The 2008 election was a wake - up call for Republicans to reach out and bring more people into our party , " RNC Chairman Mike Duncan said in a statement reported Saturday afternoon by Politico .
" I am shocked and appalled that anyone would think this is appropriate , as it clearly does not move us in the right direction . "
Chip Saltsman sent RNC members the parody CD " We Hate the USA " for Christmas , which includes the controversial tune .
He defended his decision Friday , telling CNN the song was clearly intended as a joke .
Watch the controversy over the song »
" I think most people recognize political satire when they see it , " Saltsman told CNN .
" I think RNC members understand that . "
Saltsman , a former chair of the Tennessee Republican Party , was a top advisor to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and managed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 's presidential campaign .
He is one of several candidates running to replace Duncan in the closely contested race to lead the Republican Party .
The song , set to the tune of the 1960s pop hit " Puff the Magic Dragon , " was first played on Rush Limbaugh 's radio show in 2007 .
Its title was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column that suggested Obama appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation 's history of mistreatment of African - Americans .
Saltsman said the song , penned by long - time friend Paul Shanklin , should be easily recognized as satire directed at the Times .
The CD includes parody songs referencing former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , among other targets .
Also Saturday , Peter Yarrow , who co-wrote " Puff the Magic Dragon , " called Saltsman 's decision to distribute the parody tune " offensive , " and " shocking and saddening in the extreme . "
" It is almost unimaginable to me , " Yarrow wrote in a statement sent to CNN , that Saltsman " would seriously be considered for the top post of the Republican National Committee .
Puff , himself , if asked , would certainly agree . "
Yarrow , a member of the 1960s folk group Peter , Paul and Mary , was a contributor to Obama 's presidential campaign .

Exporters face payment risks
By Hu Yuanyuan ( China Daily )

China 's exporters are facing soaring payment risks from the United States and Europe as a result of the global financial crisis , Sinosure 's risk - analysis report revealed on Friday .
[ Asianewsphoto ]
China 's exporters are facing soaring payment risks from the United States and Europe as a result of the global financial crisis , Sinosure 's risk - analysis report revealed on Friday .
As the country 's only policy - oriented insurer specializing in export credit insurance , Sinosure has issued the global risk - analysis report since 2005 .
It covers 191 foreign countries and regions .
Due to the worsened global economy , 48 countries were downgraded in their risk ratings this year .
But 14 countries , mainly in Africa and Latin America , saw an improved trade and investment environment and thus were upgraded in their ratings .
The United States , for the first time , was downgraded by one level .
According to Sinosure 's statistics , Chinese firms exporting textile , mechanical and electrical products to the US were the largest victims , with losses exceeding $ 10 million so far this year .
The situation in the EU is also poor .
The claims Sinosure received on mechanical and electrical products were five times that of the same period last year .
" Comparatively speaking , Chinese exporters could do more in exploring business opportunities in Asia where risks rising from the global crisis are not so obvious yet , " said Fu Ziying , vice - minister of commerce .
But according to the report , risks in Asia are also growing because of the weaker currency system and largely fluctuated pricing of commodities .
With $ 210 million having been paid to enterprises , Sinosure reported a 174.5 percent growth in claims in the previous 11 months this year , also indicating the soaring risks for Chinese exporters .
" Given the global financial turmoil , enterprises ' demand for export credit insurance is also growing rapidly this year , " said Liang Zhidong , vice - general manager of Sinosure .
The value insured by Sinosure jumped 64.5 percent year - on - year to 50.8 billion yuan at the end of October .
Due to the tightened cash flow , more overseas importers are now extending the period of payment , further exacerbating potential risks , Liang said .
Wang Yi , president of Sinosure , suggested Chinese exporters strengthen management of their accounts receivable to better fight against the growing trade risks , .
" A more careful and complete investigation on the buyers ' credit is needed in such a global turmoil to prevent risks beforehand , " said Wang .
People I No Longer Talk To
This blog is dedicated to people who I used to work with , be married to , had a relationship with but , for one reason or another , no longer speak to .

" What ’s wrong ? " my wife asked anxiously as I looked at the computer screen .
I did n’t answer , except to blurt out another , " Oh , no ! "
Finally , I looked at her and said quietly , " Paul Krugman has won the Nobel in economics . "
" Whew ! " she answered .
" I thought maybe one of your parents had died . "
" No , " I replied .
" This is much worse . "
And , so an intellectual event matched only by the sacking of Constantinople in 1453 , the Swedish central bank has announced that Krugman will take his place alongside F.A. Hayek and others as the Nobel laureate .
Now , the bank announced that the prize was for Krugman ’s semi- discombobulated trade theories , not his incoherent , Keynesian columns that he writes for the Democratic Party , er , the editorial page of the New York Times .
Now , before going on , I must say that most of the people who have received the Nobel in economics actually were economists ; this is the first time I have seen a pure political operative receive the prize .
However , there is precedence for this outrage : last year , Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize for his crackpot movie on Global Warming ; this year Gore preaches violence against those who might have different thoughts or who might be economic competitors of his own bankrolled " new technologies . "
( If any executive were to call for violence to shut down his competitors , he would be vulnerable to being charged under the RICO statutes ;
Gore , of course , receives a free pass .
That is what a Nobel can do . )
Thus , armed with his Nobel , Krugman almost surely will be able to set forth with his own crackpot economic " theories " and ride this prize to a high position in the upcoming Obama administration .
Because he has been front - and - center in the latest debate on the meltdown in financial markets , perhaps it is time to see what Mr. Nobel believes will be our economic salvation .
What better place to start than with today ’s column in which he praises the British government for nationalizing the country ’s banks ?
He writes :
But the ( Gordon ) Brown government has shown itself willing to think clearly about the financial crisis , and act quickly on its conclusions .
And this combination of clarity and decisiveness has n’t been matched by any other Western government , least of all our own .
What is the nature of the crisis ?
The details can be insanely complex , but the basics are fairly simple .
The bursting of the housing bubble has led to large losses for anyone who bought assets backed by mortgage payments ; these losses have left many financial institutions with too much debt and too little capital to provide the credit the economy needs ; troubled financial institutions have tried to meet their debts and increase their capital by selling assets , but this has driven asset prices down , reducing their capital even further .
What can be done to stem the crisis ?
Aid to homeowners , though desirable , ca n’t prevent large losses on bad loans , and in any case will take effect too slowly to help in the current panic .
The natural thing to do , then — and the solution adopted in many previous financial crises — is to deal with the problem of inadequate financial capital by having governments provide financial institutions with more capital in return for a share of ownership .
This sort of temporary part- nationalization , which is often referred to as an " equity injection , " is the crisis solution advocated by many economists — and sources told The Times that it was also the solution privately favored by Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman .
As with so many other Krugman howlers , it is hard to know where to begin .
First , this " liquidity crisis " exists because the banks found themselves owning worthless assets and , thus , could not raise the cash to make loans .
This is kind of like my throwing my household money into pork bellies , losing my shirt , and then not having the cash on hand to pay my bills .
Krugman makes a huge assumption , and that is that governments actually have the spare change to raise the money to " inject " into the system .
The $ 700 billion boondoggle ( which he supported ) means the government must float what surely has to be the largest single bond issue in history , with the seller on the hunt for suckers .
( I do n’t even want to think of logistics of this nonsensical exercise , except to say that in the end , the Fed will purchase the bonds and monetize the whole thing . )
Thus , this is not an " equity injection . "
It is a backdoor attempt by the government to print money , give it to banks , and call it equity .
Furthermore , the reason that these banks got into trouble in the first place was because they made a series of very bad loans , yet the government is insisting that they continue to march in the same direction , even though a very high and thick wall stands in their way .
However , Krugman saves the best for last .
The problem , he declares , is that the Bush administration is too free - market oriented to be able to solve this crisis :
Meanwhile , the British government went straight to the heart of the problem — and moved to address it with stunning speed .
On Wednesday , Mr. Brown ’s officials announced a plan for major equity injections into British banks , backed up by guarantees on bank debt that should get lending among banks , a crucial part of the financial mechanism , running again .
And the first major commitment of funds will come on Monday — five days after the plan ’s announcement .
At a special European summit meeting on Sunday , the major economies of continental Europe in effect declared themselves ready to follow Britain ’s lead , injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into banks while guaranteeing their debts .
And whaddya know , Mr. Paulson — after arguably wasting several precious weeks — has also reversed course , and now plans to buy equity stakes rather than bad mortgage securities ( although he still seems to be moving with painful slowness ) .
As I said , we still do n’t know whether these moves will work .
But policy is , finally , being driven by a clear view of what needs to be done .
Which raises the question , why did that clear view have to come from London rather than Washington ?
It ’s hard to avoid the sense that Mr. Paulson ’s initial response was distorted by ideology .
Remember , he works for an administration whose philosophy of government can be summed up as " private good , public bad , " which must have made it hard to face up to the need for partial government ownership of the financial sector .
Now , I know that having a Nobel Prize gives one a certain amount of authority to speak in certain areas , but I must say that an administration that has ratcheted government spending to ruinous levels , effectively nationalized the financial system , and engages in systematic abuse of its citizens hardly qualifies as " free - market . "
Henry Paulson might be a lot of things , but a clone of Ron Paul is not one of them .
So , Krugman continues to peddle his snake oil , but today he gets to do it as the Nobel Laureate instead of just another partisan hack .
Nonetheless , having a Nobel will enhance his stature as a guy who supposedly knows something .
However , just as the peace prize does not make Al Gore a man of peace , neither does the Nobel Prize in Economics make Paul Krugman an economist .
As I wrote five years ago :
… since my own writings have been extremely critical of the Bush Administration and both political parties , it does not bother me to read Krugman ’s anti-Republican rants .
What does bother me is that the man pretends to be something he clearly is not : an economist .
That is correct .
Let me say it again .
Paul Krugman is not an economist .
His colleagues in the economics profession and the editorial board of the Times may call him an economist , but that does not make him one .
This is harsh criticism , I realize , so I must explain my views in full .
Yes , Krugman has a Ph.D. from MIT in economics , but his writings , both popular and academic , demonstrate that he does not believe in laws of economics .
Instead , like most folks with socialist leanings , he believes that the state is both omniscient and omnipotent and simply by fiat can eliminate those pesky little problems caused by scarcity .

I think we are just about ready for a 0.9.0 release and will be feature complete enough to be considered Beta .
Two things I 'd like before we release 0.9.0 is some replication testing of the new security stuff and to finally change " count " to " limit " in view query string arguments .
Also , some people have complaints about the programmatic interfaces for map / reduce / rereduce functionality .
If anyone wants to change these , or any other major aspects of CouchDB interfaces , now is the time .
It only gets harder as we move forward .
Feedback please .

Beyond Justice
When You and I become a Just People the outcome will be certain .
Our Homes , Our Families , Our Corporations , Our Governments , Our Society will move Beyond Justice to a new Society that shall " beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more . " , " the lamb will lie down with the lion " , and there will " be no poor among them "
I ’ve decided to change how I handle my on - line stuff .
I used to have a number of different sites that I used for different things .
I ’m going to be consolidating most of it to one place .
For book reviews , if I ever find the time to get doing them again ( which I really hope to do ) I will just post them at my personal blog rather than having a website just for them .
It makes more sense now that I think about it .
I ’m going to take this site , export everything as static html , and put that up in place of the existing WordPress site .
I do not intend to make any new posts here .
So it will still exist for historical purposes but there will be nothing new .
If I write new stuff it will be at my blog – https://jrpeck.com/scribbles
My plan is just to use tags or categories to differentiate types of content so people can find what they want .
( Using people here makes me chuckle – there were never a lot of people reading this stuff here – mostly it all happened with the reviews posted over at Slashdot .
Anyway it ’s funny . )
Thanks
Many of the roughly 3,000 political appointees of President George W. Bush are beating the bushes harder than expected for post-election employment .
The unusually tough job hunt reflects the depressed market for senior management talent , with some Bush administration officials bracing for lower - paying jobs than they anticipated , say recruiters .

Channel 4 has opted to end the year on a controversial note by inviting the president of Iran , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , to give the broadcaster 's alternative Christmas message tomorrow .
But the channel has shied away from scheduling the president 's address against the Queen 's Christmas speech at 3 pm .
Unlike most years , it is not airing its alternative Christmas message at the same time as the Queen , but is instead scheduling Ahmadinejad 's message at 7.15 pm .
Channel 4 has said that the Muslim president , who has a hostile relationship with many western countries , will deliver a spiritual address that will feature a message of seasonal goodwill .
It will be preceded by a short introduction designed to place his speech in context , the broadcaster added .
Ahmadinejad will argue that the world is in its current predicament because people have lost spiritual faith .
He will also make thinly veiled criticisms of western powers in a reference to the " tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems " .
" If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would stand with the people in opposition to bullying , ill - tempered and expansionist powers , " he will say .
" If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers , occupiers , terrorists and bullies the world over .
" If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would fight against the tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems , as he did in his lifetime , " he will say .
" The solution to today 's problems can be found in a return to the call of the divine prophets . "
The Channel 4 head of news and current affairs , Dorothy Byrne , argued that the selection of such controversial figure was in line with the broadcaster 's policy of providing an " alternative world view " and reflected the extensive coverage it has given to Iran in recent times .
" As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East , President Ahmadinejad 's views are enormously influential , " she said .
" As we approach a critical time in international relations , we are offering our viewers an insight into an alternative world view .
" Channel 4 has devoted more airtime to examining Iran than any other broadcaster and this message continues a long tradition of offering a different perspective on the world around us . "
However , when the president makes his address on Christmas night he will speak to a nation more likely to be tuned in to TV shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Coronation Street .
Since it launched in 1993 , Channel 4's alternative Christmas message has been delivered by a varied selection of presenters including an injured veteran from the war in Afghanistan , Quentin Crisp , the Reverend Jesse Jackson , Doreen and Neville Lawrence , Genelle Guzman , a 9/11 survivor and The Simpsons .

If you ’re using a Windows 10 PC or laptop , you know that having an Outlook.com email account is necessary if you want to fully take advantage of the features offered by the Mail and Calendar apps .
However , this is bound to change since Microsoft is releasing an update that will extend these features to Gmail users .
The Redmond - based tech giant revealed this exciting info on the official Windows blog on April 21 .
With this update , Windows 10 users who prefer to use Gmail will be able to enjoy the features that were previously available only to Outlook users .
One of these is Focused Inbox , which essentially divides your email inbox into two categories : Focused and Other .
All your important emails will fall under Focused , while the rest will be automatically sorted under Other .
You ’ll be notified about the emails that are going to the Other category , and you can easily switch from one tab to another .
This feature is designed to get the non-important stuff out of the way and help you concentrate on priority tasks and stay productive .
Gmail users will also find it easier to verify flight , hotel , and transportation bookings and keep all their travel information in one place .
This comes from the fact that the update brings with it the simplified summary cards that Outlook users are enjoying .
These cards appear in the inbox as well as in the Calendar app and provide you with all the important details you need about your itinerary , such as your departure times , check - in link , and confirmation numbers for reservations .
As a result , there ’s no need to trawl through your inbox and open emails one by one — a quick glance at the summary card will give you all the info you need .
Simplified summary cards are also available for package deliveries .
Once you receive a shipping confirmation email for your order , the important details ( such as the date and time of delivery ) will automatically be placed in a summary card .
It will also be added to your Calendar app so you ’ll always be reminded of when your package will arrive .

I do n’t think it can have escaped anyone ’s attentions that there was a reasonably significant election in America recently .
And they got me thinking .
Barack Obama is 47 .
By contrast , David Cameron – who leaps to mind as another potential national leader in the coming years , whatever you may think of that fact – is 42 .
I got to thinking about what a national leader might look like in ten years time , 2018 .
Let ’s suggest , based on Obama and Cameron , that they ’re 45 .
They ’re 45 in 2018 when they stand for office – that means they were born in 1973 .
They would have been four when Taito released Space Invaders came out ; seven when Pac Man came out .
In 1985 , when they were 12 , Nintendo would launch the NES in the west .
At 18 , just as they would have been heading to University , the first NHL game came out for the Genesis / Megadrive and might consumed many a night in the dorm .
At 22 , the Playstation was launched .
At 26 , they could have bought a PS2 at launch ; at 31 , they might have taken up World of Warcraft with their friends .
They would have been a gamer all their lives .
Not someone who once played videogames , trotting out the same anecdote about “ playing Asteroids once ” in interviews ; someone for whom games were another part of their lives , a primary , important medium .
Someone who understood games .
And if that was the case , what might they have learned ?
What happened
Warning that the U.S. economy will get worse before it improves , President - elect Barack Obama said he will push to enact the largest public - works program since the building of the federal highway system in the 1950s .
The program , whose cost he declined to estimate , would include road and bridge projects as well as upgrading U.S. energy , education , and technology infrastructure .
( The New York Times )
What the commentators said
Like Franklin Roosevelt , Obama is inheriting an economic crisis and proposing “ his own New Deal ” to fix it , said William Rees - Mogg in The Times of London .
And like FDR , “ Obama has realized that the president ’s strongest weapon is his relationship with the public . ”
As Obama sells his plan to the public , his webcasts , like FDR ’s “ fireside chats , ” will be “ his real power . ”
“ Obama invokes both FDR and Eisenhower in his new program , ” said Ed Morrissey in Hot Air , but the “ key difference ” between Obama ’s plan and Ike ’s interstate highway program is that Eisenhower “ could afford that public works project . ”
Obama , inheriting tens of trillions in federal debt and future entitlements , can’t .
“ We conservatives ” have some “ legitimate worries ” about massive public - works projects , said Emil Henry Jr. in The Washington Post , but there ’s a “ bigger point :
Our infrastructure needs are at a critical juncture . ”
Like private companies , the U.S. wo n’t be competitive unless it invests in its future .
Still , conservatives can make sure Obama taps “ private capital and expertise . ”
Actually , the biggest determinant of success in public - works programs , said Nicole Gelinas in The Wall Street Journal , is “ leadership and competence at all levels of government . ”
Some needed projects are too big and complex to trust to private contractors — think Boston ’s Big Dig .
“ In public infrastructure , the word ‘ public ’ is there for a reason . ”

Advertisement Thousands of runners who took part in a Lake District endurance race disrupted by treacherous weather are now accounted for , police have said .
About 2,500 people were taking part in the two - day Original Mountain Marathon near Keswick in Cumbria .
Police said race organisers have now indicated that the final six missing runners were safe .
About 743 sheltered in farms , former mines and a school overnight .
Twelve people received hospital treatment .
More than 1,700 people had been unaccounted for overnight , although many had found shelter and all were equipped with tents and food , race organisers said .
On Sunday morning , Cumbria police called in a helicopter to search for those runners still missing .
ORIGINAL MOUNTAIN MARATHON
Two - day mountain marathon Event started in 1968 Past venues in northern England , North Wales and Scotland Course length of up to 49.6 miles
Tough challenge of mountain race Athletes upbeat after finding shelter Animals threatened by floods OMM organisers had appealed for participants who had already left the area to get in touch and let them know they were safe .
As the hunt progressed , the number of OMM competitors who were unaccounted for fell rapidly to 42 , and then 14 .
By 1300 GMT an RAF rescue helicopter was searching for the final six missing racers , comprising three teams .
Grave danger
The OMM was abandoned at about midday on Saturday after being hit by some of the worst weather in its 41 - year history .
It has taken place every year since 1968 at locations across northern England , north Wales and Scotland .
According to the race website , the end of October is chosen " to allow weather to enhance the challenge " .
There are various courses ranging between 40 km ( 24.8 miles ) and 80 km in length , with an ascent of up to 3000 m .
Extreme conditions on the mountains and severe flooding made it difficult to get the message to competitors scattered across the hills , often with no means of communication .
Mountain rescue teams searched the hills until after dark on Saturday .
RAF
Flt Lt Curly Crawford earlier said a helicopter crew had airlifted five runners and two mountain rescue volunteers to safety .
" A female had been washed into a river by the rains , and obviously [ was ] in grave danger of being washed away , " he told the BBC .
" Fortunately she 'd been recovered by fellow runners but was severely injured and suffering from hypothermia . "
Cumbria County Council said it opened a reception centre overnight at Cockermouth school and worked with volunteers from the Red Cross and local supermarkets to shelter and feed racers .
Authorities are currently working to reunite competitors , who were competing in teams of two , with their vehicles , and the council is providing transportation .
Police said the B5289 between Seathwaite and Keswick is now passable with care and police are still ascertaining which other local roads are open .
One competitor , Rob Darrington , said at times the high winds and rain had felt as though it was " blowing needles into your face " .
Another competitor Jules Carter defended the event .
" Obviously the flooding just took things a step too far this time unfortunately , " he said .
Overnight , 300 runners sheltered in Honister slate mine , which has seen 1ft ( 40 cm ) of rain fall since Thursday , according to the Environment Agency .
Mine manager Mark Weir was critical of organisers who had " overwhelmed the emergency service " by allowing the race to go ahead .
But OMM organisers defended their decision to stage the event .
An article on the its website on Saturday said : " The idea of self - reliance is n't a popular one in this day and age , so the fact that 900 people are said to be unaccounted for is being presented with the implication they are lost and in trouble - which is not the case . "

About 400 runners stayed at Gatesgarth farm , while Glaramara Centre and Cockermouth Sheep and Wool Centre gave refuge to dozens of runners .
It is understood casualties were admitted to the Mary Hewetson Cottage Hospital , in Keswick , and later moved to Cumberland Infirmary , in Carlisle , and West Cumberland Hospital , in Whitehaven , for treatment .

What are these ?
From the deepest oceans
to the outermost reaches of space to the genetic code of human life .
The same adventurous spirit that propelled Columbus ' explorations will enable us to challenge old assumptions , acquire new knowledge , and broaden the horizons of humankind .
Columbus ' story illustrates the importance of diversity .
Columbus was born and raised in Italy ; he learned much of his
seafaring knowledge and experience from Portuguese sailors and navigators ; and he put those skills in service to the King and Queen of Spain , who funded his explorations .
By establishing a
safe , reliable route between Europe and the New World , Columbus opened the door for subsequent explorers from Spain , France , and England and for the millions of immigrants who would be welcomed by America in later centuries .
But the encounters between Columbus and other European Explorers and the native peoples of the Western
Hemisphere also underscore what can happen when cultures clash and when we are unable to understand and respect people who are different from us .

Checking Out Chavez ’s Venezuela Berkeley Daily Planet , CA - Dec 29 , 2006
In 2003 , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez urged Latin Americans to not celebrate the Columbus Day holiday .
Chavez blamed Columbus for leading the way in the mass genocide of the Native Americans .
Chavez Calls Bush " The Devil " Hugo Chavez Speech at the UN on September 20th,2006 broadcast on Fox " Representatives of the governments of the world , good morning to all of you .
First of all , I would like to invite you , very respectfully , to those who have not read this book , to read it .
Noam Chomsky , one of the most prestigious American and world intellectuals , Noam Chomsky , and this is one of his most recent books , Hegemony or Survival : The Imperialist Strategy of the United States .
It ’s an excellent book to help us understand what has been happening in the world throughout the 20th century , and what ’s happening now , and the greatest threat looming over our planet .
The hegemonic pretensions of the American empire are placing at risk the very survival of the human species .
We continue to warn you about this danger and we appeal to the people of the United States and the world to halt this threat , which is like a sword hanging over our heads .... We want ideas to save our planet , to save the planet from the imperialist threat .
And hopefully in this very century , in not too long a time , we will see this , we will see this new era , and for our children and our grandchildren a world of peace based on the fundamental principles of the United Nations , but a renewed United Nations .
And maybe we have to change location .
Maybe we have to put the United Nations somewhere else ; maybe a city of the south .
We ’ve proposed Venezuela .
In an interview later with CNN en Español , Chavez said he had good relations with President Clinton , but of Bush he said , " With this cowboy you can't even talk ... the Texan who walks around shooting from the hip . "
Today we have other worlds to explore --
Regarding them as sinners , he was interested only in the ones who could lead him to gold , and it was n't long before he was proposing shipping Indians back to Spain as slaves .
But the Catholic kings had qualms - surprisingly , since there was a flourishing market in Spain for African slaves .
They summoned a committee , which thought that , on the whole , it was not right .
The monarchs ordered that , so long as the natives were " submissive " , they should be treated well and educated .
Each family should have its own house , and mixed marriages were to be encouraged .
Clash of civilizations , from cartoons to the pope , the riotous debate .
It is still arguable whether political scientist Samuel Huntington 's thesis that a " clash of civilizations " between European - rooted liberalism , respect for reason , and tolerance , and Islamic - rooted religious enthusiasm is an inevitable part of our future .
But several events this past year suggest the danger level is high .
When in January cartoons by a few previously obscure Danish cartoonists were published , some of which lampooned the Prophet Muhammad , complaints were not enough for some Islamic enthusiasts .
Instead there were riots in the Middle East and threats in Denmark , purposely orchestrated by ambitious mullahs .
Later in the year , when Pope Benedict XVI quoted a 14th - century pope who was critical of Islam – in the context of a nuanced discussion of the difficulty of reconciling faith and reason – churches were burned , and a nun was shot in the back .
Furthermore , restive Muslims rioted in France , and native - born Britons planted bombs on the subway .
Europe has little experience with cultural assimilation , but it will have to get up to speed quickly .
Moderate Muslims – still the vast majority – need to step up and serve as bridges between cultures .
And if the U.S. ever hopes to neutralize " Islamofascist " terrorism it will have to learn a lot more about Islam and how to talk with sincere but reasonable believers .
While many in the United States of America generally refer to the country as America and themselves as Americans , [ 1 ] many people elsewhere in the Americas resent what they perceive as appropriation of the term in this context and , thus , this usage is frequently avoided .
In Canada , their southern neighbour is seldom referred to as " America " with " the United States " , " the U.S. " , or ( informally ) " the States "
The most common way to distinguish is singular / plural or America / Americas and adding " the " with the plural " s " is even more clear .
A hemispheric free - trade agreement , long a goal of U.S. policy , seems like a long shot as " populist " rulers love to blame the poverty of their countries on the very activity – international trade – that stands the best chance of relieving it .
Philip Streich , 17 Platteville , Wisconson Nano Entrepeneur
First Steps :
Since he was 10 years old , Streich has lived on a farm , helping tend crops and livestock .
Homeschooled since the seventh grade , he began taking science and math courses in the ninth grade at the University of Wisconsin–Platteville .
There he teamed up with James Hamilton , a chemistry professor who introduced him to the microscopic carbon cylinders known as nanotubes .
The Challenge : Superstrong carbon nanotubes have a wide array of potential applications , including lighter bulletproof vests and more responsive touch screens , but they have a tendency to clump together , which makes them difficult to work with .
To solve the problem , chemists had been coating the nanotubes with various substances , but doing so often altered the tubes ’ physical and electrical properties , thus limiting their utility .
Streich and Hamilton thought there might be a better way : Dissolving the nanotubes in some sort of solvent would keep them from clumping without altering their properties .
But no one knew if there was a solvent that could do the job .
The Solution : Streich custom - built a spectrometer to probe the chemical characteristics of the nanotubes .
Using these data , he discovered that the solvent N - Methyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone would indeed dissolve nanotubes .
Streich then went on to find more solvents with the aid of the spectrometer .
The project won him more than $ 100,000 in scholarship money , and he and Hamilton published their results [ subscription required ] last spring .
By June Streich was celebrating an additional $ 50,000 victory at a state business - plan competition for a nanotech start - up called Graphene Solutions , which he had cofounded with Hamilton .
“ I never dreamed any of this would be possible , ” Streich says .
“ I really credit my parents ’ support for allowing me to try homeschooling .
If I had been in the regular school system , I doubt any of this would have developed . ”
What ’s Next : Streich is planning for college , where he hopes to combine his love of science with politics and the humanities .
Eric Delgado , 18 Bayonne , New Jersey
First Steps : Delgado ’s curiosity was sparked when , after 10th grade at Bayonne High School , he worked with Jersey City Medical Center researchers investigating the MRSA bug , a cause of antibiotic - resistant infections , especially in hospitals .
The Challenge : Fighting antibiotic - resistant germs means coming up with a way to counter the tricks bacteria use to thwart antibiotics .
One trick used by some bacteria is to eject antibiotics through so - called efflux pumps embedded in their cellular membranes .
Delgado wondered :
Was there a way to disable these pumps ?
And how could he do such complicated research in a high school lab ?
The Solution : Working with pathogenic bacteria would be far too dangerous in a school setting , so Delgado focused on disabling an efflux pump in the common bacterium E. coli .
Marie Aloia , a teacher , helped Delgado contact researchers across the country for advice and supplies .
One helped him identify lab techniques that would allow him to avoid hazardous chemicals .
Another supplied a plant compound ( diosmetin ) known to disable efflux pumps in other bacteria .
“ The Internet has definitely made it much easier .
You can do things kids from 10 years ago would n’t have been able to do , ” Delgado says .
After school and on weekends for two years , Delgado measured how much antibiotic the organisms pumped out and how much was needed to kill them off after exposure to diosmetin and other candidate compounds .
Delgado ’s work won fifth place at the Intel Science Talent Search in 2008 .
What ’s Next : Delgado is currently attending Yale University .
“ I ’ve always been interested in the health sector , ” he says .
“ Having real - world applications helps . ”
Daniel Burd , 17 Waterloo , Ontario
First Steps :
In 2006 Burd was moved by clutter at home to study plastic - eating microbes .
“ I just got tired of all the plastic bags falling on my head every time I opened the closet , ” he says .
The Challenge : Millions of plastic bags clog our landfills , often finding their way into the oceans and strangling marine life .
Scientists estimate that it can take hundreds of years for a plastic bag to completely break down .
Burd decided to see if he could isolate naturally occurring plastic - munching microbes and get them to work more quickly .
The Solution : Using supplies and equipment acquired mostly through eBay , Burd collected soil samples , isolated candidate microbes , and grew each in a culture .
Then he quantified each organism ’s ability to degrade plastic by exposing it to plastic strips .
Burd isolated four microbial strains that could degrade plastic , including one that worked particularly well .
He experimented with different temperatures and various mixtures of strains until he was able to degrade up to 43 percent of his strips in six weeks — a dramatic improvement over the years it could take in a landfill .
Burd ’s research won first prize in a Canada - wide science fair last spring .
What ’s Next : Burd is continuing his work at his high school , Waterloo Collegiate Institute , where he is a senior .
Anastasia Roda , 19 Lancaster , Pennsylvania
First Steps :
For almost as long as she can remember , Roda has loved Barnegat Bay , the coastal area of New Jersey where she spent her summers .
At age 15 , when she realized just how close the bay was to the Oyster Creek Generating Station , the nation ’s oldest nuclear power plant , she swung into action .
The Challenge : Did Oyster Creek have an impact on the bay ’s ecosystem ?
Roda ’s goal was to raise awareness in the public and among engineers who design nuclear power facilities .
“ Once we know about our impact , it ’s easier to lessen it , ” she says .
The Solution :
She spent the next three summers comparing creeks near the power plant with a control creek about seven miles away .
She measured water properties from temperature to clarity and did a detailed analysis of microbes and other organisms .
Roda found that , compared with the control creek , creeks closest to the power plant had higher temperatures and faster currents , and further downstream they had higher bacteria levels .
She remembers how warm the water near the power plant was compared with other parts of the bay .
“ It was like bathwater , ” she says , adding that the creeks ’ ecosystems do remain functional , in that they are still host to many organisms .
Roda ’s work has won her numerous honors , including the American Museum of Natural History ’s Young Naturalist Award and a spot in the Intel Science Talent Search finals last spring .
What ’s Next : Now at Harvard University , Roda plans to focus on environmental studies , marine biology , and possibly law .
Isha Jain , 17 Bethlehem , Pennsylvania
First Steps :
In fifth grade , Jain did a science fair project about the physical properties that make candy either chewy or hard .
Her father , a material sciences professor at Lehigh University , invited her to continue working on the project in his lab , and they published their results two years later .
By ninth grade Jain was working part - time in a developmental biology lab at Lehigh .
The Challenge : How limbs grow is still poorly understood .
Getting a better handle on this process may play a role in healing bone injuries and treating bone disease .
Jain tackled the problem by looking at how bone grows in zebra fish fins .
The Solution : Using a number of techniques including fluorescent microscopy , Jain charted the process in the bone cells themselves .
Instead of finding a single burst of activity , she documented a series of cellular pulses .
Jain ’s findings were published in Developmental Dynamics and won her a $ 100,000 scholarship at the 2007 –2008 Siemens competition .
She credits her success to starting so young .
“ I always liked science and math , but without being immersed in research , I would n’t have known it was what I wanted to do , ” she says .
What ’s Next : Jain is now a freshman at Harvard and plans to go to medical school .
Social conservatives cannot complain that their issues have not been heard in the 2008 campaign , in exactly the fashion they wanted .
Editors Note :
This is the first part of the four part Culture of Lies series ; read the entire series here .
Social conservatives cannot complain that their issues have not been heard in the 2008 campaign , in exactly the fashion they wanted .
John McCain selected the far - right ’s hand - picked candidate as his running mate , Sarah Palin , instead of either of his preferred choices , Joe Lieberman or Tom Ridge .
McCain used one of the far - right ’s most egregious and most thoroughly debunked attacks , that Barack Obama supports infanticide , in the final presidential debate .
The Republican Party platform is recognized as the most extreme platform in history on cultural issues .
Palin has talked up " Culture of Life " issues in her very few interviews , and John McCain has as well , going on record saying he believes life begins at conception .
The Republican National Committee , several pro-life lobbying groups , at least two independent expenditure campaigns and the McCain campaign have used television , radio , mail , internet and robo-calls to deliver what appears to be a coordinated message on the " Born Alive " infanticide charge .
The McCain - Palin campaign attacked comprehensive sexuality education , supported bans on gay marriage , and several fundamentalist Christian churches openly defied tax and election law by endorsing the ticket from their pulpits to further energize their base .
Everyone is talking about the importance of the Supreme Court and attacks from the far - right have intensified as the campaign progressed .
In every possible way , the Republican Party and the McCain - Palin campaign embraced the far - right ’s " Culture of Life . "

Social conservatives could not possibly ask for more .
If McCain and Palin win , the appeal to the far - right base will be heralded as the reason , and he will owe them far more than just the Supreme Court justices he has promised .
If they lose , the recriminations , which have already started , will be fierce and the Culture War will likely turn into an un-Civil War within the Grand Old Party .
Already the Palinistas on the far - right are suggesting she was " mishandled " by the campaign .
Others will say with the economic crisis , there was just no way for McCain to win , even with a more experienced vice - president that appealed to independents .
You can bet that none of the Culture Warriors on the far - right will take even one moment to consider that they have moved too far outside the mainstream of American culture .
Either they are heroes for having delivered victory to McCain - Palin , or
if they lose , they ’ll argue that McCain was n’t strong enough on social
issues from the beginning .
Will any brave and clear - sighted Republicans realize that rather than
throwing McCain a lifeline in this election , far - right extremism has
further isolated McCain , and the party , from mainstream Americans ?
It is hard to imagine how much meaner and nastier a campaign can get than distorting someone ’s record and accusing them of infanticide , but I have faith that the far - right could .
That is what they will argue if they face defeat .
Yet there are actual facts that tell a different story from the one social - cons will believe , and argues against crediting them with victory should that come .
Since 2004 , when equal numbers ( 37 percent ) of Americans identified with each of the two major political parties , Democrats have held steady while the Republicans have dropped to 29 percent .
New registrations , especially in swing states , have dramatically favored the Democrats .
Across the board , polling has indicated that the Culture War issues of abortion and gay rights matter to a very small percentage of the electorate , usually less than five percent , often less than three .
Similarly , polling consistently indicates Americans reject far - right social conservative policies like abstinence - only - until - marriage , banning abortion and stem cell research , and discriminating against homosexuals .
Barack Obama and Joe Biden have unflinchingly discussed their pro-education , pro-prevention and pro-choice values , from a position of public policy as well as personal morality .
Obama put together a platform that has been praised by pro-choice and pro-life Democrats , and openly talks about working to reduce unintended pregnancies while respecting different opinions on abortion .
The ticket supports stem cell research and does not believe in discrimination .
The far - right cannot complain that the Obama campaign has somehow " hidden " its agenda .
Could it be that Americans are rejecting the far - right Culture War ?
Could it be that they see through the tactical misinformation and manipulation of the " Culture of Life " and recognize it instead as a Culture of Lies ?
Even with a McCain victory the trend lines are obvious , the Culture War issues no longer resonate , especially with younger voters .
Let ’s be clear .
I do n’t know anyone who would take away the right for a person to believe what they choose , to follow their faith , however they interpret it .
The Culture of Lies is not about what the far - right believes or their right to believe it .
The lies are about how they distort facts trying to impose what they believe on everyone else , taking away other Americans ’ rights in the process .
If you want to believe dinosaurs and man walked the Earth together 6,000 years ago , when the Earth allegedly began , go right ahead — but let ’s not teach that in public schools .
If you hold , as a matter of faith , that pregnancy begins at an unknowable moment of conception , most people I know will fight for your right to believe that , but will oppose any effort to impose that ideology over basic medical facts in public policy .
If you believe that teens really will remain abstinent and thus need no knowledge of prevention methods , that may work for you , but to continue wasting $ 1.5 billion dollars on programs that do n’t achieve that goal , and actually put teens at risk , seems odd to many taxpayers .
You believe that gay people " choose " to live a " lifestyle " that subjects them to discrimination , fine .
You believe that women should not be allowed to make their own personal life decisions — that ’s your choice — no one is forcing you to use contraception , plan your family , have an abortion , or work outside the home .
And at death , should you suffer from a terminal illness and want every possible technology and treatment to keep you alive , no one — other than your insurance company — would deny you your belief that only God can end life , no matter how much science you use to keep yourself alive .
The question on the table is whether your personal , individual beliefs should apply to everyone else , regardless of their personal , individual and deeply held beliefs .
For a generation , the far - right has promoted the biggest lie of all — that they are the ones fighting for individual rights , the ones whose values are threatened .
But the far - right has made a raison d’etre of opposing countless rights
critical to individuals ’ freedom and self - determination , including stimatizing women who have abortions and making them more difficult to obtain ; even banning procedures necessary to protect a women ’s health — rather that work with common sense proposals like Prevention First promoted by progressives .
The far - right has attempted to equate contraception with abortion , which the Bush Administration will likely move toward by issuing a new ruling this week allowing trained medical professionals to deny you access to contraception .
They demonized gay people and their families promoting ex-gay ministries instead of embracing God ’s gay children and damned them by suggesting AIDS was God ’s curse .
The far - right continues to support policies that do more to promote the spread of AIDS than stop it , like increasing the abstinencce - only earmark in US global AIDS policy .
The far - right stood in the way of equal pay for women , denied family planning funding , imposed global gag rules denying free speech to doctors and medically accurate information to women , established Crisis Pregnancy Centers that promote propaganda over health , launched a war on science that delayed the approval of emergency contraception , spread misinformation about the efficacy of condoms , and so much more .
They have been unable to win these battles by arguing the truth as represented in medical facts , provable public health strategies , and science , so they lied .
By manipulating genuine belief among people of faith with misinformation , they became a reliable power base within the Republican Party and as a result have had disproportionate influence on the political process , and the McCain - Palin campaign .
After eight years of being able to control the levers of power within the Bush Administration , the far - right was able to persuade John McCain to play his one shot at the White House their way .
Having been beaten by their machine in 2000 , he chose to follow instead of lead .
Americans have a full understanding of the Culture War the far - right has waged against their fellow Americans for a generation .
We have seen their policies when they controlled Congress , we have watched the Bush Administration implement them , their judicial appointments put ideology over law , and the McCain - Palin team campaign on them .
Next week we will see if America embraces the values presented as a " Culture of Life " or sees them instead as a Culture of Lies .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The chances of a terror attack on a major city somewhere in the world using weapons of mass destruction are better than even , according to a task force mandated by the U.S. Congress , The Washington Post reported in its Tuesday edition .
A draft study by the panel warns of growing threats from rogue states , nuclear smuggling rings and the spread of atomic information in the developing world , the newspaper reported .
The panel , the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism , singled out Pakistan as a grave concern because of its network of terror groups , history of instability and nuclear capabilities , according to the report .
“ In our judgment , America ’s margin of safety is shrinking , not growing , ” the newspaper quoted from the draft report .
The panel said it is more likely that a terror attack , which could also include biological weapons , will take place by the end of 2013 , according to the report .
Former Sen. Bob Graham , a Florida Democrat , chaired the commission with former Rep. James Talent , a Missouri Republican , as the vice chairman .
The commission recommended the overhaul of international nonproliferation treaties , including more robust inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency , the report said .
The panel also urged President - elect Barack Obama to take a tough line with Iran and North Korea .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Some of John McCain 's advisers are not happy that his running mate , Governor Sarah Palin , is making a habit of going off - script and off - message with some of her comments ...
Most recently this weekend when she discussed her wardrobe at a rally in Florida .
So let 's play " what if ? "
What if John McCain had not picked Sarah Palin to be his running mate ?
For one thing , the Republicans probably would n't have had to spend $ 150,000 buying clothes for the candidate .
Seriously .
What if McCain had picked Mitt Romney .
A self - made man with plenty of clothes and a knowledge of the economy that the current ticket is sorely lacking .
And while he probably can't see Russia from his state , he could probably name at least one newspaper that he reads every day .
And if he won , he probably would n't go to Washington in January thinking he was " in charge of the Senate . "
Or what about Tom Ridge .
The former Pennsylvania governor and Secretary of Homeland Security ?
The key to victory for McCain or Obama may well be Pennsylvania , where Obama holds a double - digit lead heading into next Tuesday .
Think Tom Ridge might have helped McCain with his " Pennsylvania " problem ?
Besides , it would have been fun if McCain wins watching Ridge wrap the White House in clear plastic sheeting and duct tape .
Watch : Cafferty : Palin a mistake ?
But McCain chose Sarah Palin who immediately became a national joke to everyone except the conservative base of the Republican party .
Even some Republicans are convinced the Palin selection showed a total lack of judgment on McCain 's part .
Or what about Florida governor Charlie Crist ?
Would winning Florida help McCain ?
You get the idea .
Here ’s my question to you :
Was it a mistake for John McCain to pick Sarah Palin as his running mate ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Anj from California writes :
It is not putting “ country first ” when a 72 year - old with a history of cancer picks as his successor someone so obviously unqualified for national office .
News flash : Competence matters .
Quite frankly , selecting Palin is emblematic of every sellout and shoot - from - the - hip - just - like - Bush decision McCain has made since securing his party 's nomination .
I do n't know how he can even look at himself in the mirror .
Kyle from DuPont , Washington writes :
Jack , not at all .
The mistake was trying to force her into a stereotypical number two role and placing a muzzle on her .
Had the McCain camp let her be " Sarah Palin " from the start , I think we might be asking this question about Bigmouth Biden .
Frank from Columbus , Ohio writes :
For the brain - dead base of his party , it was the right choice .
For the moderate Republican and conservative - leaning independent , it was not .
McCain , the gambler , held a decent hand but folded to the base .
He lost the election the day he announced this preposterous choice as his running mate .
At the end of the day the decision will be seen as the turning point of his campaign .
Bad for him , but good for America .
Paul writes :
All those other choices would have been bad for McCain .
He needed to excite the base of his party .
Which she did .
It 's all Monday morning quarterbacking .
The truth is that it would n't have mattered who McCain picked .
His goose in the general was cooked when the financial crisis hit last month .
Had n’t that happened , this would have been a much closer race
Elliott writes :
Yes .
Choosing Sarah Palin was a mistake .
But it 's not because of her lack of experience , her lack of knowledge or her lack of transparency .
The biggest problem with the selection of Sarah Palin is that it is extremely polarizing .
Bush 's Presidency has been marked by some of the deepest partisan divisions in the nation 's history .
This election is a chance to restore civility between the parties .
With Palin on the ticket , that opportunity is lost .
Brendan from San Antonio , Texas writes :
She makes Quayle look like Einstein , and I did n't think that was possible !
It 's weird to think of Russell T. Davies as the voice of restraint on Doctor Who , after some of his crazy plot twists .
But Davies told the Times that the BBC really wanted to turn the show 's time - traveling eccentric , the Doctor , into a little kid .
( Or show him as a child ? )
Says Davies ,
" It would demystify the Doctor having a boy running around saying , ' I am the Doctor ' with a sonic screwdriver . " [ Times ]

Simon Cowell has been the unlikely catalyst for Jeff Buckley 's posthumous ascent of the pop charts .
His mother relishes the irony , she tells Guy Adams
Should the unthinkable happen , and a grassroots campaign by Jeff Buckley fans disrupt Simon Cowell 's efforts to again secure a Christmas number one , BBC Radio 1 will be forced to deal with a tricky issue of protocol .
Normally , the station interviews chart - topping artists before playing their winning song ( even when Bob the Builder won , Neil Morrissey stood in ) .
But Buckley would be sadly unavailable for selection .
The supremely gifted singer , whose haunting rendition of Leonard Cohen 's " Hallelujah " has reignited public interest in the pop charts , died in a swimming accident on 29 May , 1997 .
He had completed just one studio album , and was on the verge of major celebrity when his life was cut short .
Today , Buckley boasts a cult following .
His album , Grace , is considered one of the greatest records in pop history .
Rolling Stone recently put him at 39th , one spot below Elton John , in its list of the " 100 greatest singers of all time " .
He is also extremely influential .
A generation of musicians , from P J Harvey and Rufus Wainwright , cite him as a major source of inspiration .
Justin Timberlake called his dog Buckley , by way of a tribute .
Brad Pitt recently appeared in a documentary about his life .
Yet Jeff Buckley 's real legacy lies behind a smartly - painted door of a small house in the bohemian Los Angeles suburb of Silver Lake .
This is the home of Mary Guibert , a woman who has painstakingly safeguarded his reputation ever since the day he was killed in Wolf River Harbour , Tennessee .
Ms Guibert knew Buckley better than anyone : she was his mother .
" I think Jeff would have found this number one thing very amusing , " she said , during a break from writing Christmas cards yesterday .
" It 's ironic in so many ways .
I mean , here is The X Factor , run by Simon Cowell , who is supposed to be the ultimate taste arbiter , and they 've been run to the wire by my son .
" It 's come about so organically , with no record label pushing it , and I think Jeff would have loved that , and loved his fans for doing it . "
Buckley 's father was Tim Buckley , a folk musician in the Bob Dylan tradition who had met Mary at high school in Orange County , a region of California often described as the Essex of Los Angeles .
She became pregnant with Jeff in 1966 , just as Tim Buckley 's career was taking off ; they were divorced soon afterwards .
" When I was 17 and pregnant with nothing to do I would sit at home and eat spaghetti and play Chopin on the piano , " says Ms Guibert .
" I was a concert pianist .
Before he was even born , he spent months pressed up against that piano , listening to music . "
Jeff never met
Tim until 1975 , when at the age of nine he was taken to one of his concerts in nearby Anaheim .
Mary says the event caused him to " fall in love " with his father and " absolutely guaranteed " that he would follow in his footsteps as a musician .
" From that day , it took the form of a moral imperative for Jeff to be a musician .
When other kids were watching television or on the phone , he would be in his bedroom listening to records by Hendrix or Led Zeppelin , and playing guitar . "
But Buckley did n't get to know Tim .
A couple of months after their first meeting , his father died from a drug overdose .
Mary meanwhile married and divorced again , condemning her son to a youth she once described as " rootless trailer trash " .
" There was always something a little melancholy about Jeff 's observation of the world , " says Ms Guibert .
" When he was four or five he would come up and say ' why are people so mean to people ? '
In childhood , he observed a lot of man 's inhumanity to man , or rather man 's inhumanity to woman . "
After leaving school , Buckley studied guitar at the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles , before hitting the road to travel America playing in small venues and coffee shops .
The breakthrough occurred , or so the legend has it , after moving to New York in 1990 .
Shane Doyle , the owner of a small coffee shop called Sin-e in the East Village , hired him to play at the venue each Monday night , to a crowd of regulars who included William Burroughs and Lou Reed .
Soon the gigs were the talk of the town .
" Very quickly , it became clear that this guy was seriously good , " he recalled yesterday .
" We were a tiny venue , very untidy , and I 'd be getting these phone calls asking me to reserve a table for famous producers like Clive Davis or Seymour Stein . "
Buckley could hit notes across a range that spanned eight octaves .
His guitar playing , on a 1976 Gibson Les Paul , was accomplished .
Although he often played covers ( he was a relative latecomer to the art of songwriting , and wrote relatively few original tracks ) he was swiftly heralded as a singular talent .
In 1992 , after a bidding war that reputedly ended in a $ 2 m ( £ 1.3 m ) contract , Buckley was signed by Columbia Records .
His debut album Grace was released in 1994 , after which he began a national tour .
Grace included the cover version of Leonard Cohen 's " Hallelujah " which would become Buckley 's most famous record .
In person , despite the melancholy nature of his music , Buckley was extroverted , and renowned as a gifted mimic .
Buckley 's biographer David Browne said : " He grew up thinking of himself as an essentially unattractive individual , so when he signed to Columbia and had girls swooning over him , sure – he took advantage .
" He also dabbled with heroin .
It was in the mid-1990s when it was a cool drug , during this period when he looked up a lot of his father 's old friends , and tried to pick their brains and understand his father . "
Yet the incident that ended Buckley 's short and glorious career had nothing to do with rock ' n ' roll excess .
It occurred on a hot evening , when he took a break from recording his second album at a studio in Memphis to go for a swim in the Mississippi .
A swirling current carried him downstream .
His body was discovered several days later .
When Jeff 's death eventually sunk in , Ms Guibert dedicated herself to securing her son 's legacy .
She oversaw the release of his almost completed second album Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk .
More recently Ms Guibert has compiled several other records of live recordings that have sold millions of copies around the world .
Today , she also helps run the countless fan clubs that still organise dozens of tribute events around the world on his birthday each November .
A film of his life is currently in development , produced by Michelle Cy – who produced Finding Neverland – and Orian Williams , the producer of the recent film Control , about another singer who died just when they were beginning to emerge , Joy Division 's Ian Curtis .
It should be a compelling narrative , steeped in the glorious musical tradition of talent cut that is short in its prime .
" If Jeff had lived , he would now be on a level with Bono , " adds Ms Guibert .
" He would have toured the world and had a lifelong career , and at the end of it , he would have been that guy sitting in a wheelchair with the microphone specially lowered six inches , so that we could all hear him sing " Hallelujah " one more time . "
Belfast Telegraph
Years ago I first heard this myth and it lodged itself deeply in my mind .
It seems so true that it ’s taken years to shed myself of it .
The myth : Never start designing and certainly NEVER start writing code until the requirements are defined .
It implied that requirements make a foundation of solid rock on which to build grand edifices of code .
Unfortunately , none of it is true .
As a foundation requirements are no more stable than the shifting sands of North Carolina ’s Outter Banks .
Initially sketchy and ill defined with work requirements can grow into something akin to Mr. Obama ’s political platform — all inclusive and contradictory .
In school we were warned about some of this and armed with a technique to defuse it — the use case .
Supposedly , if you define all user interactions the full scope of a system can be defined before one line of code is written .
The problem : real users do n’t have a clue about computer systems .
Imagining interaction with a computer system requires a technical understanding of the evolving abilities and limitations of computer systems .
Domain experts rarely have that knowledge . *
Domain experts do n’t talk computer .
They talk in domain .
Domain problems , processes , challenges , and trajectory of change ( in the domain field ) .
Successful systems start in the domain .
That is the ground - zero of a software system .
Building on ground zero produces a curious side effect .
By nature domain understanding does not lead to specification .
Understanding suggests design .
A very important part of design is limits .
When design is allowed to bubble up from understanding it ’s easy to put the limit of the design into places that are logical for the domain .
In contrast to design , requirement definition is limitless .
The requirements gathering process typically goes on until someone says “ I think we ’ve got enough now ” .
That arbitrary stopping point becomes a design limit and hobbles further system development .**
The solution is to write the requirements after the design is created so that the scope will be defined .
If a design is new it ’s often a good idea to write a little code to prove the design will work before investing in the requirements .
I have n’t done a scientific survey to prove this , but my guess is that the design of almost every great new invention was created long before any sort of specification / requirement document was written — if there ever was one .
It also seems that great designers are almost always people who have a deep understanding of the domain as well as being excellent technologists .
Now that I ’ve trashed on requirements some of you are probably getting fired up in their defense .
At least I hope so because a requirements documents is one of the most useful tools in the software engineer ’s tool belt .
One of the most important things Software Engineers can do is communicate proposed designs / changes with key stakeholders before heavy investments in development are made .
Requirements give stakeholders the chance to review changes and catch misunderstandings .
It also gives them a chance to plan for their future .
Changes in software systems are disruptive and giving stakeholders the tools to coordinate change is important .
I do n’t know of any tool that does this better than a requirements document .
In Summary :
Understand the domain Define the design ( rough draft )
Prove the design works ( prototype / mock - up / stubbed out , etc ) Write requirements Write code ( Iterate 1 - 5 as needed )
The Myth reversed : Never write requirements until you ’ve designed your system and written some code .
* I have found use cases to be somewhat useful for explaining existing systems to technical / managerial people , but it ’s too clunky and abstract for much more .
** If the requirements first method is used for maintenance patches the problem of arbitrary design limits compounds .

The government of Indonesia is preparing to do mass relocation ’s of people living on islands considered vulnerable to rising sea levels over the next three decades .
Experts and Government officials fear that about 2,000 islands across the country will be underwater by between 2030 and 2040 due to rising sea levels caused by global warming .
Indonesia has over 17,000 islands , of which , about 6,000 are populated .[ social_buttons ]
“ We have formed a technical team who will identify the islands which could sink , “ Maritime and Fisheries Minister Freddy Numberi told the International Round - table Meeting of World Ocean Conference here Thursday .
He went on to add “ The government has prepared a contingency plan , which includes relocation of residents off the islands . ”
Freddy said the islands were located in Sumatra , Kalimantan , Sulawesi and Papua , and called on the international community to join forces in anticipating the disaster that would affect the whole world .
“ Indonesia will only see small islands disappear , but there will be a country that is at risk of completely sinking due to the rising sea levels .
Therefore , all countries must take this issue seriously . ”
Riau Governor Ismeth Abdullah said the sea level increases were the result of global warming and would affect uninhabited islands in the province in the long run .
Local fisherman are already feeling the pinch from climate change , he added .
“ Climate change has cut the fishermen ’s income because many fish are now gone , ” Ismeth said .
His administration has promoted mangrove reforestation to deal with the increasing sea levels .
Experts , representatives of regional governments and maritime and fisheries institutes from 13 countries , including from Europe and Southeast Asia , attended the round - table meeting .
The forum is expected to help formulate the Manado Declaration , which will cap the World Ocean Conference on May 11 - 15 , 2009 in the North Sulawesi capital .
The declaration will provide a reference of global maritime development and conservation .

The campaign of Charlotte Dennett is gathering steam in Vermont .
Please call anyone you know in Vermont and TELL THEM TO VOTE FOR CHARLOTTE DENNETT ON TUESDAY !
To help go to CharDennett.org
Vermont Attorney General challenger Charlotte Dennett and famous prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi reiterated that the state of Vermont would have clear jurisdiction in the prosecution of George Bush for the deaths of Vermont soldiers in Iraq .
In the Community Room of the Fletcher Free Library in Burlington on Oct. 24 , before a lively audience , Dennett and Bugliosi contended that the " effects " principle of the law gave state prosecutors jurisdiction if it could be shown that a crime which occurred outside the territorial jurisdiction of the state had a harmful effect on the people of the state .
Vermont has the highest per capita loss of soldiers in Iraq of any state in the nation .
Bugliosi also argued , in response to a question from the audience , that the issue was not whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , but whether it was an imminent threat to the security of the United States .
" If the possession of weapons of mass destruction were the issue , we'd be attacking Pakistan or China or former republics of the Soviet Union .
What 's missing is that Saddam Hussein was not a jihadist .
He loved life and wanted to live , and attacking the United States would mean certain death .
He never would have attacked the United States because that would be suicide . "
Buugliosi went on to say : " They found him in a spider hole begging " do n't shoot , " he slept in a different bed every night .
Every conclusion by intelligence agencies that Saddam was not an imminent threat , in the report used to persuade Congress and the America people to go to war , was completely deleted by the White House . "
In answer to a suggestion by a member of the audience that Congress must be prosecuted as well , because it also consented to the war , Bugliosi disagreed .
He said that since the evidence presented to Congress was fraudulent , that consent was obtained on a fraudulent basis , and therefore not valid .
" Show me a congressman who knew , at the time that Bush was lying , that he knew Bush was lying , then sure , he could be prosecuted too , " said Bugliosi .
Dennett and Bugliosi have been traveling the state together in Dennett 's campaign to unseat Attorney General William Sorrell .
Dennett is also campaigning on a pledge to vigorously oppose the re-licensing of Vermont Yankee , the problem - riddled nuclear power plant which she contends has given many warning signs that it should be closed .
" A collapsed cooling tower , a radiation leak which caused the evacuation of workers , it goes on and on .
How many warnings do we need ? "
Dennett has said on numerous occasions .
" Not only have they not closed it , the state actually allowed it to increase its radiation output by 20 percent . "
Dennett favors the long - term development of alternative energy sources which at same time help create jobs to replace those lost by the closing of Vermont Yankee , which is scheduled for re-licensing in 2012 .
Dennett says that one of her first acts as attorney general , if elected , would be to appoint Bugliosi as Special Prosecutor against Bush .
As a Los Angeles District Attorney , Bugliosi successfully prosecuted 105 out of 106 felony jury trials , including 21 murder convictions without a loss .
He is best known for prosecuting Charles Manson .
At the library event , Bugliosi quoted President Calvin Coolidge , who said : " If the spirit of liberty should vanish in other parts of the Union and support of our institutions should languish , it could all be replenished from the generous store held by the people of this brave little state of Vermont . "

Norway has done the most to close the gender gap , says the WEF Norway has topped a league of countries in closing the gender gap , followed by three other Nordic nations , a survey by the World Economic Forum says .
Progress in political , education and economic spheres has occurred globally but the gap in health has widened .
The UK fell in the ranking while France rose helped by women 's political role .
The forum said more women at the top of financial institutions and government and was " vital " to finding solutions to the economic turmoil .
" Greater representation of women in senior leadership positions within governments and financial institutions is vital not only to find solutions to the current economic turmoil but to stave off such crises in future , " said Klaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman of the forum .

Norway rose from third to first place and scored 82.45 % in the table of 130 countries , denoting the percentage of the gap between women and men that has been closed to date .
Finland , Sweden and Iceland came second , third and fourth respectively .
Last year , Sweden came top of the index .
The UK came 13th and slipped from 11th place last year while France was among those countries whose ranking rose sharply , from 51st to 15th place helped by gains in economic participation and political empowerment .
Syria , Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia all fell in the ranking and showed a drop in overall scores .
Progress in closing the gap is not only " possible " but can be achieved in a relatively short space of time said the forum .
The index surveyed economic participation , educational attainment , political empowerment and health and survival .

The report provides some evidence on the link between the gender gap and the economic performance of countries .
" Our work shows a strong correlation between competitiveness and the gender gap scores " .
" While this does not imply causality , the possible theoretical underpinnings of this link are clear : countries that do not fully capitalize effectively on one - half of their human resources run the risk of undermining their competitive potential " .
The survey stems from a collaboration of individuals of Harvard University , the University of California , Berkeley and the World Economic Forum .

The unearthing of three 220 m - year - old fossils in China has solved the enduring mystery of how the turtle got its shell .
The ancient remains are the first evidence palaeontologists have of a species of turtle that is in the process of evolving a shell , revealing for the first time how it happened .
Fossil hunters uncovered the remains of three remarkably intact adults in Guizhou province last year .
Each has characteristics that have never been seen in turtles before , including teeth and an incomplete upper shell , according to a report in the journal Nature .
Turtles have had complete shells since the time of the dinosaurs .
Before the latest find , the oldest known turtle fossil was a specimen unearthed in Germany dated to 210 m years ago .
That creature , named Proganochelys , did not shed light on the evolution of shells because its was already fully formed .
Scientists have been divided on how the turtle shell evolved , with some arguing that it developed from bony plates on the skin that broadened to form a kind of armour before fusing to the underlying ribs and backbone .
Modern reptiles such as crocodiles have bony plates , called osteoderms , a feature also seen in some dinosaurs , including the ankylosaurs .
Artist 's impression of the ancestral turtle Odontochelys with its armoured belly and soft top .

The latest fossil , named Odontochelys semitestacea – meaning " toothed , half - shelled turtle " – proves that shells formed in two stages .
First the underside of the shell , called the plastron , developed , then the ribs and backbone grew out to form the upper shell or carapace .
Odontochelys has a fully formed plastron but only a partial upper shell extending from its widened ribs and backbone .
" Now we have these fossils of the earliest known turtle .
They support the theory that the shell would have formed from below as extensions of the backbone and ribs , rather than as bony plates from the skin as others have theorised , " said Xiao - chun Wu at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa .
Dr Wu's student and lead author of the report , Chun Li of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing , discovered the fossils in Guizhou province with the help of local farmers .
Detailed inspection of the fossils suggests that Odontochelys was an aquatic animal .
The lower shell is one clue , as it would have protected the turtle from predators below as it swam .
The remains of other marine reptiles and invertebrates were found in the same rock formations .
" Reptiles living on the land have their bellies close to the ground with little exposure to danger , " said Olivier Rieppel , head of geology at The Field Museum in Chicago .
" This animal tells people to forget about turtle ancestors covered with osteoderms . "
Denver Plane Crash Injures 38 ( Photos , Video )
Continental Airlines Flight 1404 skidded off the runway at Denver International Airport and caught fire , injuries dozens of passengers .
The flight was bound for Houston and was taking off at 6:20 p.m. on Saturday night .
The Boeing 737 veered off course about 2000 feet from the end of the runway and came to rest in a ravine about 200 yards from the runway according to Patrick Hynes of the Denver Fire Department , who said the plane was on fire with its wheels sheared off .
Hynes described it as a surreal scene when they pulled up , with " heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft , all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft , people evacuating and walking up the hillside toward firefighters .
The cabin area was on fire , with significant fire damage to the overhead luggage compartments , which melted and dropped down onto the seats . "
Only one of the 38 people taken to area hospitals was in serious condition .
Fractures and bruises were the chief complaints , with no fatalities or critical injuries reported , according to Denver International Airport manager of aviation Kim Day .
The plane carried 112 people including five crew members .
A section of the airport will remain closed into Sunday .
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board is now on the scene and will begin their task of determining the cause of the accident .

S.F. nonprofit feeds hunger for computer basics

Unemployed machinist Chris Vincent has no experience with computers , he says - unless you count Nintendo .
But Vincent , 43 , knew that looking for a job these days is difficult enough without having at least some basic computer skill .
So he turned to the St. Anthony Foundation 's new Tenderloin computer and job training center earlier this month .
" You used to be able to look at ( want ads ) in the newspapers .
Now you can pull up Craigslist and find a job .
It 's like the ( difference between ) the Flintstones and the Jetsons . "
Best known for serving meals to the needy for the past 58 years , the San Francisco nonprofit has started feeding a new hunger among low - income Tenderloin area residents : for personal technology training .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The new Employment Program and Tech Lab opened Oct. 3 as a one - stop center offering free training and Internet access for people with little or no access to a computer .
The center , which has 37 computers , provides basic classes in Microsoft Word , Excel , e-mail and navigating the Web .
It also offers training in how to create cover letters and resumes .
Within a few days , the training classes were filled and the computer drop - in center , where clients can check e-mail and search sites like Craigslist or Monster.com for jobs , became constantly packed , said Karl Robillard , the center 's program manager .
" Having access to a computer is no longer a luxury for people , it 's a necessity .
And if you do n't have the basic skills to do that , your opportunities for employment are seriously limited , " Robillard said .
The program becomes even more important with the economy floundering .
The unemployment ranks are rapidly swelling with tech - savvy workers , which adds competition for jobs .
" We have people who 've applied for 20 - hour , part - time , entry - level positions and have been told there was over a hundred applicants for one position , " Robillard said .
" That 's unheard of . "
The facility , housed on the third floor of St. Anthony 's new Social Services Center at 150 Golden Gate Ave. , merges the decade - old S.F. Network Ministries Computer Training Center on Eddy Street with St. Anthony 's Employment Program and Learning Center .
The new lab emphasizes learning computer skills to train for jobs , even those not directly in high - tech fields .
" Even some security jobs , which traditionally have always been for people without any technical computer literacy , and a lot of fast - food jobs require you to have basic computer skills , even just clocking in , clocking out , using the registers , " Robillard said .
Some clients are men and women who have jobs that require physical labor , such as warehousing and construction , but are seeking new computer skills because as they get older , their bodies can no longer keep up with the physical demands , Robillard said .
Many of the tech center 's clients are " essentially computer illiterate , " he said .
" If you were to say to them , ' Get on Yahoo and send me an e-mail , ' 86 percent of the people who come in here do not have an e-mail account .
That 's a significant barrier to employment .
" They do n't have the concept that the Internet does n't exist in your computer , that it 's a more free - form , universal way of communicating , " he said .
" It 's a very interesting gap in the digital divide , because young people today are being raised with technology in a way that it 's almost inherent to what they do .
( Then ) you have a significant population of people 40 or over and they have had virtually no contact with a computer even up until now . "
As a carpenter , Elijah Haynesworth , 50 , is used to pounding nails into wood .
But pounding out the " A " and " E " keys on a keyboard was another matter .
" I feel like my fingers are all over the place , so it 's kind of hard , " Haynesworth said as he tried to save animated bugs on the popular Mavis Beacon typing tutorial .
The South of Market resident enrolled in a basic computer class at St. Anthony 's to reduce his reliance on construction work , which slows in economic downturns .
" For things like job applications , most places , they 're not accepting applications by paper anymore , " he said .
" They 're doing it through the Internet .
Up until now , I was angry , because the only thing I know how to do is put it on paper .
Since I 've been in this class , I 've been really thinking about getting in there and upgrading my resume because I can do it now . "
Truck driver Jarrett Nash , 61 , dropped out of the workforce when his wife , Cynthia , died suddenly four years ago .
When he was ready to get back into the job market , he learned that the computer skills he lacked had become essential .
In the past , Nash said , " most of the jobs I got were from the newspaper , and you do n't see them in there anymore .
All of a sudden , everybody was saying , you have to go online . "
Now , Nash has his own e-mail account and has learned how to post his resume online .
" I give kudos to this place big time , " Nash said .
" I do n't have a computer at home , so I can come in here and check my e-mail and send out resumes and send out applications . "
A $ 1 million software grant from Microsoft Corp. helped fund the center .
The foundation also received help from a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who wished to remain anonymous .
He sent a shipment of flat - panel monitors .
The program also offers classes in Web design and A+ certification , the computer industry standard for entry - level technicians .
St. Anthony 's plans to expand the number of computer classes to meet the demand , but needs volunteers to teach them , Robillard said .
Michael Dallas Wilson
Finch , 43 , has been out of work since last year and is homeless .
He relies on computers in the lab 's 17 - station drop - in center or at the public library to check e-mail and job postings on Monster.com .
Even with the current economic turmoil , the former Internal Revenue Service employee remains confident that there are better times ahead .
" They probably will have more jobs in the long run after everything subsides , " Finch said .
" I really believe in that .
And the more jobs that are going to come up are going to come up through the Internet .
I believe that 's the future . "
The Employment Program and Tech Lab is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays except Wednesdays , when it closes at noon .

There are those among the Peak Oil community who suspect that we could be facing a failure of our interdependent society that may be sudden , profound , and complete .
I have repeatedly said that I am not numbered among them .
My opinion is that our way of life will have to change significantly , but slowly .
I do n’t expect to be clubbing anybody with a femur in any foreseeable future .
This opinion is on record in both print and electronic media , and I do n’t expect to be issuing a retraction any time soon -- but a recent event forced me to admit that I may have to hedge a little .
This is an updated story that originally ran in January 2008 .
David Clarke 's warnings about the risks of failure in highly connected systems have proved to be prescient in light of recent events - Big Gav .
Our internal network here has been having problems .
My email ( and more importantly my access to TOD ) has been very unreliable over the last two days .
The network regularly flicked from " working " to " failed " in the blink of an eye .
I was reminded that the speed of collapse in a network is often a function of the natural frequency ( speed ) of the network , while the breadth of failure depends on a number of factors , including load and the degree of interdependence within the network .
The problem was eventually traced to a problem with one piece of software on one machine on our intranet .
The software drivers for the network interface card on one machine were corrupt .
This raised a question in my mind :
The Internet Protocol was originally designed to be a robust , reliable , redundant system .
How does one piece of software on one machine bring down a network with thousands of nodes ?
The answer is easy : Cost efficiencies .
Our Intranet network could have been built to be reliable , but instead it was built to be " efficient " .
Far from being a network of fail - safe systems , our network is a network of interdependencies .
When the system was loaded , a single failure brought the whole system down .
" Business Efficiency " has brought our network to its knees for two consecutive days .
I have seen this pattern a lot recently .
Last year the power went out in my city .
The power transmission system was heavily loaded one afternoon , when a single failure brought the whole system down .
Academics have studied failures of complex systems with interesting results .
One of the experiments they did will be familiar to anyone who has ever played with sand - castles as a child .
Build a sand pile by gradually adding grains of sand .
After a while , avalanches start to run down your pile .
Sometimes they are minor , while other times they affect the whole pile .
There is seemingly no way to reliably predict the outcome .
However Per Bak , in his book “ How Nature Works , ” shows that there is an instructive way to look at this question .
There is a critical angle for piles of sand - - a level of steepness that the slope cannot go beyond without sand starting to roll down the slope .
Imagine that , as you add sand , you colour red all of the areas of the pile that achieve this critical angle ( and are thus on the verge of an avalanche ) .
You will notice that the red patches appear as tendrils running down the side of the pile .
As you add sand to the pile it gets higher and wider – the pile gets steeper and more little tendrils of red appear .
Eventually you will see the tendrils of red start to interconnect .
If you drop a grain of sand on a red area then you will precipitate an avalanche .
If the red area is interconnected with other red areas then all these areas will be drawn into the avalanche .
If the red area is isolated , then the avalanche will be confined to one red tendril running down the side of the pile .
This basic principal can be applied to my network problem .
If one route on the network gets loaded to capacity ( i.e. turns red ) , the system detects that it has reached maximum capacity , and it delays traffic ( piles it higher ) or switches traffic to other routes ( spreads wider ) .
If the other routes were new , unloaded and redundant parts of the network , then this would not be a problem .
But they are not .
The other routes are simply other parts of the old , heavily loaded network .
Pretty soon all routes are red , and they are all interconnected .
So when one part of the network fails , it passes the traffic to another part of the network , which fails and your avalanche starts .
With all networks connected , all of them are vulnerable and all fail .
Our network operates at electronic speeds , and it failed with the same rapidity .
Understanding how this happened is critically important .
There are four parts to creating the complete meltdown of a network :
1. Create a network by building connections between systems .
2 . When a particular part of the network approaches overload ( goes red ) , recognise that this is happening and use the connections you have created to allow you to switch load to another part of the network .
3 . Continue doing this until all areas are red .
4 . Now add more load .
When we poured sand on our sand pile we allowed the sand to fall randomly , and thus the avalanches seemed random .
But once we had the ability to monitor ( see our potential “ avalanche ” areas coloured red ) , we were able to carefully divert the sand into other areas .
This delays the avalanche , but in the long run the avalanche is going to be much worse , because it will occur when all areas are red .
In summary :
The ability to measure and monitor the system gives us the capacity to avoid small avalanches in individual areas .
However , if we keep adding load without adding capacity we overload the entire network and thus make an all - encompassing avalanche inevitable .
If we ca n’t add capacity , then it would have been better to allow a series of small avalanches .
A look at the financial markets at the moment might illustrate the same point .
When we look at the “ sub - prime ” issues that are emerging , we see that the market created a series of “ Investment Vehicles ” that allowed risk to be shared .
A complex network of interdependencies was created to share this risk , but capacity was not added to deal with the possibility of default .
The various institutions that bought these “ Investment Vehicles ” thought they were buying assets , not debts .
The institutions failed to recognise that they needed to add “ capacity ” in the form of liquidity equal to the possible value of defaults on this debt .
As a result , now that load is being applied ( in the form of defaults ) it threatens to bring down the entire network , rather than just the single “ node ” that originated the debt .
[ Update , October 2008 : In view of what has happened since I wrote this piece in January I should probably mention that , in my view , the natural frequency for the cascading failure of the economic system is quite variable .
We have electronically linked systems in some areas , while other areas rely on lawyers and accountants laboriously unwinding CDS and other derivatives by hand .
The variability means that contrary to what I was hearing yesterday , this cascade is far from finished .
It is also worth noting that a crash can happen in a fast system , but you may not feel it until it has propagated through a slow system , if these systems exist as part of a chain .
For example , credit systems can lock up quite quickly , but you may not feel it until the effects have propagated through transport systems .
When credit is unavailable , resellers cannot buy items ( such as grain ) , so it does not go on ships , and does not get delivered -- but it will be weeks before you notice the delivery failure .
( Baltic Dry is an indicator of shipping rates .
As I write this , the Baltic Dry Index is down about 80 % .
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=bdiy&exch=IND&x=15&y=11
-- and we are starting to feel the effects of this downturn . )
The speed of impact of a cascading failure is often limited by the natural frequency of the slowest link . ]
The critical concept is that monitoring and networking the system allows us to go right up to the edge of disaster , and then move load to another part of the network until it , too , is on the edge of disaster .
Now that the networking effects have been discussed , I would like to push the analogy a bit further and look at how this plays out from a Peak Oil perspective .
Several years ago , sweet light crude oil started getting a bit more difficult to obtain .
In response , we stopped talking about “ oil ” and started talking about “ liquids ” .
The word “ liquids ” covers Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) , ethanol , heavy oils , tar sands , and an increasing number of other oil - substitutes .
Essentially the part of the network called “ Sweet Light Crude ” turned red , so we started connecting the " Oil Network " to other networks .
We connected oil to the “ food ” network by turning food into ethanol .
Actually food was already connected because you need oil to make food in the modern world , but now the circle is complete - – previously we used oil to create food , and now we use food ( corn , sugar , palm oil , etc ) to create oil ( or oil - substitutes ) .
Adding LNG and CTL ( Coal - To - Liquid ) to the network connects oil to other energy sources .
As this connection strengthens and load starts to be applied , a shortage of any of these sources would have an impact in each of the other sources .
To some extent , this has already started to occur .
Adding tar sands and various other oil substitutes to the network has made a surprising connection between the environment and oil .
This connection takes many forms , but the most interesting lies in the fact that oil substitutes are less efficient than light sweet crude - –much more CO2 is produced for any given amount of work done .
This connection is emerging , and could have interesting repercussions .
The problem applies to virtually all the oil - substitutes , so the widespread adoption of substitutes ( particularly CTL and tar sands ) might cause an environmental disaster which in turn would suppress ethanol production and create knock - on effects in other parts of the network .
The financial system has an important role to play in this network .
If energy , food and the environment can be considered three portions of the network , then our financial system can be considered to be both a form of network monitoring , and the communication medium that the network uses to pass signals around .
Consider the financial system to be similar to the blue cable running out the back of your computer .
Your computer ’s blue cable is n’t likely to run hot , but our finance system is a network of networks , and it is glowing red .
In addition to monitoring and communication , the financial system provides support for maintenance and upgrades of the energy systems , so capacity in the financial system is critical .
When one part of the network develops a problem ( say production of LNG suddenly drops ) , then messages get sent via the financial system ( in the form of increased prices ) , and the other parts of the system accept the load , if they can , by increasing production .
When compared to an Internet Protocol network there are many faults in this system .
High latency leads to slow responses .
Poor monitoring leads to conflicting signals or a failure to detect faults .
Bad messages are often not corrected , leading to incorrect responses , and so on .
The speed of a crash
The interesting point to note is that increasing demand past capacity will not immediately “ crash ” this system .
Oil facilities that are working at capacity will not “ crash ” if demand exceeds the capacity , they will simply continue working at capacity .
The crash may come , but it will come because demand heats up the financial system and crashes other systems that depend on finances .
Since the oil production system is dependent on other systems , this could conceivably cause an eventual crash .
Eventually lack of maintenance will degrade the capacity , but this is a process that occurs over a period of months or years .
Likewise , the process of adding capacity is exceptionally slow .
Building CTL or NGL plants takes the best part of a decade .
The oil production system can certainly crash , but it would be a crash in slow motion .
The only part of the system that can crash quickly is the financial system .
The financial system provides monitoring , communication , maintenance and upgrades .
So a profound , complete crash in this area could conceivably bring down the whole network .
However , could such a financial crash occur ?
An immediate halt to oil production would require a crash far more profound than the Great Depression .
The response speed of our financial system has been improved by linking many of the sub - systems electronically , but there are still a number of choke points , circuit breakers , and sanity checks .
The Great Depression emerged over a period of months or years .
Even with the electronic linkages in place today , a complete breakdown of our financial institutions is unlikely to happen overnight .
If this system crashes overnight , it will be because the plug got pulled - –a breakdown of society external to the system .
The natural frequency for events in the oil and oil - substitute network is in the range of months at least , or more likely years .
Internal stresses cannot cause it to crash overnight .
The Breadth of a crash
The breadth of the crash depends on the degree of linkage and the degree to which each part of the network is loaded .
This is where I start to worry .
Oil appears to be at or near peak capacity -- exports are dropping .
As for the food network -- world grain reserves are at historic lows , and expected to drop a little more next year .
And the environment ?
Climate change is clearly with us , indicating that the environment has already gone past its capacity .
When looked at in these terms it appears that the network is already in decline .
Each of these three parts of the network is at or past capacity .
If a span of years is the natural time - frame for a crash in this system , then it seems quite plausible that we are watching a very broad - based crash of our energy systems -- right now .
Our actions in increasing the connections to the food and environment networks will not help , and may simply speed the crash .
The signals indicating the start of a crash would be seen in the monitoring and communication system– - the financial systems .
Prices for oil would go up .
Which we have seen ....
Prices for food would go up .
Which we have seen ....
We might expect perturbations , volatility , and attempts to “ price ” the environment ....
Hmmmm .
Conclusion
I am forced to concede that a broad - based collapse is a possibility .
I still maintain that a sudden collapse is unlikely , but if it is already happening , then it could certainly look sudden when we eventually notice it .
[ Update , October 2008 : I am still hoping to avoid a sudden , broad - based collapse .
Some factors look like they will contribute , while others will mitigate .
In many cases , the pace cannot proceed faster than the slowest system in the dependancy chain .
In monitoring this situation , look for dependancy connections between systems , and then ask yourself what the natural frequency of the slowest system in the chain is . ]

Soldier Under Investigation for Reportedly Encouraging , Taping Toddler Fight A man is being investigated for reportedly taping fight and posting it online .
Nov. 18 , 2008  --
A video that apparently shows two toddlers fighting as an adult eggs them on has sparked an investigation that may cost a father custody of his child .
The video , which went viral on the Internet before being pulled , has left Alicia Scheideger , the mother of one of the children , devastated .
" I was horrified .
It 's a baby cockfight — just like somebody put two animals up to fight each other , " Scheideger said .
What the Video Shows
Scheideger 's ex-husband , a Fort Bragg special operations soldier who had custody of the boy , reportedly filmed the altercation between his son and an unidentified , unrelated boy .
It 's believed to be his voice on the video encouraging the children to continue fighting .
" Go hit him back .
I do n't care , " a voice is heard on the tape , which was filmed several weeks ago .
The tape shows one boy slapping and punching another who is crying hysterically and trying to cover himself up .
During the altercation , one boy tries to crawl away but the other boy gets on top of him and continues hitting .
At one point an older boy , reportedly a brother of one of the children , apparently tries to intervene and break up the altercation , but he 's picked up and removed from the situation as the two toddlers continue to battle .
Two minutes later , the fight ends .
" He 's done .
No more .
It 's bleeding , " a man said on the tape .
The Investigation
When Scheideger learned of the video , she contacted child protective services and military police .
Both are now investigating .
Scheideger say her son was removed from her ex-husband 's home at Fort Bragg and was placed with a relative .
" My ex-husband told me that they had been fighting for two days and they finally just decided to let them have at it and just not stop them , " Scheideger told ABC News ' Raleigh - Durham , N.C. affiliate WTVD - TV .
" They actually encouraged the fight and tell them to keep going . "
The Army released a statement to WTVD - TV about the video .
" The behavior displayed by the parents in the video is neither condoned nor indicative of soldiers in this command or the Army , " the statement read .
" The command takes very seriously the health and welfare of all service members and their families .
This command will take the appropriate actions as required and will continue to cooperate with civilian agencies . "
Scheideger said she cried when she saw the footage .
" I mean , I 'm their mom and I 've been told by a friend that if I did n't know the kids , or it was n't my kids , I 'd think it was funny and I do n't , I think it 's horrible , " she said .
" As a parent you stop it , you do n't let it continue and you especially do n't let your kid get hurt . "
One child psychologist agreed .
" It 's certainly not appropriate , " said Dr. Richard Gallagher .
" Kids turn to their parents to protect them . "
Gallagher added that the adult 's apparent encouragement was n't beneficial .
" That 's just a dad teaching kids to be bullies .
Even with adults we have rules about boxing .
They have to be the same size and weight , " he said .
Unfortunately , Gallagher said , this is not the first time video of children fighting has ended up on the Internet .
" I do n't think that the boys should be somewhere where they 're taught that it 's OK to fight like that .
I do n't think it 's OK for them to be around someone who thinks that this is a funny issue , it 's not , " Scheideger said .

Where Robot Cars ( Robocars ) Can Really Take Us
Where Robot Cars ( Robocars ) Can Really Take Us
Or how computer geeks can enable the electric car , save the planet and millions of lives using near - term A.I. to make taxis and trucks deliver , park , recharge and drive themselves .
For the lastest news and updates , check out my Robocars Blog .
Many of the essays on this site were written 10 years ago but are still mostly accurate today -- but they could use some updating .
The dream of cars that drive themselves -- robocars -- has existed for decades .
In the 2000s it got kickstarted , and the 2010s saw rapid development by scores of major players .
Now the 2020s will see commercial deployment .
It 's not science - fiction any more .
The technology behind this is fascinating , but even more interesting are other questions that surround the robot car future .
Those issues include :
The staggering numbers that make it necessary and inevitable .
How we might get past the social and legal barriers .
How it will change energy , pollution , cities , transit , war , work , real estate and manufacturing -- and yes , cars .
I 'll tell you why and how robocars can deal with much of this , and paint you a " roadmap " to this future .
I 'll reveal why a number of the most interesting robocar boons come from things they can do when there 's nobody inside .
But I want to start you with some amazingly huge numbers , so large they seem almost absurd .
Nonetheless , I believe that robocars could , in the USA alone , per year , enable savings like these :
33,000 lives and a million injuries ( NIH ) .
Mostly young people , for whom car accidents are the leading cause of death among major categories .
Over a million lives / year around the world .

A serious reduction in the urban land devoted to the ~600 million parking spaces , estimated to be up to 10 % of urban land in many cities .
Now multiply that by 5 to get figures for the whole planet .
If that 's not enough to get you going , I am not sure what is .
I calculate that the human race drives around 1.7 light years every year .
Yes , together we 're going faster than light .
Executive Summary
They 're here : Robot cars ( Robocars ) are operating in pilot projects already , and will go into commercial deployment in the 2020s .
There 's a path to get us there .
Robocars make computers the most important part of cars , and bring the Moore 's - law acceleration to transportation .
Google 's robocars have aready gone over 10 million miles ( 2018 ) on regular roads , operated with no human supervision in special cases and today drive a special set of members of the public around the Phoenix area .
And almost all automakers , and suppliers , plus many tech companies and startups are in the game , with many billions of dollars already invested .

Our brains are crammed with a massive amount of memories that we have formed over a lifetime of experiences .
These memories range from the profound ( who am I and how did I get here ? ) to the most trivial ( the license plate of the car at a stoplight ) .
Furthermore , our memories also vary considerably in their precision .
Parents , for instance , often know the perils of a fuzzy memory when shopping for a birthday gift for their child : remembering that their son wanted the G.I. Joe with Kung Fu Grip rather than the regular G.I .
Joe could make an enormous difference in how well the gift is received .
Thus , the “ fuzziness ” of our memory can often be just as important in our daily lives as being able to remember lots and lots of information in the first place .
Different Levels of Detail for Different Types of Memory ?
In the past several decades , cognitive psychologists have determined that there are two primary memory systems in the human mind : a short - term , or “ working , ” memory that temporarily holds information about just a few things that we are currently thinking about ; and a long - lasting memory that can hold massive amounts of information gained through a lifetime of thoughts and experiences .
These two memory systems are also thought to differ in the level of detail they provide : working memory provides sharp detail about the few things we are presently thinking about , whereas long - term memory provides a much fuzzier picture about lots of different things we have seen or experienced .
That is , although we can hold lots of things in long - term memory , the details of the memory are n’t always crystal - clear and are often limited to just the gist of what we saw or what happened .
A recently published study by Timothy F. Brady , a cognitive neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and colleagues suggests that these long - term memories may not be nearly as fuzzy as once thought , however .
In their work , the researchers asked subjects to try to remember 3,000 pictures of common objects — including items such as backpacks , remote controls and toasters — that were presented one at a time for just a few seconds each .
At the end of this viewing phase , the researchers tested subjects ’ memory for each object by showing them two objects and asking which one they had seen before .
Not surprisingly , subjects were exceptionally good ( more than 90 percent correct ) even though there were thousands of objects to remember .
This high success rate attests to the massive storage ability of long - term memory .
What was most surprising , however , was the amazing level of detail that the subjects had for all of these memories .
The subjects were just as good at telling the difference between two pictures of the same object even when the objects differed in an extremely subtle manner , such as a pair of toasters with slightly different slices of bread .
If It ’s Not Fuzzy , Why Do We Still Forget Things ?
This new work provides compelling evidence that the enormous amount of information we hold in long - term memory is not so uncertain after all .
It seems that we actually hold representations of things we ’ve seen in a fairly detailed and precise form .
Of course , this finding raises the obvious question : if our memories are n’t all that fuzzy , then why do we often forget the details of things we want to remember ?
One explanation is that , although the brain contains detailed representations of lots of different events and objects , we ca n’t always find that information when we want it .
As this study reveals , if we ’re shown an object , we can often be very accurate and precise at being able to say whether we ’ve seen it before .
If we ’re in a toy store and trying to remember what it was that our son wanted for his birthday , however , we need to be able to voluntarily search our memory for the right answer — without being prompted by a visual reminder .
It seems that it is this voluntary searching mechanism that ’s prone to interference and forgetfulness .
At least that ’s our story when we come home without the Kung Fu Grip G.I. Joe .

Daughter of chronic scam victim Jessica Looke
Jessica lost £ 50,000 to mass - marketed mailings
My mother Jessica died in October 2007 aged 83 .
For the last five years of her life she had been hounded by fraudsters from all over the world .
It all started when my mother replied to a very convincing letter telling her she had won a large amount of money and that she needed to send an administration fee to receive her prize .
Although her cheque never arrived that letter was quickly followed by dozens more , all were saying that there was money waiting to be dispatched , and all giving reasons why she had to send off more money .
As soon as I realised what she was doing I tried to stop her , but it was useless .
Relationship
The scammers started to build up a relationship with her and the hold they had over her was so strong .
It did n't take long before she started to send away all of her pension except for about £ 15 a week she would keep to live off
The letters ranged from looking really official to being very personal and friendly but they all had one thing in common , that they all gave a reason as to why her winnings were delayed .
Either the money was in a so - called holding company or some other fictitious place that needed her cash to release it .
My mother became more and more hooked as the amount of mail increased .
Some days she would receive around 30 letters a day .
It did n't take long before she started to send away all of her pension except for about £ 15 a week she would keep to live off .
The more I tried to persuade her that she was on a suckers list , the more we argued .
There was no way I could reason with her and although my mother and I were very close , these scammers started to tear us apart .
I could n't get her mail redirected without her consent and although I tried through every channel I could think of , nobody could help .
Prediction
As she continued to respond so called clairvoyants started to jump on the bandwagon , of course they also wanted money .
The situation strained the relationship between mother and daughter
The clairvoyants all knew she had " won " large amounts of money and they also knew she was " surrounded by bad luck " so they promised to remove this negative energy for a fee , and so it went on .
There would be times she would sit up until about 3 am struggling to read through the piles of what she started to call documents .
All this started to have an effect on both her physical and mental health .
At times she would telephone me in the early hours saying she had been threatened by firebombs from these evil beings if she did n't pay up .
I have recorded some of these phone calls .
I realised that she was also being plagued by phone calls and changed her phone number , but they soon found it again .
My mother must have put it on another bogus claim form .
Many times my mother would tell me she had stopped sending off her money .
But now have seen her bank books and spoken to the staff at the building society , I realised she had been doing it continually for five years .
Tragic Eventually at the beginning of August 2007 the scam mail took its toll and my mother was admitted to hospital .
Many of the letters swore her to secrecy or told her to read away from prying eyes
It was at this time that I took her building society pass book and forged her signature to get her mail redirected .
But it was too late , I knew she did n't have long to live so I decided to go along with her to stop the arguing .
It broke my heart but I even took her out in the wheelchair looking for things she could buy with her " winnings " .
My mother only came home for a short while and died on 24 October .
She still spoke about sharing the money between the family days before she died .
When clearing her house I removed about 30,000 letters all tightly knotted in carrier bags .
They were pushed in drawers and cupboards and her shed was full of them .
Many of the letters swore her to secrecy or told her to read away from prying eyes .
Some asked for passport photos saying they were for a winners magazine .
Others asked for personal information about the victim and family members in a quest to discover passwords or steal her identity .
Some were threatening .
It sickens me to think how my lovely mother was hounded and robbed of the last five years of her life .
Its easy for people to say " just throw this kind of mail in the bin " but because of her age my mother 's mind was not as sharp as others , and receiving this kind of mail started her to deteriorate mentally .
Although I could see this happening , without her cooperation I could n't get medical help .
The last five years of my mother 's life were a nightmare not only for her but for me as well .
That is why we need to raise awareness of this evil crime and stop this happening to the elderly and vulnerable people of our society .

Russia has begun delivering S - 300 air defense systems to Iran which could help repel any Israeli and US air strikes on its nuclear sites , the official IRNA news agency reported on Sunday .
Arms Deal Defense Ministry official in Russia to thwart sale of missiles to Iran Roni Sofer Amos Gilad trying to convince Moscow not to sell S - 300 anti-aircraft missiles to Tehran , Damascus , claiming it would disturb the balance of power in the Middle East Defense Ministry official in Russia to thwart sale of missiles to Iran
" After few years of talks with Russia ... now the S - 300 system is being delivered to Iran , " IRNA quoted Email Kosari , deputy head of parliament 's Foreign Affairs and National Security committee , as saying .
Kosari did not say when the deliveries began .
Iran 's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report .
Last week Amos Gilad , head of the Israeli Defense Ministry 's Security - Diplomatic Bureau , landed in Moscow to convey Israel 's opposition to the deal .
While in Russia , Gilad was also expected to address the possible sale of weapons to Syria and the flow of arms through Syria to Hizbullah terrorists in Lebanon .
The United States , its European allies and Israel say Iran is seeking to build nuclear arms under the cover of a civilian atomic energy program .
Iran denies the charge .
Israel 's insistence that Iran must not be allowed to develop an atomic bomb has fueled speculation that the Jewish state , widely assumed to have the Middle East 's only nuclear arsenal , could mount its own pre-emptive strikes .
' No capability to make nuclear weapons '
In October Russia 's Foreign Ministry denied media speculation that Moscow would sell the medium - range S-300 system , adding Moscow had no intention of selling weapons to " troubled regions . "
But Russia 's RIA news agency last week quoted " confidential sources " as saying that Russia was fulfilling a S - 300 contract with Iran .
The most advanced version of the S - 300 system can track targets and fire at aircraft 120 km ( 75 miles ) away .
It is known in the West as the SA - 20 .
Russian arms sales and nuclear cooperation with Iran have strained relations with Washington , which says Tehran could use them against their interests in the region and also against its neighbors .
Russia , building Iran 's first nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr , says Tehran does not have the capability to make nuclear weapons .
The Virginia Supreme Court has overturned a state antispam law and the 2004 conviction of longtime spammer Jeremy Jaynes , saying the law is an overly broad prohibition on anonymous free speech .
The Supreme Court , in a decision released Friday , said the 2003 Virginia spam law did n't distinguish between commercial e-mails and those with political messages , and thus was an overly broad prohibition on free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
Jaynes was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to nine years in prison for sending millions of unsolicited e-mail messages a day from his home in North Carolina .
He was the first person to be convicted of sending illegal spam in the U.S .
The Virginia spam law " prohibits the anonymous transmission of all unsolicited bulk e-mails including those containing political , religious or other speech protected by the First Amendment , " wrote Virginia Justice G. Steven Agee in the opinion .
The Virginia law allowed jail sentences for spammers if they altered e-mail headers or other routing information and attempted to send either 10,000 messages within a 24 - hour period or 100,000 in a 30 - day period .
The sender could also be prosecuted if a specific transmission generated more than US $ 1,000 in revenue , or if total transmissions generated $ 50,000 .
Jaynes ' prison sentence was longer than those of other prolific spammers convicted in recent years .
In July , " Spam King " Robert Soloway was sentenced to 47 months in prison after pleading guilty to fraud , spamming and tax evasion .
Virginia prosecutors argued the spam law was a trespass law focused on the e-mail servers of companies such as AOL and not a free speech law , but the Supreme Court rejected that argument .
The law 's prohibition against changing e-mail headers took away the ability of e-mail senders to be anonymous , the court said .
The court also drew a distinction between false and fraudulent header information , when prosecutors used those descriptions interchangeably .
False header information does n't necessarily mean the information is fraudulent , and false information is the only way to protect an e-mail sender 's right to be anonymous , the court said .
" Because e-mail transmission protocol requires entry of an IP [ Internet Protocol ] address and domain name for the sender , the only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name , " Agee wrote .
Ray Everett - Church , director of privacy and industry relations at e-mail marketing vendor Responsys and a critic of spammers , questioned the Virginia Supreme Court 's decision .
" I find their application of anonymous speech protections to be overly simplistic , " Everett - Church said .
" Jaynes was engaged in commercial speech , not political or religious speech , and as such the constitutionality of such restrictions are supposed to be judged at a different standard . "
The court suggested the Virginia law would outlaw the e-mail publication of the Federalist Papers , a series of articles advocating the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1787 - 88 , were they to be first published now .
Everett - Church dismissed the comparison of spam to those important historical documents .
" I get the sense that the court is suffering from a poor understanding of how anonymous speech works in the Internet age , " Everett - Church said .
" I find the court 's attempt to compare The Federalist Papers to the likes of penis enlargement e-mails not only wrong - headed but ultimately offensive to the reasons why we have a First Amendment . "
While the Supreme Court 's ruling overturns Jaynes ' conviction , it should have little impact nationwide , because the U.S. Congress passed its own spam law in late 2003 , said Jerry Cerasale , senior vice president of government affairs for the Direct Marketing Association , a trade group representing direct marketers .
In addition , DMA members have to follow the trade group 's own rules on sending commercial e-mail , Cerasale said .
" A legitimate marketing entity is not going to lie in the header because they want to sell you something , " he said .
The federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing ( CAN - SPAM )
Act allows Internet service providers to sue spammers and state attorneys general to sue on behalf of users .
CAN - SPAM includes a criminal penalty of up to a year in jail for sending commercial e-mail with false or misleading header information , plus criminal penalties , ranging up to five years in prison , for some common spamming practices , including hacking into someone else 's computer to send spam , registering five or more e-mail accounts using false information and using those accounts to send bulk spam .
The law allows multimillion - dollar fines for some spamming activities .

( CNN ) -- Cycling legend Lance Armstrong -- a survivor of testicular cancer -- and girlfriend Anna Hansen are expecting a baby , CNN learned on Tuesday through his charitable organization .
Cyclist Lance Armstrong has announced he will come out of retirement and race once again in the Tour de France .
The baby is due in June .
Armstrong was diagnosed in 1996 with testicular cancer that had spread to his brain , lungs and abdomen .
He underwent treatment for the disease and was able to return to cycling , eventually winning seven consecutive Tour de France's .
The harsh chemotherapy left him unable to have children , although he and then - wife Kristin Richards had three children using sperm the cyclist had donated before the treatment .
Armstrong and Hansen , however , are expecting without the use of any artificial fertilization process .
" This is a hopeful thing for testicular cancer survivors , " CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said .
" It means his body healed from the chemotherapy and surgery . "
Armstrong retired from cycling after his seventh Tour de France win in 2005 , and focused his energy on the Lance Armstrong Foundation ( livestrong.org ) , which supports people affected by cancer .
Armstrong founded the organization in 1997 .
The 37 - year - old Texan announced in September that he was launching a comeback with the goal of winning the Tour de France in 2009 .
" After talking with my children , my family and my closest friends , I have decided to return to professional cycling in order to raise awareness of the global cancer burden , " he wrote on LiveStrong 's Web site .
He is training for several races leading up to the Tour de France , including Australia 's Tour Down Under and the Giro d'Italia .

Friendly Fox anchor defends Bush from Nixon comparison Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday December 2 , 2008
Print This Email This
This weekend 's release of a new film examining the pivotal 1977 interviews that laid bare Richard Nixon 's stunning abuses of power will inevitably lead to much discussion of Nixon 's parallels to the current White House occupant .
Ron Howard , who directs Frost / Nixon , got an early jump on this comparison after a screening of the film in Washington this week .
President Bush himself was n't nearby to rebut the observation that his administration has been as power - hungry and corrupt as Nixon's , but he was not without a friendly voice in the crowd .
Fox News anchor Chris Wallace jumped to Bush 's defense , with the stunning observation that Bush 's abuses of power were all done in the name of national security , whereas Nixon merely lusted for power .
" Richard Nixon 's crimes were committed purely in the interest of his own political gain , " Mr. Wallace told Mr. Howard before an audience of a few hundred after viewing the filmmakers new film " Frost / Nixon , " which is about the only U.S. president to resign from office .
" I think to compare what Nixon did , and the abuses of power for pure political self preservation , to George W. Bush trying to protect this country  even if you disagree with rendition or waterboarding  it seems to me is both a gross misreading of history both then and now , " Mr. Wallace said .
As others have noted , the pantheon of Bush scandals is replete with examples that had nothing to do with national security -- for example , snubbing Congressional oversight , politicizing the justice department , refusing to ensure preservation of White House records and outing Valerie Plame , among others .
Wallace 's vigorous -- if misinformed -- defense of the president should come as little surprise .
When Bush appeared on Fox News Sunday in February , the exchange was anything - but the aggressive interrogation Wallace gave to Bill Clinton two years ago .
Wallace was all smiles and kid - glove treatment , trading gossip about the ongoing GOP primary , begging Bush to attack then - surging Democratic candidate Barack Obama , and giving the president every opportunity to rebut his liberal critics .
At one point , Wallace 's conservative - talking - point - infused defense of Bush 's war policies seemed to go too far even for the president .
WALLACE : I want to follow up on that .
Whether it is interrogation of terror prisoners or the intercepting of surveillance among al Qaeda members , are you ever puzzled by all of the concern in this country about protecting of rights of people who want to kill us ?
BUSH : That is an interesting way to put it .
I would n't necessarily define some of the critics of my policy that way .
I would say that they want to be very careful that we do n't overstep our bounds from protecting the civil liberties of Americans .
Frost / Nixon , which opens Friday , dramatizes the series of exchanges between the disgraced former president and British television personality David Frost .
The interviews , conducted over several weeks in the spring of 1977 , produced several revealing exchanges , including Nixon 's views on executive power .
" Well , when the president does it that means that it is not illegal , " Nixon told Frost in perhaps the most revelatory declaration of the interviews .
The interviews also caused Nixon to come to terms with his involvement in the Watergate burglary and subsequent cover - up , which ultimately led to his resignation before he could be impeached .
As viewers flock to the film , which is already receiving glowing reviews , a question likely to emerge is , Who will be David Frost to George W. Bush ?
One thing 's for certain , it wo n't be Chris Wallace .
A reader writes :
I work at a Florida county library where they 're holding the two - week Early Voting , and we 've had a long line of voters from opening until now , close to six hours .
Our sliding doors have been propped open .
At one point it went out into the parking lot , about 80 - 90 people deep .
We 've been tempted to go out to the line and say , " Guys , you can do this over the next two weeks !
There 's no real rush ! "
Deal is , we 've never seen lines like this before , definitely not for the actual election days in November ...
We 're guessing this year 's election is going to see massive turnouts .

CORNWALLIS , Nova Scotia ( Reuters ) -
The Pentagon is considering a plan to send more than 20,000 troops to Afghanistan over the next 12 to 18 months to help safeguard elections and quell rising Taliban violence , officials said on Friday .

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he and top commanders had discussed sending five brigades to Afghanistan , including four brigades of combat ground forces as well as an aviation brigade , which a defense official said would consist mainly of support troops .
An Army combat brigade has about 3,500 soldiers .
Gates said much of the infusion could take place before Afghanistan holds elections by next autumn .
“ I think it ’s important that we have a surge of forces before the election , ” said Gates , who stressed no decision on troop deployments had been taken .
“ We ’ve had some very preliminary discussions , ” he told reporters after meeting to discuss southern Afghanistan with his counterparts from NATO countries with troops deployed in the region .
Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said more support troops , also known as “ enablers , ” could also head to Afghanistan as Gates considers a request by U.S. Army Gen. David McKiernan , the top commander of NATO and U.S. forces in the country .
“ The commanders are looking for well north of 20,000 forces .
Gates wishes to fulfill the commanders ’ request , ” Morrell told reporters as the U.S. defense chief returned from Cornwallis .
Violence in Afghanistan has surged to the highest levels since the 2001 U.S. - led invasion toppled the country ’s Taliban government .
An Army combat brigade is already scheduled to arrive in eastern Afghanistan in January to begin training Afghan forces .
Most of the remaining forces , which could begin deploying as early as next spring , would likely head to poppy - growing southern Afghanistan where commanders say the NATO force of 18,000 troops is too small to contend with an increasingly confident Taliban insurgency .
There are now some 70,000 Western forces in Afghanistan , including 32,000 U.S. forces -- 14,500 under NATO command and 17,500 under a U.S. command .
‘ SURGE ’
Gates ’ use of the term “ surge ” to describe the influx drew parallels with the 2007 U.S. force build - up that placed an extra 30,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and contributed to a sharp decline in violence there .
“ The key is how do we reverse the trends of the last couple of years or so in terms of rising violence and create a better security environment in which economic and civic development can go ahead and take place , ” Gates said .
“ We are clearly going to be putting more troops in and I think that the prospects for being able to have these elections successfully are good , ” he said .
“ We all recognize the need for the Afghan government -- with our help -- to demonstrate some progress over the course of 2009 , ” he said .
Gates rejected speculation Afghanistan could be heading for a dire situation .
“ The notion that things are out of control in Afghanistan or that we ’re sliding toward a disaster I think is far too pessimistic , ” he said .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama says he wants to focus more on the Afghan war and plans to persuade other nations to send more soldiers .
But Canadian Defense Minister Peter MacKay said Obama should look to other NATO members first , rather than turning to the other seven states that took part in the Cornwallis meeting : Canada , Denmark , Britain , the Netherlands , Australia , Estonia and Romania .
“ The reality is there are other NATO doors that President - elect Obama should be knocking on first , ” he told the news conference .
Canada has long complained that the nations with troops in southern Afghanistan are bearing a disproportionate share of the military burden .
“ There is an enormous amount of goodwill that has been engendered by President - elect Obama that he might be willing to spend for a cause that he clearly believes in , ” said MacKay .
Many NATO countries insist on stationing their troops in quieter parts of Afghanistan and strictly limit what kind of combat activities they can carry out .

NetBeansPythonTutorial
Getting Started With Python in the NetBeans IDE 6.5
This tutorial shows Python developers how to work with Python in the NetBeans IDE 6.5 .
It covers how to set up which Python runtime you want to use , how to create a new project , how to edit files , and how to run your programs .
Use the NetBeans Python Editor for code completion , instant rename , quick fixes , catching unresolved or unused names , and import management .
NetBeans also supports an interactive console and a debugger for Python .
Projects
When you are working with a Python project in NetBeans , the first thing to do is to create a project .
The project keeps things organized and also keeps track of command line arguments , which Python runtime you are using , and other important data .
Setting Your Platform Runtime
Python support in NetBeans allows you to choose the version of Python used to run the Project .
Currently , NetBeans comes with Jython 2.5 ( alpha 3 ) pre-installed , but you can use any version of Python that is installed on your computer .
Let 's assume that you already have Python installed somewhere on your machine , and that you know in which directory Python is installed .
1. Choose Tools >
Python Platforms from the main menu .
The Python Platform Manager dialog appears .
In this dialog you create an entry for a version of Python ( you can see that there is already an entry for Jython ) , or you pick one of the existing version entries for your project .
You can also set a particular version as the default version for new Python projects .
2 . To create a new Python version entry , click New .
Type the path or browse to the location of the Python interpreter on your computer , and click Open .
The IDE displays your selection in the Command and Console Command fields of the dialog box .
You can edit these fields , and you can also supply any command line arguments to be passed to the interpreter .
The Python Path tab allows you to add additional Python libraries to your Python path .
The Java Path tab allows you to add new Java libraries to the Java classpath used by Jython .

Starting a new project
NetBeans uses projects as a way to keep all the files for a project organized , and the first thing that you need to do is create a project for your work .
To create a new project :
1. Choose File > New Project from the main menu .
The New Project wizard appears .
2 . If you want to start from scratch , select New Project .
Enter a project name and destination , and select the Python runtime you want to use to execute the project files .
Click Next
If you have existing Python files that you want to import into a project , select the Python Project with Existing Files option in the New Project wizard .
Click Next
3 . If you selected Python Project with Existing Files in the previous panel , specify the directory or directories of your existing Python files .
Click Finish .
Creating / adding files
Adding a new file is simple .
1 . Make sure that your project is selected , and then choose File > New File from the main menu .
2. Select either Empty Module or Executable Module .
NetBeans prepopulates the new file with common information .
Editing
Here are some of the major editing features of NetBeans IDE Python Early Access .
Code Completion
At any time when typing in the editor you can press Ctrl - Space , and the NetBeans IDE displays a list of possible completions .
You can do this in the middle of typing a word , and completions will be reduced to actual completions of what you have typed .
Use the arrow keys to scroll through the list of completions , and if you select a function , notice that the documentation of the function is also displayed .
Instant Rename
If you place your cursor before an identifier , NetBeans Python highlights all the related usages ( and the definition ) for that identifier .
You can rename all those usages instantly by typing Ctrl - R .
When you do this , a red box appears around the identifier where ever it is used and where it was defined .
As you type over the contents of the box , all the highlighted occurrences are updated as well .
QuickFix
NetBeans Python can point out areas where your code could be improved .
If it has such a suggestion , a yellow light bulb appears in the column just to the left of the code entry area .
Click the light bulb to get more details on the suggested improvement , and press Enter to execute the suggested fix .
Catching unresolved or unused names
The NetBeans IDE for Python makes it easy to see if you have a variable that is n't being used ( likely the result of a typo ) or have used a name that does n't exist ( ca n't be resolved - and also likely the result of a typo ) .
Both of these features need to be turned on , and you 'll find the settings in the Hints section of the Editor pane in the Options window .
To access the Options window , choose Tools >
Options in the main menu .
For unused variables , the preference is here :
The indicator resembles this .
The preference for unresolved names resembles this .
The indicator looks like this .
Import Management
Another really handy feature of the NetBeans IDE for Python is Import Management .
Place the cursor over a name , right - click , and choose Fast Import .
The IDE displays a list of all the modules that define that name .
Another useful feature is Fix Imports , which takes import statements
and cleans them up .
Running Programs
There are several ways to run your Python program .
One of these is to set one file as the main file for the project .
To do this :
1. Right - click the project node in the Projects window , and select Run .
2. Specify the name of the main file , along with any command line arguments that are to be passed to that file .
If you set your project to be the Main Project ( Run > Set Main Project > < your project name > ) , then you can run the main file by choosing Run > Main Project in the main menu , or by pressing F6 .
You can also right - click any file in the Projects window and choose Run File ( the shift - F6 key ) .
The output of your program appears in the Output window at the bottom of the IDE .
Interactive Console
NetBeans Python also provides you with access to the Python Interactive Console .
You can open the Interactive Console by choosing Window > Python Console from the main menu .
The Console window appears in the Output window at the bottom of the IDE .
You can then type Python code into the console to execute it .
You can also interrogate the state of the Python interpreter through this console .
Debugger
The NetBeans IDE for Python includes a Python source code debugger .
Jean - Yves Mengant , the author of the debugger has written an excellent tutorial .

" I can't understand why people are afraid of new ideas .
I 'm frightened of the old ones "
- John Cage
What 's up with Republicans and their love of stupid anyway ?
First Reagan , then George W. Bush , then Sarah Palin , and now Joe The Plumber .
Well , perhaps it has something to do with their constant state of fear .
Drugs , terrorists , hippies , immigrants , universal medical coverage , Muslims , gay marriage , science , God , teenagers having sex - is there anything these people are n't terrified of ?
And when they find an intelligence - challenged hero like Palin or this idiot plumber guy , they do n't just get behind them , they go absolutely nuts .
We 're talkin' a full - on lovefest with ignorance .
While just about every other democracy around the world is looking for leaders who are more intelligent than your average Joe , plumber or otherwise , a large segment of Americans seem to be constantly looking for a leader as stupid as they are : " Someone just like me . "
Yeah , Dubya might be more fun to have a beer with than , say , Kerry , but who the hell would want him running your country ?
While the rest of the world understandably expects elites to run things like , you know , the government , Republicans seem to despise elites , not only for their intelligence and education , but also for their competence and ability .
" Goddamn elites , think they 're so special just ' cause they know stuff .
I like Dubya ' cause he reminds me of my uncle Bubba , and my uncle Bubba 's one hell of a guy .
Heck , Uncle Bubba would be a better president than any of these college - educated communist elites and their gay - marryin ' friends .
Like to see any of them skin an elk as fast as good ol ' Uncle Bubba . "
Misplaced Terror
Furthermore , do you ever wonder why the most hardcore War On Terror supporters seem to all live in places like Mississippi , Alabama and Kansas ?
And do you ever feel confused as to why exactly they seem so scared ?
Do they seriously think terrorists are coming to get them in Jackson , Montgomery and Wichita ?
I mean , there has to be some sort of an explanation for this bizarre situation .
Mention any terrorist plot , either real of imagined , and these anti-terror Red Staters are all over one another trying to be the first to support a cut in civil liberties , the launching of a preemptive war , and / or a whole lot more Bible study classes in schools .
Meanwhile the majority of those living in places that are actual prime terrorist targets , such as Boston , L.A. , San Francisco and New York City , stay relatively calm and continue to fight for their civil liberties and against crap like the oxymoronically - named Patriot Act .
You 've Got That Right
Ok , so who am I to deny anyone the right to live in a constant state of terror , if that 's how they really want to live ?
But , still , you 've got to admit it 's more than just a bit ridiculous .
Huddled together in perpetual fear throughout states such as Alabama , Arkansas , Kentucky , Montana and Kansas are millions of people petrified that the terrorists could be coming for them at any moment , just as they knew the Communists were coming in decades past .
These people may not be able to find Canada on a map , let alone Afghanistan , but they sure as hell know what they know and what they know for sure is that the enemy of all civilization , aside from gay marriage of course , is definitely Islam .
Unwinnable Wars
But , if they really like waging unwinnable wars , perhaps they should go back to fighting the War On Gays and the War On Drugs instead of this distant , far - off , overseas War On Terror .
The people of , say , Knoxville and Texarkana may have never met a Muslim , but they sure as hell have met someone who they suspected of being gay or of smoking a joint , so this makes the whole war so much more immediate and real .
And some of those pot smokers and gays have even been known to indulge in that hideous thing known as premarital sex , so there 's a whole other war to be fought there as well .
Seriously , even Wichita must have at least a couple of suspected gays who have n't fled for their lives yet , but how many terrorists do you really think actually reside in the entire state of Kansas ?
Evolution , global warming , dinosaurs and the liberal elites ' love of country may all be things that have never actually existed , but drugs , gays and illicit premarital sex are all as real as Jesus and the coming Rapture .
So it 's a no - brainer really .
Personally
Personally , I 've been to Mississippi , Tennessee , North Carolina and a number of other southern states and the only terrorist attacks I foresee taking place down there are those undertaken by homophobs , the KKK and , perhaps , a few rogue sheriffs .
I just do n't see bin Laden and his buddies sitting in their caves over there in Pakistan plotting a massive attack on Knoxville , Tennessee .
Nor do I see Louisville , Greenville or Huntsville being all that vulnerable either .
New Scientific Study
Well , there 's a new study that at least partly explains what 's going on with these people and , surprisingly , it has nothing to do with I.Q. , the ability to accept reality ( science , rationality , etc. ) or even the awesome ability to recite whole sections of the Bible .
Just published earlier this fall in the journal Science and entitled " Political Attitudes Vary with Physiological Traits " , the study goes a long way in explaining why those who could be excused for being terrified remain relatively calm while those who have little to fear always seem so petrified .
According to this study , it 's all rather simple : Conservatives , it seems , scare much easier than regular folks .
We 're talking physiological differences here .
We 're talking biology .
We 're talking hard - wiring .
They see a threat or , more accurately , they 're told that there 's a threat somewhere overseas and they immediately want to bomb it to oblivion .
Clearly , this helps explain why a buffoon like George W. Bush could be re-elected after his unequivocally disastrous initial 4 - year term .
A little fear - mongering , it seems , no matter how transparent and obvious , goes a long way when it comes to motivating these fearful conservative types .
So , once again , it looks like we must have pity for the conservatives .
They have an anxiety issue here and it's clearly something that needs treatment ... before they destroy the whole planet .
Only One Problem
My only problem with this study is this :
If they 're so fearful of all perceived threats , how come they could n't give a shit about the only one that actually threatens them and their children ?
No , not gays , not terrorists , not even Iran .
I 'm talking about global warming .
How come they 're so terrified by a few guys in some caves over in South Asia , but they have no fear whatsoever of actual global catastrophe ?
Strange indeed .
But , to be fair , not all fear is unwarranted .
Perhaps Barack Obama has , in fact , like so many from the Religious Right seem to believe , cunningly pretended to be a Christian for his entire life , so that he could eventually attain the highest office in the land and then unleash his sinister true Muslim self on the nation and the world .
Perhaps they 're really onto something here .
Perhaps he 's even the Antichrist , like some suspect .
Perhaps only Uncle Bubba can stop him now ?
Or , then again , maybe these people are just a bunch of ridiculous fear - mongering morons that have simply got it all wrong ?
It 's anyone 's guess .

JEAN KNAACK could n’t keep a lid on it .
While on a six - mile run near her home in Maryland , she raised her water bottle and expelled its contents onto the passenger - side window of a car .
Ms. Knaack , a 115 - pound runner , had been jogging on the sidewalk when the vehicle had come within inches of hitting her .
The driver had blindly pulled out of an adjacent parking lot , and Ms. Knaack responded with the aggressive squirt , coupled with a few choice expletives .
She did not anticipate what happened next .
The driver pulled the rest of the way out of the parking lot and into the street , whipped around in an intersection , got out of the car , and confronted her .
Amid of flurry of profanities , the motorist threatened to strike her with a beer bottle .
“ The fact that he was so specific really scared me , ” she said .
“ My heart rate shot sky high .
I felt like I was going to pass out . ”
Even though Ms. Knaack was a seasoned runner  she ’s the executive director of the Road Runners Club of America  and is knowledgeable about proper training technique and nutrition , she never got the memo on what do when an angry or negligent motorist takes a workout sideways .
That ’s because there really is n’t one .

New Scientist offers the definitive guide to everything you wanted to know about being green but were too embarrassed to ask
If I switch the light on and off every time I enter and leave a room , does this use more energy than leaving it on all evening ?
Switching the light on and off does saves energy , but there is a catch .
Every time you flip the switch , the bulb takes a jolt of electricity , which shortens its life .
Studies by the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto , California , found that turning low - energy compact fluorescent bulbs on and off at frequent intervals can shorten their lifespan by as much as 75 per cent .
The institute ’s director of energy utilisation , Tom Reddoch , suggests leaving energy - saving bulbs on if you will be out of the room for less than 15 minutes .
How clean does the pizza box have to be for it to be recyclable ?
Likewise cans and bottles
According to the Waste and Resources Action Programme ( WRAP ) , based in Banbury , UK , pizza boxes are often not recyclable .
That ’s because grease from the toppings contaminates the cardboard , making it useless to paper mills – though it can still be composted .
Such impregnation is not a problem when it comes to cans and bottles .
Nevertheless , they should be rinsed to remove food remnants so as not to attract vermin .
Plastic should also be clean , and lids removed from bottles so they can be squashed flat .
WRAP recommends rinsing waste items in old washing - up water to save energy .
Are laminated juice cartons recyclable ?
Yes – but …
New Yorkers are used to living amongst huge skyscrapers around Madison Square Park but they have probably never seen anything like this .
For his first New York building , Daniel Libeskind has proposed a 900 + foot , 54 - story glass condo with dripping sky gardens .
Libeskind 's creation would swoop up next to , and past , the 700 - foot Met Life tower .
The green spaces would be enclosed in cylindrical glass tubes at the center of the building and cut - aways in the face would open them up to the outside .
The openings also provide the condominiums in that part of the tower with balconies .
“ This is a building for the city 's future , ” Libeskind added , shrugging off concerns about working in these recessionary times .
“ We have a long way to go still , but we think this contributes in a whole new way . ”

In “ A Great Idea at the Time , ” Alex Beam presents Hutchins and Adler as a double act : Hutchins the tall , suave one with a gift for leadership ; Adler “ a troll next to the godlike Hutchins , ” with a talent for putting students to sleep .
Making the acquaintance of Hutchins through his works was , to Beam , “ like falling in love . ”
By contrast , “ to be reading Mortimer Adler ’s two autobiographies and watching his endless , self - promotional television appearances was a nightmare from which I am still struggling to awake . ”
As an appendix to the Great Books , Adler insisted on compiling a two - volume index of essential ideas , the easily misspelled Syntopicon .
A photograph in “ A Great Idea at the Time ” shows Adler surrounded by ­filing - cabinet drawers , each packed with index cards pertaining to a separate “ idea ” : Aristocracy , Chance , Cause , Form , Induction , Language , Life and so on .
The cards registered the expression of those ideas —
Adler arrived at the figure of 102 — in the Great Books of the Western World .
Image Mortimer Adler Credit ... From Time & Life Pictures / Getty Images
Hutchins and Adler ’s Great Books were a mixture of books you would n’t dream of reading ; books you think you ought to read but know you never will ; and many books that , if you have n’t read them already , you would admire and possibly enjoy .
The last category included the “ Iliad , ” works by Chaucer and Shakespeare , “ The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , ” a few novels — “ Tom Jones , ” “ War and Peace ” — and various works of philosophy .
The commercial aspect played on the common desire to harbor all of knowledge — Euclid , Kepler , Bacon , Descartes , Hume , Adam Smith , to name but a few — under one roof .
The texts were presented , however , without annotation , which would prove a hindrance even in the case of relatively accessible works , like Shakespeare ’s sonnets .
The 54 volumes contained practically nothing written in English in the previous 100 years ( two works by Charles Darwin , one by William James ) , but heaps of Plato and Aristotle , some alarming medical remedies of Hippocrates — “ Make the irons red - hot , and burn the pile until it be dried up ” — and column after column of ancient science , of little interest to anyone but specialists , who would have equipped themselves with more advanced texts anyway .
When asked for his views on which classic works to include among the Great Books , the science historian George Sarton pronounced the exercise futile : “ Newton ’s achievement and personality are immortal ; his book is dead except from the archaeological point of view . ”
Hoping to offer the reader what many of the Great Books fail to provide — entertainment —
Beam falls over himself in the effort to be breezy and upbeat .
No Mortimer Adler , he .
“ It is hard to resist poking fun , ” he writes , and resistance is easily overcome .
“ From the culture ’s point of view , Adler was a dead white male who had the bad luck to still be alive . ”
When reporting that “ War and Peace ” was among the selections of Hutchins and Adler , Beam fails to resist adding “ no ‘ Anna Karenina ’ ; too readable ! ”
His plain - man slangy style , which will be appreciated by fans of his column in The Boston Globe , is just as likely to be off - putting to others .
Hutchins and his colleagues , Beam writes , “ signed a pact with the devil of commerce ” and “ hawked their books ” the way their ad man , William Benton , sold Crest toothpaste .
“ Forget that it cleans your teeth ; you ’ll be popular !
Wisdom of the ages , schmisdom of the ages .
Forget about learning — your boss will be impressed , women will seek you out ( ‘ Oh !
You ’re reading Fourier ’s “ Theory of Heat . ” . . .
How fascinating !’) , your kids will get into college , and so on .
. . .
Soon enough the Great Books were synonymous with boosterism , Babbittry , and H. L. Mencken ’s benighted boobocracy .
They were everything that was wrong , unchic and middlebrow about middle America . ”
If not a great book , “ A Great Idea at the Time ” acts as a good guide to the rise and fall of the project .
For a brief period , the Great Books were at the heart of the curriculum at Chicago , and continue to feature strongly elsewhere .
In one of the reportorial chapters toward the end of his account , Beam visits St. John ’s College in Annapolis ( it also has a campus in Santa Fe ) , which still operates a teaching program based on “ all Great Books , all the time . ”
In 70 years , little has changed at St John ’s .
“ If a boy or girl wants to attend medical school , ” Beam writes , “ that means an additional year . . . of memorizing facts in conventional biology and chemistry classes , not learning the ‘ truth ’ behind the science , Great Books - style . ”
I invited Dr. Blomberg to write a post to challenge us at DC , and he 's graciously responded in the interests of a fair discussion of the ideas that separate us .
No disrespectful skeptical response to such a respected scholar will be published . , by Dr. Craig Blomberg : I was raised in what I later learned to identify as a very liberal parish of the old Lutheran Church in America .
I was confirmed in 1968 , the year American society seemed to be falling apart .
I took it as seriously as anyone in my confirmation class , which is n’t saying all that much .
We spent more time discussing Simon and Garfunkel lyrics and Jesus Christ Superstar than we did Luther ’s Catechism .
In my public high school my best friend brought me to our Campus Life club .
There for the first time I met kids my own age who spoke about having a personal relationship with Jesus and it was clearly making a difference in their lives .
In a culture in which “ eggheads ” like me who were neither athletic nor very good looking , and as a result had very few friends , they genuinely befriended me ( and many others ) .
I wanted what they had and prayed one February night in 1970 to receive Jesus as my Savior and to make him my Lord .
But it was n’t so much a revolutionary new idea as my sense that this was what the Lutherans had once been about but had given it up , at least in my church , for newer , trendier things .
I was valedictorian of my high school class of 750 .
I set out to be a mathematician .
( I did teach high school math for one year . )
In college , I encountered religious studies taught from a perspective that publicly acknowledged it was trying to destroy historic Christian faith .
A delightful church history professor ( and an ordained Lutheran ) once told us with a big grin but very seriously that it was impossible to be an evangelical Christian and maintain one ’s intellectual integrity .
I was enough of an intellectual I determined to see if I thought he was right .
Fortunately we had a good library and a couple good local bookstores where I found resources in abundance , not in any religion professor ’s bibliographies , that convinced me he was wrong .
A disproportionate number of those books in the mid-1970s were written by British scholars or by Americans who taught at a school near Chicago called Trinity Evangelical Divinity School , so I decided to go to seminary at TEDS and , later , to doctoral study in Aberdeen , Scotland .
Most seminarians complain of periodic spiritual dry times .
I did n’t have that experience .
I had spent the previous eight years trying tactfully to share my faith with any who would listen .
I ’m not sure there were any of the major challenges to Christianity that I did n’t encounter in those volatile years .
I had found what I thought were some good answers to some of the questions , but seminary enabled me to find a whole lot more and , of course , to discover how much I did n’t know in other areas of theology .
So I proceeded to doctoral study .
I felt called to teach New Testament studies and have done so ever since , first at the undergraduate and then at the graduate level .
Why am I still a Christian all these years later ?
First , I have to stress what I do n’t mean by the word “ Christian ” .
I do n’t mean someone who has to be politically conservative .
On many issues , I am not ; I voted for Obama .
I do n’t mean someone who has to be a creationist ; I believe in an old earth and theistic evolution .
( One of my daughters , when she was too young to know her hilarious double - entendre , once summed up my views as succinctly as anything I ’ve ever heard : if there was a big bang , there had to be a big banger ! )
By Christian I do n’t mean someone who knows
God ’s will for those who have n’t been given a credible chance to respond to the gospel .
As I ’ve studied Christian history , I ’ve learned there are about six major approaches to the question .
I have some hunches , but I ultimately retreat to my convictions about God ’s justice and grace .
I can trust him to work it out .
As for judgment more generally , I like two excerpts from C. S. Lewis in particular .
First , there will be three surprises in heaven : who ’s there , who ’s not there , and there I ’m there !
Second , there are only two kinds of people in the world — those who say to God , “ Thy will be done , ” and those to whom God says , “ thy will be done . ”
Finally , by a Christian , I do n’t mean someone who pretends to have the problem of suffering and evil solved .
But again , an easy - to - remember tripartite answer goes a long way for me .
Why does n’t God do something ( or do more than he has ) ?
(1) He has done something .
He sent Jesus to die for human sin , which is a major contributing factor to suffering and evil , and to begin a process of transformation in them for the better .
( 2 ) He is doing something , not least in the ways throughout church history in which Christians have helped make the world a substantially better place .
( If all you ’ve ever studied are the ways people have done bad things in the name of Jesus , check out a book like New Zealander and Oxfordian Nathan Hill ’s What Has Christianity Ever Done for Us : How It Shaped the Modern World [ 2005 ] and discover the disproportionately large role it has played over the centuries in the disciplines of literature and law , medicine and science , art and education .
Note , too , who comes forward to help the most in response to contemporary disasters and who most keeps long term relief and development programs afloat . )
( 3 ) He will do much , much more , eventually righting all the wrongs of the world .
But the only way that can happen will be for him to intervene so as to abolish human freedom to rebel against him , which will mean the end of the world as we know it and the end of any opportunity for people to freely choose for him as well .
He delays the end because of his mercy .
As you can tell , I ’ve already begun to answer my own question .
The short summary answer to why I am still a Christian is because I have n’t found any other world view , ideology , religion , or –ism that makes nearly as much sense of all of the pieces of the world as I have studied and experienced it .
After tragedies like 9/11 or , locally , Columbine , I marvel at those people who can say all humans are basically good .
It was G. K. Chesterton who once wrote that the depravity of humanity is the most empirically verifiable doctrine of the Christian faith !
But I also marvel at those who can say that atheistic evolution can account for all of human behavior .
What about the sheer altruism , utterly unmotivated by self - interest , which leads firefighters to sacrifice their lives by running back into towering infernos ?
Only the concept of humans made in the image of God can account for that in my estimation .
In fact , if Christians have to wrestle with the problem of evil , so must everyone else .
Indeed , we must all wrestle as well with the problem of good .
Where do these concepts come from ?
What makes the most hardened atheist ( usually ) insist that there is something just plain wrong , perhaps even immoral , with torturing prisoners , abusing children , raping women , and with someone else gratuitously murdering them .
The most advanced of apes has never disclosed any awareness of systems of morality , which is why we never arrest and imprison them , even if they kill humans .
( We might euthanize them once in awhile , but not as retributive punishment , merely to protect the rest of humanity . )
And we certainly do n’t condemn multiple - partner animals of being unfaithful to their mates .
Mark Twain ( no evangelical he ! ) put it well : “ Man is the only animal that blushes , or needs to . ”
Near the end of his life , Darwin admitted he had no satisfying explanation for human moral consciousness and reasoning .
Most ( not all ) atheists I meet are not interested in talking about religion or ideologies that function like religion .
No matter how tactful I try to be , they respond to my questions either by changing the subject or by ridiculing or getting angry with me .
I do not see them having an overarching purpose that gives their life meaning and fills them with deep joy and confidence in the future despite all the trauma of the present .
I do see this , though , in countless theists , especially Christians ( which is not to deny that we still sin , sometimes in big ways , and that there are even a few perennial “ jerks ” in our midst ! ) .
Watching people die is an experience everyone should have at not too old an age in life , but many today do n’t because we have hidden death by institutionalizing it .
I ’ve watched a number of people dying in my 53 years of life and it ’s then when you find out someone ’s true colors .
If there is no afterlife and this life is all there is , I still ca n’t think of any better way to die than with the peace and quiet confidence I ’ve observed in and discussed with several Christians who ’ve told me they ca n’t explain it , it was n’t anything they conjured up in their own strength , it was simply given to them for their last days .
If there is an afterlife and the possibility of being part of the new heavens and earth as Revelation 21 - 22 describes , however metaphorically , why would anyone not want to be a part of it ?
That , in a nutshell is why I am still a Christian .
Thanks for reading !

The voters are waking up to the reality that is Sarah Palin .
Latest polls show that her shine has worn off .
With the Vice - Presidential debates set for tonight , America gets to see her once more in action .
There will be no teleprompter to help her through the rough patches .
As the Washington Post has noted “ Palin may now be a drag on the Republican ticket among key voter groups . ”
“ Six in 10 voters see her as lacking the experience to be an effective president , and a third are now less likely to vote for ( Republican presidential hopeful John ) McCain because of her , ” the daily said .
While voters rated Palin as highly as they did McCain or his Democratic rival , Barack Obama , in the immediate aftermath of her entry into the race , her support has slid dramatically , the survey said .
“ The 60 per cent who now see Palin as insufficiently experienced to step into the presidency is steeply higher than in a Post - ABC poll after her nomination early last month .
Democrats and Republicans alike are now more apt to doubt her qualifications , but the biggest shift has come among independents , ” the survey added .
Her approval rating in Alaska has dropped significantly in the last three weeks .
Palin enjoyed an unprecedented 82 percent which has now plummeted to 68 percent .
What has changed is the bipartisan support she ’s enjoyed since taking office .
According to Moore ’s numbers , Palin lost 25 percent of her Democratic support in Alaska .
Similarly , support by independents – who make up the biggest bloc of Alaska voters – dropped 18 percent .
One of those voters who changed his mind is Jed Whittaker , a construction worker from Anchorage .
He said he supported Palin until reporters arriving in Alaska started uncovering things about her .
“ We do know a lot more about Mrs. Palin now than we did three weeks ago , ” Whittaker said .
Among those revelations , he cited Palin ’s religious views and that she once said it was God ’s will to build a multibillion - dollar pipeline to deliver natural gas from Alaska to the Lower 48 states .
More so than ever before in the past - we are seeing two - thirds of the voters planning to watch the VP debate - that is a significant difference from the 2004 debate .
Of course , the voters believe that Biden will win by a landslide .
He is an accomplished debater , in my opinion , plus his expensive knowledge on foreign and domestic affairs will be the highlight tonight .
Franken campaign attorney Marc Elias said today that Franken is within 50 votes of Sen. Norm Coleman ( R - Minn . ) , according to the campaign ’s internal tally , and believes that Franken can overtake Coleman when all the ballots are tallied .
Today 's announcement from Elias comes as election officials from Ramsey County have found 171 ballots that went uncounted Election Night at one of the county 's precincts , which has netted Franken an additional 37 votes .
Ramsey County is one of the more reliable Democratic strongholds in Minnesota .
The votes are currently being tallied in the recount .
With over 91 percent of the vote recounted , the secretary of state ’s official tally shows Coleman up by 340 votes .
But Elias argued the number is misleading , given that none of the 5,952 disputed ballots are included in that tally .
The Coleman campaign has challenged 191 more ballots than Franken ’s team , skewing the results in its favor .
Elias said , based on the Franken campaign 's own count , they believe they have picked up 165 votes on Coleman so far .
“ We ’re confident we ’re going to gain votes when the challenges are resolved because we believe our challenges are of a higher quality [ than Coleman ’s ] , ” said Franken attorney Marc Elias .
“ The vast majority of these challenges are going to be thrown out . ”
Franken ’s campaign team is also attempting to count absentee ballots that it believes were wrongly rejected .
About 9,000 absentee ballots were rejected , and Elias believes up to 1,000 of them were rejected unfairly .
UPDATE : Coleman 's campaign attorney Fritz Knaak disputes the Franken campaign 's internal calculations and said their own count is " nowhere near " the Franken tally .
" We ’re well north of the Franken number , " Knaak said , but declined to offer a specific figure .
Knaak also said the Coleman campaign believes only " a couple dozen " absentee ballots were wrongly rejected , a small number unlikely to change the final result .
" We 're cautiously optimistic , " he said .
" It ’s very tight , but this has been going the way we expected . "

Fresh off of urging his millions of supporters to protect “ traditional marriage ” by passing Proposition 8 in California , evangelical guru Rick Warren announces a new partnership with Reader ’s Digest to spread his personal brand of “ Purpose Driven ” Christianity across the nation :
The Reader ’s Digest Association , Inc. , and Dr. Rick Warren , Pastor of Saddleback Valley Community Church and the author of the worldwide best seller , “ The Purpose Driven Life , ” today announced a partnership to produce an inspirational multimedia platform called The Purpose Driven Connection .
Together the organizations will pool their international resources to produce and publish this Purpose Driven platform to help people who are seeking their purpose in life and wish to interact with others on their spiritual journeys .
The platform will provide a suite of bundled multimedia tools : “ The Purpose Driven Connection , ” a quarterly magazine ; Small Group study materials delivered in DVDs , workbooks and downloadable discussion guides ; and a state - of - the - art Christian social networking website .
“ We are excited about this new partnership and its unprecedented potential for international impact , ” said Warren , who will serve as Editor - in - Chief and be heavily involved in the conception of each element .
“ The Purpose Driven Connection represents more than simply integrated multimedia resources ; it will become a platform for a movement of people to change the world . ”
“ We are delighted to be working with Rick Warren and the Saddleback team , ” said Alyce Alston , President of RDA ’s Home & Garden and Health & Wellness affinities .
“ This is one of our company ’s most important and far - reaching ventures ever .
Together we will create a category - busting multimedia suite that will help millions of people in their daily lives , including those who already follow the Purpose Driven principles as well as seekers everywhere looking for greater fulfillment . ”
Former Sen. Larry Pressler ( R - SD ) votes ( by absentee ) for Obama .
I was on a panel a week or so ago .
And I said that I thought most observers were overstating the degree to which an economic crisis automatically advantaged the Democrat .
To some degree , sure , especially in the dying days of an unpopular Republican incumbent .
But remember , McCain ’s sell in this campaign was steadiness , experience , unflappability in a crisis .
If he ’d convinced voters that that was what he brought to the table , I do not believe the damage he sustained by the economic crisis would have been nearly so great .
I continue to think that McCain ’s reaction to the economic crisis was the turning point in the election .
Here ’s what Pressler said …
“ G.M. is the biggest of the three and it ’s in the worst shape , ” said John Casesa , principal in the auto consulting firm Casesa Shapiro Group .
“ I think it would be a pretty big blow to Rick if they do n’t get the money . ”
The debate on Capitol Hill will focus on whether the Detroit automakers can get $ 25 billion in aid immediately from either the Treasury Department ’s $ 700 billion financial rescue program , or from an existing loan program aimed at improving the fuel - efficiency of Big Three vehicles .
Ford and Chrysler , however , have not made the same dire predictions about their businesses  putting the urgency of the bailout squarely on the shoulders of Mr. Wagoner and G.M .
Some members of Congress have suggested that a management change is necessary at G.M. before any loans can be made .
“ I do not support the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to reward the mismanagement of Detroit - based auto manufacturers , ” said Senator Richard Shelby , the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , which holds its hearing on the bailout on Tuesday afternoon .
The lanky , 6 - foot - 4 - inch Mr. Wagoner , a 55 - year - old former Duke University basketball player and Harvard Business School graduate , has refused to consider resigning even if it would help G.M. ’s chances of getting emergency aid .

G.M. has declined to make Mr. Wagoner available for interviews .
In a Nov. 10 interview with the trade journal Automotive News , however , he said that a change in management at G.M. would not be wise at such a crucial time for the company .
“ I do n’t think it ’d be a very smart move , ” he said .
“ I think our job is to make sure we have the best management team to run G.M .
It ’s not clear to me what purpose would be served . ”
During recent months , the Fed has flooded the banking system with reserves , which the banks have chosen to accumulate as ( legally ) excess reserves , rather than using the funds to add to the volume of their outstanding loans and investments .
The Fed ’s recently adopted policy of paying a small rate of interest on bank reserves accounts for some of this accumulation , but the amount is so gigantic that it seems much more likely that the banks have greatly increased their assessment of the risk involved in lending and investing as usual and therefore have chosen the lower yielding but less risky alternative of accumulating more and more reserves .
Since August , the amount of excess reserves has risen from $ 2 billion to $ 559 billion .
A graph of this astonishing development shows an abrupt transition from a virtually horizontal line ( approximately zero excess reserves for decades ) to a virtually vertical line ( a quick jump of $ 557 billion in three months ) .
So far , this explosive increase of reserves has had only a small effect on the growth of the money stock as measured by the conventional monetary aggregates , such as M2 , although the rate of growth of the monetary aggregates is beginning to increase substantially , as shown in this graph .
Because the public ’s demand for cash balances has also risen , the recent increases in the money stock have not given rise to increased prices in general .
In fact , the major price indexes have fallen slightly in recent months , although the bulk of this decline has occurred because of the decline in the price of oil and related products since July .
Price indexes for goods other than energy have declined very little – certainly not enough to justify the many expressions of fear of impending deflation ( setting aside whether an actual deflation ought to be feared or not ) .
At matters now stand , by far the greater threat is rapid inflation , notwithstanding the ongoing recession .
When the banks begin to feel more comfortable with expanding the volume of their conventional loans and investments , they will have more than $ 550 billion on hand to employ for that purpose .
The multiplied effect of such a vast amount of lending , as newly created deposits make their way through the fractional - reserve banking system , portends a gargantuan increase in the money stock and hence a correspondingly enormous jump in the general price level .
As the public responds to the acceleration of inflation by reducing its demand for cash balances , the increased velocity of monetary circulation will contribute to even more rapid price inflation .
So much potential new money is now impounded in the commercial banks ’ holdings of excess reserves that it is difficult to see how the Fed will be able to stem the flood once the banks begin to transform those excess reserves into normal loans and investments .
If the Fed attempts to sell enough government securities to soak up the growing money stock , it will drive down the prices of Treasury bonds and hence drive up their yield , increasing the government ’s cost of borrowing to finance the huge budget deficits the government will be running because of its various bailout commitments and so - called stimulus programs .
This scenario holds the potential for a complete monetary crackup .
I have never been inclined toward touting doomsday financial scenarios .
I raise the possibility now only because , as I consider the situation portrayed in the graph of excess reserves linked above , I am unable to foresee how the Fed and the Treasury can navigate through these treacherous waters – waters that their own previous actions have whipped to a foam – without creating terrible financial and economic harm .
If the dollar survives the ministrations of Bernanke , Paulson , Bush , and the Obama gang , its survival will be something of a miracle .
November 29 , 2008 --
In October , a three - member delegation of Australian trade unionists visited the Saharawi ( Western Saharan ) refugee camps in the Hamada desert , south - west Algeria .
Western Sahara has been illegally occupied by Morocco since 1975 .
Green Left Weekly / Links ’ Margarita Windisch spoke with Sid’Ahmed Tayeb , the minister of public health for the exiled Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic , when she visited the 27 February refugee camp .
The Saharawi refugee camps have now existed for close to 33 years in extremely inhumane surroundings .
What has led to the Saharawis becoming refugees and what are the challenges facing the Saharawi people ?
First , I would like to thank you very much for your visit .
It shows us that we are not alone .
This is important support that international community can give us .
All along , the Saharawi community has been conscious of its historic responsibility and the sacrifice it has made and still has to make in its fight for national sovereignty .
Our sacrifices have been necessary to preserve the history of our people and liberate our territories from Moroccan occupation .
Western Sahara was invaded in 1975 , by a monarch who needed to stabilise his throne and expand his territory .
Living as refugees is a disgrace and is marked by scarcity — in all senses of the word .
The biggest impact of displacement is on health .
During the first years after the Moroccan invasion , we not only lost many lives during the resistance war but we also had to come to terms with moving away from our natural habitat .
We were overwrought with a lack of perspective on how to survive in this new environment , a very hard geographic space without natural life — no vegetation or animals .
We have had no experience in how to live in such inhumane conditions .
We had many deaths in the camps from 1975 to 1983 that were related to the difficulty of adapting psychologically and physiologically to a radically different and highly stressful terrain .
To resolve this critical problem we needed to employ all the material resources available to us .
In the face of massive adversity , the main moral , political and sociological task of Saharawi society was to draw strength from the little available to restructure itself and mature against all odds .
And I can confidently say that we managed this task with excellence .
When we started to organise the Saharawi state in the camps , we were conscious that health is one of the main vulnerabilities .
That ’s why especially the first years of restructuring in the camps , one fifth of Saharawis were employed in the health field , focusing on prevention .
Health prevention today is still one our main political tools .
We started with the promotion of health issues in all its aspects initially , because the only thing we had available at that time was human resources .
Our society , which was predominantly Bedouin and nomadic , had to undergo a brutal change once we arrived at the camps .
People had to settle and face unhealthy dietary change .
Saharawi diet was based on milk , meat , malt , rice and some wheat breads .
In the camps , which concentrated big social groups in restrictive areas , the refugees suddenly had to survive from emergency food aid , which comprised mainly legumes , adding to the already adverse and stressful circumstances
However , due to our strategy of health prevention , we managed to make some important improvements rather quickly .
Humans never know their capabilities until they reach a point were problems have to be confronted ; as much on an individual as a societal level .
Saharawi Bedouins ’ life is very tough , but they still like this kind of life .
A Saharawi is not very interested in comfort , such as sofas or television .
These are not big attractions .
The Bedouin adores nature and appreciates coexistence with his animals , like the camels .
We are close to our animals , because they are our means of subsistence .
Our society needed a total reorganisation .
We had to create administrations in order to manage every district and municipality of the camps according to their specific necessities .
We decided to prioritise schooling and community health clinics over individual family needs .
Sometimes we had three to four families share one tent so there was a tent for each school and clinic available .
Saharawis have had to live for over 30 years on emergency food aid .
How are you dealing with the consequences ?
The characteristic of any refugee camps is health vulnerability , and nutrition is an important part of that .
We have achieved some very good results .
In more than 20 years we have had no type of disease epidemic , even though we have had to live in drastic climatic circumstances where we face massive temperature changes from a high of 58 °C in summer to - 6 °C in winter .
On top of this , our diet is hyper glutei — made up of 95 % of carbohydrates — because it is the cheapest and easiest accessible form of aid available for the camps .
This diet is highly deficient for our immune system .
It also creates a different human organism to normal .
Women and men are born into this state of scarcity — which is impacting especially on the mother but also the child .
We not only develop general health programs , but also diagnostic programs that look at the health risks and causes .
We create workshops with all the Saharawi health professionals , and our specialist friends and sympathisers , to arrive at a good scientific diagnosis .
At the moment we are working with Norwegian health professionals on a four - day nutrition seminar .
We identified this as a priority because in February we did a nutritional study that looked at levels of anemia and malnutrition , especially in the most vulnerable sectors ; women of childbearing age and children under 15 .
We found alarmingly high levels of anemia and malnutrition .
These findings compelled all of us involved in health to get together and develop a realistic diagnosis and find realistic solutions .
Our problems will persist as long as we are refugees .
However , the only way to minimise the impact is for us to unite our strengths , make the situation as dignified as possible and apply all our knowledge .
What benefits does the high level of Saharawi control and organisation in the camps bring ?
Saharawi people live a precarious existence ; we are in a place of being or not being .
We have only two choices — a sovereign Saharawi state or total dispersion of Saharawis across the world , without a homeland , memories and no responsibility for the future .
We are conscious of this responsibility for our society in its totality ; we have to organise ourselves in order to survive .
We have to develop the level of organisation in order to meet the challenges coming our way every minute .
We have now lived for quite a few years with neither peace nor war , since the 1991 ceasefire with Morocco .
When we were engaged in war , the perspectives were clear , even though we did n’t know how many lives our resistance struggle would cost us .
We were engaged in armed combat in very unequal conditions with a militarily superior Morocco .
It was not only Saharawi society that paid a big price for the caprices of the Moroccan king .
Moroccan soldiers were also victims of his Machiavellian mind ; they , their families and Moroccan society in fact have paid dearly for the king ’s expansionist ambitions .
We noticed an encouraging high participation of women at the recent General Workers ’ Union of Saguia el - Hamra and Rio de Oro ( Western Saharan trade union organisation ) congress , but also more generally women are very visible in public life in the camps .
Our society is a very naturalist society .
We share our responsibilities in a collective manner , which includes extended families along ancestral lines .
Because of our ways of life , women occupy a critical rank .
In a nomadic society , the woman is everything .
The man of the family is itinerate ; he is either looking for pastures or is at the markets hundreds of kilometres away and may be absent for weeks .
Once we arrived at our refuge in South West Algeria , women organised the state and constructed the institutions , from the smallest to the biggest .
Women have also been combatants during the years of war .
In incredibly harsh conditions , women were both the backbone of the camps and the revolution .
In Saharawi society , women are not discriminated against because of their specific physiological make up .
Cuba has educated many Saharawi children .
Why is this the case ?
Cuba , such a small country with minimal material resources , has extended humanitarian help to many countries .
Most importantly , Cubans have helped with education and health .
The Saharawi people are one of those peoples that are eternally grateful to the Cuban people .
Only Cuba , on the other side of the word , opened the doors for us and took our kids to educate them into doctors , engineers , lawyers and technicians of all types .
Cuba has also helped with medical support .
In 1976 , we only had four qualified nurses — a consequence of more then 100 years of Spanish colonial rule .
So imagine , in times of war and an extreme refugee situation , we had to make do with only four nurses to try and deal with our health problems !
Now , the leaders , functionaries and youth you see working in the camps are all a result of the support and education provided by Cuba .
Cuba , with the little they have , still shares with others , independently of their obligations in their geographical region , culture , religion or skin colour .
We Saharawis are conscious that it was Cuba that has helped us to walk on our own two feet since the Moroccan invasion .
Western Sahara is Africa ’s last colony and the conflict is still unresolved .
How can we best give our solidarity to Saharawi people ?
There is only one solution to our existence as refugees : our return to our sovereign homeland .
There is no other solution .
I can only mention the need to unite all our societies along the lines of peace and true justice .
It is this unity , not aggression , that we need so all of us can enjoy happiness instead of destitution and humiliation .

Bazaar branches for all Ubuntu source packages available
Hi , If you go visit http://package-import.ubuntu.com/
you will find bzr branches available for ( almost ) all Ubuntu source packages .
These branches are a new service available to all Ubuntu developers .
These Bazaar branches are available for anyone to use in any way that is useful to them .
I can describe some ways in which they will be useful , but I know many more will be found that I have n't thought of yet .
From this point forward these branches will only get more useful as we work to link them up with Debian and upstream branches .
While that work is ongoing we will also be working on tools that allow you to complete tasks more easily , experiment with changes , and visualise the differences between the code we distribute in Ubuntu and the code distributed elsewhere .
These branches will be kept up to date by processes that continuously monitor uploads to the archives and import new versions of packages .
This means that the branches will be up to date regardless of whether an uploader uses bzr or not .
Currently there are around 500 packages that failed to import at some point .
This means they will either not appear on that site , or the branch will be incomplete .
I will be trying to reduce that number over the coming weeks .
Anyone that would like to help with this is welcome to get in touch .
You can see the current list of failures at http://package-import.ubuntu.com/logs/files/head%3A/failures/
If there is a package you care about on that list and would like to see a full import then drop me a note and I can prioritise it .
The current branches are read - only .
This means that you can make use of the data , but you will not be able to preserve any revision history you create while working on branches by pushing them back .
You will of course be able to push them elsewhere if you wish to collaborate with someone , but integrating that extra history with the main branch will not be possible until they are read - write .
These branches are being made available at this location while the Launchpad developers work on extending launchpad to be able to host source package branches .
Once they have finished we will migrate to launchpad for hosting , which will bring us several benefits , notably read - write branches , with the write permissions tied to upload permissions for the source package .
At this point it is important to stress what these branches are not .
They are not complete with respect to upstream history , and they do not even contain revisions corresponding to Debian uploads .
This means two things , firstly that there is no way to e.g. merge from upstream if they use bzr ( or something with a bzr plugin , e.g. svn ) , or merge from a Debian packaging branch .
Secondly , we are currently in the " merge " period of Ubuntu development , and these branches will only help with part of that .
You wo n't be able to use bzr 's excellent merging to merge from Debian , only use the historical information to help you understand past changes .
Work during Jaunty will be put in to rectifying this , so that in Jaunty + 1 you will at least be able to merge from Debian directly in bzr , and in later cycles integrate properly with VCS packaging in Debian and upstreams .
Some of this work will involve rewriting revision history , and so will require fixing up your branches ; more details will be provided nearer the time .
An extension of this point is that if you already maintain an Ubuntu package in a VCS , or you work with Debian or upstream through their VCS then you may just want to ignore these branches for now .
You will probably already have something that is more useful to you than what is provided by these branches .
I will be in touch later about using such branches directly so that things work better for you .
These branches are being made available now , despite these shortcomings so that you can start experimenting with them , and making use of the historical information that they provide .
As we work on the outstanding issues they will become more and more useful to your work .
Here are some possible next steps if you are still reading : 1 . Find a package you know and grab the branch and have a poke around .
Make sure that everything looks as you would expect and speak to me if it does n't .
2 . Go to the site and click around on loggerhead and get a feel for some of the information that can be provided by a DVCS branch that it is hard to get from source packages .
You might like to download the branch and use something like bzr - gtk or qbzr to get a richer view as well .
3 . Try a packaging task in bzr .
There is some documentation at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DistributedDevelopment/Documentation
Please help improve it , and let me know if something is not clear .
4 . Help to craft the tools and workflow that will be coming to support this by contributing to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DistributedDevelopment for example in a Requirements document for your use case , or in helping to design the client tools .
For those interested in general in this topic you may like to join http://vcs-pkg.org/ to discuss using VCSs for packaging .
For those interested in the next steps for Ubuntu keep an eye on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DistributedDevelopment , and consider attending https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/distributed-development-debian-import if you are at UDS .
Have fun with the branches , and keep me updated on the interesting things you discover you can do with them .
Thanks ,
James

The two major problems in concurrent programs are data races and deadlocks .
Races occur when two or more threads are accessing shared memory without proper synchronization .
Deadlocks occur when synchronization is based on locking and multiple threads block each other 's progress .
In a typical deadlock scenario , thread A locks the mutex X , and thread B locks the mutex Y . Now , in lockstep , thread A tries to lock Y and B tries to lock X . Neither can make progress , waiting forever for the other thread to release its lock .
The program freezes .
In a sense , data races are the opposite of deadlocks .
The former result from not enough synchronization , the latter usually happen when there 's too much synchronization and it gets out of hand .
There are sophisticated schemes to prevent races and / or deadlocks , but they either require special language support or strict discipline on the part of programmers .
Here I present a solution based on a well - known deadlock - avoidance protocol and show how it can be enforced by the compiler .
It can be applied to programs in which the number of locks is fixed and known up front .
This scheme could probably be implemented in C++ by somebody skilled in template metaprogramming .
I chose the D language ( www.digitalmars.com/D) insteada language from the same curly - brace family , but with more user - friendly support for metaprogramming .
Most code samples in this article should be easy to understand if you 're familiar with C++ , Java , or C# .
Lock Ordering
The crucial observation is that deadlocks occur when threads take locks in different order .
In the previous example , thread A tried to take locks X and then Y , while thread B tried to take lock Y , then X .
If you could ensure that all threads that take both locks take them in the same order , you 'd know they will not deadlock ( at least not on those two locks ) .
In some programs all locks are known at compile time and you can prescribe the order in which they are to be taken .
Strictly speaking , the ordering does n't have to be total partial order is sufficient ( for example , the way nodes are ordered in a tree using parent / child relationship ) .
If two locks are never taken together , they do n't have to be ordered .
In any case , given a partial order , there always is a way to sort the locks into some linear sequence ( it 's called " topological sort " ) .
So without loss of generality , I assume that we have such a sequence of locks in our program .
Now it 's easy to convince yourself that if all threads take locks in the order compatible with this sequence , there will be no deadlocks .
( Notice that it 's okay to skip some locks in the sequence . )
Even the best protocol does n't amount to much if it can not be enforced .
The first thing that comes to mind is to try to enforce the scheme at runtime .
Every time you take a lock you would add it to a thread - local list and , if you detected an out of order attempt , you 'd throw an exception .
Releasing a lock would take it off the list .
The problem with runtime enforcement is that concurrency bugs are hard to reproduce .
The program may go through testing with flying colors only to deadlock months or years later on a client 's machine .
I 'll concentrate on ways to enforce deadlock freedom at compile time .
A compile - time scheme is by necessity more restrictive ; it might reject perfectly valid programs .
But once the program compiles or , more precisely , type - checks , you have the guarantee that it will never deadlock .
I realized that the biggest problem in statically enforcing a lock - ordering scheme is that you do n't know which locks may be taken by the functions you are calling .
Suppose your function takes lock number 6 in the global sequence .
As long as you hold onto it , you should n't be able to call any function that may take any lower - numbered locks .
Suppose that the information about what locks may be taken by a functionits lock options could be encoded in its type signature .
Trying to call a function that is declared to take lock 5 from a function that takes lock 6 would result in a type error .
How can you encode , using the type system , the information that , say , lock 6 has been taken ?
It turns out that there is a trick to that .
Electoral Vote Predictor 2004 : Kerry 232 Bush 285
New polls : AL AR CA CO FL IA IL IN MI MN MO NC NJ NM NV OH OK PA WA
News from the Votemaster
John Edwards won the vice - presidential debate 41 % to 28 % among uncommitted voters according to a CBS poll .
An online poll conducted by MSNBC makes the margin of Edwards victory even larger : 67 % to 33 % .
While the MSNBC poll was not a scientific poll , it did have 885,000 responses , so it was a very large poll of Internet users .
The effect of the first presidential debate is starting to kick in .
Kerry is surging and Bush is dropping .
Kerry has retaken the lead in all - important Ohio by 49 % to 48 % , New Mexico by 46 % to 43 % , and Iowa by 48 % to 47 % .
While all of these are within the margin of error , previous polls had Bush ahead in these states by more than the margin of error .
Clearly the forward motion Kerry has been experiencing in the national polls this week is starting to show up in the state polls as well .
On the other hand , Bush has taken the lead in Pennsylvania by a margin of 48 % to 47 % .
I got tons of mail about averaging .
The response is overwhelmingly against averaging .
When I was n't doing it , many people said I should do it .
Now that I am doing it , many people say I should n't .
If I may paraphrase a famous Republican , " You can please some of the people all of the time and you can please all of the people some of the time but you can't please all the people all the time . "
I dropped the averaging and went back to the old scheme of listing the most recent poll .
If two polls have the same middle date , the shorter one wins .
If two ( or more ) polls have exactly the same polling interval , they are averaged .
Many teachers have sent me mail telling me how they use the site to discuss the election in their classes .
There is material for history classes ( why is there an electoral college ? ) , geography ( why are some states red and some states blue ? ) , math ( how can you predict a whole state by asking 800 people ? ) and more .
If you are a teacher looking for more material about the election to use in your classes , take a look at the Lesson Plans Page .

Enlarge By Tsvangirayi Mukwazhi , AP Women carry water in buckets as others carry empty buckets towards the underground water source , after water was cut in Harare , Zimbabwe , on Monday .
Water in the capital was cut due to shortage of purification chemicals as Zimbabwe battles with a cholera outbreak which is thought to have left hundreds dead .
HARARE , Zimbabwe ( AP ) 
As children play near cesspools , their parents shake their heads at a public service announcement that drifts over the radio urging people to boil water before drinking it .
It sounds like a taunt in a country where water and electricity supplies are off more than on .
This week , authorities turned off the taps in Zimbabwe 's capital after the National Water Authority said it ran out of purifying chemicals and feared contaminated water would spread a cholera epidemic that has claimed hundreds of lives since August .
The crisis is the latest chapter in the collapse of this once - vibrant nation under President Robert Mugabe , who has ruled for 28 years and refuses to leave office even though he and his party lost elections in March .
An agreement to form a unity government with the opposition has been deadlocked for weeks over how to share Cabinet posts .
In Mabvuku , a suburb where residents have dug shallow wells in open ground , people say they know unboiled water can make them ill , but that they have no choice .
" We are afraid but there is no solution , most of the time the electricity is not available so we just use the water , " resident Naison Chakwicha told AP Television News .
In another suburb , Mbare , Anna Marimbe traced the deaths of two children last week to stinking open drains where she said the kids played .
Residents of the densely populated bedtown of Chitungwiza on Friday sued the National Water Authority in the High Court , saying they had been without running water for 13 months , causing cholera to surface and leading to deaths .
The application describes " large pools of raw sewerage " in the streets of the suburb , where the first cholera cases were reported .
Controlling the epidemic depends on providing clean water , which means also repairing bust water and sewage pipes as well as dilapidated pumping and purification equipment .
Harare is the epicenter of the cholera epidemic , which has spread across the country and spilled over its borders .
MORE ON OUTBREAK : Cholera epidemic spread to South Africa
The government has reported 473 deaths since August and a total of 11,700 people infected by Monday , according to Paul Garwood , spokesman for Health Action and Crises , the humanitarian arm of the U.N. World Health Organization .
Garwood said that according to the official toll , 4 % of people are dying of a disease that usually claims fewer than 1 % of those infected and is easily treated with rehydration salts or an intravenous drip .
Doctors say the toll is nearer 1,000 dead , or 10 % of victims , but nobody can count those dying at home and in the countryside without medical care .
All the country 's main hospitals have closed .
Those continuing to operate can offer little care with no medicines and a shortage of staff whose monthly salary does not cover one day 's bus fare to get to work .
The opposition - controlled Harare City Council is burying cholera victims for free because people cannot afford to buy graves .
Zimbabwe 's government , normally hostile to international aid agencies , is welcoming an initiative by several — including the U.N. Children 's Fund , WHO and Doctors Without Borders — to provide emergency care as well as try to ensure safe water supplies .
Health officials , following the line of a government that is refusing to declare a national emergency , insisted the cholera outbreak was under control until five days ago .
Then , the best advice Health Minister David Parirenyatwa could offer was to urge people to stop shaking hands .
" I want to stress the issue of shaking hands .
Although it 's part of our tradition to shake hands , it 's high time people stopped shaking hands , " he told The Herald , a state newspaper .
The collapse of all services , including refuse collection , has turned the city into a playground for rats that threaten to spread other , more deadly , diseases .
Amid the disaster , Zimbabweans continue to find ways to deal with the crisis .
Those who can afford it are sinking wells and boreholes .
Others are buying water tanks and pumps , then paying $ 50 in foreign currency for a delivery of 2,000 liters ( 500 gallons ) of water .
Most vendors in Zimbabwe today only accept U.S. dollars or South African rand since the Zimbabwe dollar , once on a par with the greenback , seems to devalue with each hour that passes .
On Tuesday , it was trading for 1.8 million to the U.S. dollar : that is after the central bank dropped 10 zeros from the local currency this year in an attempt to keep up with inflation last set officially at 231 million percent by July .
Even money sometimes can't buy water .
One supplier told an AP reporter on Tuesday that he has a waiting list more than two weeks long .
Those without foreign currency must turn to " water Samaritans " — suburban residents who have wells or boreholes and are allowing people to fill buckets and jerry cans for free .
Some residents are charging for the privilege .
Lines of mainly women and children gather daily outside the homes of people with wells .
But even that supply is not assured .
Parirenyatwa , the health minister , voiced the fears of many when he said the cholera epidemic likely will get worse with the onset of the rainy season , which lasts two or three months .

Biden : McCain looked like ' angry man ' at debate David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden had some harsh words for the opposition while speaking at a campaign event at the University of South Florida 's Sun Dome in Tampa , Florida .
Biden said that Republican Senator John McCain has been coming across as " an angry man " lately with his campaign's " ugly inferences " and " unbecoming personal attacks " on the Democratic ticket .
The Delaware senator said that " the questions from the people of that town hall last night I believe , personally believe , reflected what a majority of the American people are looking for , a steady hand , leadership , an optimist , not an angry man lurching from one position to another .
We 're looking for answers . "
" You did n't hear a single question about the ugly inferences and the unbecoming personal attacks launched by the McCain campaign on Barack Obama , " Biden added .
" You did n't hear one single average person ask that . "
Later in his speech , Biden advised the crowd not to to become " distracted . "
" Those attacks do n't hurt Barack Obama or me , " Biden said .
" They hurt you .
Every single false charge and baseless accusation is an attempt to get you to stop paying attention on what is going on in this country . "
Earlier today , as Raw Story reported , during an appearance on CBS 's Early Show , Biden unleashed some harsh criticism on the harsh turn the McCain campaign has taken the last week .
According to Biden , Alaskan governor Sarah Palin is injecting " fear and loathing " into the race with her false claim that Obama is friends with a terrorist , former Weather Underground member and founder William Ayers .
" You know , the idea here that somehow these guys are once again injecting fear and loathing into this campaign is ...
I think it 's mildly dangerous .
I mean , here you have out there these kinds of , you know , incitements out there - guy introducing Barack using his middle name as if it 's some epitaph or something , " Biden said , apparently confusing the words ' epitaph ' and ' epithet , ' the Associated Press reported .

Keith Bakker ( right ) regularly takes time to meet and talk to gamers .
Ninety per cent of the young people who seek treatment for compulsive computer gaming are not addicted .
So says Keith Bakker the founder and head of Europe 's first and only clinic to treat gaming addicts .
The Smith & Jones Centre in Amsterdam has treated hundreds of young gamers since the clinic opened in 2006 .
But the clinic is changing its treatment as it realises that compulsive gaming is a social rather than a psychological problem .
Using traditional abstinence - based treatment models the clinic has had very high success rates treating people who also show other addictive behaviours such as drug taking and excessive drinking .
But Mr Bakker believes that this kind of cross-addiction affects only 10 % of gamers .
For the other 90 % who may spend four hours a day or more playing games such as World of Warcraft , he no longer thinks addiction counselling is the way to treat these people .
" These kids come in showing some kind of symptoms that are similar to other addictions and chemical dependencies , " he says .
" But the more we work with these kids the less I believe we can call this addiction .
What many of these kids need is their parents and their school teachers - this is a social problem . "
In response the clinic has changed its treatment programme for gamers to focus more on developing activity - based social and communications skills to help them rejoin society .
Social ties " This gaming problem is a result of the society we live in today , " Mr Bakker told BBC News .
" Eighty per cent of the young people we see have been bullied at school and feel isolated .
Many of the symptoms they have can be solved by going back to good old fashioned communication . "
In most cases of compulsive gaming , it is not addiction and in that case , the solution lies elsewhere
Keith Bakker
By offering compulsive gamers a place where they feel accepted and where their voice will be heard , the clinic has found that the vast majority have been able to leave gaming behind and rebuild their lives .
For Mr Bakker the root cause of the huge growth in excessive gaming lies with parents who have failed in their duty of care .
But he is quick to point out that 87 % of online gamers are over the age of 18 - and once they cross that line , help is something they need to seek for themselves because parents no longer have the legal right to intervene .
For younger gamers , intervention may be the only way to break the cycle .
That means stepping in and sometimes literally taking a child away from a computer , removing them from the game for a period of time until they become aware of their habits and begin to see there are other choices .
" It 's a choice , " he says .
" These kids know exactly what they are doing and they just do n't want to change .
If no one is there to help them , then nothing will ever happen . "
Alone together George [ not his real name ] is an 18 - year - old gamer being treated at the clinic in Amsterdam .
He was spending at least 10 hours a day playing Call of Duty 4 until he sought help at the centre .
" Call of Duty was somewhere I felt accepted for the first time in my life , " he says .
" I was never helped by my parents or my school .
At the clinic I also feel accepted and have come out of myself . "
' George ' used to spend hours every day playing Call of Duty 4 George kept his gaming problem a secret as much as he could but when he did tell people , he says that no - one offered him help .
" I liked gaming because people could n't see me , they accepted me as my online character - I could be good at something and feel part of a group . "
Underlying that new sense of belonging was a young man who felt powerless and neglected in real life .
" I was aware that I played too much but I did n't know what to do .
But it helped me because I could be aggressive and get my anger and frustration out online , " he says .
This kind of aggression is not uncommon in young gamers who feel frustrated with their real lives .
Besides addiction , aggression and violence form part of the ongoing debate about the influence of gaming on impressionable minds .
When two students killed twelve pupils and a teacher in the Columbine High School shooting in the US in 1999 , many believed that their common interest in playing violent games had helped to trigger the massacre .
Research at Smith & Jones seems to imply that feelings of anger and powerlessness often pre-exist a compulsion to play violent games .
In some cases these people find each other in the gaming world and form a bond based on those feelings of alienation and anger .
Mr Bakker believes that if there was more commitment from parents and other care givers to listen to what their children are saying then these issues of isolation and frustration could be dealt with at source and bring many young people out of the virtual world and back into real life .
" If I continue to call gaming an addiction it takes away the element of choice these people have , " he says .
" It 's a complete shift in my thinking and also a shift in the thinking of my clinic and the way it treats these people . "
Mr Bakker sees a time when addiction centres like Smith & Jones could close down if parents and adults in the community took more responsibility for the habits of their children .
" In most cases of compulsive gaming , it is not addiction and in that case , the solution lies elsewhere . "

Was it really that long ago that Britney Spears was showing off her crotch ?
Well , apparently it was and as history may have it she 's always been known to party on her birthday and definitely never misses a photo op , though that last one may have been a mistake .
We at BH just wanted to take a moment to wish Britney a Happy Birthday ; we hope you party your ass off .
You 've supposedly cleaned up your act to promote your new album Circus , and we all think it 's cute that you 're releasing it on your birthday .
( WTF ?... a circus themed album release / birthday party )
Most people would think that was great , personally we feel you 've fallen off the band wagon and were much cooler when you rocked out like Sid Vicious .
Mumbai police capture terrorist alive and claim he is from Pakistan
Police have captured one of the terrorists behind the Mumbai attack during the operation at the Taj Mahal hotel .
He was named locally as Zakiruallah , a Punjabi from the Pakistan town of Faridkot .
The 12 gunmen involved may have been trained in Pakistan by militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba , Indian officials have claimed .
A grinning terrorist brandishes an AK - 47 at the height of the attack last night .
At least 12 locations in Mumbai were targeted simultaneously
Sources close to the operation said Zakiruallah told investigators that the group had been trained by Lashkar .
But a spokesman for Lashkar denied involvement .
The Pakistani government also condemned the attacks .
It is believed the terrorists hijacked an Indian trawler , M V Alpha , which was used as a mothership from which to launch a maritime terror attack on the coastal city .
Indian coastguards recovered the vessel off the Mumbai coast .
The decapitated body of its captain was found on board .
Two inflatable rafts were used to transport the men together with massive quantities of RDX explosive , hand grenades and AK - 47 assault rifles , to Mumbai .
Police discovered 16lb of RDX outside the Taj Mahal and another 20lb near the Oberoi Trident hotel .
The heavily armed terrorists then fanned out across south Mumbai .
One group even hijacked a police van and cruised around the city gunning down bystanders .
Ratan Tata , who runs the company that owns the Taj Mahal hotel , said they appeared to have scouted their targets in advance .
' They seem to know their way around the back office , the kitchen .
There has been a considerable amount of detailed planning , ' he said at a press conference .
The attack comes after it was revealed a domestic Islamic terror group warned it was planning a massacre in Mumbai two months ago .
The Indian Mujahideen denounced the city 's police anti-terrorist squad - known as the ATS - in September , accusing them of harassing Muslims .
It said in an e-mail : ' You [ the ATS ] should know that your acts are not at all unnoticed .
We are keeping an eye on you and just waiting for the right time to execute bloodshed .

A man carries his partner away from the Taj Hotel
' We are aware of your recent raids at Ansarnagar , Mograpada in Andheri and the harassment and trouble you created for the Muslims .
' You threatened to murder them and you even misbehaved with the Muslim women and children . '
The message added : ' If your arrogance has reached this degree and if you think that you can scare us by your stunts , then let the IM warn the people of Mumbai that the ATS will be responsible for the deadly attacks on Mumbaikars in the future . '
Analysts believe the group which claimed direct responsibility for last night 's terror attack , the Deccan Mujahideen , is a front for the Indian Mujahideen .
Witnesses say the attackers were young South Asian men speaking Hindi or Urdu , suggesting they are probably members of an Indian militant group rather than foreigners .
Deccan is an area of southern India , indicating the terrorists may be members of a south India offshoot or cell of the main group .
Firefighters try to put out a blaze as smoke rises from the Taj Hotel building in Mumbai
Indian police say the Indian Mujahideen is an offshoot of the banned Students ' Islamic Movement of India ( SIMI ) , but that local Muslims appear to have been given training and backing from militant groups in neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh .
SIMI has been blamed by police for almost every major bomb attack in India , including explosions on commuter trains in Mumbai two years ago that killed 187 people .
The Indian Mujahideen may also include former members of the Bangladeshi militant group Harkat - ul - Jihad al Islami , police said .
It has made credible claims of responsibility for most of the recent major attacks on civilian targets in India over the past two years .
People take cover after shooting broke out outside the Metro Cinema in Mumbai
The Mumbai attacks appear to have been carefully co-ordinated , well - planned and involved a large number of attackers .
A high level of sophistication has also been a hallmark of previous attacks by the Indian Mujahideen .
The Mumbai attacks also focused clearly on tourist targets , including two luxury hotels and a famous cafe .
However , experts consider any links to al - Qaeda or that the attacks were inspired by Osama bin Laden 's movement unlikely .
Rohan Gunaratna , author of Inside Al - Qaeda and a terrorism expert at the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore , said he believed the group that carried out Wednesday 's attack was Indian Mujahideen .
Mr Gunaratna added : ' The earlier generation of terrorist groups in India were mostly linked to Pakistan .
But today we are seeing a dramatic change .
They are almost all homegrown groups .
...
They are very angry and firmly believe that India is killing Muslims and attacking Islam . '
British - based Jane 's Information Group said it thought the attackers could be Indian but that taking hostages suggested a wider anti-Western agenda .
' Until now , terrorist attacks in India have targeted civilians , often in busy market or commercial areas , and in communally sensitive areas with the intention to foment unrest between Hindu and Muslim communities , ' said Urmila Venugopalan , Jane 's South Asia analyst .
' This stands in contrast to the national issues that appeared to motivate Indian Mujahideen , ' Venugopalan said .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh blamed ' external forces ' but stopped short of blaming Pakistan .
Both are nuclear - armed countries .
Risk forecasters Exclusive Analysis added that it was ' highly unlikely ' that they were authorised or even known about at the top level in Pakistan .
Army personnel take position at the Gateway of India that stands in front of the Taj Hotel
In May , the Indian Mujahideen made a specific threat to attack tourist sites in India unless the government stopped supporting the United States in the international arena .
The threat was made in an e-mail claiming responsibility for bomb attacks that killed 63 people in the tourist city of Jaipur .
The e-mail , signed by ' Guru Al - Hindi ' , declared ' open war against India ' and included the serial number of one of the bicycles on which the bombs were left .
Witnesses in Mumbai say the attackers singled out Americans and Britons in their attacks .
The group first emerged during a wave of bombings in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in November 2007 , sending an e-mail to media outlets just before some of the bombs exploded .

Their next attacks were the Jaipur blasts .
On July 25 , eight small bomb attacks in Bangalore killed at least one person and wounded 15 .
There was no known claim of responsibility .
But a day later , at least 16 bombs exploded in Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat , killing 45 and wounding 161 .
Shortly before the blasts , an e-mail in the name of the Indian Mujahideen was sent to local media warning that people would soon ' feel the terror of death ' in the name of Allah .
It said the attacks were revenge for the Gujarat riots of 2002 , when around 2,500 people , most of them Muslims , were killed by Hindu mobs .
A later e-mail accused several state governments of harassing , imprisoning and torturing Muslims and threatened consequences if they did not stop .
In September , at least five bombs exploded in crowded markets and streets in New Delhi , killing at least 18 people .
A guest is rescued from the fourth floor of the Taj Hotel .
At least 101 people have been killed in the attacks
The Indian Mujahideen sent out an e-mail moments after the first blast in New Delhi , saying the explosions were to prove its capability to strike in the most secure of Indian cities .
All previous incidents in which the Indian Mujahideen are suspected of involvement involved co-ordinated serial bombs .
The Mumbai attacks also show clear signs of co-ordination but were carried out by gunmen , some carrying grenades .
The tactics - a military - style assault on soft targets , singling out foreigners , and taking hostages - are rare and do not fit the usual methods of militant attacks on civilian areas .
However , similar attacks have been carried out before , notably the May 2004 attacks in the eastern Saudi city of Khobar .
Gunmen attacked two oil industry installations and a foreign workers ' housing complex in the city , taking more than 50 hostages and killing 22 of them .
The attackers asked hostages whether they were Christian or Muslim before deciding whom to kill .

Why does all this copyright reform stuff matter , anyway ?
What 's at stake ?
Everything .
Until a very short time ago , copyright was an industrial regulation .
If you fell under copyright 's domain , it meant that you were using a piece of extraordinary industrial apparatus  a printing press , a motion - picture camera , a record press .
The cost of this apparatus was significant , so adding a couple hundred bucks for the services of a skilled copyright attorney to the deal was n't much of a hardship .
It merely tacked a couple percentage points of overhead onto the cost of doing business .
When non-industrial entities ( e.g. , people , schools , church groups , etc. ) interacted with copyrighted works , they did things that copyright law did n't have anything to say about : they read books , they listened to music , they sang around the piano or went to the movies .
They discussed this stuff .
They sang it in the shower .
Retold it ( with variations ) to the kids at bedtime .
Quoted it .
Painted murals for the kids ' room based on it .
Then came the early days of the copyfight : the analog period , when VCRs , double - cassette - decks , photocopiers , and other proto - copying technology came along .
Now it was possible to do things that rose to the realm of copyright 's regulated activities ( copying , performing , displaying , adapting ) with stuff lying around the house .
Dealer rooms at cons sometimes sported crudely bound fanfic " novels , " teenagers courted each other with mix tapes , you could bring some HBO over to the neighbors ' on VHS cassette and have a movie party .
And yet , there was comparatively little danger in this process .
Although these activities were of dubious legality ( certainly , the big rightsholder groups considered them technological suitcase nukes , comparing the VCR to the Boston Strangler and promising that " home taping is killing music " ) , the cost of enforcement was very high .
Publishers and record labels and studios could n't watch what you did at home and work and parties and cons , not without an expensive network of paid snitches whose salaries would exceed any losses they were experiencing .
Enter the Internet and the personal computer .
These two technologies represent a perfect storm for bringing ordinary peoples ' ordinary activity into the realm of copyright : every household has the apparatus to commit mass acts of infringement ( the PC ) and those infringements take place over a public conduit ( the Internet ) that can be cheaply monitored , allowing for low - cost enforcement against ordinary people by the thousand .
What 's more , Internet transactions are more apt to commit a copyright offense than their offline equivalents .
That 's because every transaction on the Internet involves copies .
The Internet is a system for efficiently making copies between computers .
Whereas a conversation in your kitchen involves mere perturbations of air by noise , the same conversation on the net involves making thousands of copies .
Every time you press a key , the keypress is copied several times on your computer , then copied into your modem , then copied onto a series of routers , thence ( often ) to a server , which may make hundreds of copies both ephemeral and long - term , and then to the other party ( ies ) to the conversation , where dozens more copies might be made .
Copyright law valorizes copying as a rare and noteworthy event .
On the Internet , copying is automatic , massive , instantaneous , free , and constant .
Clip a Dilbert cartoon and stick it on your office door and you 're not violating copyright .
Take a picture of your office door and put it on your homepage so that the same co-workers can see it , and you 've violated copyright law , and since copyright law treats copying as such a rarified activity , it assesses penalties that run to the hundreds of thousands of dollars for each act of infringement .
There 's a word for all the stuff we do with creative works  all the conversing , retelling , singing , acting out , drawing , and thinking : we call it culture .
Culture 's old .
It 's older than copyright .
The existence of culture is why copyright is valuable .
The fact that we have a bottomless appetite for songs to sing together , for stories to share , for art to see and add to our visual vocabulary is the reason that people will pay money easy payday loans for these things .
Let me say that again : the reason copyright exists is because culture creates a market for creative works .
If there was no market for creative works , there 'd be no reason to care about copyright .
Content is n't king : culture is .
The reason we go to the movies is to have something to talk about .
If I sent you to a desert island and told you to choose between your records and your friends , you 'd be a sociopath if you chose the music .
Culture 's imperative is to share information : culture is shared information .
Science fiction readers know this : the guy across from you on the subway with a gaudy SF novel in his hands is part of your group .
You two have almost certainly read some of the same books , you 've got some shared cultural referents , some things to talk about .
When you hear a song you love , you play it for the people in your tribe .
When you read a book you love , you shove it into the hands of your friends to encourage them to read it too .
When you see a great show , you get your friends to watch it too  or you seek out the people who 've already watched it and strike up a conversation with them .
So the natural inclination of anyone who is struck by a piece of creative work is to share it .
And since " sharing " on the Internet is the same as " copying , " this puts you square in copyright 's crosshairs .
Everyone copies .
Dan Glickman , the ex-Congressman who now heads up the Motion Picture Association of America ( as pure a copyright maximalist as you could hope to meet ) admitted to copying Kirby Dick 's documentary This Film is Not Yet Rated ( a scorching critique of the MPAA 's rating system ) but excused it because the copy was " in [ his ] vault . "
To pretend that you do not copy is to adopt the twisted hypocrisy of the Victorians who swore that they never , ever masturbated .
Everyone knows that they themselves are lying , and a large number of us know that everyone else is lying too .
But copyright 's problem is that most of the copyists cheerfully admit that they copy .
The majority of American Internet users engage in infringing file - sharing .
If file - sharing were stamped out tomorrow , they 'd swap the same files  and more  by trading hard drives , or thumb drives , or memory cards ( and more data would change hands , albeit more slowly ) .
Copyists either know that they infringe but do n't care , or they believe that the law can't possibly criminalize what they 're doing and assume that it punishes more egregious forms of copying , such as selling pirate DVDs in the street .
In fact , copyright law penalizes selling DVDs at a much lower level than sharing the same movies over the Internet for free , and the risk of buying one of these DVDs is much lower ( thanks to the high costs of enforcement against people making transactions in the real world ) than the risk of downloading them online .
Indeed , copyists are busily building an elaborate ethos of what can and can't be shared , and with whom , and under what circumstances .
They join private sharing circles , argue norms among themselves , and in word and deed create a plethora of " para - copyrights " that reflect a cultural understanding of what they 're meant to be doing .
The tragedy is that these para - copyrights have almost nothing in common with actual copyright law .
No matter how hard you adhere to them , you 're probably breaking the law  so if you 're in making anime music videos ( videos for pop music made by cleverly splicing together clips of anime movies  google for " amv " to see examples ) , you can abide by all the rules of your group about not showing them to outsiders and only using certain sources for music and video , but you 're still committing millions of dollars ' worth of infringement every time you sit down to your keyboard .
It 's not surprising that para - copyright and copyright do n't have much to say to one another .
After all , copyright regulates what giant companies do with each other .
Para - copyright regulates what individuals do with each other in a cultural settings .
Why be surprised that these rulesets are so disjointed ?
It 's entirely possible that there 's a detente to be reached between the copyists and the copyright holders : a set of rules that only try to encompass " culture " and not " industry . "
But the only way to bring copyists to the table is to stop insisting that all unauthorized copying is theft and a crime and wrong .
People who know that copying is simple , good , and beneficial hear that and assume that you 're either talking nonsense or that you 're talking about someone else .
Because if copying on the Internet were ended tomorrow , it would be the end of culture on the Internet too .
YouTube would vanish without its storehouse of infringing clips ; LiveJournal would be dead without all those interesting little user - icons and those fascinating pastebombs from books , news - stories and blogs ;
Flickr would dry up and blow away without all those photos of copyrighted , trademarked and otherwise protected objects , works , and scenes .
These conversations are why we want the things we 're conversing about .
Fanfic is written by people who love books .
YouTube clips are made by people who want you to watch the shows they 're taken from and discuss them .
LJ icons demonstrate affinity for works .
If culture loses the copyright wars , the reason for copyright dies with it .

For a long time I wanted to do an interview with one of the GIMP developers .
Then I came across Martin Nordholts ( aka enselic ) website and read the following description of his involvement with GIMP :
Here is my list of most critical features GIMP needs and which I intend to help bring into existance :
High bit deepth editing through GEGL
Non-destructive editing through GEGL
A completely color managed workflow
Native CMYK and spot color support
I decided he was the man and bugged him for an interview .
So here is one of the core contributors to GIMP telling us about the current state of affairs , helping us to understand what is going on deep inside the GIMP ( and GEGL ) as well as lifting a corner of the veil about what is to come .
Martin , thanks a lot for taking the time for this interview .
For a start , can you tell us a few words about yourself and your involvement in GIMP ?
After my first GIMP contribution in October 2006 I gradually became more and more involved and now I am doing more or less daily contributions including fixing bugs , maintaining bug reports , reviewing and merging code and working on new features .
I occasionally contribute to the GEGL framework too but GIMP gets most of my time .
In my day job I work as a software developer for a well known mobile phone manufacturer .
Speaking from a photographer ’s point of view , there is a long wait for features such as color management , higher bit depth editing or “ effect layers ” to be included in GIMP .
Now that GEGL gets ready for “ prime time ” , how will its use in GIMP allow these features ?
When GEGL is fully integrated , GIMP will offer high bit depth and non destructive editing including so called effect layers .
Color management is a separate issue and a high quality color management work flow will require work both on the GEGL framework and the GIMP core .
With the 2.6 version of GIMP recently out , GEGL is used in GIMP for some operations .
How much more work is there on GEGL to be ready to be used full swing in GIMP ?
For GIMP 2.6 most color operations were ported to GEGL .
For GIMP 2.8 we are as good as done porting the projection code to GEGL as well .
The projection code is what combines the layers into a single composite i.e. image .
With the image structure represented as a GEGL graph it is easy to insert non-destructive nodes and I know Øyvind has done some prototyping which as far as I understand was mostly painless .
One could say that GIMP has an isolated core capable of high bit - depth and non-destructive editing .
What needs to be done is adapt code so that users can make full use of this currently isolated core .
It is impossible and pointless to speculate about a specific date when this will be complete .
We can only establish that work is being made and will eventually be finished .
How was the integration of GEGL in GIMP 2.6 ?
Do you feel that the ground work done in the previous GIMP versions is bearing good fruits and the process was relatively simple or would you rather describe it as “ painful ” ?
The work that has been done so far ( including for 2.8 ) has been fairly straightforward .
As often is the case it just takes some dedicated time for thinking and hacking .
Now the questions I have been dying to ask for so long ( and I am probably not the only one … ) .
How far are we from seeing the different features previously mentioned being included in GIMP ?
Maybe we can talk about color management first : it is there now in GIMP ’s preference and in the image menu .
I feel I have all I need for a color managed workflow , but do you plan on adding a few more “ bells & whistle ” ( print proofing ) ?
Does the current code need heavy refactoring to be GEGL compatible ?
I am myself interested in improving the color management but I will not put any major effort into it before GEGL is almost completely integrated .
Speculating in specific dates is again impossible and pointless .
Some hacker might turn up and start working on this right away , or it might take several years before anyone find enough time and motivation to improve the situation .
The next question is about higher bit depth – a subject dear to a photographer ’s heart .
If a 8 bits / channel is being assumed everywhere in the code , I can imagine that changing that assumption means refactoring everything .
Is that correct ?
What are the main challenges to see a higher bit / channel version of GIMP ?
Since GEGL is a new framework it really is n’t a matter of rewriting the 8 bpc legacy code , but rather replacing that code entirely .
It will make sense to write wrappers for legacy components so that they can be used with the new framework as well , but that ’s not really rewriting code .
I do n’t really see any major challenges regarding higher bit depth , code just needs to be written .
Long term plans does not work well in a project driven by volunteers , but there are some loose plans .
If nothing goes wrong GIMP 2.8 will have the projection code ported to GEGL .
When that is done the next natural step is starting to really use the new framework and its high bith - depth and non-destructivenss .
Maybe GIMP 2.10 will make use of this somehow .
Now what about “ effect layers ” or even better : non destructive editing ( a wicked cool feature , if you ask me ) ?
Non-destructiveness will be easier because legacy 8 bpc code paths can still be used to transfer data .
Higher bit - depth will be harder due the need for new / more general code paths .
Color management is the hardest part because it affects the entire image editing pipeline .
This also asks for a question about UI design – image editing is a complex task and a simple UI for a complex task is not easy ?
The UI team ( mostly Peter Sikking ) is giving valuable input .
I know there are plans for a user interface to non-destructive features but I do n’t remember any details right now .
Are there some more features which you would like to mention ?
There have been discussions about a single - window tabb - based interface that can probably interest a few people .
Recent refactorings has also made progress towards better handling of the floating selection and support for layer groups which might even make it for GIMP 2.8 .
GIMP 2.8 will also feature three Google Summer of Code projects that are in progress of being merged , namely simple vector layer support , on - canvas text editing and tagging of GIMP resources .
Where are the areas where GIMP would benefit from help ?
I do n’t really believe in calling for help .
If people are interested in helping they will help , otherwise they wo n’t .
People in all areas are appreciated .
Developers , bug report maintainers , website maintainers , documentation writers etc etc .
I know you may or may not be interested in photography 🙂 but what is your opinion on the status of open source software for photography in general ?
I must admit I am not very much of a photographer .
Photography interests me but I never have time to really do something serious .
I am in other words not the right person to judge the quality of open source photography from a professional point of view .
But we can all see that programs are constantly evolving and new ones are popping up so the situation is continuously improving .
Playing the devil ’s advocate : with RAW developers becoming more and more powerful and able to treat different types of image files , is there still a place for a “ good old editor ” like GIMP ?
What can I say , if some other image editor surpasses GIMP in terms of features then so be it .
I suspect though that once we have finished the work we are doing currently doing , GIMP will be very attractive to the people currently turning to dedicated programs for high - bit depth RAW processing for example .
I find competition ( if one can use that term ) nothing but interesting .
Martin thank you very much for your time .

Voter registration
This section details threats to voters from and problems with the state 's voter registration system .
Things you can do :
Add info on registration or other related topics .
Verification , database and rejection
November 6 , 2008 .
Up to 35,000 voters in Franklin County may have been required to vote on provisional ballots on election day , after a data - processing error incorrectly flagged them as ineligible to vote .
[ 1 ]
Phone calls to the County Board of Elections notified them of the problem , and poll workers were told at approx .
9:30 a.m. on election day to allow flagged voters to cast regular ballots .
It is unknown how many people were affected ; Deputy County Elections Director Matthew Damschroder says that a full investigation will take place after other mandatory election work has been completed .
[ 1 ]
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner criticized the county for the flagging error .
" We 'll be closely monitoring that situation , and we will work with the board to determine why the error occurred so that we can prevent that from happening again , " Brunner said . [ 1 ]
Common Cause rated Ohio's registration registration procedures as " unsatisfactory , " citing , " Name , driver ’s license number , birth date , Social Security number , and current address are used for verifying registrant ’s eligibility through a statewide database .
There are no matching standards currently in effect .
The state has not issued any statements regarding the matching system it is using , or how it is coordinating its registration database with other statewide databases as is required by HAVA . " [ 2 ]
Notification and appeal
Common Cause rated Ohio's registration notification procedures as " unsatisfactory , " citing , " Boards of elections no longer required to notify registrants that their registration applications have been rejected . " [ 2 ]
3rd party registration
NVRA implementation
Common Cause rated this as " inconclusive , " citing , " State reports it is in compliance with § 7 provisions of NVRA ; independent research suggests that these provisions are not being fully enforced , or that there has been a significant drop - off in the extent to which the state is enforcing the provision .
Secretary of State has implemented a NVRA leadership team to increase NVRA implementation in agencies . " [ 2 ]
Student voting rights
Common Cause rated this as " mixed , " citing , " The Ohio Secretary of State ’s website says that students may register to vote so long as they intend “ to reside permanently in the Ohio county ” where their “ school residence address is located . ”
Student identification or a university utility bill with the student ’s address suffices as voter identification . " [ 2 ]
Felon voting rights
Quoting from an October , 2008 report [ 3 ] on " de facto disenfranchisement " ( summary ) ( download PDF ) co-published by the Brennan Center for Justice and the ACLU :
" Ohio [...] permits those convicted of misdemeanors to vote .
But interviews with local election officials in 2008 revealed that 30 % responded incorrectly or expressed uncertainty about whether or not individuals with misdemeanor convictions could vote .
Most troubling , a representative from the Ohio Secretary of State ’s office advised that individuals incarcerated for misdemeanors may not vote in Ohio . "

Common Cause rated
Ohio's sample ballot practices in 2008 as " mixed , " saying that only " some counties provide sample ballots on their websites , " while " some counties send sample ballots to voters , " and that , by law , " sample ballots may be printed by the board of elections . " ( emphasis added ) [ 2 ]
Common Cause rated Ohio's language accessibility as " inconclusive , " because the information is only available in English . [ 2 ]
Common Cause rated Ohio's voting machine education as " unsatisfactory , " saying that some counties provide voting machine demonstrations at local events . [ 2 ]
Absentee and early voting

Oct 31 , 2008 : Approx .
2700 absentee ballots have been set aside by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections due to mistakes in how the ballots were placed in their return envelopes .
Notifications were sent to those affected , who have until Nov. 14 to correct the errors . [ 4 ]
September , 2008 .
There are multiple reports [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] that absentee ballot applications sent by the McCain campaign were invalidated because of a flawed form .
" The form contained an extra box to check indicating you were a registered voter -- respondents who sent back the form without checking the box will not receive absentee ballots as per their request .
The Board of Elections found that although the box was not required on the form , returning the form without checking the box is tantamount to requesting a ballot without being a registered voter . " [ 9 ]

Voter caging , purging and other eligibility challenges
Note : please also see section " Voter Registration : Verification , database and rejection " at top of page for current news items .
November 24 , 2008 .
Following the charges of " vote fraud " that were used to justify the efforts to block registrations of tens or hundreds of thousands of voters , there were a total of two ( 2 ) reports of problem votes . [ 10 ]
November 4 , 2008 .
Election Protection coalition reports many voters showing up to vote and finding they are not on the registration rolls , particularly Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) and Franklin County ( Columbus ) . [ 11 ]
September 20 , 2008 .
Project Vote warns that " significant numbers of minority voters will be included on the county - generated caging lists " if voters are removed without a hearing after the state mailed letters marked " Do not forward " and over 500,000 were returned as undeliverable [ 12 ] .
In September , 2008 , the Ohio Republican party sued the Ohio Secretary of State in an attempt to block 666,000 new voters from being added to the registration rolls . [ 13 ]
On October 15 , 2008 , a federal court ruled that Ohio had until the following Friday to set up a system to verify the eligibility of about 666,000 newly registered voters and make the information available to the state 's 88 county election boards . [ 14 ] .
This ruling threatened to disenfranchise more than 200,000 of the newly - registered Ohio voters . [ 15 ]
Two days later the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in , ruling that the voters could remain on the voting rolls . [ 16 ]
Following this ruling Ohio Secretary of State Brunner , a Democrat , received death threats , suspicious packages containing white powder in the mail and threatening phone calls . [ 17 ]
On October 25 President Bush , in an unprecedented pre-election move , ordered the Justice Department to " look into " whether 200,000 new Ohio voters must reconfirm their registration information . [ 18 ]
On October 29 the Justice Department declined to require the state to disclose the names of voters whose data did not exactly match other databases . [ 19 ]
On September 30 , 2008 , the Brennan Center for Justice released a comprehensive report on voter purging [ 20 ] .
Appendix A [ 21 ] of the report , titled Ohio Case Study , begins , " As of the 2006 election , Ohio had 7,860,052 registered voters , and the state reported that 416,744 registrants ( 5.3 % of total registrants ) were deleted from the registration rolls in 2006 . "
Purging methods listed in the case study are :
Change of Address .
The report says
Ohio does not have consistent methods for determining whether voters have changed their address ; no consistent criteria for matching names of voters to address change lists ; there is no consistent deadline for registrants to respond to a confirmation notice -- all giving counties wide latitude in deciding who to remove .
Duplicates .
Ohio does not have consistent methods for removing duplicate registrations , sometimes resulting in the removal pof voters with similar names or addresses .
Death .
Different counties use different methods for determining whether a voter has died .
Some use obituaries , which do not include addresses , and the wrong voter can be removed .
Criminal Conviction .
While Ohio law says people cannot vote while incarcerated , many counties remove voters after incarceration , even if incarcerated for as little as an hour .
There are no procedures for ensuring that npeople with similar names are not removed .
Adjudication of Mental Incapacitation .
Ohio does not have " clear and consistent protocols governing this type of removal to ward off the temptation to purge inappropriately . "
Voter Inactivity .
At least one county sends confirmation notices after each election to all those who did not vote in the election .
In other counties the boards of elections send confirmation notices in odd years to any registrant who did not vote in the last two federal general elections .
Voters must then update their information to remain registered .

Voter ID requirements
Nov. 4 , 2008 : Confusion over what constitutes valid I.D. has led some polling location judges to issue provisional ballots in error .
According to Hamilton County Board of Elections Director Sally Krisel , a state - issued photo I.D. with an incorrect or outdated address still constitutes valid I.D. , but poll workers unclear on the law are still requiring provisional ballots in some cases . [ 25 ]
Polling place accessibility and wait times
Nov. 2 , 2008 .
Sunday 's wait times in Columbus , Ohio reached up to six hours for early voting . [ 26 ] According to Franklin County Spokesman Michael Stinziano , lines began forming at 6:30 a.m. -- well before the polls opened at 1 p.m. -- and remained long throughout the day .
All voters who were in line by 5 p.m. would be allowed to vote . [ 26 ]
Voting machine and ballot distribution
The Advancement Project warns that " an inadequate number of voting machines and poll workers could result in extremely long lines " in Ohio . [ 27 ]
" The Advancement Project , founded seven years ago by a group of civil rights lawyers , said an inadequate number of voting machines and poll workers could result in extremely long lines in battleground states .
" What we 're seeing now in Toledo , Lucas County , and more broadly across the state and all the states are insufficient resources to accommodate everybody who wants to vote , " said Jim Freeman , Project Advancement staff attorney .
" That could lead to wide disparities in precincts across jurisdictions if machines are allocated inefficiently .
We 're concerned about a disproportionate effect on communities of color . "
Common Cause rated this as " unsatisfactory , " citing , " Law calls for there to be a “ sufficient ” number of voting booths . " [ 2 ]
In suburban Shaker Heights in Cuyahoga County , the first four voters were only issued the second page of the ballots , which did not include the presidential slate .
Board of Elections spokeswoman Kimberly Bartlett said that the ballots were subsequently voided , and correct ballots issued in their place . [ 28 ]

11/8/2004 Lucas County .
" Technical issues , " difficulties with the memory cards , and " problems with the new technology " ( Diebold touch screens ) were some of the causes of the " chaos " in the election .
Chain of custody issues , too : " But the scene at midnight was one of chaos on the third floor , with the special red and green bags holding memory cartridges and printed tapes of votes lining the hallways , piled on the floor in the elections office , and dumped in a large cart sitting unattended near the elevators . " [ 24 ]
11/8/2004 Delays in many counties were attributed to machine problems and lack of training in the 44 counties that used new touch screens and optical scanners in this election . [ 24 ]
11/8/2004 Medina County .
The new Diebold touch screen system reported incomplete results as complete , because the computer program that made that determination was based on polling places , not on the number of precincts .
David Baer , spokesman for Diebold Elections Systems , said that they can report results in a number of ways and that first - time users often find they need to tweak the reporting programs to get the kinds of reports they need . [ 24 ]

Ballot design
Provisional ballots
This section lists past and potential election threats caused by the state 's laws , regulations and practices on provisional ballots .
Particularly , what are the state 's criteria for receiving a provisional ballot ( including voting in the wrong precinct ) and its procedures for verifying eligibility and then including those votes in the totals .

Add info on registration or other related topics .
Preliminary tallies show that Ohioans cast 193,000 provisional ballots in 2008 , an increase of almost 22 % from 2004 — despite there being fewer votes cast overall .
The increase has led to calls for an examination of the use of provisionals in the state and demands for more research into the cause .
While historically a high portion of provisional ballots have been accepted in Ohio ( 81 % in 2006 ) , concerns about future delays and lawsuits continue to mount . [ 30 ]
Under election law , boards of elections cannot even begin counting provisional ballots until Nov. 13 .
Because that 's a Saturday , many boards may wait until Nov. 15 , the following Monday , to begin counting . [ 24 ]
Criteria
Eligibility verification
Common Cause rated this as " unsatisfactory , " citing , " Provisional ballots are counted if : a local election authority determines that the voter who cast the ballot is eligible to vote in that precinct ; the voter did not bring proper identifi cation to the polls but presents identification to the board of elections within ten days of the election . " [ 2 ]
Ballots cast in wrong precinct
Common Cause rated this as " unsatisfactory , " citing , " Provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct will not be counted . " [ 2 ]
According to an October , 2008 Demos study , [ 31 ]
Over 10,600 provisional ballots were rejected in Ohio in 2006 because they were cast in the wrong precinct .
Ohio alone accounted for over one in three of the provisional ballots so rejected nationwide .
In Cuyahoga County , 34 percent of these invalid provisional votes were cast in the correct polling place , though the wrong precinct .
Another 30 percent were cast within two miles of the voters ’ correct precincts .
6
This is especially troubling because Ohio law requires poll workers to direct voters to their correct precinct prior to issuing a provisional ballot .

Ohio as one of the states .
Tens of thousands of eligible voters in at least six swing states have been removed from the rolls or have been blocked from registering in ways that appear to violate federal law , according to a review of state records and Social Security data by The New York Times . [. . .]
The screening or trimming of voter registration lists in the six states — Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina — could also result in problems at the polls on Election Day : people who have been removed from the rolls are likely to show up only to be challenged by political party officials or election workers , resulting in confusion , long lines and heated tempers .

The grape - sized Gromia sphaerica , a distant relative of microscopic amoebas , had previously been discovered lying motionless at the bottom of the Arabian Sea .
But when Assistant Professor Mikhail Matz of the University of Texas and a group of researchers stumbled across a group of G. sphaerica off the coast of the Bahamas , the creatures were leaving trails behind them up to 50 centimetres long in the mud .
The trouble is that these single celled critters , also known as giant deep sea protists , are n't supposed to be able to leave trails .
Trace fossils
The oldest fossils of animal trails , called ' trace fossils ' , date to around 580 million years ago , and palaeontologists believed they must have been made by multicellular animals with complex , symmetrical bodies .
But G. sphaerica's traces are the spitting image of the old , Precambrian fossils ; two small ridges line the outside of the trail , and one thin bump runs down the middle .
At up to three centimetres in diameter , they 're enormous compared to most of their microscopic cousins .
" If these guys were alive 600 million years ago , and their traces got fossilised , a palaeontologist who had never seen this thing would not have a shade of doubt attributing this kind of trace to the activity of a big , multicellular , bilaterally symmetrical animal , " says Matz .
" This is a very important discovery , " says Professor Shuhai Xiao of Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
" The fact that protists can make traces has important implications for how we interpret many trace fossils . "
The finding could overturn conventional thinking on the evolution of early life during a period known as the Cambrian explosion .
Until about 550 million years ago , there were very few animals leaving trails behind .
Then , within ten million years an unprecedented blossoming of life swarmed across the planet , filling every niche with hard - bodied , complex creatures .
" It was n't a gradual development of complexity , " says Matz .
" Instead these things suddenly seemed to burst out of a magic box . "
Species explosion
Charles Darwin first noticed the Cambrian explosion and thought it was an artefact of a poorly preserved fossil record .
The precambrian trace fossils were left by multicellular animals , he reasoned , so there must be some gap in fossils between the nearly empty Precambrian and the teeming world that quickly followed .
But if the first traces were instead made by G. sphaerica , it would mean the explosion was real ; it must have been a diversification of life on a scale never before seen .
Genetic analysis of the water - filled G. sphaerica cells also reveals tantalizing clues that it could be the oldest living fossil on the planet .
" There 's a 1.8 billion - year - old fossil in the Stirling formation in Australia that looks just like one of their traces , and with a discoidal body impression similar to these guys , " says Matz .
" We have n't proved anything , but we might be looking at the ultimate living macroscopic fossil . "
Hairy Tongue :
This is a relatively rare condition whose appearance is due to the elongation of filiform papillae .
These papillae have a mechanical abrasive function .
These papillae do not contain taste buds
This condition can be caused by poor oral hygiene , chronic oral irritation or smoking .
The far right picture shows a patient who was a heavy smoker and has been treated with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer .
Radiation therapy causes a dry mouth with chronic oral inflammation .
Treatment involves good oral hygiene , brushing of the tongue , mouth rinses and sometimes the trimming of the elongated papilla .
The picture to the left is the same patient two months later after improvement in his oral hygiene .
Black Hairy Tongue :
This patient has a black hairy tongue which was caused , at least in part , by significant gastroesophageal reflux .
Control of her reflux along with the use of a topical anti-fungal medication ( Nystatin ) , cessation of smoking and bushing of her tongue resulted in marked improvement .

Leukoplakia is a white patch which can occur in the oral cavity .
It is often caused by chronic irritation or infection but can also be a cancerous or precancerous lesion .
In this patient the leukoplakia had areas of redness called erythroplakia .
Erythroplakia often represents a cancer .
On biopsy , the patient was found to have a fungal infection .
Fungal infections of the oral cavity may often mimic a cancer both on gross appearance and sometimes even histologically .
A condition called pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia can cause a similar appearance and pathologically can be mistaken for cancer .

Shingles ( Herpes Zoster ) : Shingles are caused by the Herpes Zoster Virus .
They occur many years after an individual has had chicken pox .
Once a patient has had chicken pox , they will carry the virus for the rest of their life .
When the patient does not have symptoms , the virus is in a dormant state residing cell bodies of nerve tissue .
Over the years , a patient 's antibody levels fall and the dormant virus emerges .
The virus causes lesions to erupt on the skin in the regions that are innervated by the infected nerve .
In the right - hand picture , the lesions are seen on the patient 's right jaw and right half of his tongue .
This corresponds to the lower division of the trigeminal nerve ( V cranial nerve ) and the lingual nerve ( XII cranial nerve ) .

The torus to the right has a chronic non-healing ulceration exposing a focus of dead bone .
This patient had been on Fosamax for five years .
Fosamax is a bisphosphonate , a medication used to treat osteoporosis .
This patient also had ear surgery ( mastoidectomy ) three years previously , while on Fosamax for two years , without any problems .
A year later and off of Fosamax the bony sequestra fell off and the palate healed without surgery .
Fosamax inhibits bone resorption by suppressing the activity of the cells which remodel bone , osteoclasts .
Some patients taking Fosamax have been found to form dead bone in their jaws ( mandibular necrosis ) .
This is especially true if the patient has infected teeth or trauma to the overlying mucosa .
Less frequently , this complication has been found to occur in the upper jaw bone or palate ( maxilla ) .
Treatment is difficult since any trauma or surgery to the area may expand the bone loss .

Phemphigoid : Bullous phemphigoid is an auto - immune disease which causes blistering of the skin .
It can involve the mucous membranes in 10 % to 25 % of patients .
Blisters form when antibodies attack proteins in the basement membrane of the skin ( between the dermis and epidermis ) .
Many cases are self limited and go into remission in five years or less .
However , severe cases may require treatment with corticosteroids and immunosupressive agents .
Phemphigoid should not be confused with Phemphigus Vulgaris which is a much more aggressive disease .
In Phemphigus Vulgaris antibodies attack proteins called desmogleins .
Desmogleins are the proteins which hold the skin together .
Diagnosis of Phemphigoid and Phemphigus requires biopsy .

Too much credit and easy money .
Those were the biggest culprits behind this financial crisis .
Yet , apallingly , the government 's rescue attempt is built on more credit and even easier money .
That 's like giving a procrastinator a deadline extension .
By choosing this course , Washington has steered us on to the " road to Weimar " – the road to runaway inflation .
It did n't have to come to this .
And it still does n't .
But the proper remedy will take tremendous political courage : Bring back the gold standard .
That , more than any byzantine regulations that emerge from the Bretton Woods II conference this weekend , would provide stability and safety for nations and individuals around the world .
Sadly , current policy seems to reflect a desire to weaken the dollar as quickly as possible .
The Federal Reserve 's own data tells the story .
The headline is the doubling of Federal Reserve credit , the main component of the US monetary base .
Since Labor Day 2008 , it 's risen from $ 894 billion to $ 2.2 trillion .
That 's the greatest monetary expansion in the Fed 's 95 - year history .
How the Fed is doing it matters almost as much .
It has nearly abandoned its traditional instrument for monetary policy , open - market operations , which involves the purchasing and selling of full - faith - and - credit US Treasury securities .
With increasing frequency and amounts , it has relied primarily on " discount window operations " – lending to specific institutions for specific purposes instead of general injections of funds into an open market – since August 2007 .
This shift may weaken its ability to " tighten " monetary conditions should inflation reach dangerous levels .
A gold standard offers exactly the kind of discipline that 's missing from the Fed .
But its impact would be wider : Both in substance and in symbolism , gold provides integrity to the entire global financial system .
Governments , however , have historically bridled at the constraint and accountability a gold standard brings .
After all , when currency can be exchanged for gold , it 's harder for governments to inflate the money supply , which they 're tempted to do in order to spend beyond their means or cheat on their debts .
Before 1933 , you could , generally speaking , trade a US dollar for a set amount of gold .
That gave the dollar strength and stability .
During World War I , when European governments abandoned gold and inflated their currencies to pay for the war effort , the US maintained its gold backing .
In 1933 , however , to enable the Treasury to finance massive new government spending hailed as an economic recovery package – sound familiar ?
– President Roosevelt suspended domestic transactions in gold , and reduced the dollar 's gold value .
Finally , in 1971 , President Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard .
The dollar – and inflation – has fluctuated wildly ever since .
Today 's
Fed thus faces virtually no constraints .
Were a gold standard in place , it could not possibly have doubled its balance sheet in only seven weeks without triggering a wholesale flight from the dollar analogous to the summer of 1971 .
Weimar Germany experienced one of the greatest inflations in modern history in 1922 and 1923 .
Eventually , the official exchange rate reached 4.2 trillion marks per dollar .
Some Germans heated their homes by burning cash , since it was cheaper than buying wood .
The inflation finally was tamed by government bonds promising repayment in gold , backed by land taxes also payable in gold .
Today , if the US price level responded directly with the Fed 's current rate of expansion of its own credit , then the technical conditions for Weimar - style hyperinflation could be upon us .
Fortunately , Fed credit expansion acts on the domestic price level with a significant time lag .
But could it tighten monetary conditions if it had to , having shifted its reliance to the discount window and the specific projects being financed there ?
That 's why a conversation about a gold standard is needed .
But could it realistically make a comeback ?
Anna J. Schwartz , who co-wrote with Milton Friedman the highly influential book , " A Monetary History of the United States : 1867 -1960 , " suggested at a 2004 gold conference at the American Institute for Economic Research that only a crisis of sufficient depth and magnitude would provoke the public to demand the stability of gold or a gold - linked currency .
Such a crisis , which appeared remote at the time , may soon be upon us .
There 's another significant point that Ms. Schwartz raised in 2004 :
The size of government itself would have to shrink radically to permit a complete return to gold .
Before 1933 , the share of gross domestic product represented by government at all levels was about 10 percent .
Today , the national average of that share is about 35 percent .
Any adjustment to economic shocks has to be absorbed by a proportionately much smaller private sector than was the case 75 years ago .
Some critics worry that a return to gold would make credit harder to come by .
It 's true that the kind of ultra-loose credit that fuels housing bubbles would be marginalized , but normal credit in a gold system would tend to be cheaper because concerns about the future value of repayments are diminished .
America faces a stark choice .
The path back to a gold standard is rocky and uphill .
The current inflationary path is slippery and downhill .
One leads to integrity and stability .
The other could lead to financial ruin .
Which will we choose ?

Israeli aircraft attacked Hamas targets in Gaza today , the third day of an offensive that has killed more than 300 Palestinians , many of them civilians .
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency said at least 57 of the dead were civilians .
It based the figure , which an UNRWA spokesman called " conservative " , on visits by agency officials to hospitals and medical centres .

Hamas defied the strongest assault against Palestinian militants in decades by launching a rocket attack on Israel that killed one person , the second such fatality since Saturday .
Most Gazans in the densely populated enclave stayed at home , in rooms away from windows that could shatter in blasts from air strikes on Hamas facilities .
Residents of southern Israel ran for shelter at the sound of alarms heralding incoming rockets .
" At no time could we leave the kids unattended .
They trembled every time there was a bombing , day and night , and all of us had almost no sleep , " said Umm Hassan , a mother of seven .
An Israeli air raid flattened a building in the heart of a residential neighbourhood in Gaza , sending a cloud of dust into the air , shaking nearby dwellings and wounding five people .
It was not immediately clear why the structure , which was apparently empty , was targeted .
Israel declared areas around Gaza a " closed military zone " , citing the risk from Palestinian rocket fire , and ordering journalists observing a buildup of armoured forces to leave .
" You 've got to go , " an army spokesman told a Reuters correspondent after she appealed a military police directive to clear out .
Excluding the press could help Israel keep under wraps its preparations for a possible ground assault against Hamas , the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza , following three days of air strikes that have caused chaos , turned some buildings to rubble and left hospitals struggling to cope .

In the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon , a rocket launched from the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip killed one person .
Mark Regev , a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , said the military action , launched after a six - month ceasefire expired , would go on until the population in southern Israel " no longer live in terror and in fear of constant rocket barrages " .
Broadening their targets to include the Hamas government , Israeli warplanes bombed the Gaza Interior Ministry today , Palestinian sources said .
No immediate word was available on whether there were any casualties .
In what it called a " terrorist " attack , the Israeli military said a Palestinian stabbed three Israelis in the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba in the West Bank before he was shot by a passerby and arrested .
One of the wounded Israelis was in serious condition .
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum urged Palestinian groups on Sunday to use " all available means , including martyrdom operations " against Israel - a reference to suicide bombings during a Palestinian uprising that erupted in 2000 but has since died down .
The Gaza offensive has enraged Arabs across the Middle East .
Protesters burned Israeli and US flags in several places to press for a stronger response from their leaders .
Hamas said 180 of its members had been killed and that the rest of the more than 300 dead included civilians , among them 16 women and some children .
Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said Israel was targeting militants but " unfortunately in a war ... sometimes also civilians pay the price " .
Chief Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qurie said US - backed peace talks with Israel have been put on hold , citing the Gaza offensive .
The negotiations over the past year have achieved little visible progress .
The UN Security Council called for a halt to the violence , but US President George W Bush 's administration , in its final weeks in office , has put the onus on Hamas to renew the truce .
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said during a visit to Turkey that " Israel must stop its killing operations against Palestinians " .
He called for an immediate ceasefire .
A senior Israeli official dismissed any suggestion that Israel had acted now because it believed a window of opportunity was closing with Bush leaving office and Barack Obama preparing to enter the White House .
" Why should everything be connected to the United States ?
A far more important date for Israel is February 10 , " the official said , referring to the upcoming Israeli parliamentary election .
" It was n't politically sustainable for leaders in Israel to idly stand by and let Hamas continue shooting , " the official said .
His fifth birthday marked a particularly low point for her .
She had gone with her mother to meet a social worker in a car park , from where the pair expected to be driven to see the boy at a contact centre .
But on arriving , Mrs W was told she was barred from seeing him because approval had only been given to her mother .
" I was left on my own in this empty car park .
I was in bits , " she explains .
" L was so upset , asking my mother where I was and why I had n't been there for his birthday . "
Jim Sides , 55 , a Californian living in Bonn , is a swing voter who cast his ballot for President George W. Bush in 2004 .
This time the one single factor driving him to the Democratic ticket is the possibility that the Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin is a heartbeat away from the American presidency .
If John McCain is elected next Tuesday , the 72 - year - old Republican senator from Arizona , who has battled skin cancer , would become the oldest US president in history .
“ Let ’s say McCain does n’t make it health - wise -- then we ’d wind up with Caribou Barbie in the White House , ” Sides said , referring to the Alaskan governor ’s bouffant hairdo and the political lightweight impression Palin has made on millions of television viewers .
Sides , a CEO of Meyer Sound Germany , a division of the US manufacturer of professional loudspeakers , said he had been even leaning towards McCain before Palin entered the Republican ticket .
Feeling betrayed by McCain ’s choice
Sarah Palin lookalike being parodied on " Saturday Night Live "
“ I had a very high regard for John McCain based on my knowledge of his record as senator .
He was an honorable man , a war hero , but after he picked Palin , I felt he had betrayed his country , ” he said .
“ I was in a state of pure shock .
Leaving someone completely unqualified intellectually in a position to step into the Presidency was so irresponsible , ” Sides continued .
Sides ’ wife Lisa , who had also liked McCain , felt that the Vietnam veteran ’s extensive military experience could be valuable in finding a realistic exit strategy out of the morass in Iraq .
“ But picking her ( Palin ) pushed me over the edge towards Barack Obama .
McCain made that choice based on trying to win the election rather than having the best interests of our country in mind , ” she said .
Picking Palin alienated expat voters
The choice of Palin was meant to balance and galvanize the Republican ticket with a social conservative who could draw on the extreme , evangelical elements of the party as well as female Hillary voters .
But the move wound up alienating many of the US expatriates DW - WORLD .
DE spoke to in the old American settlement of Bonn ’s scenic Plittersdorf district on the Rhine River , where life revolves around the international school and English - language church .
US expats meet at Stimson Memorial Chapel in Bonn
All those interviewed said it was a key , if not the key reason , to vote for Barack Obama , whether they liked the Illinois senator or not .
The expatriates in the former German capital come from all over the map in the United States and reflect diverse political views .
They tend to be better off than their compatriots back home , since many are managers at blue chip US multinational companies .
That puts tax policy , trade and America 's image abroad high on the list of issues that matter to them .
Jeff Nagel , 44 , a top executive at one such multinational , said that the way McCain made his vice - presidential choice reflected the personality differences between the two presidential candidates .
That sealed his decision to vote for Obama instead , he said .
Choice of VP reflects personality of candidates
“ As a businessman , I look at an individual ’s leadership skills regardless of their experience and position on the issues .
I agree with Obama only about half the time , ” said Nagel , who had previously voted for President George W. Bush and describes himself as a free trader and fiscal conservative , but a moderate on social policy .
“ But look at how he has managed his campaign , taking on the Democratic establishment Clintons .
Look at how he articulates his positions , and his ability to keep a level response through the ups and downs of his campaign , ” he said adding that Obama has already shown that he is a thoughtful and effective leader through his choice of six - term Delaware senator Joe Biden , 65 , as his running mate .
Obama 's choice of Joe Biden ( left ) has been widely praised
“ Biden is someone who can deliver the experience that Obama lacks , but not the electoral votes that he needs to win the presidency .
Obama ’s choice was not based on the short term decision to get into office , but to put together a good team for the long haul in office , ” continued Nagel , who declined to name his company since he was expressing his personal views .
Many expats like Nagel see McCain ’s public outbursts and unpredictability that his Republican handlers call “ maverick ” , in a negative light .
They say that McCain ’s ‘ shoot first , ask later ’ fighter pilot mentality that might work on the battlefield , is unsuited for the US presidency , which requires a cool head .
Concerns about McCain ’s judgement
Others have expressed serious concerns about McCain ’s judgement .
Matthew Howard , a global engineering manager based in Cologne for Ford Motor Company , who has Republican leanings and is not convinced of Obama , has vacillated so much with his absentee ballot that it is now too late to cast his vote .
“ If McCain had picked ( former Massachusetts governor ) Mitt Romney or any other qualified candidate , I would vote for him in a flash .
Picking a running mate was the most important decision of his candidacy and he blew it with Palin .
How could he be so dramatically out of touch to pick this woman ? " asked Howard , who added that the role of VP today is no longer just a president - in - waiting , but an important team player in the cabinet .
“ If I were back in Michigan , I would n’t be able to sit home on Election Day .
It ’d be painful , but I ’d vote Obama , ” said Howard , explaining that he generally dislikes Democrat fiscal and economic policies .
Resigned into voting for Barack Obama
Expat absentee ballots can make a difference in swing states
Vera -Lynn Lewallen , 53 , who was born on a military base in Germany and grew up in North Carolina , sent in her absentee ballot , but initially thought of abstaining , since she is bitter at the Democratic Party for casting aside Senator Hillary Clinton in favor of Obama .
“ I ’d rather not vote if I ’m not happy with the Democratic candidate , but now I feel blackmailed by the Republicans into voting , because they picked this Palin woman , ” she said .
Then there is Mickie Nagel , who unlike her husband , an Independent , has been a lifelong Republican and even worked on the campaign to re-elect the incumbent president ’s father , George Bush Sr . She was opposed to Palin enough to cross the line for the first time in this election .
“ I never thought I would vote for a Democrat , ” she said .
One Ford engineer and mother of two , who asked not to be identified , did vote for McCain out of loyalty to the Republican Party , but also voiced serious doubts about Palin .
She is taking strange comfort in the fact that her absentee vote wo n’t count in her home state .
“ Michigan is a clear blue state .
Obama will win there anyway , ” she said with a sigh of relief .
Bush Administration to Talk With Taliban ?
To stabilize Afghanistan , the Bush administration would talk with the Taliban .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 28 , 2008  --
As the Bush administration reviews its strategy in Afghanistan , there is an emerging consensus that the way forward should include reaching out to supporters of the Taliban , and possibly even elements of the Taliban itself .
Several U.S. officials confirmed a report today in the Wall Street Journal that the White House is actively considering taking part in talks with tribal leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan who are associated with the Taliban .
Officials said , however , that these talks would be led by either Afghanistan or Pakistan , or both .
The United States would play a secondary , supportive role , the officials said .
" Part of the calculus of any way forward will have to include reconciliation with some current antagonists in Afghanistan , " one senior military official said .
Earlier this month , Gen. David Petraeus , the former top commander of U.S. forces in Iraq -- who , on Friday takes over as the commander of CENTCOM , which directs U.S. military operations in the Middle East and southwest Asia -- said talking to insurgent groups in Iraq was critical to bringing down the violence there .
" I do think you have to talk to enemies , " Petraeus said on Oct. 8 in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in Washington .
" I mean , what we did do in Iraq ultimately was sit down with some of those that were shooting at us . "
The idea , officials explained , is to negotiate from a position of strength , supporting talks with those willing to renounce violence and hunting down those who do n't .
Boeing : Biofuel - Powered Flights Will Be Common in 3 Years
October 27th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Biofuel - powered plane rides may be in our future much sooner than anticipated if Boeing gets its way .
The company expects to see approval for commercial use of biofuels in the next 3 to 5 years .
Planes will probably run on a blend of 30 % biofuel , since there is n’t enough biofuel available to completely supply an industry that uses 85 billion gallons of kerosene each year .
Use of the biofuel blend wo n’t require modification to current aircraft .
The issue of biofuel availability is a big one — fueling the 13,000 commercial planes in operation with soya bean - based fuel would require a land mass the size of Europe .
Fortunately , newer biofuels might alleviate the problem of using arable land for fuel production .
Solazyme recently announced that it has produced the world ’s first algae - based jet fuel .
But since algae fuel could take longer than 3 to 5 years for mass production , we may have to wait a bit before seeing truly sustainable airplane biofuel take off .

Early but intriguing research on mice suggests a new mechanism of aging , and possibly a way to stall it .
Drugs designed to target one aspect of aging also seem to help repair DNA damage and regulate gene activity , preventing them from going haywire with the stresses of time .
" In principle , we now could have a way of reversing the effects of aging , " said David Sinclair , a Harvard University gerontologist and co-founder of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals , a company best - known for its development of an experimental drug called resveratrol .
Resveratrol and similar compounds activate an enzyme called SIRT1 .
The enzyme rejuvenates mitochondria , the machines that power our cells .
Mitochondrial breakdown has been associated with many age - related diseases , including heart disease , diabetes and dementia .
Several labs in addition to Sirtris are researching compounds that target mitochondria .
The new findings suggest that SIRT1 fixes DNA in addition to mitochondria .
Sinclair 's team found that unless SIRT1 enzymes gathered at sites where DNA had started to unravel , other DNA repair proteins failed to arrive .
This allowed damage to progress , eventually causing dormant genes to come alive , a process called deregulation .
Some researchers think gene deregulation is a cause of aging :
As cells get older , they produce less SIRT1 , ostensibly becoming less able to repair faulty DNA and suppress the dormant genes .
But in mice either given resveratrol or genetically engineered to produce extra SIRT1 on their own , repairs went smoothly and quickly .
" One idea of why we age is that DNA becomes damaged or mutated , " said Sinclair , lead author of the research published Wednesday in Cell .
" But perhaps the main culprit is the effect of genes switching on and off , and that should be reversible . "
But as with any animal study of a new mechanism for something as complex as aging , caution is advised in extrapolating from the results .
" We have a long way to go before applying this to humans , " said
University of Southern California gerontologist Valter Longo , who was not involved in the study .
The exact role of gene activation in aging is not entirely clear .
And while Sinclair 's work showed that cancer - prone mice lived 40 percent longer than usual after SIRT1 stimulation , they did n't test its benefits on healthy mice .
Sinclair said that such tests are planned , as are experiments on elderly mice designed to see whether SIRT1 stimulation causes genetic patterns to revert to youthful states .
He also hopes to determine if other members of the SIRT1 enzyme family , known as sirtuins , have similar roles .
" We think this is just the tip of the iceberg , and that SIRT1 is just the first of many proteins that get reshuffled during aging , " he said .

Houston church shows $ 100 can go a long way to helping $ 100 goes a long way when helping others
Accepting a challenge by their pastor , Houston Grace Presbyterian members ' small investments multiply
Karen Anderson turned her $ 100 into $ 36,000 to buy coats for every student at Galveston 's Ball High School , and then some .

The markets were crashing and Christmas was coming when Pastor Doug Ferguson stepped up to the pulpit of Houston 's Grace Presbyterian Church with $ 5,000 in his back pocket .
He preached about generosity , neighborly love and the meaninglessness of worldly wealth .
Then he handed out $ 100 bills .
His instructions were simple :
Use the money to spread comfort and joy .
Show some kindness to strangers .
And report back in 90 days on what you did .
Ferguson hoped the assignment would lift his congregants above the fray of financial collapse and refocus their thoughts on the real meaning of Christmas : by investing in people instead of stocks .
It was n't a unique sentiment from a man of the cloth , but the novelty of his approach inspired a fresh fervor in his flock .
The Sunday morning challenge unleashed creative and charitable impulses that some congregants had been hiding under a bushel .
In the weeks that followed , they bought shoes for the homeless and a plane ticket for a woman who could n't afford to see her son graduate from boot camp in the U.S. Marine Corps .
They invited needy children to build gingerbread houses and sent medical equipment to Third World countries .
But they did n't stop with their $ 100 bills .
Their investments were fruitful .
They multiplied .
Karen Anderson stretched her seed money the furthest : in just over a month , her $ 100 grew to more than $ 36,000 , thanks to donations from a network of friends that ultimately spanned the nation .
The 61 - year - old poet and publisher used the money to buy 2,130 winter coats — enough for every student at Galveston 's Ball High School , and then some .
Labors of love
It 's not every Sunday the collection plate gets passed in reverse .
But on the last Sunday in October , Ferguson wanted to make a point .
" I just said that even though your 401 ( k ) has lost 30 percent of its value , there 's a Scripture passage that says we do n't trust in worldly wealth , " Ferguson recalled as Christmas neared and the seed money started to bear fruit .
" We intentionally picked this time of year to do this .
This is the season when you want to encourage generosity and get people more focused on loving one another . "
The $ 100 bills were a gimmick , Ferguson acknowledges , but the gimmick worked .
Of the nearly 1,500 people who regularly attend Sunday services , only a tiny fraction — 55 people , some of whom took IOUs after Ferguson ran out of $ 100s — accepted the pastor 's challenge .
Some of them had no idea what they would do with the money .
For many , it was the nudge they needed to start on a project they 'd been meaning to get around to .
" Do your shoe thing ! " whispered 43 - year - old Jenny Graham 's husband , elbowing her as she hesitated to get up and take the cash that morning .
Graham has always been moved by the biblical story of Jesus washing the disciples ' feet , and she knows that foot care is a daunting problem for the homeless community .
She wanted to help .
But she 's not the type to wander the streets , anointing feet .
" I 'm not a big foot person , " she admitted .
" I do n't like touching anyone 's feet . "
When prodded , though , she took the money .
She put together five " sole care " kits — each one containing a pair of shoes and socks , disinfecting wipes , nail clippers and the Gospel of John .
Then she started asking people to sponsor other kits at $ 20 apiece .
She 's given out 11 already , working with Houston 's Coalition for the Homeless , and she has collected another $ 300 — enough for about 15 more .
Helping the homeless
The challenge also stirred 51 - year - old Geoff Edney 's impulse to help the homeless .
Edney , a systems administrator for an oil and gas company , was homeless himself for several years in the early 1990s .
He has long wanted to help others follow his path off the streets of downtown Houston , but held back because doing so would mean confronting haunting memories of the darkest hours of his own life .
That Sunday , he took the $ 100 .
He invested it in sleeping bags , which he 's used as an icebreaker to start talking to some of the people living under overpasses near his west Houston home and in alleys near his downtown office .
Suddenly he finds that the hope he 's fostering in others has eclipsed his own grim memories .
" I had always kind of stopped short because I thought , ' How do I approach these people ? ' " he said .
" Now that I 'm doing it , I do n't know who 's getting a bigger blessing : them or me .
I 've decided that this is n't going to be just a 90 - day thing .
It 's going to be ongoing for the rest of my life . "
When Ferguson proposed the $ 100 challenge , a hush fell over the sanctuary .
No one came forward for so long that he feared he'd leave church with egg on his face and a pocket full of hundreds .
Slowly , one by one , the congregants approached the pulpit .
One by one , the pastor peeled away bills , exhausting the $ 5,000 donation that funded the experiment , along with $ 500 a second donor sponsored retroactively .
Some people gave away their $ 100 before the day was out ; others spent weeks researching the perfect investment .
They have until the end of January to meet their 90 - day deadline .
9 - year - old raises $ 1,000
While Ferguson envisioned the task to emphasize certain biblical lessons , the variety of responses showed there was no one right way to spend the money .
Griffin Simpson begged her parents to let her take one of the bills , but they were reluctant .
They told the 9 - year - old to give everyone else a chance first .
Finally they relented , with Ferguson 's encouragement .
Griffin wanted to donate to pediatric AIDS research and treatment .
" It was the first thing that came out of her mouth , " said her mother , Angela Simpson .
" I was surprised because I did n't even know she knew what it meant . "
To stretch her resources , Griffin decided to design note cards , taking orders from more than 100 friends and neighbors .
She raised roughly $ 1,000 .
" At first I did n't know it was going to be this big .
I just thought it would be nice to help , " Griffin said .
" This is really exciting . "
Congregants seemed more excited about this project than any of Ferguson 's run-of - the - mill calls to community service .
They picked their favorite causes and used their unique talents to make the money last .
Cakes raise cash
Sharon Collins , a director with BP who dabbles in baking , wanted to raise money for her favorite charity : Project C.U.R.E. , which donates used medical equipment to Third - World countries .
She invested the pastor 's $ 100 in ingredients and put her culinary skills to good use , selling her favorite cakes — fresh apple and Mexican chocolate .
At $ 25 each , she 's also raised about $ 1,000 for the cause .
" This just came to me as I was sitting in church , " Collins said .
" God spoke to me and said , ' Cakes !
You can make cakes ! ' "
Since most people want the cakes by Christmas , she 's been working a day shift at work and a night shift in her kitchen for the past six weeks .
" My house did n't get very decorated this year , but that 's OK , " she said before setting off to deliver a fresh - baked batch the week before Christmas .
Some who took the challenge said that as the 90 - day end date nears , they do n't see their charity work tapering off .
Some , like Edney , say it 's now a permanent part of their lives .
Others , like Collins , will play it by ear .
" We 'll see where God takes it , " she said .
" If I 'm supposed to continue baking cakes , I 'll keep doing it . "
Anderson , who retired from a career in early childhood development , working as a parent educator , now finds herself addicted to coats .
She 's already outfitted every student at Ball High School .
And every student in the school 's alternative programs .
If she finds more Galveston youths who need winter coats , she said , she 'll keep going .
Ferguson 's challenge gave Anderson a new direction on a day she almost did n't go to church .
She was overwhelmed by the exigencies of her life :
Her son , who lived in Galveston , had lost his home and his job during Hurricane Ike .
Her sister - in - law was in the hospital .
Her husband needed neck surgery .
And Anderson had just started a publishing company and printed her own book of poetry .
But she did n't hesitate when Ferguson held out the stack of $ 100 bills .
" When I got up to get it , I felt so peaceful , " she said .
There was little artistry in her fundraising efforts .
She spent the original $ 100 on the first six coats , bought through a nonprofit that offers a discount for children 's coats bought in bulk .
Anderson then sent an e-mail to about 70 friends and relatives — her Christmas card list — and asked each of them to e-mail 10 friends .
The donations came in from people as far away as Hawaii , intrigued by the challenge and moved by Galveston 's need .
Anderson received three big - ticket donations , each for about $ 5,000 .
But the rest ranged roughly from $ 10 to $ 100 , and most came from people she had never met .
' Feel like a polar bear '
The week before Christmas , students crinkled and swished through the Galveston high school 's halls in new matching puffy ski coats .
Some had lost their old coats to Ike 's brackish floodwaters , and some never had a winter coat to begin with .
The varsity football team took a break from weightlifting on a gray , blustery day to pick out their coats from red , green and blue piles that lined the school 's lecture hall .
" I have a letterman jacket , but it does n't really keep you warm , " said 17 - year - old Damion Britton " We 're grateful for the big coats .
They make you feel like a polar bear . "
Giving the coats away gave Anderson a warm feeling of her own .
For that alone , she said , it was the best $ 36,000 she 's ever spent .
Even congregants who did n't match her fundraising bounty said the giving project filled their hearts with new riches .
" I figure I do n't have to change the world , " Edney said , " but if I can touch someone 's life , I can start to pay back for all the wonderful things that have happened to me . "

For a 22 - year - old woman known as AW , denim evokes feelings of depression , disgust and worthlessness .
Corduroy causes confusion , and silk provides utter contentment .
She is one of two people known to experience a newly discovered form of synaesthesia , where textures give rise to strong emotions .
HS , another young woman who experiences tactile - emotion synaesthesia , gets no kick out of denim .
Fleece and dry leaves disgust her , while the touch of tennis balls , fresh leaves and sand are heaven .
Other forms of synaesthesia include numbers and letters that evoke colours , shapes that evoke tastes shapes and colours with their very own fragrances .
AW and HS ’s sensations , unusual though they may seem , are an extreme form of the positive feelings most people associate with a soft blanket or the aversion to sharp knives and jagged rocks , says V. S. Ramachandran , a neuroscientist at the University of California , San Diego .

“ We have an affinity for fur because when were evolving in the ice age , we needed coats , ” he says .
“ This is the architecture on which [ tactile - emotion synaesthesia ] is built . ”
Real metaphors
A mental mishmash between touch and emotion could underlie metaphors such as sharp criticism and a rough night , he says .
“ Synaesthesia is a quirky example of a mechanism we all have for generating metaphors , ” he says .
Ramachandran – one of the first researchers to apply neuroscience to synaesthesia – and colleague David Brang tested and retested AW and HS to confirm that their experiences were bona fide .
Measurements of skin conductance – sweat – suggest that touching denim and fleece truly evoked instinctual responses of disgust in AW .
While surreptitious video footage of AW and HS caressing different textures point to the same conclusion : tactile - emotion synaesthetes associate strong , irrepressible feelings with touch .
Their associations proved consistent , too .
On AW ’s first examination she said fine - grained sandpaper was like “ telling a white lie ” .
Eight months later , upon touching the same sandpaper , she felt “ guilty , but not a bad guilt ” .
Soft leather made HS ’s skin crawl on a first visit .
On a subsequent occasion it made her feel afraid and repulsed .
Silver lining
Both women have developed ways to cope with their experiences .
When AW touches an aversive texture , she sings to distract herself from it .
Feeling something made of silver – a positive texture – can also cancel out unpleasant tactile - emotions .
The same trick helps her feel better after a bad day .
Now that Ramachandran and Brang have confirmed that tactile - emotion synaesthesia is a genuine experience , they are hoping to discover what is going on in the brains of AW and HS .
A more common form of synaesthesia , where numbers are linked to colours , results from cross-wiring in the brain areas responsible for detecting colour and processing numbers , Ramachandran says .
“ Those neurons , those connections , have been not pruned away .
They are residual and excessive , ” he says .
Interfering neighbour
Ramachandran theorises that tactile - emotion synaesthesia is caused by similar cross-wiring between the insula cortex , the seat of many emotions , and its close neighbour , the somatosensory cortex – a region responsible for processing texture .
“ Whatever ’s going on with these synaesthetes , it seems to be an example of the normal mechanisms that are present in all of us , ” says Edward Hubbard , a neuroscientist at Cornell University in New York .
He reckons that HS and AW ’s associations between texture and emotion are not learned but are hard - wired and mostly arbitrary .
“ It ’s the sort of randomness that gets wiped out , trained way , overwhelmed by learning and cultural factors ” in most people , but not in synaesthetes , he says .

Many Pakistanis now believe that the recent Islamic terrorist attack in Mumbai , India , was the work of the Israeli Mossad , or the American CIA .
Such fantasies are a common explanation , in Moslem nations , for Islamic terrorist atrocities .
Especially when women and children , and Moslems , are among the victims , other Moslems tend to accept fantastic explanations shifting the blame to infidels ( non-Moslems ) .
Conspiracies are not unique to the Moslem world , but they are much more common there .
After the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the United States , many Moslems again blamed Israel .
A favorite variation of this is that , before the attacks on the World Trade Center , a secret message went out to all Jews in the area to stay away .
Another variation has it that the 19 attackers ( all of them Arab , 15 from Saudi Arabia ) were really not Arabs , but falsely identified as part of the Israeli deception .
In the United States , some Americans insist that the attack was the work of the U.S. government , complete with the World Trade Center towers being brought down by prepositioned explosive charges .
While few Americans accept this , the Moslem fantasies are widely accepted in the Moslem world .
Even Western educated Arabs , speaking good English , will casually express , and accept , these tales of the Israeli Mossad staging the attacks , to trick the U.S. into attacking Afghanistan and Iraq .
Americans are shocked at this , but the Moslems expressing these beliefs just shrug .
American troops arriving in Iraq go through a real culture shock as they encounter these cultural difference .
They also discover that the cause of this , and many other Arab problems , is the concept of " inshallah " ( " If God wills it . " )
This is a basic tenet of Islam , although some scholars believe the attitude preceded that religion .
In any event , " inshallah " is deadly when combined with modern technology .
For this reason , Arab countries either have poorly maintained infrastructure and equipment ( including military stuff ) , or import a lot of foreigners , possessing the right attitudes , to maintain everything .
That minority of Arabs who do have the right attitude towards maintenance and personal responsibility are considered odd , but useful .
The " inshallah " thing is made worse by a stronger belief in the supernatural , and magic in general .
This often extends to technology .
Thus many Iraqis believe that American troops wear sunglasses that see through clothing , and armor vests that are actually air conditioned .
When they first encounter these beliefs , U.S. troops thought the Arabs are putting them on .
Then it sinks in that Arabs really believe this stuff .
It 's a scary moment .
However , many troops learn to live with , and even exploit , these odd beliefs .
When troops at one base discovered that they were n't being attacked much , because many of the locals believed that the base was surrounded by a force field , the troops would casually make reference to their force field , when they were outside the wire and among the locals .
This reinforced the force field myth , and made the base safer .
Other troops would invent new fantasies , like a pretending that a handheld bit of military electronics was actually a mind reading device .
That often made interrogations go a lot quicker .
Not all Arabs believe in this stuff , and those that did n't and worked for the Americans , often as an interpreter , could only shrug their shoulders when asked about it .
This easy acceptance of fantasies is exploited by leaders throughout the Middle East , and the Moslem world in general .
Leaders who know better , build on these fantasies as a way to maintain their control over the population .
The problem is a dirty little secret in the Moslem world , that leaders and academics do n't even like to discuss it openly , much less with infidels .
But it is real , and you can read all about it in the local media , or overhear it in the coffee shops .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- A U.S. Marine and a soldier were shot to death Tuesday while conducting a humanitarian mission north of Baghdad , the U.S. military said .
Protesters demonstrate Friday in downtown Baghdad against a deal to keep U.S. forces in Iraq .
Another two Marines and three civilians also were wounded in the attack , which occurred in Baaj , in the northern province of Nineveh , the military said .
Military officials said the unit came under fire from two men -- one of whom appeared to be wearing an Iraqi military uniform .
" The attack appears to have been unprovoked , " said Col. Bill Buckner , spokesman for the Multi-National Corps - Iraq .
" It is unknown if the attacker was an Iraqi soldier or an insurgent in disguise . "
The incident is under investigation and the names of the U.S. troops are being withheld until their families are notified .
Sixteen U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq in November , bringing the total number of U.S. service member deaths in the Iraq war to 4,206 .
The latest deaths occurred on the eve of a parliamentary vote on a proposed security pact between the United States and Iraq that sets out the role of U.S. and allied troops in Iraq .
The Iraqi government approved the Status of Forces Agreement the Sunday before last , sending the measure to parliament to be debated .
Reached after months of negotiations between Iraqi and U.S. representatives , the pact sets June 30 , 2009 , as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns .
The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq altogether would be December 31 , 2011 .
The measure has been met with protests from some Iraqis , most of whom are backers of anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr .
The Sadrists are among the most ardent critics of the deal , and others -- such as Sunni Arabs and secularists -- have expressed reservations and opposition to the pact .
The Sadrists oppose having any agreement with the United States and want U.S. forces to leave immediately .
They took to the streets of Baghdad in protest this weekend , waving Iraqi flags and carrying signs scorning the agreement .

I ’m not real certain just what the process is for the Crown Estates in the UK about leasing tidal areas , but it seems to be competitive for at least two companies to battle to have their ocean current designs installed at Pentland Firth , off the coast of Scotland .
Pentland Firth is in the UK ’s far north and has been described as the “ Saudi Arabia ” of marine power .
The considered leading candidate is Marine Current Turbines Ltd , who confirmed that it intends to apply for a lease from the Crown Estate to deploy its “ world - beating ” tidal technology in Scotland ’s Pentland Firth .
Atlantis Resources Corporation chief executive Timothy Cornelius said the area that the company hoped to develop in Scotland is also the Pentland Firth in the country ’s north , too .
The company is confident it will win a contract to build 500 underwater turbines in the sea off Scotland .
One wonders how big this Pentland Firth place is , now with so much interest .
Marine Current Turbines has a project underway called SeaGen deployed in May of this year , a tidal project in Northern Ireland ’s Strangford Lough , the world ’s first commercial - scale grid - connected tidal stream energy system .
At 1.2MW capacity , SeaGen , which is in the final stages of commissioning , will generate electricity onto the grid to meet the average needs of 1000 homes .
Martin Wright , Managing Director of Marine Current Turbines adds , “ Harnessing the power of the Pentland Firth will be challenging and there are still substantial issues , in particular financing and grid connection , which will have to be addressed .
However , the move by the Crown Estate is a significant and welcome step forward if the UK is to harness the sea ’s energy potential on a truly commercial basis . ”
SeaGen works in principle much like an “ underwater windmill ” with the rotors driven by the power of the tidal currents rather than the wind .
Strangford Lough has a highly energetic tide race and so is recognized as one of the main tidal “ hotspots ” in UK and Irish waters .
The Aussies at Atlantis Resources Corporation have developed turbines that can generate electricity from the sea ’s movement , too .
The deep - water Solon turbine “ is a story of a group of young Australians doing wonderful things on a global scale . ”
Cornelius said .
Cornelius said , “ This young guy from Townsville , in 12 months , has gone from concept to building this turbine . ”
The deep - water Solon turbine designed by 28 - year - old Dr. John Keir is considered by many to be the world ’s most efficient underwater generator .
The thrifty and frugal Scots have their naysayer in Scottish engineer Tony Trapp who told The Scotsman newspaper that tidal power was not reliable enough to generate the power levels that Atlantis is suggesting .
Dr. Trapp says , “ The trouble is , it is n’t the solution .
Tidal and wave [ power ] are trivial in the world energy picture .
The overall conclusion is it ’s silly – it ’s not a sensible use of intellect or financial resources . ”
Cornelius counters saying , “ The tides are completely reliable , so much so that you can predict them 20 years in advance .
That is exactly the kind of information energy companies are looking for .
We can be highly accurate on our outputs to the electricity grid . ”
I ’m with Cornelius on this .
There is a huge amount of momentum in tidal flows ready for the harness if the details and economics can be worked out .
It seems that the Crown Estate and Marine Current Turbines think so , too .
Now as you ’ve noted , these two companies are using what can be described as conventional turbine technology of blades levering a shaft .
A new take on this is a near shocker – using vortex - induced vibrations , actually making them to work in slow moving water – is counter intuitive as vortex induced vibrations are something engineers avidly seek to avoid .
These vibrations are the bane of moving things ; they wear , fatigue and destroy equipment and installations to great damage and harm .
The idea of inducing them and pulling out the energy is just – innovative in the extreme .
A University of Michigan engineer , Michael Bernitsas , a professor in the U - M Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering designed VIVACE , which stands for Vortex Induced Vibrations for Aquatic Clean Energy .
VIVACE is the first known device that could harness energy from most of the water currents around the globe because it works in flows moving slower than 2 knots ( about 2 miles per hour . )
Most of the Earth ’s currents are slower than 3 knots .
Turbines and water mills need an average of 5 or 6 knots to operate efficiently .
A paper on it is published in the current issue of the quarterly Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering .
Vortex induced vibrations are undulations that a rounded or cylinder - shaped object makes in a flow of fluid , which can be air or water .
The presence of the object puts kinks in the current ’s speed as it skims by .
This causes eddies , or vortices , to form in a pattern on opposite sides of the object .
The vortices push and pull the object up and down or left and right , perpendicular to the current .
The vortices push and pull the passive cylinder up and down on its springs , creating mechanical energy .
Then , the machine converts the mechanical energy into electricity .
Professor Bernitsas estimates that array of VIVACE converters the size of a running track and about two stories high could power about 100,000 houses .
Such an array could rest on a riverbed or it could dangle , suspended in the water .
But it would all be under the surface .
Because the oscillations of VIVACE would be slow , it is theorized that the system would not harm marine life like dams and water turbines can .
Bernitsas says VIVACE energy would cost about 5.5 cents per kilowatt - hour .
Wind energy costs 6.9 cents a kilowatt - hour .
Nuclear costs 4.6 , and solar power costs between 16 and 48 cents per kilowatt - hour depending on the location .
Here is a hard truth and some study based facts on the power in tides and currents .
“ There wo n’t be one solution for the world ’s energy needs , ” Bernitsas said .
“ But if we could harness 0.1 percent of the energy in the ocean , we could support the energy needs of 15 billion people .
That would be a lot of power and the professor is thinking a tenth of one percent of the power available for his assertion .
It might behoove the Crown Estates to do a little further research before they commit to leases .
The installed cost , the rate for kilowatt - hours to the consumers and the longevity of the initial investment with good operating cost estimates needs prime attention .
Those tides and currents are n’t likely going anywhere soon .
But a bunch of capital investment will be involved for a multi decade or even longer useful lifetime .
Realistically , as amazingly sensible as tide , current , wind and solar are , it will be the cost for ratepayers that matters .
Great ideas need great development work and a sense of application of skills that brings more , better and cheaper .
None of the resources are going to disappear or deplete .
Getting it right , getting the most efficiency for the best price can take a little extra time .
Harvesting systems need to get much better , and cheaper than the fueled production systems are today .
Competition has an important role here , as the best will be found and everyone will benefit .
It ’s a sure thing that some of the currents and tides will get into a harness .

The importance of Linux partitions
Disk partitioning is the creation of separate divisions of a hard disk drive using partition editors such as fdisk .
Once a disk is divided into several partitions , directories and files of different categories may be stored in different partitions .
ADVERTISEMENTS
Many new Linux sys admin ( or Windows admin ) create only two partitions / ( root ) and swap for entire hard drive .
This is really a bad idea .
You need to consider the following points while partitioning disk .
Purposes for Disk Partitioning
An operating system like Windows / Linux can be installed on a single , unpartitioned hard disk .
However , the ability to divide a hard disk into multiple partitions offers some important advantages .
If you are running Linux on server consider following facts :
Ease of use – Make it easier to recover a corrupted file system or operating system installation .
– Make it easier to recover a corrupted file system or operating system installation .
Performance – Smaller file systems are more efficient .
You can tune file system as per application such as log or cache files .
Dedicated swap partition can also improve the performance ( this may not be true with latest Linux kernel 2.6 ) .

Security – Separation of the operating system files from user files may result into a better and secure system .
Restrict the growth of certain file systems is possible using various techniques .

It depends upon usage .
For example , if the data is lots of small files , it is better to use small block size .

Testing – Boot multiple operating systems such as Linux , Windows and FreeBSD from a single hard disk .
File systems that need their own partitions Partition Purpose /usr
This is where most executable binaries , the kernel source tree and much documentation go .
/ var
This is where spool directories such as those for mail and printing go .
In addition , it contains the error log directory .
/tmp
This is where most temporary data files stored by apps .
/ boot
This is where your kernel images and boot loader configuration go .
/ home
This is where users home directories go .
Let us assume you have 120 GB SCSI hard disk with / ( root ) and swap partitions only .
One of user ( may be internal or external or cracker ) runs something which eats up all your hard disk space ( DoS attack ) .
For example , consider following tiny script that user can run in /tmp directory :
#!/bin/sh man bash > $ ( mktemp ) $ 0 #!/ bin/sh man bash > $ ( mktemp ) $ 0
Anyone can run above script via cron ( if allowed ) , or even with nohup command :
$ nohup bad - script &
The result can be a total disaster as entire file system comes under Denial of Service attack .
It will even bypass the disk quota restriction .
One of our Jr. Linux sys admin created only two partition .
Later poorly written application eats up all space in / var / log / .
End result was memo for him ( as he did not followed internal docs that has guidelines for partition setup for clients server ) .
Bottom line create the partition on Linux server .
If you do not have a partition schema , than following attacks can take place :
Runaway processes .
Denial of Service attack against disk space ( see above example script ) .
Users can download or compile SUID programs in /tmp or even in /home .
Performance tuning is not possible .
Mounting / usr as read only not possible to improve security .
All of this attack can be stopped by adding following option to /etc / fstab file :
nosuid –
Do not set SUID / SGID access on this partition
– Do not set SUID / SGID access on this partition nodev – Do not character or special devices on this partition
– Do not character or special devices on this partition noexec –
Do not set execution of any binaries on this partition
– Do not set execution of any binaries on this partition ro – Mount file system as readonly
– Mount file system as readonly quota – Enable disk quota
Please note that above options can be set only , if you have a separate partition .
Make sure you create a partition as above with special option set on each partition :
/ home – Set option nosuid , and nodev with diskquota option
– Set option nosuid , and nodev with diskquota option / usr – Set option nodev
– Set option nodev /tmp – Set option nodev , nosuid , noexec option must be enabled
For example entry in /etc / fstabe for / home should read as follows :
/ dev/sda1 / home ext3 defaults , nosuid , nodev 1 2
Here is mount command output from one of my OpenBSD production server :
/ dev/wd0a on / type ffs ( local ) / dev/wd1a on / home type ffs ( local , nodev , nosuid , with quotas ) / dev/ wd0d on / root type ffs ( local ) / dev / wd0e on / usr type ffs ( local , nodev ) / dev / wd0f on /tmp type ffs ( local , nodev ) / dev / wd0h on / var type ffs ( local , nodev , nosuid ) / dev/wd0g on / var / log type ffs ( local , nodev )
How do I obtain information about partitions ?
There are several ways that information about partitions can be obtained on Linux / UNIX like operating systems .
List partitions :
fdisk -l
Report file system disk space usage :
df -h
OR
df -k
Display partition mount options including mount points
mount
Sample output :
/ dev/sda2 on / type ext3 ( rw , relatime , errors=remount - ro ) tmpfs on / lib / init / rw type tmpfs ( rw , nosuid , mode=0755 ) / proc on / proc type proc ( rw , noexec , nosuid , nodev ) sysfs on /sys type sysfs ( rw , noexec , nosuid , nodev ) varrun on / var / run type tmpfs ( rw , nosuid , mode=0755 ) varlock on / var / lock type tmpfs ( rw , noexec , nosuid , nodev , mode = 1777 ) udev on / dev type tmpfs ( rw , mode=0755 ) tmpfs on / dev / shm type tmpfs ( rw , nosuid , nodev ) devpts on / dev/ pts type devpts ( rw , noexec , nosuid , gid=5 , mode=620 ) fusectl on / sys / fs / fuse / connections type fusectl ( rw ) / dev/sda1 on / media / sda1 type fuseblk ( rw , nosuid , nodev , allow_other , default_permissions , blksize=4096 ) / dev/sda5 on / share type fuseblk ( rw , nosuid , nodev , allow_other , default_permissions , blksize=4096 ) / dev/sdb2 on / disk1p2 type ext3 ( rw , relatime , errors=remount - ro ) securityfs on / sys / kernel / security type securityfs ( rw ) debugfs on / sys / kernel / debug type debugfs ( rw ) binfmt_misc on / proc / sys / fs / binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc ( rw , noexec , nosuid , nodev ) gvfs - fuse - daemon on /home / vivek/.gvfs type fuse.gvfs-fuse - daemon ( rw , nosuid , nodev, user=vivek )
Display / edit file system configuration options
less /etc/fstab
or
vi /etc/ fstab
Quickly remount / usr in ro mode
mount -o remount , ro /usr
Quickly mount all file system configured in /etc / fstab
mount -a

Linux Partition HOWTO .

A team of Italian researchers , part of the OBELIX collaboration , used data taken from CERN , the European particle physics laboratory , from 1990 until 1996 and after careful analysis reported a surprising finding : a good fraction of a low energy antimatter beam directed at a normal matter wall bounces right back .
OBELIX at the Low Energy Antiproton
Ring ( Credit : CERN Bulletin )
The OBELIX experiment was designed to study the properties of low - energy ( slow moving , 1 - 10 kilo - electron - volt ) antiprotons and how they combine with normal matter to produce exotic atomic states .
When one of the antiprotons met a molecule of gas and annihilated with one of the molecule ’s protons , detectors picked up the new particles produced , allowing the team to pinpoint each annihilation event in space and time .
The annihilation events have been clustered into two groups .
The main group represented antiprotons being captured and annihilated by gas molecules as the particles traveled along the walls of the cylinder .
A second , more puzzling group of annihilations , which occurred slightly later in time and non adjacent to the walls , has been stumping scientists .
Now , the researchers have reported that they ’ve solved the mystery of the second group of annihilators by modeling the presence of the back wall of the aluminum cylinder .
Instead of instantly annihilating when they antiprotons hit the wall , about a quarter of the low energy antiprotons striking the wall reflect and travel straight back into the gas located in the center of the cylinder , where they later annihilate .
Another look of the The Low Energy
Antiproton Ring at Cern ( Credit : CERN )
If the antiprotons were moving fast , they would fly right through most atoms , until they finally encountered a nucleus in a nearly direct hit for annihilation .
When a relatively slow moving charged particle is fired at a stationary atom , the positively - charged nucleus can deflect it from its course .
A slow - moving antiproton , as in the OBELIX experiment , is frequently deflected by the pull of each nucleus so it gets bounced around until it eventually “ forgets ” the direction it was headed and has a good chance of popping back out , although it may still annihilate somewhere in the wall .
Ryugo Hayano , an expert on low - energy antimatter interactions at CERN , thinks the result , while at first surprising , is solid .
“ People do n’t realize such obvious things until you actually encounter some phenomena and think very hard about them , ” he says .
TFOT previously reported about a new antimatter engine design which will require only a few milligrams of positrons to send a spaceship to Mars .

Laser Sensor Boosts Wind Turbine Efficiency
November 7th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Virginia - based Catch the Wind has an innovative solution for improving wind turbine efficiency — laser beams .
The company ’s fiber - optic laser system gives turbines up to 20 extra seconds to adjust to changes in gusts and wind direction .
That may not sound like much , but Catch the Wind claims that its system can improve turbine output by 10 percent .
Catch the Wind ’s LIDAR ( light detecting and ranging ) system is mounted on top of wind turbines .
Three invisible laser beams pulse in front of the turbine and measure vertical and horizontal wind speeds as well as changes in direction .
The system ’s small size , minimal weight , and ruggedness make it ideal for permanent mounting .
The LIDAR model is currently being tested at the Wind Energy Institute of Canada , and Catch the Wind plans to have a commercial model available in 2010 .
I have n’t found any mention of the price tag , but my guess is that invisible laser beams do n’t come cheap .

Once upon a time , children ’s films were gentle , freewheeling tales in which animals and people could interact and minor life lessons could be imparted to the youth .
Now , in films like “ Beverly Hills Chihuahua , ” they are crass , reductionist affairs , indoctrinating kids to consumer culture .
Seen with the wrong pair of eyes , it is nothing short of majorly depressing .
In “ Beverly Hills Chihuahua , ” a pampered little dog ( voiced by Drew Barrymore ) -- one who wears outfits and gets spa treatments and is carried around in a designer carry - all -- becomes lost in Mexico and must find her way back home .
There are some actual people ( played by Piper Perabo , Jamie Lee Curtis and others ) who are involved in the story , but it ’s mostly about the dog and other dogs she meets and the quippy one - liners that spill from their lame special - effects - moving mouths .
One could try to overlook the film ’s view of Mexico as an either - or land of resort poshness and street - level poverty , chiefly populated by criminals and hustlers of all stripes , except that view forms the entire film , driving the narrative impulse by which the spoiled puppy makes her journey .
“ Beverly Hills Chihuahua ” features a stellar lineup of Latino actors as voice talent , including Andy Garcia , George Lopez , Edward James Olmos , Paul Rodriguez , Cheech Marin and Luis Guzman .
Even radio personality Piolin and opera star Placido Domingo are tossed into the mix .
That they are brought together only for such a wearying endeavor and are n’t even seen on - screen is in itself a huge bummer .

There is a variation on the story as presented that could smartly deconstruct the ideology of glamour and consumption that has of late crept toward younger and younger minds .
Think of it as the Paris Hilton Complex , that idea of young people as little princesses and princes who get what they want , and what they want is easy pickings and a life without engagement .
Alas , “ Beverly Hills Chihuahua ” is not that fantasy critique , as it places its hapless heroine in essence right back where she started at the end of the film , and poolside is poolside and emptiness is emptiness .
I must confess that I saw “ Beverly Hills Chihuahua ” in between a German drama on 1970s revolutionary activism and an indie comedy about a young woman with deep - rooted sexual issues , which does n’t exactly put me in the target demographic .
But still , despite its superficial lip - service to self - actualization / realization , there has to be more to life than what “ Beverly Hills Chihuahua ” is putting out there , which is fit for neither man nor beast .

“ Beverly Hills Chihuahua . ” MPAA rating : PG for some mild thematic elements .

Waterproof Fire Starter
by Joshua Stuck
I have seen many examples of fire starters , but I wanted to try and make one that was made out of only primitive materials .
I wanted to make sure that it was small and waterproof .
Also , it could be used with any primitive coal producing method of fire making , like the hand drill or bow drill , as well as more modern methods , like steel and flint , Ferrocerium Rods , matches and lighters .
Here is what I did . . . .
Supplies :
1 . Bees wax melted in a double boiler
2 . Thin strips of birch bark
3. Char cloth
4 . Jute twine pulled apart and made into a small tinder nest ( penny used to show size relationship ) .
Begin by placing the char cloth into the center of the jute tinder nest .
Then compress the tinder nest around char cloth as tightly as you can .
The size of the ball can be larger or smaller depending on your own personal preferences .
Next begin wrapping the tinder with thin strips of birch bark .
When it is finished being wrapped with the birch bark , it should look like this .
Carefully dip half of the wrapped bundle into the wax to seal the bark in place .
Continue to rotate and dip in wax until completely covered .
Press down any pieces of bark that may be sticking up as you go so that you end up with a fairly smooth round ball when finished .
You now have a completely waterproof fire starter that you can use even in the wettest conditions .
When you are ready to use your fire starter ( this was done on a rainy day , on cold wet pavement , in late October , in Northeast Wisconsin ) , simply cut it in half , pull out the tinder nest from the inside , expose the char cloth and you are ready to go .
This particular fire starter ball was started with steel and flint and burned on this wet pavement for over 10 minuets .
Hope this comes in handy for you .

A terminally ill girl has won the right to refuse treatment after a hospital ended its bid to force her to have a heart transplant .
Herefordshire Primary Care Trust ( PCT ) dropped a High Court case after a child protection officer said Hannah Jones was adamant she did not want surgery .
Hannah , 13 , of Marden , near Hereford , said she wanted to die with dignity .
Her father Andrew said he and his wife supported her decision but they had been upset by the PCT 's actions .
He said Hereford County Hospital 's child protection team had contacted them in February threatening to remove Hannah from their care if they did not bring her to hospital for the operation .
The threat that somebody could come and forcibly remove your daughter from you ... was quite upsetting really
Andrew Jones
Why children have a say over care Your stories Your Comments Hannah , who has a hole in her heart , had been offered a transplant in July 2007 but said she did not want to go through with it after taking advice from doctors , Mr Jones said .
She said the operation might not work , and if it did work , it would be followed by constant medication .
Hannah was interviewed by the child protection officer after the trust applied for a court order in February to force the transplant .
She said she wanted to stop treatment and spend the rest of her life at home and the PCT subsequently withdrew its legal action .
Mr Jones said : " The threat that somebody could come and forcibly remove your daughter from you against her wishes , against our wishes , was quite upsetting really . "
Hannah Jones decided she did not want a heart transplant
He added : " We did n't get too involved in ( Hannah 's ) decision .
" Hannah made that decision consciously on her own , a bit like a grown up , even though she was only 12 at the time and she has maintained that decision .
" How she coped with it , what her mind was thinking at the time , I 've got great admiration for her in that and , as I said , we have to support her and her decision . "
Hannah previously suffered from leukaemia and her heart has been weakened by drugs she was required to take from the age of five .
Last week her father was forced to cancel plans to take her to Disneyland because he could not get insurance for her .
The family had been given the holiday to the US by the charity Caudwell Children .
Sally Stucke , a consultant paediatrician at Herefordshire Primary Care Trust , said it had been " an extremely complex case " .
She added : " No one can be forced to have a heart transplant .
Hannah said she wanted to stop treatment and come home " We understand that the child and the family 's views in relation to care and treatment might change over time as the child 's condition changes .
" Any individual has the right to change their mind at any time .
" When considering whether a child is able to make a decision we would consider the age and the maturity of the child as well as the views of the family and others as appropriate .
" A child has the right to change their mind and all professionals providing support to the child and the family have to be sensitive to that . "
' Perfectly capable ' Dr Tony Calland , chairman of the British Medical Association 's ethics committee , said a child of Hannah 's age was able to make an informed decision to refuse treatment .
He said the House of Lords had ruled in the 1980s that a child who understood the issues and consequences could be considered legally competent .

It followed the case of Victoria Gillick who took her health authority to court claiming she should be informed if her daughters were prescribed contraception .
It was reported that in Hannah 's case , the trust intervened after a locum GP raised concerns over her with the child protection team .
Dr Calland said he understood why a doctor might have taken this action .
He said : " I think some doctors take the view that they must intervene and they are making that decision in what they see as the best interests of the patient .
" But of course best interests of patients is not just the best medical interests - it 's the overall holistic interests of the person in general . "
He added : " I think obviously a child of 13 with these circumstances should be perfectly capable of making the decision and particularly when supported by the parents . "
Clive Lambert , headteacher at Hannah 's school , St Mary 's High School , in Lugwardine , said she was an intelligent girl , capable of making her own decisions .
" She has many friends at school and her presence is a source of inspiration to us all through the courage and dignity that she displays , " he said .

A - Rod Hosting Thanksgiving For Madonna and Her Kids
has really irritated his soon to be ex-wife .
It seems he abruptly left Miami and returned to NYC because of .
New York Post Page Six is reporting that a friend of the beleaguered Cynthia related the contents of an e-mail that A - Rod 's wife sent .
Cynthia 's email message said : " My 6 foot 3 , 200 lbs. soul - less , soon to be ex-husband is abandoning his kids on Thanksgiving to be with Madonna ...
She called and he ran on her command back to New York City .... Gross ! "
A - Rod is hosting a dinner at his apartment for Madonna , Lourdes Leon , Rocco Ritchie , David Banda and Madge 's manager Guy Oseary .
Alex and Cynthia have two children - 4 year old Natasha and one year old baby Ella .
Their final divorce settlement has yet to be signed .
SOCIAL networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace are distracting office workers from the hellish , brain - curdling reality that is their shabby , predictable and ultimately meaningless lives , according to a new report from the Confederation of British Industry .
The CBI is concerned that surfing the internet is preventing workers from reaching financial targets that will bring them no measurable benefits , but will swell executive bonuses by up to 220 % a year .
They are calling on the government to introduce legislation that will ban workers from thinking about the slightest hint of a possibility that life may not in fact be a relentlessly nauseating sea of shit .
Meryl Blears , a 28 year - old financial assistant from Swindon , said : " I like Facebook because it gives me hope that one day I 'll have actual conversations with people who do n't secretly want to kill themselves . "
Kate Braff , 22 , from Bristol , added : " I like MySpace because I can see photographs of human beings enjoying things like fresh food and pets , rather than staring all day at a spreadsheet filled with my chief executive 's brothel expenses . "
Brian Greatbatch , 36 , from Bedford , said : " So far this year my boss has spent about 45 minutes at his desk and that was because he wanted to redesign his office before ordering a snooker table for his boat .
" On the way out he told me that if I wanted to look at Facebook I should quit my job , become a drug addict , lose my house and end up begging for money so that I could buy a cup of coffee in an internet cafe and stand behind someone who was looking at Facebook .
" Then he hit me on the head with his shoe .
It 's men like him who are keeping the Chinese at bay . "
RICHMOND , Va. --
Former NFL star Michael Vick is back in Virginia to plead guilty to state dogfighting charges , a move he hopes will expedite his return to society and , eventually , pro football .
The former Atlanta Falcons quarterback is being held in protective custody at the Riverside Regional Jail , superintendent Darnley Hodge said Friday .
Michael Vick , arriving to federal court in August 2007 , is isolated at the Riverside Regional Jail in Virginia to avoid disruptions .

Vick arrived Thursday afternoon from the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth , Kan. , where he 's serving a 23 - month sentence for a dogfighting conspiracy conviction .
He was brought back by the Fugitive Unit of the Virginia State Police , which already had two other prisoners to pick up in the midwest , state police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said .
Vick is isolated from the jail 's approximately 1,200 inmates to avoid disruptions , but will be treated like any other prisoner , Hodge said .
Vick , 28 , is due to appear Tuesday in Surry County Circuit Court , where he 's expected to plead guilty to two felony counts in a deal with prosecutors that calls for a suspended sentence and probation .
The plea would resolve his last pending criminal charges , and his lawyers hope would make him eligible for early release from prison into a halfway house designed to ease his return to society .
Only prisoners with no outstanding charges are eligible to participate in the program , which transfers prisoners into Residential Reentry Centers as much as six months before their scheduled release date .
Vick is scheduled to be released from Leavenworth on July 20 , 2009 , according to the Bureau of Prisons Web site , 20 months to the day since he reported in advance of his Dec. 10 , 2007 , sentencing to begin serving his time .
The release date apparently assumes time off for good behavior .
What remains unknown is when , or if , Vick will be allowed to resume his NFL career .
He was suspended indefinitely by league commissioner Roger Goodell , who has not said whether he will ever allow Vick to play again .
Vick 's lawyers attempted last month to get permission for him to make his plea by videoconference , but Judge Samuel Campbell denied the request .
Vick was convicted of the federal charges in August 2007 when he admitted bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in rural Surry County .
He also admitted to participating in the killing of several underperforming dogs .
Three co-defendants also pleaded guilty in the case .
The state charges -- beating or killing or causing dogs to fight other dogs and engaging in or promoting dogfighting -- each carried a possible prison sentence of five years , but Vick 's legal team and Surry County Commonwealth 's Attorney Gerald Poindexter agreed to the plea deal .
Information from The Associated Press and ESPN reporter Kelly Naqi was used in this report .
I slept late this morning and had n't really thought about writing a Thanksgiving post .
I 'm not big on holidays of any sort , and other than enjoying some time off work , I do n't do anything different from what I usually do .
I know that makes me quite odd , but I 'm getting more comfortable embracing that .
Still , my upbringing leaves me with an almost irresistible urge to reflect on what I am thankful for today .
To the degree that it makes sense for an atheist to talk of being thankful , I am thankful for having an atheist movement .
Even a largely disorganized and ineffective one is better than none at all , and so I extend warm wishes to all who make this movement happen .
For the purposes of this post , all I mean by atheist movement is a group of people interested in working together to defend and even promote the rights of atheists .
Such a group recognizes that atheist equality is a civil rights issue .
Such a group cares about making the world a better place for those of us in the reality - based community .
Certainly , these brave people deserve our thanks .
It is good to simply know that there are others out there who have managed to throw off the shackles of ancient superstition and accept the world as it is rather than how they want it to be .
Our brand of activism is about moving forward while benefiting from the lessons of the past .
I thank the atheist activists for engaging in their long struggle .
Whether you write an atheist blog or visit them from time to time , whether you engage in brief acts of positive activism or are a full - time activist , whether you belong to one secular organization or several , I thank you .
Your efforts help each of us feel less alone and more a part of our civil rights struggle .
If I 'm going to be thankful today , it is for your presence .
Expert : Lawyers ' all over the place ' on constitutionality of Prop.
8 David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday November 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Protests , rallies and three separate legal challenges are currently under way in response to the passage in California of " Proposition 8 , " which outlaws same - sex marriage .
According to CNN's Kiran Chetry , it seems as though no matter what the outcome of the challenges , the 18,000 existing same - sex marriages will remain intact , because " California 's attorney general says that the constitutional amendment is not retroactive . "
However , CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin told Chetry , " The law is really unclear here .
...
Everyone is all over the place .
Some [ lawyers ] said , ' When you look at the language of Proposition 8 , it is very clear that it was meant to be retroactive . ' ...
Another law professor that I spoke to said , ' That is absolutely , fundamentally ridiculous .
The bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples , and this is a right that is not going to be given away . ' "
" I think that we 're going to see a lot of litigation here , " Hostin concluded .
" Everyone is in a legal limbo . "
She suggested that the California Supreme Court , which " allowed these marriages in the first place , " will weigh in but that the constitutionality of Proposition 8 may ultimately have to be decided by the US Supreme Court .

An Actors Strike In This Economy ?
A - Listers Take Sides
The Screen Actors Guild is planning to call for a strike vote on January 2 , that would have their ranks curtailing their current television and movie projects , and undoubtedly putting scores of others out of work in the process .
Their contract with Alliance of Motion Picture and TV Producers expired on June 30 , 2008 and SAG members have been working without a new agreement for the past six months .
The issues get dicey in the midst of an economy that is in the toilet .
A good share of actors ' get that ' and have drafted a petition that has been sent to SAG National President Alan Rosenberg asking the board to cancel the strike - authorization vote for now .
Their document said :
" We feel very strongly that SAG members should not vote to authorize a strike at this time .
We do n't think that an authorization can be looked at as merely a bargaining tool , it must be looked at as what it is -- an agreement to strike if negotiations fail .
We support our union and we support the issues we 're fighting for , but we do not believe in all good conscience that now is the time to be putting people out of work . "
Those signing includeandOthers includeand
On the flip side , there are 30 prominent actors who have signed a statement supporting a SAG strike vote .
They include Mel Gibson , Ed Harris , Holly Hunter , Martin Sheen , Sandra Oh , Jerry O'Connell , Rob Morrow , Hal Holbrook , Dixie Carter , Ed Asner , Elliott Gould , Valerie Harper , Robert Hays , Justine Bateman , Scott Bakula and Diane Ladd .
Chief beefs continue to be new - media residuals and other compensation related issues .
Games , movies , and magic have one major thing in common – misdirection .
Show people one thing , then indicate to them that they saw another , and usually they 'll believe you .
In magic , it 's harder because they 're trying to figure out what you 're doing while you 're doing it .
In movies , it 's easier because the person is really just going along for the ride .
In games , it 's really easy , because the player is being assaulted by zombies and does n't have any attention to spare .
At least , they do n't the first time they play the game .
The second time , they 're probably paying a lot more attention to what 's going on around them .
The zombies attacking , yeah , sure , they 're a problem – but we 've dealt with them before .
Let 's look at the other things around us !
This is when they discover how careful the game is at showing you exactly what they want you to see , and keeping you from doing anything besides what you 're supposed to .
Not supposed to go through a door yet ?
It 's locked .
Got a cutscene to watch ?
I can guarantee every door leaving that room is locked – even if you just came through it ten seconds earlier .
You can walk through a door , have it lock behind you , and then have the very same door unlock the instant you 're done with a cutscene or a movie .
Happens all the time .
Sometimes they even force you to look in certain directions .
Sometimes , this is to make you look at something you 're supposed to see .
Sometimes , this is to make you look away from something you 're not supposed to see .
In the first level , there 's an exploding shuttle .
I bet you remember seeing it explode , right ?
It was really cool ?
No !
You did n't .
Because you can't have .
The camera is jerked away from it at the last second , and when you turn back to it , it 's already exploded .
You 're carefully prevented from seeing the exact moment it explodes .
The reason for that , of course , is that animating something large exploding in a realistic manner is expensive and hard .
It 's easier to just not show it .
And it works great . . . up until the person realizes what 's going on and decides to try exploring the boundaries .
This is a common issue in games .
There are a good number of games out there that pretend you 're given choices , but actually prevent all choice .
The Half - Life 2 series is a perfect example – the first time you play it feels like an exploration , but every time after that you realize , hey , wait , I 'm not allowed to go anywhere else !
That exploration feeling was a ripoff !
I should mention that this is not necessarily a bad thing .
The fact is that most people will never start a second playthrough – in fact , many people wo n't even finish the first .
It 's arguably kind of silly to triple your budget by making content that 95 % of your users will never even see .
( It 's also arguably not .
I 'll post an entry about this someday . )
But it does mean that going through the game a second time is kind of like being invited backstage at a live performance , or having the magician explain his tricks – all those cute things you noticed the first time turn out to be your own fevered imagination running a bit too fast .
Solution ?
There is n't one , besides solving the hard AI problem and writing programs that can generate content for us .
Unfortunately , this is a ways off , and if we ever do solve it , we 've put ourselves out of a job .
All I can say is : be aware of it , and try hard to keep the player from feeling constrained .
At least , on the first playthrough .
Two orb - weaving spiders sit in the middle of their respective , symmetrical webs aboard the International Space Station on Nov. 20 , 2008 .
Two plucky spiders on the International Space Station have bounced back from a tangled false start to weave amazing new webs in zero gravity , astronauts said Friday .
The orb - weaving spiders were transported to the station aboard NASA 's shuttle Endeavour earlier this week , but initially wove an aimless concoction in their lab enclosure during their first days in weightlessness .
But now they 've taken another stab at weightless web construction .
" We noticed the spiders made a symmetrical web , " the space station 's current skipper Michael Fincke radioed to Mission Control today .
" It looks beautiful . "
Fincke said he was amazed at how fast the two eight - legged creatures appear to have adapted to living in space .
The spiders are part of an experiment aimed at sparking interest in science among students on Earth .
The arachnids are the same kind of spider as " Charlotte " in the children 's book " Charlotte 's Web " by E.B.
White .
Students on Earth will compare the webs of the space station 's spiders with those of similar arachnids on Earth for the next few months .
They 'll also follow the lifecycle of painted lady butterfly larvae , which also are part of the experiment .
The University of Colorado at Boulder is overseeing the experiment and provided an ample supply of fruit flies to feed the spiders , and nectar for the butterflies that will eventually emerge .
Along with the experiment , Endeavour astronauts are undertaking a major home renovation mission at the International Space Station .
They delivered a second kitchen and bathroom , two new astronaut bedrooms , additional gym equipment , a space food fridge and a water recycling system that turns urine into drinking water .
Mission Control noticed the new spider web early Thursday and gave Fincke and his station crewmates a heads - up to look out for it .
" While y'all have been busy doing your extreme makeover , our spiders have done an extreme makeover and have torn down their first web and have made another one , " flight controllers said .
On Friday , flight controllers on Earth said the space station spiders were their new source of space entertainment .
" I thought we were your main entertainment , but I guess we 've been taken over by spiders , " Fincke said .
NASA is providing live coverage of Endeavour 's STS - 126 mission on NASA TV .

Human trials of a world - first skin cancer vaccine could start as early as next year .
Professor Ian Frazer , who developed the vaccine for cervical cancer , is due to outline his latest skin cancer breakthrough at the Australian Health and Medical Research Congress in Brisbane tomorrow .
The former Australian of the Year will tell the conference the skin cancer vaccine has been successful in animal testing and it could be available to the public within five to 10 years .
But Cancer Australia CEO
David Currow has warned that the vaccine will not prevent all skin cancers .
Mr Currow says it could be a revolutionary discovery , but people will still need to be careful .
" As we 've seen with cervical cancer , although it may deal with 70 per cent of cancers of the cervix , the vaccine does n't deal with the other 30 per cent , " he said .
" And so it is with a vaccine related to skin cancer .
The message is still that one of the most powerful things that we can do is reduce the risk by reducing our exposure to sunlight . "
He says the vaccine could prevent some of the 400,000 cases of skin cancer diagnosed in Australia every year , but there is no guarantee .
" The future is sometime off here and even if we get this vaccine in place in the next decade it 's absolutely imperative that in the meantime we continue to take a very active stance in managing the risk factors that each of us have control over , " he said .
Lisa Naumann from the Cancer Council says it is fantastic news .
" This sort of research is a really exciting opportunity for us to see what we can do to combat this really awful disease , " she said .
" The Cancer Council is certainly really excited to see what becomes of this vaccine . "
A direct ancestor of Monty Python 's renowned " Dead Parrot " sketch has been found in a book of jokes dating back to Greece in the fourth century AD , a publisher says .
A new English translation of Philogelos :
The Laugh Addict contains a joke in which a man complains that a slave he has just bought has died .
" By the gods , " answers the slave 's seller , " when he was with me , he never did any such thing . "
In the Python sketch , written 16 centuries later , the shopkeeper claims the parrot , a Norwegian Blue , is not dead but just " pining for the fjords . "
Other jokes in the book show that sex , nagging wives and passing wind have formed the basis of humour for centuries .
One example is : " A misogynist is attending to the burial of his wife , who has just died .
When someone asks , ' Who is it who rests in peace here ? '
He answers , ' Me , now that I 'm rid of her ! ' . "
The 265 jokes in Philogelos are attributed to a pair of jokers called Hierocles and Philagrius .
Little is known about them , except that they were more likely to have been the compilers of the jokes rather than the original writers of the gags .
The jokes have been published in a multimedia online book , which includes video of veteran British comedian Jim Bowen performing the jokes for a 21st century audience .
Bowen said : " One or two of them are jokes I 've seen in people 's acts nowadays , slightly updated .
They put in a motor car instead of a chariot . "
The translator of the book , William Berg - a US professor of classics - said the Philogelos book was already a later version of jokes first aired in the fourth century .
" The text of Philogelos comes to us from several manuscripts ranging from the 11th to the 15th centuries , " Professor Berg said .
" All of them trace back to an earlier original , probably - judging from the content and language - from the fourth century . "

Spoilers galore ahead ; this is a meditation on the last episode of the series
“ The Big O ” has come under fire by people that initially appreciated it .
To quote Wikipedia :
For some reviewers , the second season “ does n’t quite match the first ” addressing [ sic ] to “ something ” missing in these episodes .
Andy Patrizio of IGN points out changes in Roger Smith ’s character , who “ lost some of his cool and his very funny side in the second season . ”
Like a repeat of season one , this season ’s ending is considered its downfall .
Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD wonders if this was head writer “ Konaka ’s attempt to throw his hat into the ring for creating one of the most confusing and oblique endings of any series . ”
Patrizio states “ the creators watched The Truman Show and The Matrix a few times too many . ”
The reviewer at Japan Hero does not think the payoff was worth it , writing “ the audience had been waiting on pins and needles for so long , and practically every episode upped the tension and suspense at least a little bit , if not a whole lot , and then we come to the big IT - moment , and … well , there it is .
For me , it was honestly a little of a disappointment . ”
Any anime / sci - fi work has to be examined in terms of the counterfactuals it develops and the questions it raises .
The counterfactuals – “ what if ” questions – arise from the strangeness in any given story .
1. In “ The Big O , ” Paradigm City lost its memory forty years ago and seems to be the only viable place left on Earth .
Our hero within the city is Roger Smith , a “ negotiator ” who acts like a lawyer and a private investigator rolled into one .
The character is clearly patterned after Bruce Wayne , complete with an “ Alfred ” type butler , a mansion , and an expensive toy few know he pilots : a giant robot ( “ Big O ” ) used to combat threats the military police of the city cannot handle .
Roger handles cases for people in tough spots , and is drawn into the quest for the truth of what happened forty years ago only by outside forces , including various memories that come back at the wrong moments with full force and paralyze him .
The technology of the robot determines the entire series .
Smaller , regular human - sized androids act – and as we learn through R. Dorothy Waynewright – feel just like people .
The larger robots , not just Roger ’s but the others that appear throughout the series , we come to realize are sentient , and also struggling with fragments of memory .
Moreover , it is said explicitly by the fascist ( literally – he owns the Paradigm corporation that runs the city ) ruler , Alex Rosewater , that the power of the robots allows one to determine what is just and enforce that notion .
The series continually refers to giant robots having the power of God ; the three major robots , Roger ’s , Schwartzwald / Gabriel ’s , and Rosewater ’s , all pass judgment on their owners : “ Ye Not Guilty , ” “ Ye Guilty , ” and “ Ye Not . ”
We can assume the robots have some fragmented notion of what is just , at least : in acting with a pilot , they represent something more , even if what they represent is failed or incomplete .
2 . The technology of the robots determines everything .
If you can create a destroyer of worlds that is sentient , what else can you create ?
A lot of fans object to the ending of the series , where we discover the world is one big set , and that the reason why people are having hell with memories is that the memories were prerecorded using sets and TV cameras for maybe all of them .
It seems like postmodern absurdity : ca n’t we just get back to big robots fighting ?
After all , we have a series of Communist robots ( 3 from the “ Union ” ) , a fascist robot ( Rosewater ’s ) , one that symbolizes the tyranny of public opinion ( Schwartzwald ) and is modified later to represent a base desire for power ( Gabriel’s ) .
Big O itself is explicitly repaired by a team of Paradigm ’s own citizens at the end , and defended by those same citizens when appearing to lose the final battle .
Why did we have to get smarter than the political metaphor ?
The answer is that Paradigm City is an entirely man-made world , with men having crafted other men .
The crudity of just giving people memories – roles - in - life – like you would give trick - or - treaters candy is precisely the point .
No amount of human foresight in the series can respect human freedom generally : one of the funniest things about R. Dorothy is her initial disdain for religion , and yet the series continues with religious imagery even up to its final moments .
In an entirely man-made world , God matters that much more : the fact people suck at playing God demonstrates
His necessity , the fact people can prevent others from destroying everything His Providence .
So the postmodern imagery is n’t postmodern , in my book : the Phoenix , the Big Robot that can do as it will with the template of the whole , is the ideal robot the other ones are shadows of .
The generic cast of the series – the city is “ Paradigm City , ” the characters are intoduced to us in one sequence as “ negotiator , ” “ android , ” “ butler , ” “ officer ” – makes it clear this is the situation we ’re in .
We may not have giant robots , but we have nuclear bombs .
If we want a civilization to disappear entirely , we can do this .
We also have , through mass media , the ability to shape memory however we want .
Roger ’s existential crises , which seems to occur at the most annoying times , are the key to unlocking him as a hero .
He ’s engaging in self - reflection despite the fact he only displays a fairly mindless andreia – being courageous , being a “ real man ” in Greek – most of the time .
Reason is almost exclusively the province of R. Dorothy .
But she falls in love with him first : in a world without a history , literally constructed by technology , there is no “ nature ” to contemplate except through the noble .
And Roger , for all his faults , is very noble .
3 . The entirely man-made world still has Providence within it because of a memory that all share .
The character known as “ Angel ” is utterly useless , unable to commit any act of violence ( save one ) even though she ’s an agent for the Union .
The initial creator of Paradigm calls her a “ memory ” at the end , and says she ’s not human .
She ultimately gets to determine what the next city will be , even as Alex Rosewater tries to destroy it all for his own gain .
She ’s completely head - over - heels in love with Roger , but it is pretty clear that Roger is in love with R. Dorothy by the point she ’s really hitting on him .
If she is a memory – and certainly Dastun feels a kinship with her , and the coldness of the Union towards her might consist in its never having truly existed – then she ’s in a peculiar situation .
Her arising – I submit she is the memory of “ being loved , ” nothing less – is precisely because Roger and R. Dorothy have feelings towards each other .
Yet she has to be spurned because of that very fact .
In the final shots of the series , she ’s behind a smiling , probably human Dorothy in watching Roger drive away for the day ’s work .
And yet she truly held the power of God .
Playing
God is n’t as much fun as it seems to be for many of us : if you do it right , you do n’t get to be anything .
If you do it right , what you get is to watch others do right .
While Pope Benedict thinks of the gays as dangerous bushwhackers destroying the rainforest of heterosexuality and Rev. Rick Warren defends his homophobia by saying he ’s actually met some honest - to - goodness homosexuals in his life , Katharine Jefferts Schori , the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church told the Washington Post over the weekend that homosexuality “ Is a reality of creation , not just the human species â€ ¦
For some people to say it ’s against the order of creation , it ’s a very interesting comment – it does n’t accord with what we can observe in nature ” and then called homosexuality “ a gift . ”
Note to Barack Obama : Jefferts Schori lives in D.C.
She ’s available for any upcoming events you might need a priest at .

Similarly , a 2006 study by the federally chartered National Research Council found that these coal - burning byproducts “ often contain a mixture of metals and other constituents in sufficient quantities that they may pose public health and environmental concerns if improperly managed . ”
The study said “ risks to human health and ecosystems ” might occur when these contaminants entered drinking water supplies or surface water bodies .

In 2000 , the Environmental Protection Agency proposed stricter federal controls of coal ash , but backed away in the face of fierce opposition from utilities , the coal industry , and Clinton administration officials .
At the time , the Edison Electric Institute , an association of power utilities , estimated that the industry would have to spend up to $ 5 billion in additional cleanup costs if the substance were declared hazardous .
Since then , environmentalists have urged tighter federal standards , and the E.P.A. is reconsidering its decision not to classify the waste as hazardous .
A morning flight over the disaster area showed some cleanup activity along a road and the railroad tracks that take coal to the facility , both heaped in sludge , but no evidence of promised skimmers or barricades on the water to prevent the ash from sliding downstream .
The breach occurred when an earthen dike , the only thing separating millions of cubic yards of ash from the river , gave way , releasing a glossy sea of muck , four to six feet thick , dotted with icebergs of ash across the landscape .
Where the Clinch River joined the Tennessee , a clear demarcation was visible between the soiled waters of the former and the clear brown broth of the latter .
By afternoon , dump trucks were depositing rock into the river in a race to blockade it before an impending rainstorm washed more ash downstream .
The spill , which released about 300 million gallons of sludge and water , is far larger than the other two similar disasters , said Jeffrey Stant , the director of the Coal Combustion Waste Initiative for the Environmental Integrity Project , an environmental legal group , who has written on the subject for the E.P.A .
One spill in 1967 on the Clinch River in Virginia released about 130 million gallons , and the other in 2005 in Northampton County , Pa. , released about 100 million gallons into the Delaware River .
The contents of coal ash can vary widely depending on the source , but one study found that the mean concentrations of lead , chromium , nickel and arsenic are three to five times higher in the Appalachian coal that is mined near Kingston than in Rocky Mountain or Northern Plains coal .

Quality of Games .
This might be a moot point with the recent statement made by John Riccitiello saying they will ax at least one title a year .
Now I 've gotten that out of the way , let 's find a particularly raunchy floating turd on the list of shittiness .
Superman Returns .
I love the Man of Tomorrow just as much anybody , if not more , and there has n't been a single good game with Superman in it .
It 's a testament to their arrogance to think they could actually make one .
They tore a page out of the book of Spiderman 2 , who tore a page out of the book of GTA , and tried to make it an open world game ... based solely in Metropolis .
This is a serious design flaw to begin with .
I 'm going to flex my nerd muscles and say Superman is the protector of Earth and a decent portion of the galaxy , but add shitty graphics and character models , physics problems , repetitive fighting , and no real distinguishable threat to Supes and you have a recipe for tripe .
You know what ?
I can stop right there .
They 've released several good games and milked best selling franchises but when I think of EA published games , I think of the broken buggy pieces of shit they 've released based on movie franchises .
The games that take great movies and in a blatant dick move , ruined my memory of them .
They killed James Bond .
GoldenEye is considered one of the best games of all time and brought FPSs to consoles with panache .
To this day I still enjoy popping it in my 64 .
The next Bond game to come out was Tomorrow Never Dies on the PlayStation .
Sadly since GoldenEye was released it has all been down hill .
At best it has been on a plain after TND .
It went from the franchise everybody was playing in the mid to late 90's to " why the hell did I waste my money on that ? "
No amount of implied sex and space age gadgetry could save 007 from the horror wreaked on it by EA .
Sports Titles ' Yearly Releases .
NFL , NHL , NBA , MLB , NCAA , PGA , etc. , etc .
Are there really that many changes made in the PGA that merit releasing a Tiger Woods game every year ?
It seems that EA took the winning formula of Tiger Woods 06 and decided the best way to improve the franchise was to ruin it by changing the controls and needless additions of gameplay mechanics .
Here 's an idea that would cost less for EA and consumers .
Stop releasing the same fucking game every year with only the number on the end changed .
I can't reinforce that notion enough , STOP RELEASING THE SAME FUCKING GAME !
Now that has been stated , make the updated rosters , teams , locations , stadiums , etc. available as downloadable content .
If there 's a company out there that loves milking money from it 's consumers , it is definitely EA .
Though DLC is not as expensive as a full blown game , they do n't have to pay to print and distribute it and this model allows them to milk the DLC hind tit just a little bit more .
Exclusive NFL License .
I 'm not the biggest fan of directly competing against others because I usually lose .
I can admit that , but it does n't mean that the wrestlers who beat me so many years ago got the best of me .
I have a well paying job , a beautiful fiancee , a nice car , and lots of cool toys .
I can sleep soundly at night knowing in the long run I won , because they are now married to a witless slut , have dead end jobs , live on the wrong side of town , and have children that unsurprisingly look like the mailman , UPS guy , or their best friend .
Where was I going with this ?
Right , competition .
Competition in business breeds innovation , lower prices , and quality products .
I do n't play Madden and never will , but I can still sympathize with its fans because if they want a football game , more specifically NFL , they have to buy Madden .
Listening to friends who faithfully line up every year to buy Madden like lemmings marching off a cliff , the game peaked in 2005 and has n't been all that great since .
Am I wrong or was that the same year Take Two got a significant market share and instead of making a better product EA bought the license to eliminate competition ?
They try to do too much .
This one needs some clarification .
Typically when EA publishes a title , they release it on everything , including mobile phones .
There are very few developers who know how to program a great game using all the power of a single system , let alone several .
To top this off they try to release each version simultaneously .
That means that they have to dumb down the game engine for the Wii , so the fan base of the Wii do n't mutiny when they realize they bought half the game for their half system , or one version is ready well ahead of the others and gamers have to wait for them all to be completed before it gets released .
I understand giving equal choice for the game you want to purchase but could n't they stagger the releases as each game in completed ?
They bought Bioware / Pandemic .
This was a smart business move on their part but that does n't mean I have to be happy with it .
Bioware has a cult like following and the same goes for Pandemic .
Their merger sparked a unified cry of joy from the gaming community .
We had one group of talented people over here and another group of talented people over there .
Together we have one big group of talented people with enough capital to do greater things .
Shortly after this , while we gamers were still smoking our collective victory cigars , it was announced that EA had bought them both .
To me this was like smacking the victory cigar out of my mouth into a puddle of piss .
This complaint is n't limited to Bioware / Pandemic but extends to so many developers gobbled up by EA like white pellets to Pacman .
Alone these developers might not have had multibillion dollar fiscal profits but they might not be closed because EA does n't know how to expand their business model from within .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
If space - time were constructed in such a way that you could travel back in time , it would create some pretty strange effects .
One of these oddities , as many people know , is the “ grandfather paradox . ”
Here , a person travels back in time to kill their grandfather before the person ’s father is born , thus preventing their own birth .
The type of space - time that enables time traveling involves “ closed time - like curves ” ( CTCs ) , and , besides personal fates , CTCs can also provide insights into quantum information and computing .
In a recent study , computer scientists Scott Aaronson of MIT and John Watrous of the University of Waterloo have discovered that , if closed time - like curves exist , then quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical computers .
But researchers should n’t stop working on quantum computing technology just yet , as no one has any evidence that closed time - like curves actually exist .
Closed time - like curves are strange : sometimes physicists describe them as a piece of paper folded over on itself , so that opposite ends touch and create a shortcut .
A person standing at the front end could then easily step onto the back end , thereby easily stepping into the past .
CTCs provide interesting but complex insights into computation .
At first it may seem that , if CTCs existed , researchers could perform computations of unlimited length in an instant , by simply computing the answer , and then sending it back in time to before they started .
However , this proposal , like the grandfather paradox , breaks the rules of causality , since the input could be changed , affecting the future output .
Further , the computation may have actually taken 100 years , so Aaronson and Watrous do n’t consider this an honest computation method .
Instead , the scientists attempt to overcome causality breaking and its paradoxical consequences .
One way to do this is to simply argue that nature must somehow enforce causality .
For example , in 1991 , physicist David Deutsch proposed a resolution to the grandfather paradox that relies on the parallel universes theory in quantum mechanics : everyone is born into a universe with a certain probability , so if you go back in time to kill your grandfather , there ’s a probability that you wo n’t be born in that universe , but another .
Not all physicists agree with such interpretations , but Aaronson and Watrous adopt Deutsch ’s ideas for their demonstration .
The scientists envision a scenario in which classical and quantum computers contain CTCs , and these CTCs contain bits or qubits .
Computations start at a fixed point , which nature somehow decides on , and which ensures causal consistency ( avoiding the grandfather paradox ) .
Aaronson and Watrous show that classical and quantum computers with polynomial - size CTCs both have the same amount of computing power .
They can both solve the set of problems in an abstract space called ' PSPACE , ' which is all the problems that a classical computer can solve using a polynomial amount of memory .
This computing power is extremely large , and both types of computers are very efficient when using CTCs .
“ The way you use CTCs to compute , in one sentence , is by forcing nature to solve an exponentially hard computational problem just in order to make the universe causally consistent , ” Aaronson told PhysOrg.com .
“ You can set up the computation inside the CTC to take as input a proposed solution to the problem , and then do the following :
“ IF the input solution is correct , THEN output that same solution .
IF the input solution is incorrect , THEN output the next solution in some standard ordering ( looping around to the first solution after you 've reached the last one ) .
Go back in time , and feed in the output of the computer as its input . ”
The key , Aaronson explained , is determining what the input to this computation needs to be , in order for everything to be causally consistent .
“ Assuming there are any correct solutions at all , the input must itself be a correct solution ! ” he said .
“ For otherwise we'd have an inconsistency : the output of the computation would not match the input . ”
He added that , if there are no correct solutions , then the output and input both have to be completely random ; that 's the only way to ensure causal consistency in that case .
“ Admittedly , how nature manages to actually do the work of finding the fixed point ( and thereby making the universe causally consistent ) remains a great mystery , ” he said .
“ But the point is , this is the sort of thing nature would presumably need to do if CTCs existed . ”
In their study , Aaronson and Watrous described CTC computing using a rough analogy of Shakespeare ’s plays being written by someone from the present going back in time and dictating the plays to him .
As long as the person from the present dictates the plays correctly , there is no paradox , and causal consistency is maintained .
“ In the Shakespeare example , there 's no actual logical inconsistency , ” Aaronson explained .
“ You go back in time and dictate the plays to him , therefore he writes the plays , therefore the plays come down to you , therefore you 're able to go back in time and dictate the plays to him , etc .
Everything is consistent – there 's no paradox !
Or rather , the only ‘ paradox ’ is one of computational complexity : a difficult task seems to have been performed ( namely , Shakespeare 's plays being written ) , but without anyone ever doing the actual creative work of writing those plays . ”
By pinning down the exact computational power of CTCs , the computer scientists hope that their findings may lead to applications in quantum information .
“ In order to solve this problem , Watrous and I had to give an algorithm for computing fixed points of quantum operations using a polynomial amount of memory , ” Aaronson said .
“ And that 's something that one could easily imagine finding other uses for in quantum computing theory .
In fact , I 'm working on a paper right now about using bounded - memory quantum computers to extract the bias of a classical coin .
And in order to solve the problem in that paper , I 'm using many of the same techniques as in the closed time - like curves paper .
“ I do n't want to oversell this , ” he added .
“ It 's not going to revolutionize quantum information ; it 's just ( even at the purely technical level , and ignoring the closed time - like curve part ) a useful trick . ”
More information : Aaronson , Scott and John Watrous .
“ Closed timelike curves make quantum and classical computing equivalent . ”

Explore further Study Shows Time Traveling May Not Increase Computational Power
I guess we ’ve all heard last week ’s sad news about Engine Yard diminishing the awesome support they ’ve given the Rubinius project .
That ’s personally how I see it : they ’ve put the project on steroids for roughly a year , rather than “ they ’re now cutting back ” x people .
As Brian Ford pointed out , Rubinius is a community project .
And Rubinius is not going away .
A lot of people ca n’t wait to have a Ruby written more in Ruby than in C or C++. Koichi Sasada ( lead developer on Ruby 1.9 ) even recently projected that Rubinius would eventually be the Ruby implementation of choice .
Rubinius ’ future is promising .
I ’d like to go from that positive note , and have YOU try Rubinius now .
I promise that in 20 minutes , you ’ll be running Rubinius and enjoying it .
The longest parts of the process will be waiting ( cloning , compiling ) , so it wo n’t even be difficult .
Note : the article may look long , but it ’s not .
Half of it is code samples and the results returned .
So it ’s been aeons since the last article of the RFTL series .
But yes , this article is part of a series .
You can look at the first 2 parts if you want .
Some details1 wo n’t be up to date anymore , but it ’ll help you get the gist of Rubinius if you ’re not familiar with the project yet .
The 20 minutes timer starts now , for those who went ahead and read the past articles .
Install Rubinius
Prerequisites
Prerequisites are probably already taken care of on most Ruby developers ’ machines :
ruby 1.8 , rubygems , rake and ParseTree ( sudo gem install rake ParseTree )
) git ( no need to understand it , really , just having it installed )
general C++ building tools
Dependencies for Mac users
Leopard users should have all they need when Xcode is installed .
Insert your Leopard upgrade DVD and from your terminal :
open / Volumes / Mac\ OS \ X\ Upgrade \ DVD / Optional \ Installs / Xcode\ Tools/XcodeTools.mpkg
Dependencies for Linux users
Linux users have to make sure the following packages are installed .
Use your the equivalent command for your distro :
sudo apt - get install gcc bison make pkg- config libtool git
( where make == GNU make )
Get the Rubinius code
Right now the GitHub feature to download a tarball is disabled for big projects like Rubinius .
They say the feature on the radar as one of the things to fix in the next few weeks .
Which will be awesome .
For now we have have to clone the repo , which in this case takes a few minutes .
Find yourself a comfortable directory and :
git clone git://github.com/evanphx/rubinius.git
# go make coffee cd rubinius
Build Rubinius
Assuming you ’ve installed all the dependencies , the following should work right off the bat .
If it ’s not the case , check out the notes on the subject .
rake build # go get a http://www.brawndo.com/
Later , when you want to recompile from a clean slate , just run rake distclean .
If you have not gotten a BRAWNDO , please skip over the next paragraph .
RUBINIUS , like BRAWNDO , is one of the CRAZIEST ideas of the LAST DECADE !
Can you realize you ’re ABOUT to try the Ruby IMPLEMENTATION that ’s got the BEST Ruby code ratio AMONG THEM ALL !
Is n’t that FREAKING AWESOME ?
You can also do some of the CRAZIEST INTROSPECTION with MethodContext , StaticScope and other classes like THAT !
Run Rubinius
The Rubinius executable is rbx in the ‘ bin ’ subdirectory .
It ’s a bit different from MRI in that rbx starts an irb session if you do n’t specify a file to run .
So let ’s do that :
bin/rbx # in irb puts " Do n't you spring a hello world on me " #= >
Do n't you spring a hello world on me
Ok then .
Well , technically you ’ve now tried Rubinius in less than 20 minutes .
Now if you keep reading , you ’ll really taste some true Rubinius awesomeness .
Kick - ass introspection
Let ’s start slow by patching Object to help us quickly grok the new kinds of objects we may encounter :
class Object # Return only the methods not present on basic objects def interesting_methods ( self.methods - Object.new.methods ) . sort end end # => #< Compiled Method interesting_methods file =( irb ) >
And now let ’s create a basic little class that will help us start our exploration of a MethodContext instance .
class C def initialize @inst = 42 end def get_mc local_var = ' value ' MethodContext.current end end # => #< Compiled Method get_mc file =( irb ) >
So with the help of an instance of the class C , let ’s start poking gently at a MethodContext .
c = C.new ctx = c.get_mc #=> #< MethodContext:0xcc #< C:0xca>#get_mc ( irb ) :7 > ctx.interesting_methods #=> [ " __add_method__ " , " _get_field " , " _set_field " , " activate " , " active_path " , " alias_method " , " back_ref " , " block " , " class_variable_defined ? " , " const_defined ? " , " const_path_defined ? " , " context_from_proc " , " context_stack " , " copy " , " current_scope " , " describe " , " disable_long_return ! " , " dynamic_locals " , " file " , " fp " , " from_eval ? " , " get_eval_local " , " ip " , " ip= " , " last_match " , " last_match= " , " line " , " lines " , " locals " , " locals= " , " location " , " make_independent " , " method= " , " method_module " , " method_scope " , " method_scope= " , " name " , " normalized_name " , " nth_ref " , " position_info " , " receiver " , " receiver= " , " reload_method " , " script_object " , " send_private ? " , " sender " , " set_eval_local " , " set_iseq " , " sp " , " stack_trace_starting_at " ] ctx.name #=> : get_mc ctx.describe #=> " C\#get_mc " ctx.method_module #=> C
Interesting , that reminds me of the monkey - patching discussion that often comes up in the Ruby community .
Let ’s try something else :
module ModuleMC def module_mc MethodContext.current end end # => #< Compiled Method module_mc file =( irb ) > C.include ModuleMC #=> [ ModuleMC ] c.module_mc.method_module #=> #< IncludedModule:0xd6 > c.module_mc.method_module.name #=> " ModuleMC "
Would n’t it be nice if we had that kind of introspection , when comes time to debug some mixin magic ?
Now let ’s go back our MethodContext object .
Or rather , its method accessor , which gives us a Compiled Method instance :
m = ctx.method # => #< Compiled Method get_mc file =( irb ) > m.interesting_methods #=> [ " __ivars__ " , " __ivars__= " , " activate " , " activate_as_script " , " as_script " , " child_methods " , " compile " , " decode " , " describe " , " exceptions " , " exceptions= " , " file " , " file= " , " first_ip_on_line " , " first_line " , " from_string " , " hints " , " hints= " , " inherit_scope " , " is_block ? " , " iseq " , " iseq= " , " line_from_ip " , " lines " , " lines= " , " literals " , " literals= " , " local_count " , " local_count= " , " local_names " , " local_names= " , " locate_line " , " min_stack_size " , " name " , " name= " , " primitive " , " primitive= " , " private ? " , " protected ? " , " public ? " , " required_args " , " required_args= " , " scope " , " scope= " , " send_sites " , " serial " , " serial= " , " splat " , " splat= " , " stack_size " , " stack_size= " , " total_args " , " total_args= " ] m.describe #=> " method get_mc : 0 arg (s ) , 0 required " m.local_names #=> #< Tuple : : local_var > m.literals #=> #< Tuple : " value " , : MethodContext , #< SendSite:0xda # name=current hits=0 misses=0 >> m.file # = > :" ( irb ) "
The local_names method sounds extremely promising , but unfortunately for now , there ’s no primitive for actually getting the local variable ’s value , but it ’s perfectly possible3 .
It ’s just not been done yet .
By the way , what is that ?
# describe summarizes the arguments ?
Let ’s try something more interesting with it :
def method_with_args ( arg1 , arg2 = ' default ' , * args ) MethodContext.current end #=> #< Compiled Method method_with_args file =( irb ) > ctx2 = method_with_args ( 42 , ' towel ' , " do n't panic " ) #=> #< MethodContext:0x16e main#method_with_args ( irb ) :4 > m2 = ctx2.method #=> #< Compiled Method method_with_args file =( irb ) > m 2.describe #=> " method method_with_args : 2 arg(s ) , 1 required , splatted . "
m2.local_names #=> #< Tuple : :arg1 , :arg2 , :args > m 2.literals #=> #< Tuple : " default " , : MethodContext , #< SendSite:0x16 c # name=current hits=1 misses=0 >>
Nice !
Ok , now let ’s come back to our Compiled Method instance and check out it ’s scope accessor .
ss = m.scope #=> #< StaticScope:0xea parent=#< StaticScope:0xe8 parent=nil # module=Object > module=C > ss.interesting_methods #=> [ " initialize " , " module " , " parent " , " script " , " script= " ] ss.parent # => #< StaticScope:0xe8 parent=nil module=Object >
So now we ’ve essentially poked 2 levels deep : ctx.method.scope .
Let ’s rewind again and look at a our context ’s receiver and sender accessors .
To better understand both , let ’s come back to our OO roots of 30 years back and start calling ‘ method calls ’ ‘ messages ’ instead .
sender ( sends message ‘ get_mc ’ ) => receiver
sender is then the caller of the method , and receiver is , the object receiving the message .
Also known as self , during the execution of the method .
Let ’s see that in action :
r = ctx.receiver # => #< C:0xca @inst=42 > r == c # => true
So ctx.receiver is a reference to the instance we ’d put in the variable c .
From there of course we can do Ruby ’s regular meta - poking around :
r.instance_variable_get ' @inst ' #=> 42
Now let ’s look at the sender :
s = ctx.sender #=> #< BlockContext :0xf0 main#irb_binding ( irb ) :1 > s.class.ancestors #=> [ BlockContext , MethodContext , Object , PP :: ObjectMixin , Kernel ] s.interesting_methods - ctx.interesting_methods #=> [ " env " , " home " ] s.home #=> #< MethodContext:0xf6 main#irb_binding # /Users/mat/dev/_rubies/rubinius/rubinius/lib/irb/workspace.rb:1> s.env #=> #< BlockEnvironment:0xf8 @initial_ip=0 @last_ip=268435456 # @post_send=0 @bonus= #< Tuple : true >>
When calling a method from IRB , we ’re in a BlockContext instead of a MethodContext , but it ’s still in the family .
s = ctx.sender #=> #< BlockContext : 0xfe main #irb_binding ( irb ) :1 > s.class.ancestors #=> [ BlockContext , MethodContext , Object , Kernel ]
Anything new we need to know about ?
s.interesting_methods - ctx.interesting_methods #=> [ " env " , " home " ] s.home #=> #< MethodContext:0x102 main#irb_binding # /Users/mat/dev/_rubies/rubinius/rubinius/lib/irb/workspace.rb:1> s.env #=> #< BlockEnvironment:0xf8 @initial_ip=0 @last_ip=268435456 # @post_send=0 @bonus= #< Tuple : true >>
All of this is strangely reminiscent of a stack trace .
Before you go collecting all senders to explore the execution stack , let me point you to the convenient context_stack :
ctx.context_stack.length #=> 27 puts *ctx.context_stack #
Too noisy to output here puts * ctx.context_stack.map{ |s| s.describe } #=> # C#get_mc # Object#irb_binding {} # Kernel( IRB::WorkSpace ) #eval # IRB ::WorkSpace#evaluate # IRB::Context#evaluate # IRB ::IrbRubinius#process_statements {} # IRB :: Irb( IRB:: IrbRubinius ) #signal_status # IRB::IrbRubinius#process_statements {} # RubyLex#each_top_level_statement {} # Kernel( RubyLex ) #catch {} # ThrownValue.register # Kernel( RubyLex ) #catch # RubyLex#each_top_level_statement # IRB::IrbRubinius#process_statements # IRB :: Irb( IRB:: IrbRubinius ) #eval_input # IRB.start {} # Kernel ( Module ) #catch {} # ThrownValue.register # Kernel ( Module ) #catch # IRB.start # main.__script__ # CompiledMethod#activate_as_script # CompiledMethod#as_script # Compile.single_load # Compile.unified_load # Kernel( Object ) #require # Object#__script__ # #=> nil
I ’m pretty sure there ’s other areas specific to Rubinius that can be explored like that .
Please share any insight in the comments .
S - Expressions
Rubinius groks s-expressions out of the box ( similar to standard Ruby with ParseTree or ruby_parser .
An example ) .
require ' pp ' pp sx = " class C def meth ( arg ) arg * 2 end end " .
to_sexp #=> # s(: class , # :C , # nil , # s( : scope , # s( : defn , # : meth , # s( :args , :arg ) , # s(: scope , # s( : block , s( : call , s( :lvar , : arg ) , :* , s( :arglist , s( : fixnum , 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) sx [ 0 ] # => : class sx [ 3 ] [ 1 ] [ 1 ] # => : meth
With something that reminiscent to Lisp , it ’s probably better to explore recursively , though .
S -expressions are used by a lot of the Ruby code inspection tools to understand your ugly Ruby code .
Gems
I wo n’t touch trying out gems for today .
There seems to be little issues as the moment .
They do install , but I ’ve been having problems running them .
Please leave a comment if you ’ve had success with specific gems .
If you ’re curious and want to try playing with gems , Rubygems is already installed .
rbx gem install rails -- no-rdoc -- no-ri
Pro tip : always skip the documentation when playing with gems Rubinius .
The doc takes unusually long to compile .
Run the famous test suite
The spec suite that ’s been keeping all Ruby implementations honest was born from the Rubinius project .
It ’s been split into a separate project a while ago , since it ’s now such an important and central piece of the Ruby ecosystem .
Since they are now in a different project , we first have to get the most recent version .
Easy stuff :
rake rubyspec:update
rbx in your PATH
Before you run the specs , you need to do one little thing .
One of the specs expects a shell call to rbx to start Rubinius ( as in , the executable must be in your path ) .
The simplest way to do that for now is just to temporarily add the directory to your path ( right in your console , not in your .bash_profile ) .
pwd #= > / path/to/project/rubinius export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/project/rubinius/bin rbx -v
Run the specs
rake spec #
Time for another BRAWNDO !
Or rather , time to actually look at some of the specs you ’re currently running .
If you look in the spec directory , you ’ll see that it ’s pretty extensive , to say the least .
To start with something familiar , navigate to spec / ruby / 1.8 , in subdirectories core or library .
Open up a few of the specs in there and stare at them for a few minutes .
Or better , improve a few of them and try them out on MRI , JRuby and of course , Rubinius .
Conclusion
Well , now I ’ve tricked you into putting the Rubinius project on your hard drive .
And you ’re a Ruby developer .
What are you waiting for ?
I think Rubinius will be an awesome runtime for our Ruby programs .
It probably wo n’t be only Ruby in the close future , but the kernel of Ruby ( base classes & stuff ) is mostly implemented in Ruby , and the compiler is also implemented in Ruby .
This is awesome to help understand the workings of the language and to lower the barrier to contribution .
Which is already pretty low .
Rubinius is here to stay and it ’s gonna keep rocking .
T he modern era of Formula One began in 1950 , but the roots of Grand Prix racing are far earlier , including such pre-World War II legends as Italian Tazio Nuvolari and the great German teams , Auto Union and Mercedes Benz .
Copyright © 1997 , 2018 Glenn B. Manishin .
The modern era of Formula One began in 1950 , but the roots of Grand Prix racing are far earlier , tracing to the pioneering road races in France in the 1890s , through the Edwardian years , the bleak twenties , the German domination of the 1930s and the early post - war years of Italian supremacy .
At the birth of motor racing , cars were upright and heavy , roads were tarred sand or wood , reliability was problematic , drivers were accompanied by mechanics , and races — usually on public roads from town to town — were impossibly long by modern standards .
Regarded as the first motor race proper was a 1,200 km road race from Paris to Bordeaux and back in 1895 , won by Émile Levassor with his Panhard et Levassor in 48 hours .
One of the most successful drivers of the early year was Fernand Charron , who won the Paris - Bordeaux race in 1899 , also in a Panhard , at the blazing average speed of 29.9 mph .
The first race using the appellation “ Grand Prix ” was 1901 ’s French Grand Prix at Le Mans , won by Ferencz Szisz with a Renault , who covered the 700 miles at 63.0 mph .
The 1906 Grand Prix de l’Automobile Club de France , commonly known as the 1906 French Grand Prix , was organized at the prompting of the French automobile industry as an alternative to the Gordon Bennett races , which limited each competing country ’s number of entries regardless of the size of its industry .
In 1908 the Targa Florio in Sicily saw the appearance of “ pits , ” shallow emplacements dug by the side of the track where mechanics could labor with the detachable rims on early GP car tires — themselves a major technical improvement over the earlier technique of permanently attached wheels and spokes .
But even so , racing cars of the early years were too heavy and fast for their tires ; Christian Lauteschalnger ’s winning Mercedes shredded 10 tires in the 1908 French Grand Prix at Dieppe .
In 1914 , the massive 4 1/2 liter Mercedes of Daimler - Benz dominated the French Grand Prix at Lyons — 20 laps of a 23.3 mile circuit — taking the first three places and introducing control of drivers by signal from the pits .
During World War I , racing was halted in Europe , and many drivers participated in the U.S. Indianapolis 500 .
Enzo Ferrari — who ’s real fame was to follow as a team manager and manufacturer with Scuderia Ferrari , formed in 1929 to race Alfa Roméo P2s — finished second in the 1920 Voiturette race at Le Mans , the first international road race in France in six years .
B y tradition the Italian racing driver in action is an excitable character given to shouting , gesticulating , waving his fists , baring his teeth and giving way to his emotions .
Tazio Nuvolari filled this role splendidly .
The Farmer ’s Son – Cyril Posthumus
The first ( and , until Dan Gurney ’s Eagle - Weslake at Spa-Francorchamps in 1967 , the only ) Grand Prix victory by an American - built car was by Jimmy Murphy in the 1921 French Grand Prix at Le Mans , driving a Duesnberg .
Among the best of the 1920s manufacturers were Bugatti , whose straight - eight Type 35 Bs won the French and Spanish GPs in 1929 and the Monaco , French and Belgian GPs in 1930 , and Fiat , which introduced the supercharger for the first time in 1923 .
The year 1931 saw the formation of the International Grand Prix , later known also as European Automobile Championship , since all of the Grandes Épreuves took place in Europe .
It was the first international drivers ’ championship in motor racing history .
The original regulations stipulated 10 - hour races in France , Belgium , Italy and Spain , with two drivers for each car due to the duration of the races .
All cars without restriction on weight or engine capacity — hence known as “ Formula Libre ” — could participate .
The winners would be the driver pairing who in the 10 - hour period covered the longest distance .
The Great Depression of the early 1930s led to an unfortunate lack of money for and general interest in Grand Prix racing , but saw the emergence of the legendary Tazio Nuvolari , whose wins in the Alfa Romeo P3 “ Monza ” in the Mille Miglia , at Monaco and the Italian GP at Monza were stunning .
His fabled victories , well into Nuvloari ’s ’ 40s , in the 1933 Monaco GP , the first in which staring grid positions were determined by qualifying performance — and which saw nine Monza Alfas 8Cs , seven Bugattis Type 51s and three Maseratis 8 CMs entered — and in the 1938 Donington Grand Prix were epic .
( No one of the spectators at the latter , who went home having seen a tremendous race , could have imagined that it would take 55 years before the next Donington GP was run .
As winner Nuvolari got a worthy successor : Ayrton Senna ! )
Known to Italian fans as the “ Flying Mantuan ” or the “ Great Little Man , ” Nuvolari was just 5 ′ 3 ″ ( 160 cm ) tall and he soon found out that he did not have the muscular strength to force the cars around the corners with the steering wheel .
So instead he developed a technique where he put his car into a four - wheel drift and then controlled the slide with the throttle .
In all Nuvolari spent 30 years in motor racing and as was his wish , was buried in his uniform when he died , after a long illness , a short few years after the modern F1 series was initiated .
But in 1934 , the balance of power in racing would begin to shift from Italy to Germany , with the emergence of factory teams from Auto Union ( now Audi ) and Mercedes - Benz , behind massive financial support from the Third Reich government on orders from Adolph Hitler .
These powerful and beautiful German machines introduced aerodynamics into Grand Prix car design and ran on exotic , secret fuel brews .
Driving the sleek , silver 3 - litre V12 Auto Union in his trademark canary yellow jersey , Nuvolari achieved new greatness with these incredibly well - engineered automobiles — but nothing to top his 1935 German GP victory on the original , 14.173 milie Nordschleife ( “ Northern Loop ” ) at the Nürburgring , where he defeated nine modern German cars in a four - year old Alfa Roméo .
For the race , Mercedes Benz had entered no fewer than five cars , driven by Caracciola , von Brauchitsch , Fagioli , Geier and Lang .
The V - 16 4.9 liter 350 bhp Auto Unions were piloted by Stuck , Rosemeyer , Pietsch and Varzi .
Both German cars could , and did , exceed 175 mph .
Nuvolari passed Rosemeyer on lap six , passed von Brauchitsch on lap seven , was re-passed by the latter on lap eight , caught von Brauchitsch again , and Fagioli as well , on lap nine and passed Caracciola to lead the race on lap 10 .
The 250,000 German spectators could scarcely believe their eyes .
Nuvolari then had to sit through a “ typical ” Italian stop of over two minutes before he got back onto the track .
Angry at the delay , his blood was up and he drove like a total maniac .
Over the next few laps he passed Caracciola , Stuck and Fagioli as if they were nothing more than club racers .
A later than usual pit-stop by Rosemeyer moved the little Italian back into second place once more .
At the Karussell Kurve — a banked , tight left - hand hairpin paved on the inside line with concrete , now renamed Carraciola - Karussell — on the final lap , little more than 200 yards separated the red car from the Mercedes of von Brauchitsch , Nuvolari trailing , when a puncture on the silver car propelled Tazio to an astonishing victory .
Von Brauchitsch continued on the rim only to have to see the Alfa Romeo pass and go on to win in front of the astounded spectators .
With half a kilometer to go a second tyre blew on the Mercedes and a crying von Brauchitsch had to see three more cars pass before he could get his car over the line .
For a second there was silence , but then the Italian was met by tremendous cheers from the crowd .
This was a once - and - for - all triumph for the human qualities of skill , courage and judgement against the hard mechanical facts of speed , power and acceleration .
The Nazi officials were confounded by the lack of a recording of the Italian anthem to play over the loudspeakers — only Deutschland Uber Alles had been ready for the inevitable German triumph — but Nuvolari himself was able to right the situation with his own record of the Marcia Reale , which he carried as a good luck charm .

URBANA , OHIO — A defendant had a hard time facing the music .
Andrew Vactor was facing a $ 150 fine for playing rap music too loudly on his car stereo in July .
But a judge offered to reduce that to $ 35 if Vactor spent 20 hours listening to classical music by the likes of Bach and Chopin .
Vactor , 24 , lasted only 15 minutes , a probation officer said .
It was n't the music , Vactor said , he just needed to be at practice with the rest of the Urbana University basketball team .
" I did n't have the time to deal with that , " he said .
Champaign County Municipal Court Judge Susan Fornof - Lippencott says the idea was to force Vactor to listen to something he might not prefer , just as others had no choice but to listen to his music .

Launtaina 22.11.08 oli aamukahvi mennä väärään kurkkuun aamun lehteä lukiessani .
Turun Sanomien kolumnissa “ Poliittinen petos tulisi sanktioida ” lehden vt. vastaava päätoimittaja totesi EFFin olevan Suomen Sisun ohella tunnettu hyvin kansallismielisenä , maahanmuuttajiin vieroksuvasti suhtautuvana liikkeenä !
Sinnikkään yrittämisen jälkeen tavoitin puhelimitse Aimo Massisen ja syy moiseen väärinkäsitykseen selvisi .
Massinen ei ilmeisestikään tuntenut EFFiä järjestönä , sen toiminnasta puhumattakaan .
Koska hän ei ollut siihen hätään oikein muutakaan tietoa löytänyt , hän oli päättänyt luottaa siihen , mitä oli kuullut .
Lienee kohtuutonta olettaa , että Turun Sanomien tapaisen pienen paikallislehden vastaava päätoimittaja on kaikista valtakunnan asioista perillä , kuten sähköiseen äänestyskokeiluun , tekijänoikeuksiin tai sähköisen viestinnän yksityisyyteen liittyvistä julkisista keskusteluista .
Jos näin olisi , olisi luonnollisesti EFFikin tutumpi .
EFFin kannalta näin huono tunnettuus jossain Suomen syrjäseuduilla on toki harmillista .
Onneksi pääkaupunkiseudun lisäksi EFFi on jollain tavoin tunnettu sellaisilla keskeisillä alueilla , kuten sanomalehti Karjalaisen tai Kalevan levikkialueilla .
EFFin on syytä ponnistella , että sen toiminta tunnettaisiin myös Suomen syrjäisimmissä kolkissa , kuten Turussa .
Sen sijaan en ollut ymmärtää Massisen vaikeutta löytää asiallista tietoa EFFistä .
Jos ei jaksa muiden painettujen lehtien vanhoja numeroita jostain kaivella , pitäisi keksiä joku kuvaava hakusana , jolla tietoa voisi löytää Internetin ihmeellisestä maailmasta .
Itse keksin hakea tietoa “ effi ry ” sanoilla .
Kuinka ollakaan Google tarjosi ensimmäisenä tuloksena EFFin virallista kotisivua .
Lisäksi oli linkkejä juttuihin mm .

On an August afternoon in Washington , D.C. , typically miserable for its heat , humidity and stillness , reporters gathered at a downtown hotel not known for its air - conditioning .
Stuffed inside a windowless conference room that was being heated still further by the television people ’s lights , we waited for Michael J. Wallace , who had been trying , in fits and starts , to unveil nuclear power ’s second act .
On arrival , Wallace , a meticulous manager not known for ad - libbing , looked out over the sweating reporters and smiled .
“ It ’s days like today that highlight the real need for new , emissions - free , baseload power , ” he said .
Unless we get started soon , he added , rolling blackouts could become the norm .
Wearing a suit and tie and seeming to enjoy the heat , Wallace announced that his company , UniStar Nuclear Energy , a partnership between Constellation Energy and the European nuclear consortium Areva , was looking to build a new kind of nuclear power plant in the U.S. and elsewhere .
“ I ’m pleased to say I played a role in the last round of nuclear power plant development , and I ’m really pleased to be involved , ” the chairman said , calling to mind a graying astronaut who walked on the moon years ago and now wanted to do it again .
That was in 2006 .
Since then , Wallace has intermittently made new announcements about incremental progress toward building a new reactor about 45 miles south of Washington , which could be the first U.S. nuclear plant put on order and built since 1973 .
Wallace ’s original feat was leading the start - up of two of the nation ’s last big nuclear plants , completed in 1987 in Illinois .
Like another moon shot , the launch of new reactors after a 35 - year hiatus in orders is certainly possible , though not a sure bet .
It would be easier this time , the experts say , because of technological progress over the intervening decades .
But as with a project as large as a moon landing , there is another question :
Would it be worthwhile ?
A variety of companies , including Wallace ’s , say the answer may be yes .
Manufacturers have submitted new designs to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ’s safety engineers , and that agency has already approved some as ready for construction , if they are built on a previously approved site .
Utilities , reactor manufacturers and architecture / engineering firms have formed partnerships to build plants , pending final approvals .
Swarms of students are enrolling in college - level nuclear engineering programs .
And rosy ­projections from industry and government predict a surge in construction .
Modern competitive pressures complicate the matter , however .
For one thing , in much of the country any new construction would be by “ merchant generators ” — independent companies rather than large , monolithic utilities .
Nuclear power was simpler two decades ago , because utilities built their own plants and could usually pass costs through to captive consumers no matter how big the overruns .
But in states such as Texas , Maryland and New York , where the public service commission has separated the generation of electricity from power transmission and distribution , there is no longer a cushion for a generation company that guesses wrong .
Such plants must sell electricity at whatever price the market will bear .
That number is hard to predict , because although reactors would exploit current technologies and techniques , so will modern coal and natural gas plants .
Gas , especially , has much lower up - front costs , a big consideration if credit remains tight .
And gas plants can be built in small units in only three or four years , as compared with six or eight for mammoth reactors .
For nuclear power , the modernization is intended to produce dramatic differences : plants that will run more than 90 percent of the hours in a year and last for 60 years or longer .
The ones in service today ran only about 60 percent of the time when they were new and were assumed to have only a 40 - year life .
But utilities are already signing long - term contracts for large solar generators , and wind turbines are being erected at an unprecedented rate .
Those alternatives operate fewer hours of the year , but with no burden of fuel cost or fuel - disposal problems the price of power they produce could be low enough to squeeze nuclear power out of the mix .
Perhaps even more of a question is the shape of the market that reactors would serve .
Some states have a goal of zero electric growth , achieved by replacing lamps , pumps , blowers and everything else that runs on electricity with updated equipment that does the same work with less energy .
If growth stopped — an ambitious prospect — new plants would still be needed to replace old ones as they wore out , but far fewer orders would result .
By almost all accounts , cutting demand is a lot cheaper than building capacity .
Dan W. Reicher , a former assistant secretary of energy for conservation and renewables , has complained repeatedly that companies will invest in solar plants that produce electricity at 20 or 30 cents per kilowatt - hour , while ignoring fixes that would save comparable energy at a cost of four cents per kilowatt - hour .
Wild cards add even more uncertainty to how much power will be needed .
Proponents talk about tens of millions of plug - in hybrid or even electric cars , each of which might use 10 kilowatt - hours a day from the grid to cover 30 or 40 miles of travel .
That would substantially bump up demand , but the success of such vehicles is difficult to predict .
If millions of the cars did sell , they would mostly recharge at night , which would change the shape of the “ load curve ” — instead of households consuming peak amounts of power during the day and far less at night , consumption would be at a more constant level across a 24 - hour period , which favors technologies such as nuclear that are capital - intensive but operate around the clock with low marginal costs .
Consequently , any power company planning a big generating station that takes six or eight years to build does so without a clear prediction of what demand will be by the time the plant is finished .
Potential carbon regulation adds even more guesswork .
Governments are seriously considering a flat tax on emissions or a cap - and - trade system that would create a de facto surcharge for emissions .
Either way , predicting the price is hard : the initial experience in European trading was a wildly unstable market .
Still , economists predict such a system would result in a price that averages in the tens of dollars per ton of emissions .
A $ 10 charge per ton would raise the consumer price of electricity by about a penny a kilowatt - hour .
A new coal plant typically produces that much electricity for six or seven cents , so an addition of $ 20 or $ 30 a ton would create a huge advantage for carbon - free technologies such as nuclear power .
In fits and starts , a nuclear renaissance might actually be under way .
Wallace ’s vision is for standardized plants , identical right down to “ the carpeting and wallpaper , ” that could therefore be manufactured and approved for less than reactors of the past , almost all of which were custom - built .
Teams of engineers and craft workers would construct the same plant again and again in different locations ; just like assembling furniture from kits , practice would make perfect .
The idea that mass production — or , at least , serial production — is cheaper than one - of - a - kind products is nearly universally held in the industry .
John Krenicki , president and CEO of General Electric ’s Energy Infrastructure division , says site - by - site construction will never create a cost - effective solution .
Wallace ’s idea seems to be catching on .
The first standardized plant is planned as a third unit beside Constellation Energy ’s two existing Calvert Cliffs plants , about 45 miles south of Washington .
In July , AmerenUE , a big Midwestern utility , also filed a license application for a cookie - cutter unit .
More applications are waiting in the wings : one in Pennsylvania , one in upstate New York , one in Idaho and a twin - unit plant in Amarillo , Tex .
All would be built by the UniStar joint venture , in partnership with a local utility or generating company .
UniStar has not listed precise costs , but in recent briefings
Wallace has pointed to other studies of standardized plants that quote “ overnight costs ” ( not counting interest for construction ) of $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 per kilowatt of capacity .
His plants would be in the upper end of that range , he says .
An up - to - date coal plant costs about $ 3,000 a kilowatt , but charges levied on carbon dioxide emissions , or extra equipment to capture the gas instead , could add substantially to that .
The possibility of a series of new reactors is a stunning turnaround for the industry , which bankrupted some of its customers in the 1980s because of huge cost overruns and which looked so bad in the early 1990s that some completed plants were shut down after only a few years of operation .
Proponents say that today energy utilities find greater benefit in a technology that puts the financial risk up front , in the construction cost , and has little vulnerability to later swings in the price of fuel , as natural gas does , or to changes in emissions regulations , as coal faces .
Consequently , companies around the country are spending tens of millions of dollars to explore their nuclear options , conducting engineering studies and preparing license applications , even if no one has ponied up the billions of dollars that an actual reactor would require .
“ There ’s a huge sense of déjà vu for me personally , ” Wallace says .
More Viable Than Clean Coal
To no one ’s surprise , cost will loom large in any decision to plan on a reactor .
The first installation of UniStar ’s standardized model , known as a European Pressurized Reactor , or EPR , is under way in Olkiluoto , Finland .
The project is now behind schedule and over budget , after quality - control problems early in the construction period .
Other reasons to be skeptical of nuclear ’s price persist as well .
Estimates submitted by utilities to regulators in Florida predicted $ 8,000 per kilowatt of capacity when transmission and loan interest costs are included .
The cost of steel , concrete and labor have all risen , and the recent financial crisis may mean higher interest rates for construction loans , although that would affect the building of any kind of power plant .
Whether a reactor would be cost - effective depends on how it compares with other environmentally sound generation options .
Coal plants that capture their own carbon emissions are one choice , but the leading demonstration plant that was being built in the U.S. , known as FutureGen , has been scrapped .
FutureGen , originally planned for Mattoon , Ill. , was overseen by a public - private consortium .
The coal would have been cooked in a low - oxygen environment , creating a fuel gas made of hydrogen and carbon monoxide .
The hydrogen would be burned for electricity and the carbon converted to carbon dioxide and pumped underground .
The only emission would have been water vapor .
But as the price of materials rose internationally , the plant ’s cost went up even more .
In early 2008 the U.S. Department of Energy pulled out .
That move left China with the leading project , equally uncertain , which it calls GreenGen .
The Energy Department continues low - level work on so - called Gen IV nuclear reactors , fourth - generation technologies that use altered fuels or produce a more manageable waste stream .
Other low - carbon coal technologies are being attempted , too .
In Pleasant Prairie , Wis. , the Electric Power Research Institute and Wisconsin Electric are testing a process that uses an ammonia - based chemical to bind carbon dioxide in a smokestack so it can be sequestered .
But the test deals with only a little more than 1 percent of the plant ’s emissions .
“ We ’re maybe 15 or 20 years behind where we should be for burning coal in an environmentally sound manner , ” says Marsha H. Smith , president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners .
The bottom line is that although nuclear energy has obvious drawbacks such as cost and poisonously radioactive waste , it is far better demonstrated than coal with carbon capture .
More Dependable Than Wind or Solar
At the moment , the fastest - growing source of clean energy is wind .
The American Wind Energy Association said in September that installations had reached 20,000 megawatts , double the capacity of 2006 , with growth driven by generous tax incentives and state renewable energy quotas .
But wind plants run far fewer hours of the year than nuclear plants do ; 10,000 - megawatt wind machines produce the energy equivalent of only two or three big 1,000 - megawatt reactors .
Because wind is not “ dispatchable ” — meaning the generators run only when nature allows , not when operators might order them to — the extent to which it can replace around - the - clock technologies such as nuclear is unclear .
Solar is more predictable , and with certain forms of energy storage may even be dispatchable , providing power during cloudy periods or during high - demand hours after sunset .
Current solar facilities reflect the sun ’s rays off of curved mirrors to heat water or mineral oil , but experimental systems use materials such as molten salt , which could run far hotter and be stored in insulated tanks for hours or days .
Other companies are building massive arrays of photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity .
Generally , however , large solar and wind projects — the kind most likely to be cost - effective — are built in deserts or on remote mountaintops or plains , far from population centers that need the power .
So transmission lines must be built to connect supply with demand .
“ You ’re talking about immense amounts of transmission , ” says John Rowe , chair of Exelon , one of the nation ’s largest utilities .
“ It requires a really huge grid .
I do n’t see us going that way anytime soon . ”
Indeed , a recent Energy Department study concluded that wind could meet 20 percent of American needs by 2030 but would require a new transmission system costing $ 60 billion or more .
Nuclear reactors can be located far closer to consumers and would require more modest additions to the existing grid .
Efficiency Could Forestall Reactors
One of the strongest competitors nuclear power faces is energy efficiency .
Improvements in efficiency , driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , could for many years offset increases in demand from a growing population with higher living standards , forestalling the need for reactors .
In December 2007 consulting firm McKinsey & Company determined that the U.S. could cut its output of global warming gases by more than 11 percent using conservation steps that were better than free : they would pay for themselves and earn a profit .
These “ negative cost opportunities ” would require little or no technology innovation , the report said .
And emissions could be cut by another 17 percent with efficiency improvements that had only a moderate cost .
Amory Lovins , a well - known efficiency expert , has long referred to such opportunities as being better than a free lunch , “ lunch that someone pays you to eat . ”
But the steps are often not taken .
One reason is that efficiency is usually number 11 on people ’s top 10 to - do lists .
For example , a high - efficiency air conditioner costs more than a standard model but will earn back the difference , in electricity savings , in a season or two .
Yet many purchasers do not care , especially if they are landlords or builders who will never pay the electric bill .
Other steps might minimize convenience , even those that border on slothfulness .
Lots of home appliances , for example , continue to draw power when the switch is “ off ” so that they are always warmed up and can come back to life instantly .
Experts sometimes call this constant draw a “ vampire load . ”
Around the house , all those vampires add up , but hardly anybody knows or cares .
As Richard D. Duke , an energy expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council , quips , “ What consumer , when buying a TiVo , is going to demand that the manufacturer make the standby power consumption a criteria ?
Nobody . ”
Build before Memory Runs Out
Although individual consumer actions can help , major changes in carbon output will likely require better electricity - generation technologies , retiring much of the coal - fired capacity and replacing it with the most cost - effective combination of modern reactors , renewables and even clean coal .
Around the country , players in the electricity business — regulated utilities , independent merchant generators , and municipal suppliers — are placing bets on which options will be the winners .
The competition is a bit like a high school track meet , however , in which competitors ’ starting lines are staggered around the track .
Nuclear has the longest path , because it takes more time to obtain site and building permits and to clear safety reviews .
Yet anybody even thinking of a new reactor must pony up the entry fee — the cost of submitting an application and conducting preliminary studies .
Given the uncertainties in future demand , carbon regulation and the price of fossil fuels , exploring the nuclear option makes business sense .
Whether to actually build is another question .
One key factor is the price of loans .
If a plant runs $ 5 billion in “ overnight ” costs and the money is spent over five years , interest on capital during the period of construction — the utility ’s version of a home builder ’s construction loan — could add hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars .
To help , the federal government offered the nuclear industry loan guarantees worth $ 18.5 billion .
It quickly received applications for more than $ 100 billion in funding .
Another factor is just how long that construction period will be .
American builders could base their estimates on reactors built recently in Asia , but no one really knows how a project in Texas or Florida might compare with one in Japan or South Korea .
If two or three reactors , such as Wallace ’s , could get built in the U.S. , the issues would become much clearer .
Legislation that provides a predictable price for carbon emissions for the next few decades would also bring clarity .
The country needs a better way to manage nuclear waste as well .
The federal government signed contracts with the electric utilities in the early 1980s that promised to take spent nuclear fuel off their hands beginning in 1998 .
But today , 10 years beyond that deadline , the Energy Department has only applied for a license to build one controversial waste repository , at Yucca Mountain in Nevada .
Estimates of the opening date range from 2017 to never .
An interim plan , such as long - term storage in aboveground casks in a few areas that are dry and sparsely populated , might be within reach .
Many plants around the country have maxed out temporary storage in their spent - fuel pools , forcing them to put waste into huge , dry casks .
Filled with inert gas to prevent rust , the casks are moved out to concrete pads surrounded by barbed wire , which look a little like basketball courts at maximum security prisons .
Still , advocates say the reactors are inevitable .
At Areva , the company that Wallace ’s firm has partnered with , the chief executive , Anne Lauvergeon , scoffs at the idea that there is any other choice .
Could coal plants sequester their carbon ?
“ It ’s not ready at all , ” she says .
“ You do n’t know anything about the cost , and the technology does n’t exist . ”
In the meantime , world demand is galloping ahead .
Her company will build in China , she points out , and would like to build the first reactors in the Persian Gulf .
In the U.S. , many power industry experts doubt that more than a few reactors will be built , at least until company executives see how the first ones go .
But potential reactor builders sense that the world has changed enough to consider going back into business , with designs that are optimized and standardized versions of what they built more than 20 years ago .
And people like Michael Wallace want to get going while those companies ’ engineers still remember how .
More and more electric car dealers keep popping up in the Bay Area .
Most are a lot more affordable than the six - figure Tesla electric sports car .
The fully - electric Zenn is the latest addition to the green car market .
The name Zenn comes from " zero emission , no noise . "
The cars are made in Canada , are powered by battery and have most of the features you 'd find in a normal car .
But with a $ 15,000 price tag , they make an affordable alternative if you 're looking to go electric .
" There 's nothing to service really in the vehicle , " Zenn Motor Company CEO Ian Clifford said , " You do n't need a tune up , you do n't need oil changes , you do n't need an emissions test , obviously , so it 's just a very efficient way of driving through our cities and our neighborhoods . "
The Zenn has a government mandated top speed of 25 miles per hour and a range of 40 miles .
a faster , longer - range car is planned .
Rahm Emanuel ( left ) will be Barack Obama 's chief of staff .
Emanuel accepts White House job
Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) , a wily , aggressive West Wing strategist under President Bill Clinton , has accepted the post of White House chief of staff for President - elect Barack Obama , Democratic officials tell Politico .
The selection is the first major public decision by Obama since he was elected in a landslide on Tuesday .
Advertisement
Emanuel 's deputies will include Pete Rouse , currently Obama 's Senate chief of staff .
Rouse is known among Democrats as " the keeper of the list " — key jobs and who might get them .
After meeting with his economic advisers on Friday in Chicago , Obama will hold his first news conference as president - elect .
Aides say Obama and his family will relax at home for the weekend , then come to Washington to visit their new home , the White House , on Monday at the invitation of President Bush and first lady Laura Bush .
In a statement , Obama thanked the president for " reaching out in the spirit of bipartisanship . "
The choice of Emanuel sends a signal that Obama is eager to work with Congress and plans a swift launch of an aggressive agenda that will focus on the economy , taxes , energy , education and health care .
Republicans attacked the selection , however .
House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said in a statement : “ This is an ironic choice for a president - elect who has promised to change Washington , make politics more civil and govern from the center . ”
Republican National Committee spokesman Alex Conant issued a statement calling Emanuel " a partisan insider " and referring to him by his nickname of " Rahmbo " : " Barack Obama 's first decision as president - elect undermines his promise to ' heal the divides . "
The RNC started a new series called " Obama 's Broken Promise , " starting with the naming of " Hyperpartisan " Emanuel .
Obama plans to move briskly with his transition announcements and has also decided on longtime aide Robert Gibbs as his White House press secretary .
Democratic sources say he also could make quick decisions on his economic and national security teams .
" The chief " is sometimes known as the second most powerful person in Washington .
The job has vast authority , as the boss of the hundreds of aides who work directly for the president , a public face of the administration on television , and a negotiator and salesman on Capitol Hill .
The appointment was the first Obama offered after his election , and Emanuel pondered the opportunity for about 24 hours .
Friends said Emanuel accepted the job because he thought it was important to serve this historic administration despite the potential strain on his wife , Amy Rule , and their three children , who live in the Chicago area .
At 49 , Emanuel is two years older than his new boss .
Emanuel had been on track to eventually become House Speaker .
But friends say he decided the career detour would be symbolic of what Obama calls for in people and a signal of how important this time is for the country .
Emanuel viewed the decision as being not about personal advancement , but about putting aside personal ambition to bring change to the country , the friends said .
Emanuel is the fourth - ranking House Democratic leader and holds the title of Democratic Caucus Chairman .
His departure will touch off a leadership fight among House Democrats , whose majority was fattened on Tuesday .
He is also a member of the House Ways and Means Committee , which is among the most desirable assignments in Congress .
As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , Emanuel was the relentless architect of the Democrats '
House takeover in 2006 , and some Republicans said the choice sends a partisan signal at time when Obama is promising a new politics .
But Obama advisers say he likes and trusts Emanuel and believes his mastery of Capitol Hill will help speed his proposals at a time when money is tight and the nation 's problems are great .
Emanuel has a hard - nosed style and is known for aggressively working the press .
Despite his combative political instincts , he has working relationships with many congressional Republicans , including Rep. Adam Putnam ( R - Fla . ) , a rising GOP star who said after his reelection this week that he plans to leave his No. 3 post in the party 's House leadership .
The runner - up for the post was former Sen. Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) , who may take another senior post in the administration .
Emanuel is known as a centrist and a pragmatic dealmaker .
Under Clinton , he helped engineer passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which is opposed by the party 's left wing .
From his official biography : " Emanuel began his career with the consumer rights organization Illinois Public Action .
He worked on Paul Simon ’s 1984 election to the U.S. Senate and in 1989 served as a senior adviser and chief fundraiser for Richard M. Daley .
Emanuel served as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton .
After leaving the White House , Emanuel returned to Chicago to serve as a managing director at a leading global investment bank .
" Emanuel graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1981 and received a Master ’s Degree in Speech and Communication from Northwestern University in 1985 .
He is a resident of Chicago ’s Ravenswood neighborhood where he and his wife are raising three children . "
Miley Cyrus Hoax
This is not the first time that teen actress and singerhas been reported to have died .
Yesterday morning somebody posted a video on the Miley and Mandy Show page of YouTube stating that the singer had been killed by a drunk driver .
The video message was two minutes long and was supposedly initiated by Mandy Jiroux with Miley 's song Goodbye playing in the background .
The message read :
" Hey guys , this is Mandy and I have some very sad news :( ... We 're very hurt to tell everyone this , but Miley died this morning after being hit by a drunk driver .
Miley told us if anything ever happened to her , then we should let her fans know before the public ... R.I.P. honey , we will miss you much . "
By now the video has been removed from YouTube .
Mandy did post a message on her MySpace page saying that they had been hacked and that all was good with her best friend Miley .

Using Adium , I can logon to AIM , Yahoo , even LJ Chat ( tho I do n’t know why I ever would ) , but every moment or two , I get a password prompt .
If I pull up the Accounts screen and try to manually connect , it gets to “ Authenticating : 75 % ” and then hits me with another password box .
While I have no idea why this works , it does :
Quit / close your email client ( Thunderbird , in my case ) Quit / close your chat program ( Adium in my case ) Go to https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha
Complete the captcha prompt there and submit the form Restart your email and chat clients – all should be well .
It would seem some of sort of authentication bug with Google .
The captcha gets all of the services back on the same page .
IT started with a Harvard physicist acting on a hunch .
It ended up producing a new material , called black silicon , that could have a broad impact on technologies ranging from ultrasensitive sensors to photovoltaic cells .
On Monday , Harvard plans to announce that it has licensed patents for black silicon to SiOnyx , a company in Beverly , Mass. , that has raised $ 11 million in venture financing .
This would never have happened if the physicist , Eric Mazur , and his graduate students had stuck to the original purpose of their research .
He says their experience offers a lesson in government financing of science and technology , which is becoming so narrow and applied as to make discoveries like theirs much less likely .
A more narrow focus does have its advantages : for one , it can be more likely to produce an immediate payoff .
The formidable Charlie Nesson , founder of Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society and all - round good - guy law - prof , has taken up the defense of a Boston University student who 's been sued for file - sharing .
Nesson is arguing against the constitutionality of the record companies ' lawsuits , in a winner - take - all suit that could force the RIAA to come up with a better answer than " sue your customers " ( remember , the biggest file - sharers are also the biggest music - buyers , concert - goers , etc — being a music superfan meansyou do more of everything to do with music ) .
Nesson argues that the Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999 is unconstitutional because it effectively lets a private group – the Recording Industry Association of America , or RIAA – carry out civil enforcement of a criminal law .
He also says the music industry group abused the legal process by brandishing the prospects of lengthy and costly lawsuits in an effort to intimidate people into settling cases out of court .
Nesson , the founder of Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society , said in an interview that his goal is to " turn the courts away from allowing themselves to be used like a low - grade collection agency . "
Nesson is best known for defending the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers and for consulting on the case against chemical companies that was depicted in the film " A Civil Action . "
His challenge against the music labels , made in U.S. District Court in Boston , is one of the most determined attempts to derail the industry 's flurry of litigation .
On Tuesday , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) filed a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request demanding information from the government on U.S. Northern Command ’s ( NORTHCOM ) deployment of the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Combat Brigade Team ( BCT ) on U.S. soil for “ civil unrest ” and “ crowd control ” duties .
Last month , Army Times published a piece detailing how the 1st BCT spent “ 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq . ”
The 1st BCT –also known as the “ Raiders ” –carried out house - to - house raids and engaged in close - quarters combat in the city of Ramadi to suppress Iraqi resistance to U.S. occupation , according to a report on the World Socialist Website .
Readers will recall my October 11 piece , “ Militarizing the Homeland : ” NORTHCOM ’s Joint Task Force - Civil Support , ” that described NORTHCOM ’s Vibrant Response exercise at Fort Stewart , Georgia .
In tandem with the elite 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade , the 1st BCT participated in mock drills designed to “ coordinate with local governments and interagency organizations such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency , ” U.S. Northern Command News reported .
The Pentagon revealed that 1st BCT is a key component of NORTHCOM ’s Joint Task Force - Civil Support ( JTF - CS ) , designed to “ execute both homeland defense and civil support missions . ”
As I pointed out in a piece earlier this month , current Army doctrine is heavily - weighted towards contingency planning for “ civil disturbances . ”
Indeed , Army Times reported that the 1st BCT would be kitted out with “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded . ”
The publication reported , “ the package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets . ”
But after spilling the proverbial beans , Army Times retracted that portion of their report .
NORTHCOM now claims that a “ nonlethal ” weapons package was intended only for use in Iraq and not in the heimat .
In the opinion of this writer , this is nothing more than a feeble Pentagon move to spin a story that has garnered much unfavorable publicity since it first appeared .
Rules for domestic military operations , including as an armed force to suppress “ civil disturbances , ” are clearly spelled out in Department of Defense Directive 3025.12 ( DoD 3025.12 ) , “ Military Assistance for Civil Disturbances ” ( MACDIS ) .
Army doctrine and rules of engagement for civil disturbance and “ riot control ” planning have long recommended equipping troops with “ non-lethal weapons ” ( NLWs ) for what the Pentagon euphemistically calls “ operations other than war . ”
As researcher and activist Frank Morales reported in Police State America , the Center for Army Lessons Learned ( CALL ) , located at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , “ reacting to a growing sense of urgency to field weaponry in step with the requirements of globalization , issued a primer on the subject , entitled , Civil Disturbances : Incorporating Non-Lethal Technology , Tactics , Techniques and Procedures , ” in 2000 .
Why is the Pentagon now so hesitant to come clean on plans for using NLWs in the “ homeland ” ?
Since the late 1960s , the military has gradually expanded its brief to include domestic law enforcement , drug interdiction and border security , in clear violation of the Posse Comitatus Act .
The 1878 law specifically bars the use of the military in domestic policing .
However the trend towards militarizing the inherently civilian nature of locally controlled law enforcement has accelerated since the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , most infamously with the October 2002 creation of NORTHCOM itself .
U.S. Northern Command ’s original mandate “ to provide command and control of Department of Defense ( DoD ) homeland defense efforts and to coordinate defense support of civil authorities , ” has since expanded with the May 2007 National Security Presidential Directive 51 , Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20 ( NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 ) .
Indeed , as previously reported , NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 ’s top secret Continuity of Government annexes have been refused to members of Congress ; a clear move by the White House to inhibit the legislative branch from performing its lawful oversight functions .
What then , is the Bush administration hiding from Congress and the American people ?
The ACLU stakes out the legal ground on the erosion of Posse Comitatus and states ,
Civilian authorities , not the military , have historically controlled and directed the internal affairs of the United States .
This rule traces its origins to the nation ’s founding and has been reaffirmed in landmark statutes including the Posse Comitatus Act , which helps preserve the foundational principles of our Constitution and democracy .
( “ ACLU Demands Information on Military Deployment within U.S. Borders , ” Press Release , October 21 , 2008 )
Jonathan Hafetz , a staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project inquires : “ What is the unit ’s mission ?
What functions will it perform ?
And why was it necessary to deploy the unit rather than rely on civilian agencies and personnel and the National Guard ?
Given the magnitude of the issues at stake , it is imperative that the American people know the truth about this new and unprecedented intrusion of the military in domestic affairs . ”
Indeed , senior NORTHCOM commanders have repeatedly dodged these questions .
During an emergency , they claim JTF - CS “ supports ” the “ Primary Federal Agency [ PFA ] … designated to coordinate the government ’s response to a disaster or emergency situation . ”
But “ support ” to a civilian agency is not the same as playing a subordinate role to civilian leadership .
This is stated unambiguously by NORTHCOM : “ Although the JTF - CS supports the PFA throughout a CBRNE [ chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear and high - yield explosive ] consequence management operation , the unit operates within a clear Department of Defense chain of command . ”
In other words , the “ chain of command ” followed by JTF - CS begins and ends with the Executive Branch and the President in his role as leader of the “ unitary executive branch ” and Commander - in - Chief .
As former FBI whistleblower and senior ACLU national policy counsel Mike German states , “ This is a radical departure from separation of civilian law enforcement and military authority , and could , quite possibly , represent a violation of law . ”
To facilitate an open and public assessment of recent “ homeland ” military deployments , the ACLU demanded that the Departments of Justice , Homeland Security and Defense “ immediately make public all legal opinions , executive orders , presidential directives , memos , policy guidance , and other documents that authorize the deployment of military troops for domestic purposes . ”
Such a demand arises precisely because of the unprecedented expansion of the U.S. national security - surveillance complex since the 9/11 attacks .
As the civil liberties ’ group pointedly reminds us ,
[ T ]he Department of Defense has dramatically expanded its role in domestic law enforcement and intelligence operations , including the National Security Agency ’s warrantless wiretapping programs , the Department of Homeland Security ’s use of military spy satellites , and the participation of military personnel in state and local intelligence fusion centers .
The ACLU has repeatedly expressed concern about these incremental encroachments of the military into domestic affairs , and the assignment of active duty troops to Northern Command only heightens these concerns .
Unfortunately , some , if not most members of Congress , rather than defending the rights of the American people would rather re-write Posse Comitatus to reflect the needs of an “ Executive Branch gone wild . ”
As David Swanson reported on AfterDowningStreet.org , Senator John Warner wrote a constituent who had expressed alarm over the 1st BCT ’s attachment to NORTHCOM .
Swanson commented ,
This , like other changes imposed by President Bush , of course violates the Posse Comitatus Act .
It also served to strengthen the threats of martial law that Congressman Brad Sherman reported the White House making to Congress members in order to win their support for the $ 780 billion give - away to Wall Street .
( David Swanson , “ Sen. Warner Supports Domestic Use of Military , AfterDowningStreet.org , October 21 , 2008 )
Claiming he is “ deeply concerned that the Department of Defense and the President may not have authority to use active duty personnel in the most effective manner , ” Warner writes ,
I believe we must review the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act and similar provisions that limit the role of the active duty military to ensure that every available asset is properly employed in any type of future emergency situation .
Title 18 , Section 1385 of the U.S. Code , commonly referred to as the Posse Comitatus Act , prevents the armed forces from becoming involved in law enforcement activities for which , in most cases , they are not specifically trained or equipped .
Posse Comitatus is largely rooted in historical tradition that prohibits military involvement in civilian affairs .
To be clear , I do not believe that U.S. law pertaining to this matter needs to be entirely rewritten .
I do , however , think it is necessary that we review the regulations governing use of military personnel in domestic operations in order to better understand how all of our military assets can best assist during emergency situations .
Attentive readers will recall that “ The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 , ” included a section that permitted the President to deploy the armed forces to “ restore public order ” or to “ suppress any insurrection . ”
As Democracy Now ’s Amy Goodman reported earlier this month , “ while a later bill repealed this , President Bush attached a signing statement that he did not feel bound by the repeal . ”
The ACLU ’s concerns are fully warranted and demand an impartial evaluation of the dangerous implications for democracy , particularly in light of the current capitalist economic crisis .
As the historic meltdown deepens , social tensions–and struggles –will inevitably intensify .
As researcher and analyst Michel Chossudovsky wrote ,
Civil unrest resulting from the financial meltdown is a distinct possibility , given the broad impacts of financial collapse on lifelong savings , pension funds , homeownership , etc .
The timing of this planned militarization is crucial : how will it affect the presidential elections scheduled for Tuesday November 4 .
The brigade in its domestic homeland activities will be designated as the Consequence Management Response Force ( CCMRF ) .
What “ Consequences ” are being envisaged ?
( “ Pre-election Militarization of the North American Homeland .
US Combat Troops in Iraq repatriated to ‘ help with civil unrest ’ , ” Global Research , September 26 , 2008 )
While the state justifies this deployment as a response to “ terrorist threats , ” what other scenarios are being contemplated ?
With daily reports of voter suppression drives by the Republican Party in multiple “ battleground ” states hitting the corporate media , and a major exposé of these antidemocratic operations by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Greg Palast published in Rolling Stone , Washington ’s plans for the use of military force at home is a dagger aimed directly at the American people–and what remains of a democratic republic–by a thuggish and bankrupt ruling elite .
Obama to break off from campaign
Please turn on JavaScript .

US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is to leave the campaign trail for two days to visit his sick grandmother in Hawaii .
Madelyn Dunham , 85 , who helped to raise Mr Obama , is said to be seriously ill .
Mr Obama has spoken of their strong bond and has referred to her in some of his most powerful campaign speeches .
BBC North America editor Justin Webb says despite Mr Obama 's substantial lead over his rival , John McCain , his absence will make his staff nervous .
The 47 - year - old Illinois senator has the advantage in the polls with two weeks to go until election day on 4 November , but is not sufficiently far ahead to be confident of victory , says our correspondent .
Senator Obama 's grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , has always been one of the most important people in his life
Robert Gibbs
Obama aide
Profile : Madelyn Dunham
At rallies on Monday , his Republican opponent pledged to do more to help homeowners defaulting on their mortgages , and said that , unlike Mr Obama , he would cut taxes to help create jobs .
Campaigning in the swing state of Missouri , Mr McCain accused his Democratic rival of plotting to put up taxes .
" After months of campaign trail eloquence ... we finally learned what Senator Obama 's economic goal is ... he wants to ' spread the wealth ' around , " the 72 - year - old Arizona senator said .
Mr Obama had been due to campaign in the battleground states of Wisconsin and Ohio on Thursday and Friday - both states analysts say he appears likely to win .
Instead he will attend a campaign event in Indianapolis on Thursday before taking a flight to Honolulu .
Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that on Friday , the White House hopeful 's wife , Michelle , would campaign for her husband in Ohio .
' Heartland values '
The Democratic nominee is expected to resume campaigning on Saturday .
Mrs Dunham was released from hospital late last week and her health had deteriorated " to the point where her situation is very serious " , said Obama aide Robert Gibbs .
McCain insists it 's not too late - he 's invigorated at the moment , and seems to have renewed energy
Matthew Price 's blog " Senator Obama 's grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , has always been one of the most important people in his life , " Mr Gibbs said in a statement .
" Along with his mother and his grandfather , she raised him in Hawaii from the time he was born until the moment he left for college . "
In a campaign advertisement this year , Mr Obama described Mrs Dunham as the daughter of a Midwest oil company clerk who " taught me values straight from the Kansas heartland " .
She is also the " white grandmother " he referred to in a speech on race at the time questions were being asked about his relationship with his former pastor Rev Jeremiah Wright .
At the time , Mr Obama said he could no more disown Mr Wright than he could disown his grandmother - who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her on the street .
When Barack Obama finally emerged the crowd erupted - it was not applause but a roar , like one that greets a winning team or the full - throated cry of the fan
Gavin Hewitt 's blog
The development came as Mr Obama made campaign stops in Florida on Monday , including a rare joint appearance with his former rival Hillary Clinton .
He accused the Republican camp of " ugly " campaigning , keeping his focus on the economy and those in the state who have been hit hard by the mortgage crisis .
Early voting New York Senator Clinton joined her fellow Democrat on stage and urged a rally of 50,000 supporters to " close the deal for Barack Obama " .

It was the first time the pair - who were bitter rivals in the Democratic primaries - had appeared together since July .
Mr Obama has been pushing early voting on a major scale , using speeches , e-mails and advertisements placed in popular video games .
Thousands of his volunteers have been mobilised , including " town criers " riding on public buses , offering lifts to college students , and neighbourhood teams to give voters a push .
Meanwhile Mr McCain 's campaign has opted to focus its efforts more selectively on supporters who do not always vote in presidential elections .
About a third of US voters are expected to cast their votes early this year .

What are these ?
It 's nearly that time of the year – November .
November is __Na__tional __No__vel __Wri__ting __Mo__nth ( NaNoWriMo ) , and I 'll be joining the craziness and chaos of writing a novel in thirty days along with thousands and thousands of people world - wide .
It was ten years ago that a small group of 21 people in San Fransisco came up with the idea .
It remained a kind - of West Coast thing for several years but in the last few has exploded to an international event with over 100,000 people participating in NaNoWriMo last year .
( There are already more than 70,000 signed up for 2008 ) .
The concept is easy – starting midnight November 1st through 11:59 pm on November 30th , you write a 50,000 word novel .
Thirty days .
Fifty - thousand words ... or 1,667 words per day .
This will be my third year participating , and I can't wait .
I was able to eek out a win last year even going on vacation for a week .
In the NaNoWriMo world , a “ win ” is getting 50,000 words cranked out before the end of the month .
The concept is also simple – get words on paper ( or saved in electronic format ) .
You are focused on the quantity of words , not the quality .
Part of the theory of using an absurd amount of time and a large number of words is that it forces the internal editor to take a back - seat , and that the primary barrier to writing a novel is getting words down in a format that can be edited ...
As the NaNoWriMo about page details it :
Valuing enthusiasm and perseverance over painstaking craft , NaNoWriMo is a novel - writing program for everyone who has thought fleetingly about writing a novel but has been scared away by the time and effort involved .
Because of the limited writing window , the ONLY thing that matters in NaNoWriMo is output .
It 's all about quantity , not quality .
The kamikaze approach forces you to lower your expectations , take risks , and write on the fly .
Make no mistake :
You will be writing a lot of crap .
And that 's a good thing .
By forcing yourself to write so intensely , you are giving yourself permission to make mistakes .
To forgo the endless tweaking and editing and just create .
To build without tearing down .
As I wrote last year - you have permission to fail .
While the concept is easy and simple – the application is less so .
I do n't quit my day - job .
I do n't quit my night - job ( husband , dad , chauffeur to children 's activities , writing for GeekDad ) .
I fit the writing in whenever and wherever I can - I stay up late some evenings or get up early to pound out a few hundred words .
Throughout November the folks at NaNoWriMo headquarters send out pep - talk email messages and produce regular podcasts .
The forums are also both a great place for encouragement , ideas ( for things like character ideas , plot ideas , and answers to the questions you have to make your scene more realistic ) as well as a great place to totally waste time while procrastinating or fighting writer 's block .
So , I know a couple of GeekDad readers are fellow participants in NaNoWriMo .
If there are more , drop me a quick email with your NaNoWriMo name and I 'll add you as a writing buddy .
If you are n't already signed up , what the heck are you waiting for ?
The craziness , the chaos , the frustration , and most importantly the FUN make for an unforgettable month .
Mr. Brawdy , who extols the benefits of reconnecting with nature  “ dirt is in our DNA ”  during appearances at sporting goods stores and other venues , said a bout of skin cancer triggered his interest in renewable energy sources .
“ I decided to look at the bright side and harness the power of the sun to protect natural resources , ” he said , adding that a storm the night before yielded 40 gallons of water from the camper ’s rainwater harvesting system .
He said most of what he knows about the camper ’s wind turbine and solar panels has come from on - the - road experience  a fact he hopes will encourage others to emulate his example .
“ I thought I could show the world : ‘ Hey , Brian does n’t look like the sharpest knife in the drawer , so maybe I can have a rig like that , too , ’ ” he said .
Others have hopes of taking the environmentally friendly RV much further .
Alexandre Verdier , a 35 - year - old from Montreal , has designed a prototype camper that includes a diesel hybrid engine and solar panels that are controlled by a global positioning system to capture the maximum amount of sunlight .
The vehicle is an update of the classic Volkswagen Westfalia camper van , which was synonymous with the counter culture in the 1970s .
“ I did a lot of trips in the Westfalia , so I came up with the idea of a new green version , ” said Mr. Verdier , citing as particular inspiration a three - month trip he took with friends around the United States when he was 17 .

The design for the Westfalia Verdier won a 2006 - 7 Innovation for New Mobility prize awarded during the Caravan Salon Düsseldorf in Germany , one of Europe ’s largest caravanning exhibition and trade shows .
Mr. Verdier said that he was negotiating with a manufacturer and that the vehicles , with an estimated price of $ 129,000 , should be available next summer .
Even for those RV owners already on the road , being a pioneer has its challenges .
To fill their 100 - gallon tank with used cooking oil , Sara and Matt Janssen scour the landscape for fast - food and mom-and - pop restaurants willing to give away an increasingly valuable commodity .
The fueling process itself takes about an hour , Ms. Janssen said , adding that the couple invested in an on - board oil filtration system , which strains the “ batter and chicken chunks ” before the oil reaches the engine .
Last Friday , John McCain and Sarah Palin hit the campaign trail together for the first time as an official ticket , as Palin pledged her loyalty to " small - town America " in the Republican stronghold of Cedarburg , Wisconsin , population 11,000 .
That same day , the federal government released its monthly jobs report .
The unemployment rate stood at 6.1 % , the highest it 's been in nearly five years .
The American economy has lost 605,000 jobs this year .
It 's an economy , it bears remembering , that needs to add about 150,000 jobs each month just to keep pace with the growing workforce .
McCain 's addition of Palin to the Grand Old Party ticket has stoked up the conservative base , and her rhetoric will ensure that the campaign returns to familiar attack themes about Democrats being elitists and sneering at small - town values .
Meanwhile , many actual small towns are losing jobs , and the party in power has done little about it .
The party in power , of course , usually pays the price for a lousy economy .
But we know also that Republicans have used the above themes successfully in recent elections .
Will they work again ?
They just might .
After all , they pack quite an emotional punch .
But there are reasons to think that this time they might not .
To understand why , step with me into the wayback machine .
The American cultural divide has always existed , but in its present form it dates from the 1960s , when some conservative politicians figured out how to exploit liberalism 's support for minorities and other contentious causes .
George Wallace , the segregationist Alabama governor , did it superbly .
But no one was better at it than Richard Nixon .
As author Rick Perlstein argues in his book Nixonland , Nixon took all this personally .
At his college , there was a society that dubbed itself the Franklins - well - heeled , urbane and mostly liberal .
He started his own society called the Orthogonians ( a Latin portmanteau meaning , basically , " straight shooters " ) .
These were the unfashionable students , whose chief rallying tenet was resentment of the Franklins .
When he attained power , Nixon did his best to divide the country into Franklins and Orthogonians .
Our " blue " and " red " Americas are , in essence , these two groups .
But here 's the crucial point .
Not everyone is a Franklin or an Orthogonian .
Indeed , most Americans are n't particularly political .
They 're more interested in Brangelina or the new NFL season .
They vote on two bases : their instinct about the candidates and their immediate condition in life .
Orthogonian rhetoric usually works well with these folks .
They do n't spend their lives hating liberals because they do n't care enough to hate , but most of them can be persuaded that Democrats are going to raise their taxes and banish God from the public sphere , because , after all , Democrats have contempt for them and their values .
It worked for Ronald Reagan , who was running against a weak incumbent Democrat against whom a clear and comprehensive case could be made .
It worked in 1988 for George HW Bush , who faced an opponent who did n't know how to stand up and fight for himself .
It worked in 2000 and 2004 for George W Bush , whose opponents were easily tagged as elitist and who did nothing to fight the charge .
The two times it did n't work ?
For Bush
Sr in 1992 , when he was the incumbent and the economy was bad .
And for Bob Dole in 1996 , when Bill Clinton was the incumbent and overseeing a strong economy .
What about this year ?
Something is true that has not been true in any election going all the way back to 1980 .
This year , 80 % of Americans think the country is seriously on the wrong track .
Four out of five adults .
Excepting the most hardcore Bush supporters , that 's pretty much every adult in the country .
Sure , a smattering of that 80 % thinks the country 's on the wrong track because it is n't conservative enough .
But the majority is concerned about the usual things : the economy , the lack of good healthcare , America 's terrible standing in the world , and a host of other maladies .
The Democratic wager , then , is this : that most of the people in the vast uncommitted middle will not renew their Orthogonian membership cards .
So far , the theory appears to hold water .
McCain and Palin found a safely Republican town to visit in Wisconsin .
But , as of today , Obama and Biden are eight points ahead in that state - a state John Kerry won by just 10,000 votes .
How will Palin , an uber - Orthogonian , play in such an atmosphere ?
Early polling returns are not encouraging for the GOP .
In two focus groups , independents came away decidedly underwhelmed .
One typical comment : " She is a cool , poised speaker , but her speech contained few statements about policy or the party platform ...
I am not convinced that Palin 's experience as a mayor or governor in Alaska meet the qualifications to be vice - president . "
In normal times , Republicans win culture - war arguments .
But these are n't normal times .
The Democrats have to run a smart campaign : they must answer every attack and lodge several of their own , firmly tying McCain - Palin to the Bush - Cheney economic policy .
If they do it well , a majority of independents should join the Franklin club this time .

It 's been a long time coming , but after dabbling with touch on the midrange 5800 , Nokia has finally brought a touchscreen to an S60 " N - Series " smartphone , the N97 .
Take a look at our hands - on impressions and the complete rundown on Nokia 's new flagship .

But it 's not quite a full dive into touch - there 's still a horizontal QWERTY keyboard hidden below the 3.5 " 640x360 resistive touchscreen and accesable via a smooth 30° flip mechanism .
The N97 will run an even further touch - enhanced Symbian OS , S60 v5 , which features the 5800's quick contacts bar and adds an assortment of customizable desktop widgets that can pipe in your Facebook info , RSS feeds and the like , much like those found on Nokia 's internet tablet OS .
The widgets will be open to third party developers and available via the traditional " Downloads " Symbian app " for now " says Nokia - so not quite the App Store equivalent fans would hope for , but customization via software add - ons is definitely the route being pursued here .

But alas , the downsides .
Characteristically for Nokia , the N97 is aimed at Europe and Asia first .
So big ballers in Moscow and Macau can expect to be toting an N97 sometime in the " first half of 2009 , " with a U.S. release ( with the appropriate 3G bands ) to follow " soon after . "
In Europe it 'll run a hefty € 550 ( $ 695 ) unsubsidized .
The model we briefly handled tonight in NYC was , of course , the Euro version , with no U.S. 3G ( and , sadly , no Wi - Fi network availabile ) .
Its handlers were keeping it close to the vest , and with no connectivity there was n't much testing to be done , but we can say that the hardware is indeed pretty - befitting a $ 700 Nokia piece .
The desktop Symbian widgets look nice , but the drawbacks of a resistive touchscreen ( there , as always , to ensure character recognition via a stylus for Nokia 's Asian market ) were immediately noticeable when dragging widgets around the desktop .
A resistive touchscreen relies on pressing two layers of screen together with a fingernail or stylus to register a signal , so it is not as responsive as a capacitive screen which is driven by the natural electricity in your fingers ( more on the difference here ) .

Rounding out the gaudy specs are 32GB of on - board memory ( with 16 GB more available via microSD ) , A - GPS with Nokia 's refreshed Maps 3.0 app and a compass , accelerometer for landscape / portrait screen switching , 5MP camera with Zeiss lens and LED flash , 3.5 m m headphone jack , and N - Gage support .

Traffic Loop Sensor Activator
U.S. Patent 7,432,827 issued Oct. 07 2008
U.S. Patent 7,907,065 issued Mar. 15 2011
Latest development
A lot of work has been done on refining the activator into something more practical .
It 's now smaller , automatic ( no buttons needed ) , and mounts on the chain stay .
Here 's a picture :
You can follow the progress at VeloLoop.com .
Background
A common problem for bicyclists , and in particular for bicycle commuters , is the traffic loop sensor .
These are the devices which detect the presence of vehicles to control the sequencing of traffic lights at many intersections .
Often , they are installed in figure - eight slits cut into the pavement near a traffic light :
The way they work is to detect the slight change in inductance of the loop of wire buried in the slit caused by a large metallic object ( such as a motor vehicle ) above the loop .
This is usually accomplished by sensing the change in frequency of a free - running oscillator which is directly connected to the loop .
As the loop inductance changes , so does the frequency .
The problem for bicyclists is that , although many sensors are sufficiently sensitive to detect a bicycle , traffic departments often feel compelled to set the sensitivity of the electronics behind the loop rather low , so that false detections are avoided .
This can make it difficult at some intersections for a bicycle ( a relatively small metal object ) to make its presence known to the sequencing circuit .
The result is a lot of frustration for a bicyclist trying to get a green light or left - turn arrow .
This can be especially frustrating at streets with low traffic ( often where these sensors are used in the first place ) , as one waits for a motor vehicle to come by and trip the sensor .
Sometimes one must resort to laying the bicycle down on the road surface above the loop with the hope that the extra metal presented to the loop will cause detection .
Sometimes it does n't work , and sometimes frames are n't made of metal .
An electronic solution
Various devices have been patented in order to address this problem .
Some are a little impractical , and some do n't work with modern loop sensor circuitry .
One patented solution ( see USP 5,652,577 ) has the bicyclist laying down a big piece of metallic foil or screen right on the road surface !
A popular myth is that a strong permanent magnet will do the trick .
This is complete nonsense , since a magnet produces a constant ( D.C. ) field and can not change the inductance of the sensor loop , nor can it in any way pull the frequency of the sensor 's oscillator .
One must inject a signal at or near the operating frequency of the loop in order to cause the sensor to notice a change .
Although some will swear that their magnet is effective , it is possible that they have found a sensitive sensor , or that ( more likely ) another vehicle is present on an adjacent or opposite sensor and is activating the light sequence .
After studying this problem for many years , we have developed a new device ( It 's patented !
See USP 7,432,827 ) designed to be much more effective on a wide variety of loop sensors .
It has been developed in two forms :
The first form consists of a small ( 4 by 5 inches ) loop of wire mounted below the crank , some electronics to drive it , and a pushbutton to activate it .
Here is a picture of an early prototype , mounted on a bicycle :
A bracket holds the unit to the frame by attaching to threaded holes normally used for a lower water bottle cage .
The second form utilizes the metallic tubing of the bicycle frame to form a large loop for magnetic coupling to the traffic sensor .
This form consists of an electronics box and a transformer which clamps around the frame , somewhere on the large triangle ( see USP 7,907,065 ) .
Here is a picture of a prototype , mounted on the top tube :
Here is a picture of a newer prototype , made portable for demonstrations , and a diagram showing a little bit of how the electronics works :
In practice , there are some important considerations :
Many sensors are set up to require some amount of dwell time .
The object must be present for some amount of time ( often 10 - 20 sec. ) in order to start the sequence .
Often two loops are present , one in front of the other .
At some sites , a presence detection at either one will start the sequence .
At others , the first one must give a presence detection , followed shortly thereafter by a detection at the other .
This is as if a car pulled first over one , and then the other .
Very often , there is a " lockout " period , shortly after the light has changed back to red , during which presence detections are ignored .
For these , one must just wait a bit and then cause a detection .
Dwelling for the lockout period also works , but wastes battery power if using an electronic activator .
It 's easy to confuse lockout with a required dwell time .
There is so much variation in activation requirements that one must become familiar with each intersection in order to trigger presence using the electronic device in a way that minimizes battery drain .
The activator does not necessarily cause an immediate change in the traffic light status , and does not pre-empt the light .
It does not let you " run " the light .
Rather , it creates the same effect as an automobile creates in that it starts the programmed timing sequence for that intersection .
The timing of that sequence can be very different at different intersections .
The activator creates an indication of presence of a vehicle .
You may still have to wait a bit for the light to change , depending on that sequence .
However , you will eventually get the signal , just as a car would .
Traffic laws still apply .
You can read some manuals for one brand of inductive traffic loop detectors here ( Eberle Design , Inc. ) .
Visual Sensors
Inductive loop sensors often fail due to crushing forces beneath the pavement causing the loop wires to break .
As one can imagine , this can produce a maintenance nightmare .
This is the main reason why , over the last decade or so , inductive loop - based sensors are being replaced or passed over in favor of visual systems .
These rely on cameras mounted on traffic light poles and detect presence by the use of image recognition software .
The are looking for a large enough change in the image to indicate that a vehicle is present .
These are becoming very common , although by no means universal , and can be spotted at many major intersections :
These visual sensors can be more difficult for a bicyclist than the older loop sensor technology .
The visual sensor , especially when mounted far from where the bicyclist is waiting ( such as across a 4 - lane highway ) can often not detect the presence of something as small as a bicycle / rider .
One can wave arms , a jacket , or , that failing , wait for a motor vehicle .
At night , sometimes a bicycle headlight pointed directly into the camera will work .
In many cases , though , these can be nearly impossible to activate .
The future
On the brighter side , many traffic departments are discovering that the visual sensors can fail to detect motor vehicles when their color too closely matches that of the background .
Some departments have reverted back to loop sensors , and some will install both types of sensor in order to increase reliability .
Also encouraging is the emergence of infallible sensor loops which should keep the inductive loop sensor with us for a long time .

Canada Officially Goes Woo-Woo
No , I ’m not kidding .
The newly - elected Canadian government has officially declared that science is not a subject of importance to the citizens of the country , that no well - informed person is in charge of science education , and that the country has opted to take a back seat among the civilized nations of the world , in that respect .
For their new cabinet , Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s Conservative Party has selected a man without any science credentials , not a scientist nor a technologist , to serve as Minister of State for Science and Technology .
And what are his qualifications for this critical position ?
Ready ?
This man , Gary Goodyear , is a practicing acupuncturist and chiropractor !
Neither acupuncture nor chiropractic have any supporting evidence , they are both internationally recognized examples of quackery , they have been tested endlessly all over the world , and they have failed all examinations .
Perhaps PM
Harper was persuaded to appoint Goodyear because one of his important positions before he reached this exalted position was as Chairman of the all - party Canada - Armenia Parliamentary Friendship Group .
After all , there are literally hundreds of Canadian citizens who have Armenian roots …
However , the rumor that Harper is planning to appoint Uri Geller as Minister of State for Cutlery , is a base canard .
No , it doesnt matter to me .
I focus on other factors

We know that there will always be swindlers in the world , particularly when money is at stake .
What is surprising in the Madoff case is the magnitude and durability of the confidence game and the wealth and importance of many of the investors who went along for the ride , based largely on personal trust .
Madoff will go down in history along with Charles Ponzi , who gave his name to these pyramid schemes in the 1920’s .
Ponzi may have been the first , but Madoff was the biggest .
Look up Charles Ponzi in Wikipedia .
The US financial regulatory body will launch an in - house investigation into why it failed to detect Bernard Madoff ’s massive alleged fraud , despite almost a decade of warning signs .
“ The Securities and Exchange Commission , a once - proud agency with an impressive history as Wall Street ’s top cop finds itself increasingly conducting autopsies of leading financial institutions after failing , in the first instance , to perform adequate biopsies .
The issue arises as to whether investors in such a fund should be insured in any way , not against losses resulting from market activity ( those are business risks ) , but from losses through embezzlement , for example , if someone stealing the corpus of their fund , or if there is no fund .
Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox said the SEC “ has learned that credible and specific allegations regarding Mr Madoff ’s financial wrongdoing , going back to at least 1999 , were repeatedly brought to the attention of SEC staff ” .
Read
“ But ( they ) were never recommended to the Commission for action , ” Cox said in a statement on Tuesday .
Madoff , 70 , is the alleged mastermind of a $ US50 billion ( $ A71.9 billion ) fraud that is shaking financial institutions worldwide .
“ I am gravely concerned by the apparent multiple failures over at least a decade to thoroughly investigate these allegations , ” Cox said .
“ A consequence of the failure to seek a formal order of investigation from the Commission is that subpoena power was not used to obtain information , but rather staff relied upon information voluntarily produced by Mr Madoff and his firm . ”
Cox said he had “ directed a full and immediate review of the past allegations regarding Mr Madoff and his firm and the reasons they were not found credible , to be led by the SEC’s Inspector General ” .
Madoff is free on a $ US10 million ( $ A14.4 million ) bond , but will be in court on Tuesday to establish whether he has met bail conditions set after his arrest last week .
Editor 's note : Peggy Wallace Kennedy is the daughter of George C. Wallace and Lurleen Wallace , who both were governors of Alabama .
She lives in Montgomery , Alabama , with her husband , Mark Kennedy , a retired state Supreme Court justice .
They have two sons , Leigh , a decorated veteran of the Iraq war , and Burns , a college sophomore .
Peggy Wallace Kennedy says her father sought absolution for his segregationist views .
MONTGOMERY , Alabama ( CNN ) --
I heard a car door slam behind me and turned to see an elderly but spry woman heading my way .
The night before , a gang of vandals had swept through the cemetery desecrating graves , crushing headstones and stealing funereal objects .
My parents ' graves , situated on a wind - swept hill overlooking the cemetery , had not been spared .
A large marble urn that stood between two granite columns had been pried loose and spirited away , leaving faded silk flowers strewn on the ground .
I was holding a bouquet of them in my arms when the woman walked up and gave me a crushing hug .
" Honey , " she said , " you do n't know me , but when I saw you standing up here on this hill , I knew that you must be one of the girls and I could n't help myself but to drive up here and let you know how much me and my whole family loved both of your parents .
They were real special people . "
I thanked her for her kind words as we stood side by side gazing down at the graves of Govs. George Wallace and Lurleen Wallace .
After a few moments , the woman leaned into me and spoke almost in a conspiratorial whisper .
" I never thought I would live to see the day when a black would be running for president .
I know your daddy must be rolling over in his grave . "
Not having the heart or the energy to respond , I gave her bony arm a slight squeeze , turned and walked away .
As I put the remnants of the graveyard spray in the trunk of my car , I assumed that she had not bothered to notice the Barack Obama sticker on my bumper .
When I was a young voter and had little interest in politics , my father would mark my ballot for me .
As I thought about the woman in the cemetery , I mused that if he were alive and I had made the same request for this election , there would be a substantial chance , though not a certainty , that he would put an " X " by Obama 's name .
Perhaps it would be the last chapter in his search for inner peace that became so important to him after becoming a victim of hatred and violence himself when he was shot and gravely injured in a Laurel , Maryland , shopping center parking lot .
Perhaps it would be a way of reconciling in his own mind that what he once stood for did not prevent freedom of opportunity and self - advancement from coming full circle ; his final absolution .
George Wallace and other Southern governors of his ilk stood defiantly in the 1950s and ' 60s in support of racial segregation , a culture of repression , violence and denial of basic human rights .
Their actions and the stark images of their consequences that spread across the world galvanized the nation and gave rise to a cry for an end to the American apartheid .
The firestorms that were lit in Birmingham , Oxford , Memphis , Tuscaloosa , Montgomery , Little Rock and Selma were a call to arms to which the people responded .
And now a new call to arms has sounded as Americans face another assault on freedom .
For if the stand in the schoolhouse door was a defining moment for George Wallace , then surely the aftermath of Katrina and the invasion of Iraq will be the same for George W. Bush .
The trampling of individual freedoms and his blatant contempt for the rights of the average American may not have been as obvious as an ax - handle - wielding governor , but Bush 's insidiousness and piety have made him much more dangerous .
Healing must come , hope will be our lodestar , humility will reshape the American conscience , and honesty in both word and deed will refresh and invigorate America , and having Barack Obama to lead will give us back our power to heal .
My father lived long enough to come to an understanding of the injustices borne by his deeds and the legacy of suffering that they left behind .
History will teach future generations that he was a man who used his political power to promote a philosophy of exclusion .
As his daughter , who witnessed his suffering in the twilight of his years and who witnessed his deeds and heard his words , I am one who believes that the man who , on March 7 , 1965 , listened to the reports of brutality as they streamed into the Governor 's Mansion from Selma , Alabama , was not the same man who , in March of 1995 , was welcomed with open arms as he was rolled through a sea of African - American men , women and children who gathered with him to welcome another generation of marchers , retracing in honor and remembrance the historic steps from Selma to Montgomery .
Four years ago , the young Illinois senator who spoke at the Democratic National Convention mesmerized me .
I hoped even then that he would one day be my president .
Today , Barack Obama is hope for a better tomorrow for all Americans .
He stands on the shoulders of all those people who have incessantly prayed for a day when " justice will run down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream " ( Amos 5:24 ) .
Perhaps one day , my two sons and I will have the opportunity to meet Barack Obama in person to express our gratitude to him for bringing our family full circle .
And today , the day after the election , I am going to ride to the cemetery so that if asked , I can vouch for the fact that the world is still spinning but my father lies at peace .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Wallace Kennedy .

Although LIBOR Plunged For 17 Consecutive
Days it is not a sign of a huge increase in willingness to lend .
Inquiring minds note that Libor 's Biggest Drop Fails to Spur Loans .
The London interbank offered rate , or Libor , for three - month loans fell to 2.51 percent today , from 4.82 percent on Oct. 10 .
The rate is still 151 basis points more than the Federal Reserve 's target interest rate for overnight bank loans , compared with an average of 22 basis points in the five years before the global credit crisis began in August 2007 .
" Banks are cutting back , the economy is in a deepening recession and in that environment , I do n't think banks are going to become a lot more willing to extend credit soon , " said Jan Hatzius , chief U.S. economist in New York at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the world 's biggest securities firm .
" No one wants to lend because they are still wary of values of bank balance sheets , and no one wants to borrow from the money market because they can borrow directly from the central banks , " said Alessandro Tentori , a fixed - income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London .
Lender Of Only Resort
Funding Drought Slams China
China 's largest banks , with 4 trillion yuan of cash , are resisting government efforts to boost lending to 42 million small and medium - size companies that drove the economic boom of the past decade .
Half the nation 's toy exporters have closed this year , and 67,000 smaller enterprises filed for bankruptcy in the first half , according to government statistics .
Companies with assets of less than 40 million yuan provide three - quarters of urban jobs and 60 percent of China 's gross domestic product .
After five years of economic growth above 10 percent , the rate may slow to 5.8 percent this quarter , according to a Nov. 3 estimate by Credit Suisse Group AG .
That would be the lowest rate since at least 1994 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
" It 's wishful thinking for the government to try to talk banks into lending to stimulate the economy , " says Li Qing , a Shanghai - based analyst at CSC Securities HK Ltd .
" Banks are holding onto their purse not because they are bound by the quota , but because they are expecting mounting defaults and failures . "
" Chinese banks are getting smarter and they wo n't blindly follow lending directives from the top any more , " says Leo Gao , who helps oversee the equivalent of $ 2.3 billion at APS Asset Management Ltd. in Shanghai .
" We 've seen banks start to cut back loans to real estate and exporters since the second quarter as they know an outbreak of bad loans is on the horizon . "
Credit Card Bond Sales at Zero
Credit card companies were shut out of the market for bonds backed by customer payments in October for the first time in more than 15 years , as investors shunned the debt amid the global credit freeze .
A weakening job market and a looming recession are making it harder for consumers to make monthly payments , eroding confidence among investors about the safety of credit - card - backed bonds .
It 's the first month since April 1993 that there have been no sales , according to Wachovia Corp. data .
Issuers sold $ 17.1 billion of the debt in October 2007 , the data show .
" Nobody is eager to put money to work given the uncertainty in the market , " said James Grady , a managing director at Deutsche Bank AG 's asset management unit .
" When you think it can't get worse , it continues to get worse .
There is not a demand " for these bonds .
Mr. McCain himself is not popular with evangelicals .
But they will vote for him if they think the other guy may be on Satan ’s side .
In fact , of course , Mr. Obama took his oath on the Bible , not  as the rumors have it  on the Koran .
He is far more active in church than John McCain is .
( Just imagine for a moment if it were the black candidate in this election , rather than the white candidate , who was born in Central America , was an indifferent churchgoer , had graduated near the bottom of his university class , had dumped his first wife , had regularly displayed an explosive and profane temper , and had referred to the Pakistani - Iraqi border ... )
What is happening , I think , is this : religious prejudice is becoming a proxy for racial prejudice .
In public at least , it ’s not acceptable to express reservations about a candidate ’s skin color , so discomfort about race is sublimated into concerns about whether Mr. Obama is sufficiently Christian .
The result is this campaign to “ otherize ” Mr. Obama .
Nobody needs to point out that he is black , but there ’s a persistent effort to exaggerate other differences , to de-Americanize him .
Raising doubts about a candidate based on the religion of his grandfather is toxic and profoundly un-American , cracking the melting pot we emerged from .
Someday people will look back at the innuendoes about Mr. Obama with the same disgust with which we regard the smears of Al Smith as a Catholic candidate in 1928 .
An Introduction to Sine - Wave Speech
Matt Davis
MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit
Chaucer Road
Cambridge CB2 7EF .
1 ) Introduction :
Sine - wave speech is a form of artificially degraded speech first developed at Haskins Laboratory .
Several seminal experiments on the perception of sine - wave speech are described here :
Remez , R.E. , Rubin , P.E. , Pisoni , D.B. , Carrell , T.D. ( 1981 ) Speech perception without traditional speech cues .
Science , 212 , 947-9 . PubMed
In this work , Remez and colleagues demonstrated a dramatic change in the way in which sine - wave speech sentences are perceived , depending on listener 's specific prior knowledge .
For instance , listen to this sound :
Most naive listeners hear this as a set of simultaneous whistles , or science fiction sounds .
However , for listeners that have previously heard this sound :
Listening to the sine - wave speech sound again produces a very different percept of a fully intelligible spoken sentence .
This dramatic change in perception is an example of " perceptual insight " or pop-out .
We have argued that this form of pop -out is an example of a top - down perceptual process produced by higher - level knowledge and expectations concerning sounds that can potentially be heard as speech :
Davis , M.H. , Johnsrude , I.S. ( 2007 ) " Hearing speech sounds : Top - down influences on the interface between audition and speech perception . "
Hearing Research , 229 ( 1 - 2 ) , 132-147 . PDF .
There are four more example pairs of sine - wave and clear speech in the table below :
Sine - Wave Speech Clear Speech
As you listen to these four examples , you may find that you get better at understanding the sine - wave speech first time around .
This is an example of perceptual learning .
Having heard several examples of sine - wave speech , your perceptual system has tuned into this form of distortion , so as to be able to perceive new sine - wave speech sentences more clearly .
To my knowledge , no one has done controlled experiments to demonstrate that pop -out helps with learning sine - wave speech .
However , for another form of distortion ( noise - vocoded speech ) , we have shown that pop -out enhances perceptual learning so that people more rapidly learn to understand new distorted sentences .
These experiments with vocoded speech suggest that perceptual learning is also a top - down process :
Davis , M.H. , Johnsrude , I.S. , Hervais - Adelman , A. , Taylor , K. & McGettigan , C.M. ( 2005 ) Lexical information drives perceptual learning of distorted speech : Evidence from the comprehension of noise - vocoded sentences .
Journal of Experimental Psychology : General , 134( 2 ) , 222-241. PDF .
2 ) Generating Sine - Wave Speech :
Sine - wave speech is generated by using a formant tracker to detect the formant frequencies found in an utterance , and then synthesising sine waves that track the centre of these formants .
This is illustrated in the figures below :
A number of pieces of software exist for generating sine - wave versions of utterances .
These sentences shown above were generated using Praat software and a script written by Chris Darwin .
There 's also Matlab code to generate sine - wave speech written by Dan Ellis .
3 ) Other forms of perceptual insight :
There are a number of examples of perceptual insight in the visual domain that have been documented .
For instance , turning grey - scale images into high contrast , black / white images can produce a similar phenomenon to sine - wave speech .
This manipulation was originally described by Craig Mooney ( 1957 ) .
Click on the image to receive a visual hint about the content of this image .
This form of visual perceptual insight is discussed in greater detail by Nava Rubin in this paper :
Rubin , N. , Nakayama , K. and Shapley , R. ( 2002 ) , The role of insight in perceptual learning : evidence from illusory contour perception .
In : Perceptual Learning , Fahle , M. and Poggio , T. ( Eds. ) , MIT Press .
Which is where the example image above comes from .
I 'd be keen to hear of forms of perceptual insight , in other sensory modalities .

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - The Vatican ’s newspaper has finally forgiven John Lennon for declaring that the Beatles were more famous than Jesus Christ , calling the remark a “ boast ” by a young man grappling with sudden fame .
The comment by Lennon to a London newspaper in 1966 infuriated Christians , particularly in the United States , some of whom burned Beatles ’ albums in huge pyres .
But time apparently heals all wounds .
“ The remark by John Lennon , which triggered deep indignation mainly in the United States , after many years sounds only like a ‘ boast ’ by a young working - class Englishman faced with unexpected success , after growing up in the legend of Elvis and rock and roll , ” Vatican daily Osservatore Romano said .
The article , marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles ’ “ The White Album , ” went on to praise the pop band .
“ The fact remains that 38 years after breaking up , the songs of the Lennon - McCartney brand have shown an extraordinary resistance to the passage of time , becoming a source of inspiration for more than one generation of pop musicians , ” it said .
Lennon was murdered in New York in 1980 .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) -
Ice volume around the Arctic region hit the lowest level ever recorded this year as climate extremes brought death and devastation to many parts of the world , the U.N. weather agency WMO said on Tuesday .
The sun beats down on the haze shrouded skyline of New York across the Hudson River from Hoboken , New Jersey in this August 3 , 2006 file photo .
This year will be the coolest since 1997 but still the tenth hottest in a temperature record dating back 150 years , the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) said on Tuesday .

Although the world ’s average temperature in 2008 was , at 14.3 degrees Celsius ( 57.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) , by a fraction of a degree the coolest so far this century , the direction toward a warmer climate remained steady , it reported .
“ What is happening in the Arctic is one of the key indicators of global warming , ” Michel Jarraud , Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , said .
“ The overall trend is still upwards . ”
A report presented by Jarraud at a news conference showed Arctic ice cover dropping to its second lowest extent during this year ’s melt season since satellite measuring began in 1979 .
However , the Geneva - based agency said , “ because ice was thinner in 2008 , overall ice volume was less than in any other year . ”
It added : “ The season strongly reinforced the 30 - year downward trend in the extent of Arctic Sea ice . ”
The dramatic collapse of a quarter of ancient ice shelves on Canada ’s Ellesmere Island in the north of the Arctic Ocean added to earlier meltdowns , reducing cover in the region from 9,000 square km ( 3,500 sq miles ) a century ago to just 1,000 sq kms .
The WMO said the slight slowdown in warming this year , an increase of 0.31C over the 14C of the base period 1961 - 90 , against an average 0.43C for 2001 - 2007 , was due to a moderate - to - strong La Nina in the Pacific in late 2007 .
“ This decade is almost 0.2 degrees ( Celsius ) warmer compared to the previous decade .
We have to look at it in that way , comparing decades not years , ” Peter Stott , a climate scientist at Britain ’s Hadley Center , which provided data for the WMO report , told Reuters in London .
LA NINA , EL NINO
La Nina is a periodic weather pattern that develops when Pacific sea water cools .
It alternates irregularly with the related El Nino -- when the Pacific warms up -- and both affect the climate all round the world .
The WMO report was based on statistics and analyses compiled by weather services among its 188 member countries and specialist research institutions , including government - backed bodies in the United States and Britain .
“ Climate extremes , including devastating floods , severe and persistent droughts , snow storms , heat waves and cold waves were recorded in many parts of the world , ” the agency said .
In many of these , hundreds or even thousands of people died .
Among the disasters was Cyclone Nargis , which killed some 78,000 in Myanmar ’s southern delta region in early May .
In the western Atlantic and Caribbean there were 16 major tropical storms , eight of which developed into hurricanes .
In an average year , there are 11 storms of which six become hurricanes and two become major hurricanes .
In 2008 , five major hurricanes developed , and for the first time on record six tropical storms in a row made landfall in the United States .
The WMO says the 10 hottest years since global records were first kept in 1850 have all been since 1997 , with the warmest at 14.79 C in 2005 .
Countries have been struggling for years to reach agreement on how to halt the trend .
This month a two - week meeting of leaders in Poznan , Poland , called to prepare a treaty for late 2009 seemed to falter amid rows between rich and poor nations and what some climate campaigners say was lack of will to get things done .

Hussain pleaded guilty to the charges A drink - driver who killed a father and son in a motorway crash was performing a sex act on himself minutes before the collision , a court heard .
Imran Hussain was driving at speeds of up to 120 mph minutes before he ploughed into the back of a Fiat Punto carrying the Proctor family , from Wakefield .
Gary Proctor , 47 , and son James , 16 , died in the smash on the M62 motorway near Rochdale , on 3 August .
Hussain , of Bradford , was jailed for eight years at Manchester Crown Court .
Death threat
The 32 - year - old , of Como Avenue , pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one count of driving with excess alcohol at a previous hearing .
The court heard that Hussain 's erect penis was exposed when motorists came to his aid after the crash .
This man has taken Catherine Proctor 's entire family away from her in one fell swoop
Sgt Phil Robinson
Greater Manchester Police Judge Andrew Blake told him : " At the least it must have been a symptom you were not giving your full attention to driving . "
He sentenced him to eight years for each of the two counts of causing death by dangerous driving , to be served concurrently .
Hussain , a car dealer and father - of - four , was also banned from driving for 15 years .
Prosecutor Andrew Nuttall said Hussain had rowed with his wife hours before the crash and left the family home on Como Avenue for a night out with friends in Leeds .
He later stopped at a service station in Leeds in the early hours , where he was described as " staggering and clearly drunk " .
When challenged about ripping open a bag of crisps , he told the cashier : " I 'll find out where you live and will kill you . "
The Proctors were on their way to catch a flight to the US Police examined his mobile phone and discovered that he had called directory inquiries to request the number of an escort agency about 30 minutes before the crash .
Mr Nuttall said he called the agency - which provides female escorts on an hourly basis - but it was closed .
He said : " His attempts to contact the agency and the finding of him with an erect penis out of his trousers indicates that he was sexually excited and clearly handling his penis whilst he was driving and at the time of the collision . "
Hussain 's erratic driving in his Audi Q7 was reported to police by three groups of concerned motorists minutes before the crash .
Mr Nuttall said that , moments before the collision , the vehicle was seen lane - hopping , before veering across the carriageway and into the back of the Proctors ' Fiat Punto .
Several motorists stopped to help , including Christian Downard and his two friends .
Mr Nuttall said the trio went to help Hussain and saw that his penis was out of his trousers .
He tried to run away and hurled abuse .
The Proctors had been travelling to Manchester Airport to fly out to Florida for a family holiday .
Mr Proctor 's wife , Catherine , aged 44 , survived the crash , but suffered serious rib and arm injuries .
' Life shattered '
In a statement released by police , Mrs Proctor said no words could describe the devastation her family felt .
" No - one should ever go through the nightmare I have suffered over the last four months , " she said .
" My whole life has been shattered .
My hopes and dreams for the future have been taken away from me and the rest of my family .
We will never recover from this . "
Speaking after the hearing , Sgt Phil Robinson , of Greater Manchester Police , said : " This man has taken Catherine Proctor 's entire family away from her in one fell swoop .
" Not only had he got behind the wheel of his car when drunk , but he had driven so dangerously it is actually a wonder that he did not ruin anyone else 's life that day . "

If you drink enough beer , you ’ll probably be inspired to dream up some fantastic new inventions that would benefit mankind .
For some people , they go beyond merely dreaming and create very unusual beer - related products .
Some of these have novelty value , while others are simply quite surreal .
We have compiled 10 of the most bizarre and interesting for your wonder and amusement …

1. Beer + Milk = Bilk !
Do you need some extra vitamins and nutrients in your daily diet ?
Well , perhaps Bilk will help you .
Combining the power of beer and milk , this product sounds like something you would drink before bedtime to help you sleep better .
The product was devised by Japanese brewers as a practical solution to a milk surplus problem .
Bilk contains 30 % milk and is said to look and taste much like regular beer , although it has a milky aroma .

2. Guinness - flavored Marmite
If you have ever tasted Marmite ( a food spread made from yeast extract ) , you either love it or hate it – there is generally no middle ground .
So , a Guinness flavored Marmite is targeting a very niche market .
For this special edition , Marmite used a recipe with 30 % Guinness yeast to provide an alcohol - free Guinness flavor .
Guinness is famous for adding robust flavor to stews , but as something to spread on your toast – an intriguing thought !

3 . Fake beer belly
Most people take their time cultivating a beer belly the old fashioned way – by drinking copious amounts of beer .
If you ’re too impatient for that , or you want to scare your new mother - in - law , then a fake beer belly is the product for you .
A novel product for sure , I ’m just not sure how many opportunities there would be for wearing it .

4 . Beer for dogs
Is your dog jealous of your beer habit ?
When you crack open a dusty bottle of Leffe , does he look longingly , sniffing the air expectantly ?
If so , a Dutch brewery has developed beer for dogs , so Rover can join you in enjoying a regular tipple .
Named ” Kwispelbier ” ( Kwispel being the Dutch word for tail wagging ) , it ’s a combination of beef extract and malt and is tagged as “ a beer for your best friend ” .
Incidentally , the beer does not contain any alcohol , although commands a premium price of $ 2.14 per bottle !

5 . Beer scented candle
With this beer scented candle , you can waft a beery aroma around your home , without spilling a drop of your drink !
If that is n’t appealing enough , the Hotwicks website offers some complementary scented candles to help you recreate the mood of some very special locations .
Such candles include The Urinal Cake Candle , The Stripper Candle and the Hippie Candle .

8 . Beer on a stick
Beer can / bottle cozies are well established products with a purpose to keep your beverage cool .
However , here ’s an alternative product that may appeal to some drinkers .
With a design reminiscent of a ratchet combined with a popsicle stick and sporting a very bright yellow color , it will certainly help you stand out among the beer drinkers .
It ’s not clear from the image how you could rest your beer - on - a - stick down on any hard surface , but perhaps I ’m being pedantic …

9. Pizza flavored beer
The trend for flavored beer has given us some interesting combinations , but I think pizza flavored beer is in a category all of its own .
Created by Chicago brewer , Tom Seefurth , the beer is endowed with the essential flavors of a margarita pizza : tomato , oregano , basil and garlic .
No prizes for guessing what food pairing they might suggest with this drink .

Fake beer for kids
Just when you thought things could n’t get stranger than dog beer …
We ’ve all seen humorous photos of small babies holding beer bottles .
Well , here ’s a product idea that takes things one step further – fake beer for kids .
The packaging is designed to resemble a six - pack of beer and the beverage even has a head of foam when poured .
The drink itself is merely apple juice , however .
A surefire way to help your kids develop an early fondness for the world of alcohol , this may not help you win parent of the year award .

Here ’s the Sangaria TV commercial , showing the kids enjoying their fake beer :
Have we missed out on any other bizarre beer - related products ?
Have you ever tasted Bilk ?
Is there anything stranger than fake beer for kids ?

( Editor 's note : Electoral College chaos has rocked the Marvel Universe : The Daily Bugle is now reporting that Barack Obama has squeaked into the Marvel White House on electoral votes , despite Stephen Colbert 's having won the popular vote .
Read all about it in " Bugle Blows It – Obama Beats Colbert on Marvel Electoral Votes . " )
Sure , Barack Obama , you may rule the real world now .
But hyper-real comedian Stephen Colbert has claimed the presidency in the Marvel Universe , beating out both your audacity of hope and John McCain 's capacity for mope .
Marvel 's Daily Bugle headline is hot off the presses and details are sketchy for now , but it looks like the ballot results will be celebrated in Amazing Spider - Man No. 574 .
And no doubt the * Bugle ' *s freelance shutterbug Peter Parker , and his arachnid alter ego Spider - Man , had a hand in the victory .
As Underwire reported in its earlier piece on Colbert and Spidey , the truthiness squad was catching fire and was scheduled for a landslide .
That landslide has come at last , at least in the Marvel Universe , which according to Marvel editor - in - chief Joe Quesada , was more interesting than our own .
" Stephen tried to run for president in our boring universe , " Quesada explained in our earlier interview , " but unfortunately his campaign was stymied by the powers that be .
Not so in the Marvel Universe , where his campaign is in full swing and gaining momentum , once again proving that we would all rather be living in the Marvel Universe than the real one . "
Underwire asked Quesada on Wednesday to comment on whether Obama 's super Tuesday win has changed his opinion on that , or whether he 's sticking with Colbert as his preferred president .
He was suitably evasive , but he had a good reason .
He smelled trouble .
" While I personally throw my support behind whomever is elected our Commander - in - Chief , I 'm calling for a recount as I feel there may have been some voting improprieties , " Marvel 's honcho complained .
" With Mr. Colbert 's hard - line stance against illegal aliens such as the shape - shifting Skrulls , I suspect foul play of the intergalactic variety ! "
Wait , did he just call Obama a Skrull ?

Here we go again .
Although every recession is unique in the details , this one and those the country has experienced since the 1800s have at least one fundamental underlying similarity :
The boom that preceded them .
[ Thanks to Themeparks .about.com for this image of Tatsu , a new ride at Magic Mountain . ]
Let ’s compare what is happening today to what happened during the Great Depression .
In the 1920s after World War I inflating of the currency , Florida underwent a damaging real estate boom and bust cycle .
Florida ’s experience was so violent that one contemporary economist in 1928 called it " the Florida gamble . "
" When Florida land first started its upward course there were good substantial reasons for advancing prices ... [ but ] advancing prices drew those individuals who were speculatively inclined as molasses draws flies .
...
Large building projects gave an appearance of substance and worth to the whole affair .
In 1924 , pessimists were nearly all united that the Florida boom must soon end .
But the mass of people , than whom there are no greater gamblers , had Florida fever .
...
Then the bubble broke , as they always have and always will .
In the wake of the boom followed disaster , defunct banks , and depression . " Hmm .
Real estate bubble .
Sounds familiar .
In 1925 through 1928 as the Florida gamble unwound , the concomitant US stock market boom was showing foreboding signs of euphoria .
The article continues : " The [ stock market ] boom has not collapsed , and , from all appearances , is stronger than it has been for some time .
That seeming invulnerability and capacity for unlimited progress is a market feature of all such speculative periods as they near an end .
It is to be hoped that the Florida bubble will not be completely paralleled [ in the stock market ] .
Banks all over the country have entered on a new experiment in the past few years , .
[ Also sound familiar ? ]
A collapse in the stock market would make thousands of banks unwilling investors , very much as the Florida banks found themselves in the real estate business after 1925 .
Such an experience , with the inevitable blood - letting at the hands of receivers for the least fortunate , would be a blow to our progress that would force upon the country many months of painful convalescence . "
[ Quote from an unpublished paper , " Stock Speculation Versus Florida Memories , " E.C. Harwood , 1928 . ]
As we now know , the Florida real estate bust of 1925 was followed by the stock market crash months after Harwood wrote this prescient article .
Hmmm .
Stock market bubble .
Again , sounds familiar .
Between 1800 and 2008 , Americans have experienced boom and bust cycles ; yet economists as a class are known for their disagreement about the cause , with two notable exceptions .
One is the Austrian school of economists , scholars like Von Mises and Hayek , to whom our attention seems to turn cyclically after every recession , but of whom we tend to lose sight as soon as we get another taste of easy credit .
They 've been warning about credit imbalances and poor banking practices for over a century .
A more scientific thinker , this time from among the empirical economists , is the author of the articles noted above .
Through extensive study of banking statistics , Harwood concluded that markets in general , and international markets in particular , work best when unhampered ; but that they can only function well when the trading medium is staid .
Like the Austrians , he concluded that fluctuating fiat currencies and / or poor banking standards are a catalyst for excessive credit creation , resulting in speculative boom / bust cycles .
Using his analysis , he predicted the 1929 crash as evidenced in his articles published in The Annalist of 1928 and early and mid-1929 .
He also predicted the devaluation and flight from the dollar of the 1970s .
Furthermore , he maintained that the world would continue to suffer damaging speculative peaks and crashes until voters realize that it is our incompetent monetary policymakers who create them .
Legislators must acquire enough humility to admit that human agents cannot micromanage the quantity of money — a failing even Milton Friedman feared — and that government ’s only role should be to support the natural money - creation process through the establishment and maintenance of sound banking principles and of some form of currency measuring stick .
Both Harwood and the Austrians believe that , to date , the only such device that has succeeded for any length of time is the gold standard in one form or another .
The duty of our economic wizards is to find the version of it that fits today ’s parameters .
What are the chances our present or future administration will see fit to look for this solution ?
About zero .
Expect more rides in the future .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The price of gasoline , which soared to above $ 4 per gallon in July and hit motorists and industry hard , could retail at an average $ 1 per gallon next year , brokerage Alaron Trading Corp forecast on Thursday .

Alaron energy analyst Phil Flynn told a conference in Chicago he expected crude oil prices to range between $ 25 and $ 50 per barrel in 2009 , with the short - term target being $ 35 .
“ We ’re not going to see commodities turn around overnight .
We ’re entering a new era in commodities with more stable prices and we will not see the big spikes in prices we ’ve seen in the past , ” Flynn said .
Crude oil plunged about $ 108 per barrel , or nearly 75 percent , from a record high $ 147 a barrel in July to below $ 40 on Thursday as global consumption continues to slow .
Flynn also said that average retail gasoline prices in the United States next year could fall to $ 1.00 per gallon from the current average of nearly $ 1.70 ..
A MasterCard SpendingPulse report released on Tuesday pegged the current average price for gasoline at $ 1.67 a gallon and also said that demand for gasoline fell 2.5 percent during the week ended December 12 .
“ The days of easy money are over , credit will be tight and we could see five to 10 years of fairly stable prices , ” Flynn said .
“ We had the biggest OPEC cut ( oil production ) in history yesterday ( Wednesday ) and the market went down ... basically the market threw a shoe at OPEC , ” he said .
The reason OPEC cut production is because the global economy is struggling and the price of oil is declining because consumption is declining , Flynn said , all bearish factors for energy prices .
Alaron metals analyst Dave Meger told Reuters on the sideline of the conference that he expected gold prices to average $ 850 to $ 860 an ounce next year but he refused to predict a high or low price for the precious metal .
“ If you can tell me when the economy starts to recover then I can tell you when gold prices recover , and I ’m guessing right now about six months or so into next year , ” Meger said .
Meger said gold is still a safe haven investment and said those forecasting gold rallying to $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 per ounce may be right , but it wo n’t rally until it stops being traded as an asset class like everything else .
Gold remains about 17 percent below the all - time high of $ 1,030.80 it hit on March 17 .
It fell amid a wave of “ deleveraging ” in which investors sold bullion for cash to cover margin calls amid losses in other assets .
Demand for gold in Asia is tied to that region ’s culture and will stay strong but demand elsewhere will be weak until the global economy starts improving , he said .
Alaron grains analyst Tim Hannagan gave a contrarian view for the grain market , saying he expected wheat , corn and soybean prices to move higher next year .
That ’s in stark contrast to the past year ’s trend of grains almost mirroring the moves in crude oil and other commodities .
“ We ’ve divorced ourselves from the other commodities , ” Hannagan told Reuters .
Hannagan said corn prices in the spring of 2009 would range from $ 4.60 to $ 5.25 and he sees a summer high of $ 6 to $ 7 per bushel .
Corn futures prices recently dropped below $ 4 per bushel .
He pegged soy prices next spring between $ 10 and $ 11 per bushel and a summer high of $ 12 to $ 13 compared with prices below $ 9 this week .
Also , wheat prices from March - June will average between $ 7.50 and $ 8.75 , up from roughly $ 5.60 per bushel on Thursday .
Prices for grain and soybeans have fallen over 50 percent since record highs were set earlier this year but strong global demand for protein will boost prices , he said .
He also said that U.S. President - elect Barack Obama is even more supportive of green fuels than the current Bush administration , which is a good omen for corn and soyoil , the key inputs for the U.S. biofuels industry .
“ Ethanol expansion has slowed down and there have been some bankruptcies ” by some companies who had a faulty hedging plan but “ ethanol is n’t going away , ” he said .
There 's plenty of ways to convert Microsoft Office 2007 file formats ( .docx , .xlsx , .pptx ) to OpenOffice.org .
Now OpenOffice.org 3.0 imports these Office OpenXML files natively , but natively does n't mean a fluent translation .
Any translation is subject to imperfections .
For OpenOffice.org 3.0 , it is the first public release of the Office 2007 converters .
Overall , it is very good , but it stuggles mainly in areas related to tracking changes , comments , tables , and drawings .
You can wait for OpenOffice 3 to mature , but there 's another way for the impatient .
Knowing OpenOffice.org 3.0.0's weaknesses , I designed a .docx document specially to torture OpenOffice.org and to point out its weaknesses .
Here is the first page in Microsoft Office Word 2007 where the document was designed :
Here is the same . docx document on the same computer ( Windows XP ) in OpenOffice.org 3.0.0 using its native filters :
Finally , here is the same . docx document on the same computer in the same OpenOffice.org 3.0.0 , but the .docx was passed through odf - converter - integrator 0.2.1 .
Notice the conversion is much more accurate :
Originally I planned to retire odf - converter - integrator when OpenOffice.org 3.0.0 was released with native . docx , .xlsx , and .pptx support , but then I realized there is still a need for high - accuracy translations .
Instead of retiring odf - converter - integrator , I 've upgraded it with more features ( such as handling templates : .dotx , .xltx , and .potx ) .
The latest version is powered by OdfConverter 2.5 , a popular converter usually used the other way : to open ODF files in Microsoft Office .
Expect similarly better conversions with .pptx and .xlsx files , and try it yourself : download odf - converter - integrator and the reference document OpenOfficeOrg300_docx_bugs.docx .

I 'm very interested in the new RED cameras and would never think to hijack a thread , but all this talk of the value of 1000 fps has me laughing .
I mean , we do EXTREMELY well renting and selling Phantom cameras , and we only service the production market ( as opposed to the technical and military markets , which go directly to Vision Research ) .
If you only knew how many commercials used high speed , often very high speed .
All of the food shots flying by at 700 fps or so , car shots around the same , beauty products , etc .

Global swarming :
The super ants ready to invade your garden ... 100 million at a time
It lives in super colonies of more than 100 million and thrives in the cold .
Its name is Lasius neglectus - and it is heading for Britain .
Harmless to humans and not very different to look at than our own garden ant , Lasius is nevertheless causing researchers great concern .
Crawling menace : Experts believe it is only a matter of time before the Lasius neglectus ants arrive in Britain
So massive are its colonies , covering acres of ground , that it can drive out native insects and other species simply by out - competing them for food .
Apparently preferring urban parks and gardens to rural areas , it also invades houses , attracted to the magnetic fields created by plug sockets and often causing power failures by eating through wiring .
Thought to have originated in Turkey , by 2000 it had taken up residence in 30 parts of Europe .
Now the flightless creature 's huge colonies can be found in 108 locations in 15 countries , from Belgium to Uzbekistan .
Experts believe it is only a matter of time before the ant marches into Britain - that is , if it is not already here .
Researcher Dr Sylvia Cremer said : ' We assume they are going to spread even more or that they have spread already .
' They look like normal garden ants but there are masses of them . '
Lasius neglectus colonies are made up of as many as 1,000 nests .
Individual ants can move from nest to nest over areas that can stretch for miles , meaning the colony is essentially a single formidable unit .
Professor Jacobus Boomsma , one of those who discovered the species , said : ' When I saw this ant for the first time , I simply could not believe there could be so many garden ants in the same lawn . '
Lasius neglectus can thrive in temperatures as low as - 5 c , meaning it is perfectly adapted to the British weather .
Writing in the science journal PLoS ONE , the researchers said : ' Whereas most other pest ants require warm temperatures , Lasius neglectus can survive winters with extended frost periods , so that further dispersal into temperate climatic zones seems unavoidable .
' Invasive Lasius neglectus populations are a potential problem of global dimensions and a particular threat for man-made eco-systems in the cold - temperate climate zones that have so far suffered very little from invasive ants . '
Established colonies are very difficult to eradicate , meaning the quicker they are spotted the better .
Why do the majority of people – across cultures and throughout history – believe in gods ?
One way to address this question is to look at why it is that children acquire beliefs in gods .
If an idea can not be easily learned by children then it is relatively unlikely to survive into the next generation and will die out .
So if we can explain why children are so ready to believe in gods , we will be a big step closer in understanding religious beliefs more generally .
It may seem that the answer is simple : indoctrination .
Children believe because their parents or other adults teach them , right ?
Unfortunately , the story is not that simple .
Fortunately , it is far more interesting .
Children will believe a lot of what their parents teach them , but not everything .
Try to convince a child that a tarantula is harmless , that broccoli is a better food for them than crisps , or that Paul McCartney is a better musician than Miley Cyrus and you 'll likely get nowhere .
Likewise , teachers have difficulty teaching many scientific insights such as evolution by natural selection or that solid objects such as tables are composed almost entirely of space .
Children learn things that their minds are tuned to learn more readily than things that go against that natural tuning .
Developmental psychologists have provided evidence that children are naturally tuned to believe in gods of one sort or another .
 Children tend to see natural objects as designed or purposeful in ways that go beyond what their parents teach , as Deborah Kelemen has demonstrated .
Rivers exist so that we can go fishing on them , and birds are here to look pretty .
 Children doubt that impersonal processes can create order or purpose .
Studies with children show that they expect that someone not something is behind natural order .
No wonder that Margaret Evans found that children younger than 10 favoured creationist accounts of the origins of animals over evolutionary accounts even when their parents and teachers endorsed evolution .
Authorities ' testimony did n't carry enough weight to over - ride a natural tendency .
 Children know humans are not behind the order so the idea of a creating god ( or gods ) makes sense to them .
Children just need adults to specify which one .
 Experimental evidence , including cross-cultural studies , suggests that three - year - olds attribute super , god - like qualities to lots of different beings .
Super - power , super - knowledge and super - perception seem to be default assumptions .
Children then have to learn that mother is fallible , and dad is not all powerful , and that people will die .
So children may be particularly receptive to the idea of a super creator - god .
It fits their predilections .
 Recent research by Paul Bloom , Jesse Bering , and Emma Cohen suggests that children may also be predisposed to believe in a soul that persists beyond death .
That belief comes so naturally to children may sound like an attack on religious belief ( belief in gods is just leftover childishness ) or a promotion of religious belief ( God has implanted a seed for belief in children ) .
What both sides should agree upon is the scientific evidence : certainly cultural inputs help fill in the details but children 's minds are not a level playing field .
They are tilted in the direction of belief .
Justin L Barrett will discuss his research today at the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion seminar , " Born Believers : the Naturalness of Childhood Theism " at St Edmund 's College , University of Cambridge
Franken camp says they 're ahead 22 votes Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Update below :
Dem demands recount extension after ballots lost Al Franken 's senate campaign says the Democratic candidate has pulled ahead of Republican incumbent Norm Coleman for the first time since the recount began .
The campaign 's internal tally shows a Franken lead of 22 votes , campaign attorney Marc Elias told reporters on a conference call Wednesday .
( Independent tallies by local newspapers still show Coleman holding the lead . )
Plan to drop 600 ballot challenges Elias also said Franken 's campaign would be withdrawing 600 challenges of ballots , conceding that the votes clearly were meant for Coleman .
The two campaigns had challenged more than 6,000 votes between them , and Elias encouraged the Coleman camp to drop some of its ballot challenges .
Franken picked up 37 votes Tuesday night when elections officials discovered 171 ballots that had been uncounted .
The Franken campaign 's internal estimate is based on tallies from observers at recount locations and the assumption that a canvassing board will not reverse the votes on any challenged ballots .
Coleman 's campaign had challenged about 200 more ballots than Franken's , which Elias said depressed their numbers in other estimates .
As of Wednesday afternoon , the Minneapolis Star Tribune was reporting that the margin was at 303 .
Elias compared the challenge process to instant replay in a football game .
Sometimes instant replay will overturn a call , but it also often confirms that a call on the field is correct .
The same dynamic is in play with an independent canvasing board 's upcoming review of ballots in the recount ; an on - site election judge determined which candidate the voter intended to support and the opposing campaign had the option of challenging that determination .
The Franken campaign believes it will net more votes than Coleman after the challenges are determined , but for now it 's assuming the on - site judge made the right call .
" It 's more sensible to start with the proposition that they 're probably correct , " Elias said .
Update : Franken camp says 133 ballots lost in Minneapolis The Franken campaign has written to Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie demanding an extension to the recount , alleging that ballots in Minneapolis have gone missing .
Franken 's campaign said numbers provided by Minneapolis Elections Director Cindy Reichert show that 133 ballots disappeared between Election Day and Wednesday , when the recount had been expected to end .
" This is an incredible breach of the democratic process : 2,029 voters had their votes recorded on Election Day , and now local officials are able to produce only 1,896 ballots , " Franken Communications Director Andy Barr said in a release .
" That makes 133 residents of this one precinct in Minneapolis whose voices were just effectively silenced by this serious error , and it must be corrected before anyone can consider this recount complete or accurate . "
Reichart says she will keep the recount open until the discrepancy can be corrected .

Working in mice , they generated induced pluripotent stem cells , or iPS cells , and said they believe the method can work in people , too , and is an important step toward a new field called regenerative medicine .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells , giving rise to all the tissues , organs and blood .
Embryonic stem cells are considered the most powerful kinds of stem cells , as they have the potential to give rise to any type of tissue .
But they are difficult to make , requiring the use of an embryo or cloning technology .
Many people also object to their use , and several countries , including the United States , limit funding for such experiments .
In the past year , several teams of scientists have reported finding a handful of genes that can transform ordinary skin cells into iPS cells , which look and act like embryonic stem cells .
To get these genes into the cells , they have had to use retroviruses , which integrate their own genetic material into the cells they infect .
This can be dangerous and can cause tumors and perhaps other effects .
Last month U.S. researchers did the same thing using a harmless virus called an adenovirus , but the method was not efficient -- and introducing any virus into the body can pose risks .
Yamanaka ’s team tried several different methods but eventually looped three of the genes needed into one plasmid and the fourth into another , and transplanted these into cells from a mouse embryo .
The mouse embryonic cells reverted to a stem - like state and began behaving like embryonic stem cells .
Yamanaka ’s team said the method was also not as efficient as using retroviruses but said they plan to try their method using human cells .
If it works , some day doctors may be able to make tailor - made transplants to treat diseases in people by removing a few cells , transforming them in the lab and transplanting the new tissue or organs back in .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
More than half of mortgages modified in the first quarter were at least 30 days delinquent after half a year , and it 's necessary to figure out why so many modifications are not preventing re-defaults , regulators said Monday .
The proportion of modified loans delinquent by 30 days or more was 55 % after six months , according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
Modified loans that were 30 or more days delinquent after three months stood at 37 % , the agencies ' data showed .
" One very troubling point is that , whether measured using 30 - day or 60 - day delinquencies , re-default rates increased each month and showed no signs of leveling off after six months and even eight months , " said Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan .
" This trend of increasing delinquencies underscores the need to understand why these modifications have not been more sustainable , " he said in a statement .
The proportion of loans modified in the first quarter that were 60 or more days delinquent was nearly 37 % after six months , and 19 % at three months .
Also Monday , a private consortium of firms aiming to forestall homeowners entering foreclosure forecast that industry efforts are resulting in 2.2 million prevented foreclosures for 2008 with almost 950,000 mortgages having been modified .
For 2009 , the industry alliance known as Hope Now expects to double the level of modifications .
Telling details
During the third quarter of 2008 , delinquency increased in all loan categories -- prime , Alt - A and subprime -- with the percentage of mortgages that were current and performing falling to 91.47 % at the end of the September , down from 93.33 % at the end of the first quarter , the report compiled by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision said .
" Delinquencies continue to rise , foreclosures and other actions leading to home forfeiture also continued to rise , and loan modifications were associated with high levels of re-default , " the regulators concluded .
The report focused on 35 million first - lien mortgages , worth more than $ 6.1 trillion and constituting more than 60 % percent of all outstanding mortgages in the United States , held or serviced by national banks and thrifts .
Newly initiated foreclosures declined 2.6 % in the third quarter from the second quarter .
New loan modifications rose 16 % in the third quarter to more than 133,000 , according to the report .
Newly initiated home - retention actions -- loan modifications and payment plans -- also rose , up 13 % in the third quarter .
If you 're eager to get your hands on an EV but do n't have the money for a Tesla or Mini - E , the time to wait for a Mitsubishi iMiEV or the smarts to build your own , the guys at Ruff & Tuff Electric Vehicles may have just the ticket - an electric car that looks a lot like a Smart and costs $ 19,000 .
Ruff &
Tuff has teamed up with China 's Shuanghuan Automobile Company to bring the little EV to America as early as next spring .
The two companies hope to break into the budding market for EVs that are ( relatively ) inexpensive , safe and cool enough for urban environs .
The way they see it , the time is right to bring an affordable EV to the masses .
" There is a perfect storm of macro-events that are causing people around the world to take inventory of their personal habits and their effect on the environment ... and RTEV is entering the marketplace at this pivotal time , " says company CEO Mike McQuary .
Although the Wheego
Whip is capable of 60 mph , it 'll be restricted to neighborhood electric vehicle status and limited to 25 or 35 mph , depending upon the state , until the feds sign off on its crashworthiness .
That is n't expected until 2010 , by which time several cities will have some serious EV infrastructure in place .
The Whip , which will be called the E - Noble everywhere else , is made in China and based on the gas - powered Noble that Shuanghuan already builds .
Once the cars arrive in America , Ruff & Tuff will do the final assembly , fine - tune the drivetrain and program the controller .
No one involved in the venture provided much in the way of details about the Whip beyond saying it will use AMG dry cell batteries that provide a range of 50 miles .
This partnership wants consumers to see EVs as more than golf carts or toys for the rich .
They want you to drive your Wheego Whip to work .
" The long - held assumption has been that electric vehicles are quirky and impractical for everyday use , and are of interest to only a small group of eco-friendly consumers , ” McQuary said .
Their plan may be just ambitious enough to work .

Nona Nangalama checked out a dozen books from the San Francisco Public Library this week , saying that in better economic times , she would have gone to Borders to shop for the items .
The San Francisco resident and unemployed mother of two is using public libraries even more in these tough times .
She is checking out books instead of buying them , and using the Main Library 's job and career center to begin her search for employment .
" I live right near the Borders South of Market , so that would be easy for me to go there , " Nangalama said , holding 12 books on mastering algebra and geometry that she had checked out for her daughters .
" You come here and get advice , guidance and books - all for free . "
As the economy slides into a recession and families are cutting back on expenses big and small , libraries in the Bay Area and beyond are experiencing a big increase in membership and circulation .
But as demand rises , libraries are also seeing a squeeze in funding .
Libraries rely on property taxes , and city coffers everywhere have been hit by the bad economy .
Library officials from San Mateo to Marin County are beginning to look at ways to cut costs without reducing services .
" We 're trying to be conservative looking at the next fiscal year , " said Martin Gomez , director of library services for San Mateo County , which has 12 libraries in 11 cities .
" All of our numbers , in terms of visits and circulation at branch libraries , are up by around 5 percent .
But real estate drives our revenue , and property taxes are down .
We 're not looking at layoffs or reduced hours of operation , but we know the economy is going to take a while to bounce back . "
San Francisco 's public libraries have seen a 27 percent increase since July in the number of people seeking library cards , and a 12 percent increase over the same period in the number of materials checked out .
That amounts to 32,000 cards issued and 3.8 million books , CDs and DVDs checked out .
" We are seeing a significant increase in folks coming into the library to access our computers , to visit our job and career centers , and find information on government aid and look up credit ratings on financial institutions , " said Luis Herrera , city librarian for San Francisco , which has 27 branch libraries and the Main Library at the Civic Center .
" When the economy is down , library use is up , " he said .
More library cards
More Americans have library cards than at any time since 1990 , according to the American Library Association .
" Across the country , in every kind of neighborhood and community , library use , by various measures , is up , " said Jim Rettig , president of the American Library Association , which has 66,000 members and promotes libraries and librarianship .
" At this point , we have an entire population affected by the recession .
People are discovering they can save money by using libraries , and they can develop their knowledge and seek employment . "
Rettig said the 2 billion items checked out from U.S. libraries this year is 10 percent more than during the economic downturn in 2001 .
But books , DVDs and other material are only part of the story , he said .
" In 73 percent of U.S. communities , the only place a person can get free Internet access is libraries , " Rettig said .
" Libraries in areas hit hard by factory closings are playing an especially important role in the economic recovery .
Most job applications are now submitted online . "
Branches closing
Rettig noted that a number of cities , including San Diego , Philadelphia , Trenton , N.J. , and Mesa , Ariz . , are looking at closing branch libraries .
" Public libraries are facing the most severe cutbacks in decades , " Rettig said .
He said the American Library Association will submit a proposal to Congress early in the new year seeking $ 100 million in stimulus funding .
The funds would go to enhance services and materials ; extend hours of operation ; and offer more classes and workshops focused on financial literacy , housing counseling and small business development .
He also hopes a portion of the funds would go to renovating and upgrading facilities .
San Francisco's Herrera said the city 's funding for libraries is holding steady .
" We have support through a set - aside in the city 's general fund and property taxes , " he said .
" But we are going to be very prudent in how we approach spending .
San Francisco is really committed to providing library services for free . "
In fact , Herrera said , San Francisco has been increasing hours and services .
In November , seven of the 27 branches opened for an additional day each week .
Four libraries are under renovation .
The number of public computers at libraries has increased by 48 percent in the last two years .
Job seekers
Susan Cohen , a librarian for 15 years who now runs the job and career center on the fourth floor of the Main Library , is seeing more people come in asking for help with resumes and job searches .
She said applications for most jobs - from dishwashers to civil service positions - are submitted online .
She has worked in recent months to increase the number of books on how to find a job , start a small business or change careers .
Standing next to stacks of job - related books , with titles including " Jobs Directory , " " Resume Book , " " Your Next Move " and " Hire Me , Inc. , " Cohen said she 's doing what she can to help those who are struggling .
" I chose this job because I thought I could be useful , " Cohen said .
" It 's as satisfying as it's ever been .
But I can feel that times are tougher .
There 's a nervousness that people have over the economy .
I 'm happy I 'm in this position to be helpful . "
Obama warns US governors of “ hard choices ”
By Tom Eley
3 December 2008
Barack Obama spoke to some 40 governors of US states on Tuesday , the second day of the annual conference of the National Governors Association at Philadelphia ’s Independence Hall .
The conference was dominated by the economic crisis , which has imposed significant budget deficits on most states .
Yet in his brief remarks , the president - elect presented not a single concrete proposal and made only a few vague references to the social problems engulfing state governments .
Obama ’s sharpest comments served as public notice that his administration will be a regime of fiscal austerity .
“ Make no mistake , ” Obama warned , “ these are difficult times , and we ’re going to have to make hard choices in the months ahead about how to invest precious tax dollars and how to save them — hard choices like the ones you ’re making right now .
I wo n’t stand here and tell you that you ’ll like all the decisions I make .
You probably wo n’t . ”
The “ hard choices ” being made by the governors are sharp cuts in social spending , such as assistance programs for the poor , funding for public education , and unemployment benefits .
The governors are requesting a portion of whatever stimulus package the new president signs into law after his inauguration .
At the moment , the high - end figure being cited for the plan is $ 500 billion , although Congressional Democrats have hedged their bets by warning that any final legislation would be dependent upon Republican Party support , even though the latter saw its minority reduced further in November ’s general election .
There is little chance that the Obama administration will deliver to the states anything approaching the governors ’ full request of $ 160 billion , of which $ 120 billion would go toward funding infrastructure development and $ 40 billion to fund rising Medicaid costs .
Whatever resources the Obama administration makes available will prove woefully inadequate to meet the unfolding social crisis .
Furthermore , the figure will be a pittance compared to the sum allocated to bail out Wall Street by the Bush administration with the support of Obama and leading Congressional Democrats .
The states confront a cascading fiscal crisis .
Including cuts already made in the current fiscal year , it is anticipated that the collective 2009 - 2010 budget deficit for US states will be a minimum of $ 140 billion .
This figure could run higher than $ 200 billion by the middle of 2010 , threatening infrastructure spending , unemployment benefits , public education at all levels , and social assistance programs such as Medicaid — the health insurance program for low - income people .
States have already collectively trimmed $ 53 billion from budgets for the 2008 - 2009 fiscal year , according to statistics gathered by the National Conference of State Legislatures .
So far , for fiscal year 2010 , 25 states anticipate around $ 60 billion in combined deficits .
Most states are prohibited from deficit spending , due to the enactment of reactionary “ pay - as - you - go ” laws over the past few decades — the legislative equivalent of the “ no new tax ” pledges crafted to benefit the rich .
State budgets have been left particularly vulnerable to the economic crisis in part due to decades of shifting the tax burden onto working class families .
This has resulted in state tax regimes in which financial resources are dependent upon regressive forms of taxation such as the “ sales tax , ” whereby a flat percentage fee is tied to most purchases , as well as other forms of consumption taxes .
These sources of tax revenue are susceptible to cutbacks in consumer spending .
The collapse of the housing market has also sharply cut into tax receipts based on property values and sales .
The economic crisis is hitting states from two sides .
Due to layoffs , foreclosures and evictions , states face increased demand for the provision of social services .
Due to the same conditions , however , they have seen a steep decline in tax revenue .
The problem is particularly severe for the provision of health care services through Medicaid , as more unemployed workers , having lost their privately funded insurance and medical benefits , turn to state programs .
As a national average , the federal government contributes 57 percent of a state ’s Medicaid costs , while the state budget provides the rest .
But when state funding is removed , so are federal matching funds , meaning that state cutbacks in Medicaid are effectively doubled .
An estimated forty - one states face budget shortfalls in the next two years .
Leading the way is California , the nation ’s most populous state , and estimated to rank as the world ’s sixth largest economy .
On Monday , Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal “ state of emergency , ” convening the state legislature in special session in order to force new spending cuts .
Publicly funded construction projects have now ground to a halt in California , throwing more people out of work .
The state ’s total two - year budget deficit is $ 31.7 billion , of which $ 11.2 billion is a current revenue shortfall .
New York , the third most populous state , faces the second largest deficit — $ 6.4 billion for this year and next .
New York has been hammered by mass layoffs in the financial sector , centered in New York City .
Neighboring New Jersey has been similarly affected , with a shortfall is $ 2.9 billion .
Florida , the fourth most populous state , is $ 5.1 billion short on its budget .
The sixth most populous state , Illinois , Obama ’s home state , faces a deficit of nearly $ 2 billion .
The budget deficits are already devastating social programs and educational funding .
The following are only a handful of examples reported over the last few days :
• New York Governor David Patterson , a Democrat , has demanded cuts of over 10 percent from most state agencies .
Some have been unable to comply , such as the Department of Motor Vehicles , which stated that such large cuts would threaten its ability to generate income for the state .
The Department of Transportation insists that it cannot realize the full cut , as winter snow removal would cease .
The state police and prison system have been the only state agencies to be exempted from the 10.3 percent mandatory cuts .
• Florida has seen 100,000 people request food stamps in the last year , while about 1 million people applied for unemployment insurance in October alone .
• A Kentucky newspaper reports : “ Out - of - work Kentuckians who want to contest their unemployment benefits before Christmas are out of luck :
They may have to wait up to two months to get their appeals heard . ”
The decision results in part from a rapid increase in the number of appeals .
As bleak as the situation with state budgets is now , it is likely that current predictions underestimate the crisis .
At the same time , states are less prepared than at any moment in recent history to confront the social consequences of the economic crisis .
After decades of cuts to social spending — including the Clinton - era “ welfare reform , ” eviscerating assistance to the poor — state and local governments find themselves with few tools or resources .
Obama ’s appearance at the National Governors Association conference — and his appeal for state governors to prepare for the “ hard choices ” ahead — underscores that whatever the specifics of the incoming Democratic administration ’s stimulus plan , the full brunt of the economic crisis will be borne by working people and the poor across the US .
新はてブ正式リリース記念ということで。もうリリースから何週間も経っちゃったけど。
新はてなブックマークではブックマークエントリをカテゴリへと自動で分類しているが、このカテゴリ分類に使われているアルゴリズムはComplement
Naive Bayesらしい。今日はこのアルゴリズムについて紹介してみる。
Complement Naive Bayes は2003 年のICMLでJ. Rennieらが提案した手法である。ICMLというのは、機械学習に関する（たぶん）最難関の学会で、採択率はここ数年は30%を切っている。2003は119/371で、32.1%の採択率だったようだ。
Complement Naive Bayesの位置づけは
実装が簡 単
学習時間が短 い
性能もそこそこよ い
という感じで、2003年段階にあっても、絶対的な性能ではSVMに負けていた。しかし、学習が早いというのは実アプリケーションでは非常に重要で、SVMは昔の実装だと学習にかなり時間がかかる。というか、データが大規模になってくると、場合によっては使えない。私も前職でデータを作ってたときに、SVMではデータを増やしていくと学習時間が平気で数時間とかになって、焦ったことがある。
いきな りComplement Naive Bayesを説明してもたぶんわけがわからないと思うので、まずNaive Bayesを説明し、それからComplement Naive Bayes がNaive Bayesとどう違うのかを説明したい。最初は真面目に全部説明しようと思ったんだけど、まじめに説明するとどうしてもベイズの定理とかを出さざるを得ないしわかりにくいので、今回は妥協して少し不正確な説明にしてしまった。もっと正確な情報を知りたい人は、教科書を読むかおうちの人に質問してね。もしくは朱鷺の杜Wikiの単純ベイズの項を参照してね。
Naive Bayesでは（というか、ほぼ全ての機械学習アルゴリズムでは）、処理は学習とテストの2つのフェーズに分けられる。この場合、学習というのは、あらかじめカテゴリ分けされたデータを使って下準備を行うフェーズで、テストというのは(カテゴリが)未知の文書に対してカテゴリを推定するフェーズである。
Naive Bayesの学習フェーズ 学習のフェーズでは、カテゴリ毎にあらかじめ文書を用意しておき、それを使ってカテゴリ毎に単語の出現確率を学習しておく。出現確率、と書くとなんだかぎょうぎょうしいけど、実際のところ、全体中でその単語が何回出現したか、その割合を記録しておくだけでよい。たとえば、カテゴリ「社会」に全部で150個の単語があった場合に、そのうち3回が「社長」という単語だったとしよう。この場合、「社長」という単語の出現確率は3 ÷ 150 × 100 = 2%となる。（学習データに含まれない単語の事を考慮したりするともっと複雑になるけど、そこは今回は省略する。）
Naive Bayesのテストフェーズ テストフェーズではカテゴリを推定したい文書に対して、それぞれのカテゴリでの単語の出現確率を使って、文書の出現確率を計算する。もっとも出現確率が高いカテゴリを、分類結果として返す。文書の出現確率だなんて抽象的なものは正しく求めようがないので、文章中の単語の出現確率の積で近似する。
例として 、 「私は社長」という文章がカテゴリ「社会」とカテゴリ「おもしろ」のどちらに分類されるかを考える。この文章が「私/は/社長」の3つの単語に区切られたとし、カテゴリ「社会」でのそれぞれの単語の出現率が1 % , 5 % , 2%で、カテゴリ「おもしろ」でのそれぞれの単語の出現率が1 % , 4 % , 3%だったとしよう。すると、「私は社長」の出現確率は、カテゴリ「社会」では
0.01×0.05×0.02×100=0.001 % となる。また、カテゴリ「おもしろ」では 0.01×0.04×0.03×100=0.0012 % となる。0.001と0.0012を比べ、「おもしろ」での数値の方が大きいことが分かる。このため、「私は社長」はカテゴリ「おもしろ」に分類される事になる。
A former head of MI5 today describes the response to the September 11 2001 attacks on the US as a " huge overreaction " and says the invasion of Iraq influenced young men in Britain who turned to terrorism .
In an interview with the Guardian , Stella Rimington calls al - Qaida 's attack on the US " another terrorist incident " but not qualitatively different from any others .
" That 's not how it struck me .
I suppose I 'd lived with terrorist events for a good part of my working life and this was as far as I was concerned another one , " she says .
In common with Dame Eliza Manningham - Buller , who retired as MI5 's director general last year , Rimington , who left 12 years ago , has already made it clear she abhorred " war on terror " rhetoric and the government 's abandoned plans to hold terrorism suspects for 42 days without charge .
Today , she goes further by criticising politicians including Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , for trying to outbid each other in their opposition to terrorism and making national security a partisan issue .
It all began , she suggests , with September 11 .
" National security has become much more of a political issue than it ever was in my day , " she says .
" Parties are tending to use it as a way of trying to get at the other side .
You know , ' We 're more tough on terrorism than you are . '
I think that 's a bad move , quite frankly . "
Rimington mentions Guantánamo Bay , the practice of extraordinary rendition , and the invasion of Iraq - three issues which the majority in Britain 's security and intelligence establishment opposed privately at the time .
She challenges claims , notably made by Tony Blair , that the war in Iraq was not related to the radicalisation of Muslim youth in Britain .
Asked what impact the war had on the terrorist threat , she replies : " Well , I think all one can do is look at what those people who 've been arrested or have left suicide videos say about their motivation .
And most of them , as far as I 'm aware , say that the war in Iraq played a significant part in persuading them that this is the right course of action to take . "
She adds : " So I think you can't write the war in Iraq out of history .
If what we 're looking at is groups of disaffected young men born in this country who turn to terrorism , then I think to ignore the effect of the war in Iraq is misleading . "
Can anyone explain why Cheyenne the capital city of Wyoming is so windy for most of the year ?
What climate or weather produces these strong winds ?
PARIS ( Reuters ) -
The credit crunch is not nearly as severe as the U.S. authorities appear to believe and public data actually suggest world credit markets are functioning remarkably well , a report released on Thursday says .
A sign is pictured on Wall St. near the New York Stock Exchange in New York November 25 , 2008 .

As a result , governments are pumping masses of public money into the economy across the world because of the difficulties of a few big , vocal banks and industries such as car manufacturing , which would be in difficulty anyway , according to the report published by Celent , a financial services consultancy .
“ It ’s just stabbing in the dark with trillions of dollars , ” Octavio Marenzi , report author and head of Celent , told Reuters in a telephone interview where he questioned the depth of the analysis that preceded numerous fiscal stimulus packages .
The report , much of which is based on U.S. Federal Reserve data , challenges a long list of assumptions one by one , arguing that there is indeed a financial crisis but that , on aggregate , the problems of a few are by no means those of the many when it comes to obtaining credit .
“ It is startling that many of ( Federal Reserve ) Chairman ( Ben ) Bernanke and ( Treasury ) Secretary ( Henry ) Paulson ’s remarks are not supported or are flatly contradicted by the data provided by the very organizations they lead , ” said the report .
Perhaps the U.S. central bank and treasury department , and authorities in other countries by extension , know something they are not telling anyone and which is far more worrying than the public data shows , the report says .
Or , more plausibly , they were generalizing erroneously from the bad experience of a limited number of big banks and companies that are in any case in difficulty .
“ I do n’t think they ’re fabricating stuff but what I think they are doing is taking the situation of a handful of institutions and generalizing that to the market as a whole , incorrectly , ” said Marenzi .
The picture appeared to be broadly similar in much of Europe and Japan , said the report , based on publicly available data on trends in bank lending to industry , households and among banks themselves in the so - called interbank markets .
ALL A MYTH ?
Regarding U.S. business access to credit , the report says :
* Overall U.S. bank lending is at its highest level ever and has grown during the current financial crisies .
* U.S. commercial bank lending is at record highs and growing particularly fast since May 2007 .
* Corporate bond issuance has declined but increased commercial lending has compensated for this .
As for the interbank market , it says :
* lending hit its highest level ever in September 2008 and remained high in October and that overall interbank lending is up 22 percent since the start of the financial crisis , taken to be mid-2007 .
* The cost of interbank lending , as measured by the interest rates banks charge each other for lending overnight Fed funds , dropped to its lowest level ever in early November and remains at very low levels .
Marenzi said one of the other measures used by many to gauge interbank lending -- the LIBOR rate -- was a flawed gauge since it was based on daily observations of eight banks , many of which were banks with particularly severe difficulties of their own .
The report argues similarly on consumer credit , which it said was at a record high in September , the latest date for publicly available data .
Local government bond issuance had continued at similar levels to those before the credit crisis , while bank lending for real estate reached a record level in October 2008 , it says .
In Europe , the study says there is no evidence of a credit crisis in consumer and commercial lending data up to the end of October , with consumer lending in France and Italy still keeping to trends seen since early 2003 and Germany flatter but for many years and not any more so in recent times .
Bank lending in Britain , tracked from 1999 to October 2008 , was at its highest level ever and continued uninterrupted through the credit crisis , the report says .
In Japan , banks began to increase lending activity in late 2005 after a long decline and there has been no sign of a precipitous decline through to October 2008 , it said .
“ Indeed , no decline is visible at all since the credit crisis began . ”
All of which drove the Celent report to conclude that the U.S. and other governments may be throwing good money after bad for want of a better idea of what is really happening .
“ Just like a doctor contemplating an obviously sick and suffering patient , a massive surgical intervention based on a misdiagnosis can only worsen the patient ’s condition . ”

' We will definitely pay a price , but we cannot allow the current situation to continue , ' one of them says

The security establishment estimates that Israel will soon have to launch an extensive military operation in Gaza in an effort to quell the incessant rocket and mortar fire on the country 's southern region , Ynet has learned .

" We will definitely pay a price , but we cannot allow the current situation to continue , " one official said Saturday night .
" We would like to see the ceasefire resume , but Hamas , Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committees are leaving us no other choice because they are carrying on with the rocket fire .
This is why we are on a collision course with them , even if we have to act in the midst of the election campaign here in Israel and before US President - elect Barack Obama 's inauguration . "

Similar situation during Ariel Sharon 's term
The security establishment is well - aware that the Israeli public is in favor of a harsh Israeli response and that , for the most part , the rocket attacks are condemned by the international community .
In addition , the security establishment fears that a lengthy operation with heavy casualties for both sides may sway public opinion in Israel and within the international community .

If and when the confrontation does erupt , Israel will make an effort to prevent any escalation on its other fronts .
The government will also look to shorten the fighting in Gaza and perhaps call for the renewal of the ceasefire if Hamas accepts its terms .

Barack Obama and congressional leaders are preparing rapid legislation to cut US emissions that cause global warming and to kick - start a clean energy revolution .
Two bills are to be introduced as soon as the President - elect takes office in January .
One will provide $ 15 bn ( £ 10.1 bn ) a year to encourage innovation in renewable energies as part of a thorough overhaul of the highly polluting US energy system .
The other will pave the way to setting up a system of tradable emissions permits to combat global warming .
The moves , to be taken quicker than expected , will galvanise top - level international negotiations on a new climate treaty that reopens in Poznan , Poland , next week , and will greatly boost attempts to bring in a " green new deal " as the best way out of the financial crisis .
Yesterday – as exclusively predicted in The Independent on Sunday three weeks ago – Mr Obama took the first steps towards creating green jobs , a crucial element of the proposed deal , as a top priority for his forthcoming administration .
In his weekly radio address , he announced that he has ordered his advisers to produce an economic recovery plan that will create 2.5 million new jobs in two years by building windfarms , making solar panels and fuel - efficient cars , as well as in modernising schools and re-building crumbling infrastructure .

Senior Democratic sources added that the President - elect had picked Timothy Geithner , head of the New york Federal Reserve Bank to be his Treasury Secretary .
" We are facing a sea change , " said Barbara Boxer , the Democratic head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee , of the two new bills .
" Instead of denial we will have resolve ; instead of procrastination we will have action .
The time to start is now . "
The energy bill is expected to pass rapidly through the houses of Congress – in both of which the Democrats will have increased majorities – with some experts expecting it to become law by the summer .
Sources close to the rapidly forming Obama administration say that it will include tax breaks to encourage wind , solar and other renewable energies , and the creation of a grid to deliver their electricity effectively .
There will also be incentives for consumers to buy fuel - efficient cars , and for householders and businesses to conserve energy .
There will be massive investment in developing carbon capture and storage , which removes carbon dioxide from power station emissions .
And the bill may include a bid to set a nationwide target for the amount of energy to be obtained from renewable energy .
Most controversially , there is likely to be an increase in drilling for oil more than 25 miles offshore , not least to provide revenues to finance the energy revolution .
The climate bill will instruct the US Environmental Protection Agency to introduce a national " cap and trade " system for regulating emissions of carbon dioxide .
This gives the polluters limits on what they are allowed to emit , but leaves them able to trade them ; so those that clean up fastest will be able to sell unwanted permits to pollute to laggards .
Mr Obama wants to return US emissions of carbon dioxide to 1990 levels by 2020 , and cut them by a further 80 per cent by 2050 .
Last week in a video address to a global warming summit he promised to set " strong annual targets " to achieve this .
He added : " My presidency will mark a new chapter in America 's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process . "
Despite his commitment , some leading congressmen and even some environmentalists believe that a climate bill is unlikely to make it into law this year .
Senator Jeff Bingaman , chairman of the upper house 's Energy Committee , said last week that it might have to wait until 2010 , adding : " The reality is that it may take more than the first year to get it all done . "
This would imperil the international effort to agree a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol , which is scheduled to culminate in a massive conference in Copenhagen in a year 's time .
But hopes of early action rose dramatically last week when Democratic congressmen overturned their hallowed seniority system and replaced John Dingell , the 82 - year - old chairman of the House of Representatives ' crucial Energy and Commerce Committee , with a so - called " young Turk " in the shape of 69 - year - old Henry Waxman .
Rep Dingell has long been an old - school supporter of car - makers and other big industries and has obstructed tough anti-pollution legislation .
By contrast , Mr Waxman is an ardent environmentalist who represents Hollywood and Beverly Hills and promises to make passing climate change legislation a top priority .
Black Friday Wal - Mart Stampede : Worker Killed and Woman Suffers Possible Miscarriage
A stampede at a Long Island Wal - Mart resulted in the death of one man and the possible miscarriage of a pregnant woman as they were trampled by a throng of shoppers on Black Friday .
The 34 - year - old man , a temporary employee who was providing maintenance work at the store , was trying to restrain the crowd when he was knocked to the ground around 5:00 a.m. and died after being rushed to a local hospital just after 6:00 a.m .
The 28 - year - old pregnant woman was knocked to the ground a short distance from the store worker .
Her condition has not been released .
At least four other people were treated for minor injuries .
" The safety and security of our customers and associates is our top priority , " said Wal - Mart representative Dan Fogleman .
" Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at this difficult time .
At this point , facts are still being assembled and we are working closely with the Nassau County police as they investigate what occurred . "
A spokesman for the National Retail Federation said " We are not aware of any other circumstances where a retail employee has died working on the day after Thanksgiving . "
Last year shoppers were trampled at another Wal - Mart location on Black Friday .

* Massachusetts regulator issues subpoenas
* Court hearing on bail postponed until Wednesday
* Ascot , Merkin , auditor sued ( For more stories on Madoff , please see [ nN14457948 ] )
BOSTON / NEW YORK , Dec 16 ( Reuters ) - Bernard Madoff , the longtime Wall Street executive accused of cheating investors worldwide out of $ 50 billion , scrambled to find relatives or friends to guarantee his bond on Tuesday and keep him of jail .
In Massachusetts , where the disgraced investor long cultivated a loyal group of wealthy individuals , the state ’s chief securities regulator subpoenaed Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities and Cohmad Securities Corp , a firm that marketed Madoff investment products .
The two firms must hand over the names and addresses of all local residents who let Madoff invest their money by Dec. 29 .
They must also deliver notes , emails , meeting agendas related to investments made since 2000 , William Galvin , the state ’s Secretary of the Commonwealth , said on Tuesday .
In New York , Madoff , who was arrested last week , has not yet fully met the conditions of his $ 10 million bond , according to court papers .
He must find three co-signers to guarantee the bond .
If he fail to meet all the conditions , prosecutors could seek to have the 70 - year old Madoff jailed , pending trial .
A court hearing was set for Wednesday on bail matters after a Tuesday hearing was postponed .
Madoff , a former chairman of the Nasdaq Stock Market , faces up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $ 5 million if convicted .
As more banks , hedge funds and wealthy investors around the world realize they fell victim to a man long respected on Wall Street for the steady returns that his funds produced year after year , their outrage has grown .
LAW SCHOOL LAWSUIT
“ The names and sizes of those exposed to Bernard Madoff keep growing and most remarkable of all is the concentration of investments made by funds of hedge funds which promise their clients a diversified portfolio , ” said Philippe Bonnefoy , chairman of the asset allocation committee at Cedar Partners , an investment adviser .
A fund of hedge funds is a basket of funds selected by the manager to spread around risk .
New York Law School sued Ascot Partners LP , an investment firm , general partner J. Ezra Merkin and auditor BDO Seidman LLP on Tuesday over investments with Madoff .
( Please see [ ID:nN16279868 ] ) .
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
Co acknowledged its exposure to Madoff after a hedge fund unit invested heavily with him .
Tremont Holdings Inc ’s Rye Investment Management unit lost roughly $ 3 billion , nearly all of the money the unit managed , people familiar with the matter said .
Madoff is also closely tied to Carl Shapiro , a 95 - year - old Boston philanthropist who bestowed much of his fortune to the city ’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the city ’s Museum of Fine Arts .
Austria ’s Bank Medici , a closely held bank serving wealthy clients , also said it was affected by Madoff ’s scheme , but declined to give a total for its losses .
[ ID:nLG96997 ]
At the same time , prosecutors and regulators asked people who suspect that they lost money to Madoff to come forward .
The U.S. Attorney ’s Office in New York , which is prosecuting the Madoff case , set up a website for investors who may have been victimized .
It also posted an FBI hotline number , 212-384-2359 , for investors to call .
SIFTING THROUGH THE PAPERS
Investors were requested to gather any documents related to their Madoff investments and to check the website and others set up by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , the trustee of Madoff ’s brokerage business and the court - appointed receiver in the case .
Lawyers worried that many of the financial statements that Madoff ’s firm mailed to clients were not accurate , and that it will take months to sift through the papers .
“ This is a mess and it will take much longer than normal , ” said Douglas Hirsch , a partner at law firm Sadis & Goldberg , describing the work facing the trustee appointed to oversee the liquidation of Madoff ’s firm .
The Securities Investor Protection Corp , a nonprofit organization that provides limited insurance on investors ’ accounts , was named as trustee on Monday .
Madoff , who was well - known on the charity ball circuit and long supported cancer and diabetes research , also gave about $ 238,200 to political candidates , parties and committees , mostly Democratic , since 1991 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks political giving .
U.S. Senator Charles Schumer , a New York Democrat , received $ 12,000 , while U.S. Rep. Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat , received $ 10,000 over the years , the Center found .
The impact of Madoff ’s alleged fraud may be felt most severely among hedge funds .
For example , the Credit Suisse / Tremont Hedge Fund Index fell 4.15 percent in November , far more than the preliminary 0.7 percent decline reported last week .
Standard & Poor ’s said it will review public sector entities , such as universities , that invested with Madoff , to see whether their ratings should be cut as a result of their likely investment losses .

Indian military officials said that stationing three MiG 29s at the Hindon air base outside the capital after 12 years after the planes were removed would cut down its air force ’s response time in an emergency situation by at least 10 minutes .
Without the deployment , jets would need to be scrambled from bases at Ambala and Bareilly .
Signing statements were wrong enough …
Now Bush is saying “ if Congress wo n’t do it , I ’ll do it myself “ :
Under mounting pressure to act , the Bush administration said Friday it was ready to step in and prevent the U.S. auto industry from collapsing after the Senate refused to pass a rescue bill endorsed by the White House and congressional Democrats .
The most obvious source of help was the Wall Street bailout fund .
“ The current weakened state of the economy is such that it could not withstand a body blow like a disorderly bankruptcy in the auto industry , ” White House press secretary Dana Perino said .
Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin said , “ Because Congress failed to act , we will stand ready to prevent an imminent failure until Congress reconvenes and acts to address the long - term viability of the industry . ” …
The Bush administration has repeatedly said the Wall Street bailout fund should not be used for emergency aid to the automakers because it was designed to restore stability to the financial sector .
But with the Senate ’s action , Detroit ’s supporters looked to the White House for help .
I think I ’ve seen this before .
My son is n’t quite old enough to use this tactic , but I think most children figure it out pretty quickly .
If Mommy says no , go ask Daddy .
This is how an imperial presidency behaves .
Bush believes that he should be able to get what he wants , and that Congress exists to enact his goals into law .
When they do n’t see it the same way , rather than accepting that a legislature ( which should rightfully hold the purse strings ) has decided not to play along , he simply decides to do it anyway .
If this is the way things work , is n’t Congress just there for show ?
“ Aha ! ” , you say , “ Bush wo n’t be around more than another month , so things will get better when we do n’t have someone who wants to expand Presidential authority ! ”
Think again :
President - elect Barack Obama said he was disappointed that the Senate failed to act .
“ My hope is that the administration and the Congress will still find a way to give the industry the temporary assistance it needs while demanding the long - term - restructuring that is absolutely required , ” he said in a statement .
Well , President - elect , Congress pretty clearly said they ’re not going to do it .
Does that grant the President authority to do it anyway ?
Would your answer be any different if you were n’t the President - elect ?
I think what Obama ’s saying , since it ’s such a short remaining tenure for his predecessor , is this : “ I ’m not a believer in the strong executive powers that Bush has taken .
However , I can no longer argue against them , because I see a lot of wonderful ways to use them myself . ”
Congress may be useless , but I do n’t in any way support the President simply doing an end - run around their responsibilities when he does n’t like what they have to say .

Blue eyes have their hue because of a single genetic mutation that occurred fewer than 10,000 years ago in one individual and swept rapidly through the European population , according to a study published in the journal Human Genetics in January .
After studying some 800 individuals from Denmark , Turkey , and Jordan , the researchers pinpointed a single base - pair change in the human genome that showed up in all the blue - eyed people and none of the brown - eyed people .
“ There was one founder mutation that gave rise to all the people in Europe who have blue eyes , ” says report coauthor Jesper Troelsen , a University of Copenhagen molecular biologist .
“ It was quite surprising . ”
Those with blue eyes also shared a number of other genetic markers in the same region — a stretch of DNA that regulates production of the pigment melanin .
The tweak causes the iris to manufacture less melanin , lending the eyes their lighter shade .
As DNA passes down through generations , it gets shuffled and reshuffled .
Because this particular stretch of DNA was so similar — barely shuffled — among all the blue - eyed people studied , the researchers inferred that the blue - eyes mutation is fairly young .
Its apparently rapid spread through the population also suggests that , evolutionarily speaking , the mutation had something to offer .
“ It ’s difficult to know what happened 10,000 years ago , ” Troelsen says , but blue eyes may be linked with other traits — such as light skin color — that came in handy for early northern Europeans .

For those of you who do n’t happen to be named Barack , change in the next four years might seem a spectator sport .
In the aftermath of a campaign , it ’s natural to think that the agenda now is in the hands of our newly elected leaders , and that the agents of change will be government officials in Washington .
Yet the best proof that you do n’t need a White House pass to accomplish change comes from youthful social entrepreneurs around the country .

“ My feeling is that I stand by every word of the analysis  what is between the covers of the book , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ For the year I have had to apologize for the stupid , silly subtitle that was slapped on to the book . ”
Image Shelby Steeles subtitle was proven wrong last week .
He made it clear that he was the one who slapped the subtitle onto the book  “ in about 30 seconds ” when Barack Obama was trailing Hillary Rodham Clinton by about 25 percentage points .
But , he added , “ subtitles are marketing devices  I hate them .
I ’ve always hated them . ”
He said that for “ White Guilt , ” his book before “ A Bound Man , ” he tried not to have a subtitle , to no avail .
In that case , Mr. Steele went with another provocative subtitle : “ How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era . ”
The editor in chief of the Free Press , Dominick Anfuso , disputed the idea that there was overriding pressure to come up with the most extreme subtitle to sell books .
“ It is the handful of largely successful books that do that , and that gives the impression that is what we seek , ” he said .
What publishers want , he said , are “ good titles and good subtitles .
Subtitles can make best sellers , but they do n’t have to be provocative to do that .
It is a package .
They go together . ”
The argument in “ Bound Man ” is about the challenge a black politician faces in finding a way between being a “ challenger ” to white voters and a “ bargainer ” who assures whites that racism is becoming less important in society .
In an opinion piece in The Los Angeles Times after the election , Mr. Steele , who supported John McCain , wrote that Mr. Obama was offering typical liberal policies “ freshened up  given an air of ‘ change ’  by the dreamy post- racial and post - ideological kitsch he dressed it in . ”
Obama to name Bill Richardson as Commerce Secretary Agence France - Presse
Published : Tuesday December 2 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON  President - elect Barack Obama will Wednesday nominate New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson as commerce secretary , in the latest addition to his rapidly filling cabinet , a Democratic official said .
Obama is set to roll out Richardson , a former diplomatic troubleshooter and ex-envoy to the United Nations at a news conference in Chicago , two days after announcing a heavy - hitting national security team .
Richardson , 61 , one of the highest profile Hispanic politicians in the United States , had been seen as a possible choice for secretary of state , had Obama not decided to hand the job to his former political foe Hillary Clinton .
The New Mexico governor mounted an unsuccessful challenge for the Democratic nomination , and switched allegiances to back Obama over Clinton , despite his loyalty to former president Bill Clinton , whom he served as energy secretary .
Richardson's new post is the latest in a long string of official and ad hoc assignments , which included a spell in the House of Representatives .
Once dubbed the " Indiana Jones " of US diplomacy , Richardson is famed for daring head - to - head encounters with strongmen leaders on the US pariah list , including Iraq 's executed president Saddam Hussein and Cuba 's Fidel Castro .
One of the more colorful if rumpled members of the Clinton years , Richardson stormed through public life in a trademark blue blazer and was remembered as a resourceful lawmaker and consummate deal maker .
Critics however have complained he hogged the media spotlight , and took his eye off administrative responsibilities .
Over the years Richardson emerged as a favored go - between for North Korea 's Stalinist regime in successive nuclear showdowns with Washington .
He was no stranger to the idiosyncrasies of North Korean negotiators : in 1994 , he was on a congressional fact - finding trip to the isolated communist state when a US Army helicopter was shot down after straying across the iron curtain with South Korea .
Richardson negotiated the release of the surviving pilot and the return of the body of his dead co-pilot .
A year later , he faced down another mortal US enemy , Saddam Hussein , persuading him to hand over two US businessmen jailed after they accidentally crossed into the country .
In 1996 , Richardson was back in North Korea , liberating an American missionary who swam across a river from China and was accused of being a spy .
In his packed career as an unofficial envoy , Richardson also found time to negotiate with Cuba 's Castro , lobby Myanmar 's military rulers on behalf of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and persuade former Haitian military ruler Raoul Cedras to cede power .
He once reportedly closed a deal with Sudanese rebels holding three Red Cross workers by offering four - wheel - drive jeeps , medicine , rice and a tractor , in place of a 2.5 - million - dollar ransom demand .

about the book !
I always sort of liked Timothy Leary , but I never took many drugs and never really read any of his work .
I 've sat through a few videos in which he came off as a good - natured eccentric — spaced out , but with a sharp sense of humor .
This book is a surprise .
Published by Re / Search , purveyors of books about pranks , punk rock , and body modification , it may not make you want to become an " enlightened " acidhead , but it should leave you with at least one insight : Timothy Leary was a damn fine writer .
Who knew ?
I interviewed Leary On Drugs editor , Hassan I Sirius , by email to get the scoop on this new collection of Leary 's writing .
I was mostly surprised by the quality of Leary 's writing and his seriousness of purpose .
How did you go about selecting materials for the book ?
My approach was pretty much exactly what you 've just implied .
Most of the content was selected for the quality of the writing and for the calm lucidity of Leary 's thoughts about drugs .
With all the recent positive reports about psychedelic research ( Time magazine even had a story titled " Was Timothy Leary Right ? " ) — and with the growing awareness of the destructive nature of drug prohibition , it seemed wise to try to make this a fairly serious contribution to our collective knowledge and thinking regarding drugs , particularly of the psychedelic variety .
Leary wrote a lot of material , some of it frivolous , some of it caught up in the battles and in the hype of a particular time period .
And some of that material may not stand up to scrutiny .
I think I mostly selected materials that stand on their own .
You do n't have to understand the sixties or the seventies all that well to get something out of these pieces .
They really are pretty much focused on drugs – descriptions of experiences and visions , theories , observations and so forth .
The theoretical material is a bit dense .
He had a scientific orientation .
Yeah .
Even when he was living in a teepee at the height of the hippie movement , he never cancelled his subscription to Scientific American .
And even though he started using all those eastern Hindu metaphors that became so popular then , he was also seeing it all in terms of genetics and DNA , very early on .
It was not that long after the discovery of DNA – less than a decade — and this really impacted on his vision of psychedelic experiences from the start in 1960 .
You can pretty much find him intuiting evolutionary psychology even in his earlier writings .
He went on evolutionary trips , experiencing the emergence of life and its evolution toward humanity .
He assumed everybody would have that trip , which is one place where he went a bit astray .
I was able to understand most of it .
Most of his arguments for psychedelics do n't seem particularly wild .
But what I really enjoyed was the stories .
Some of those are pretty wild and pretty intense .
The political section is almost scary .
Can you say a bit about that ?
Yeah , well some of the trip stories are pretty intense too .
But you 're probably referring to the story involving Mary Pinchot , who was one of President Kennedy 's lovers .
And it seems pretty clear that she involved Leary in a successful conspiracy to turn JFK on to LSD .
The material , in this case , is from his autobiography , Flashbacks .
But in Flashbacks , this particular narrative was sprinkled throughout the book as you go through his life chronologically .
When you actually isolate the sections about Pinchot and then stitch them together as an entry , it makes a stronger impression .
The other thing you may be referring to is the conversation at the end of the book that Leary had with a hardball Swiss political operative with various intelligence connections while he was in exile from the U.S. government in Switzerland .
The entry is almost painful in its sophistication and leaves the book on a solemn note — we are still all prisoners of men who lust for power , from Leary 's point of view .
What were Leary 's favorite drugs ?
I guess they all had their place .
He was a social drinker and he was a social guy… so that amounted to a fair amount of drinking .
It 's sort of funny – he's always celebrating great moments in the psychedelic revolution with a glass of champagne or something along those lines .
Mind you , I do n't see anything wrong with it .
And he always thought LSD was an extraordinarily marvelous invention .
In a 1988 article included in the book , he writes about " good old LSD " and marvels that it 's still the best .
There 's a segment on heroin .
He was n't crazy about heroin , even though he found it pleasant when he tried it … and he makes it clear that he was n't happy about the dominance of coke and crack in the drug culture during the 1980s .
Do you think he would be happy with all of the psychedelic research going on now ?
He was alive to see it begin again and he commented on it favorably .
Yeah , he would be thrilled with the positive reports .
People forget he started out examining these drugs in a therapeutic context .
On the other hand , he denounced control of drugs by the medical profession , particularly later in his life .
He took a libertarian view that adults have a human right to do what they want with their brains .
But at other points , it 's clear that he prefers the medical model to leaving it in the hands of the drug warriors .
So what does Leary have to say to us now ?
Well , read the book .
It 's not so much reflective of the politics of the moment – although plenty of lessons about that can be found in there — but most of the material is really reflective of a search for meaning , and self - understanding , and peak experiences that people can find valuable no matter what is going on in the world .
In this book , what you get , mostly , is a very thoughtful and sensitive Leary pondering the meaning of it all .
China has condemned the killing of five of its citizens in Sudan , calling it as a terrorist act , but said it would continue to invest in the country .
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu urged the Sudanese government to do all it could to protect Chinese residents and property .
The five were among nine Chinese oil workers seized in Kordofan , near the region of Darfur , more than a week ago .
Two others are thought to have escaped , and two are still being held captive .
China is a key purchaser of Sudanese oil and has been investing heavily in the country .
The BBC 's correspondent in Beijing , Quentin Somerville , says the oil and arms deals have attracted widespread criticism for contributing to oppression in Sudan .
Darfur rebels blamed
The five Chinese oil workers were killed during a rescue attempt by the Sudanese authorities .
Sudan has blamed the kidnappings on the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) , a Darfur rebel organisation .
JEM says it has forces in the area but was not involved in seizing the Chinese .
The kidnappers later released a local driver seized at the same time as the Chinese , with a note saying they wanted a share in the region 's oil wealth .
It is the third time in the last year that oil workers have been abducted in the energy - rich region .
( CNN ) -- Breakaway conservative members of the Episcopal Church in the United States and its Canadian counterpart are expected to formally announce Wednesday the formation of a rival North American Anglican church .
The consecration of Rev. Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire left many conservatives disaffected .
Leaders of the Common Cause Partnership , a network of more than 100,000 Anglican Christians in North America , are expected to unveil a draft constitution for a new ecclesiastical territorial division , or province , at an evening service in Wheaton Evangelical Free Church in Wheaton , Illinois , the group said in a written statement .
" The public release of our draft constitution is an important concrete step toward the goal of a biblical , missionary and united Anglican Church in North America , " Bishop Robert Duncan of the Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , diocese , said in the written statement .
The move comes after years of debate over issues from the interpretation of the Bible to homosexuality .
Tensions reached a boiling point in 2003 , when the Episcopal Church consecrated an openly gay man , Rev. Gene Robinson , as bishop of New Hampshire .
The move outraged worshippers with traditionalist tendencies , and since then , four dioceses and several parishes have left the Episcopalian Church , including Duncan 's Pittsburgh diocese .
In all , the newly formed division will consist of about 100,000 members from the secessionist dioceses and parishes , along with splinter groups that had left the Episcopalian Church in earlier years , said Robert Lundy , a spokesman for the group
" This constitution brings them back together under one church , all aligned together , " Lundy said .
" This is all these folks coming back together . "
Lunday said it was safe to say Duncan will lead the nascent province .
An assembly is likely to be called next year to determine additional leadership , he said .
The Rev. Dr. Charles K. Robertson , canon to the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church , Katharine Jefferts Schori , issued a statement saying it would not hazard a guess as to the consequences of Wednesday 's service .
" We will not predict what will or will not come out of this meeting , but simply continue to be clear that the Episcopal Church , along with the Anglican Church of Canada and the La Iglesia Anglicana de Mexico , comprise the official , recognized presence of the Anglican Communion in North America , " he said .
" We reiterate what has been true of Anglicanism for centuries : that there is room within the Episcopal Church for people with different views , and we regret that some have felt the need to depart from the diversity of our common life in Christ . "
The Episcopal Church is part of the Anglican Communion , which is composed of 38 provinces around the world .
It was not immediately clear which of the other provinces would recognize the Anglican Church in North America , but Lundy said in a meeting last year in Jerusalem indicated that some would do so .
Lundy said the draft constitution will state the province 's core beliefs and doctrine .
He said it will not lay out definite policies for issues the leaders disagree on , such as ordaining women .

Radio silence from Dems on al Qaeda supporter 's McCain endorsement Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 23 , 2008
Print This Email This Imagine for a second that a militant Web site believed to reflect al Qaeda 's thinking published an essay making the case that a Barack Obama presidency would best advance the terror group 's goals .
What would the reaction be from John McCain , Sarah Palin and the Republican National Committee ?
One imagines plenty of neoconservative McCain advisers pushing for the news to become an instant talking point .
The GOP running mate already has accused the Democratic nominee of " palling around " with America 's enemies .
" We were right , " they would crow , perhaps throwing a " Right on ! " to whichever mouth - breather in the crowd first called Obama a " terrorist " or invoked his middle name .
One imagines Steve Schmidt already has a ready - to - deploy Web ad featuring Obama 's face morphing into Osama bin Laden's .
The situation that emerged was precisely reversed , though .
An al Qaeda - linked Web site said the Islamic extremists should " support McCain " because he would advance the group 's goal of bankrupting America through perpetual war .
The message from the al - Hesbah Web site , which some believe reflects al Qaeda thinking , was reported by the Washington Post and Associated Press .
The reaction from Obama and the Democratic National Committee to this stunning piece of news ?
Silence .
Not one of the five dozen e-mails the Obama campaign and DNC sent reporters since Wednesday morning , when the story broke , mentioned the near - endorsement .
Neither Obama nor his running mate Joe Biden mentioned it on the campaign trail , and campaign surrogates would n't discuss it on cable news shows .
" I think what the Obama campaign is doing is smart , " Steve Clemons , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation , said in an interview Thursday .
" Anyone who would put any kind of validity or conscientious purpose behind an al Qaeda web endorsement , would really be , I think , crossing a line . "
Clemons speculated there would be " a lot of neoconservative advisers " in McCain 's orbit who would push him to use an al Qaeda endorsement to attack Obama if the situation were reversed , but he speculated that McCain himself would veto that line of attack .
He said other groups McCain has tried to link to Obama , like Hezbollah or Hamas , are " fundamentally different " from al Qaeda , which is " more insidious " and not recognized anywhere as a legitimate political organization .
Even political activists on the very far left " want to see al Qaeda wiped out , " said Clemons , who discussed which candidate al Qaeda would prefer in a BloggingHeads discussion with Juan Cole in March .
The consensus was that extremists probably would prefer a President McCain largely because of his desire to continue the occupation of Iraq .
An Obama spokesman , contacted by RAW STORY , said the campaign would n't discuss the story at all , not even to delve into its reasoning behind ignoring it .
The decision to stay above the fray and let what many see as non-story slip by unnoticed allows the Obama campaign to maintain its focus on economic issues , where polls show voters favor the Democratic candidate .
It also sets Obama apart from McCain 's decision earlier this year to criticize Obama over kind words a Hamas spokesman had for the Illinois senator .
Obama slammed McCain for making the association , accusing him of " losing his bearings " .
Rather than similarly letting the story slip from the headlines , McCain 's campaign convened a hasty conference call Wednesday morning .
Foreign policy advisers Randy Scheunemann and Jim Woolsey made the confounding accusation that the endorsement of McCain was actually meant to bolster Obama 's candidacy .
Scheunemann said , going on to list barely - approving quotes of Barack Obama given by Hamas , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad and Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi , which he manfully said he was n't going " to characterize . "
Woolsey , for his part , peered into the mind of what he called " one individual Islamist blogger from one terrorist Islamist blog " and determined that he was " clearly trying to damage John McCain " and " not speaking from his heart . "
A source familiar with the DNC and Obama campaign 's decision to ignore the issue said the story was n't relevant to anything happening in the campaign right now .
" The fact that the McCain campaign wanted to hold what was a batshit crazy conference call to blow up the story for everyone to write about shows how badly their campaign is run , " the source told RAW STORY .
McCain 's advisers continued to argue their candidate 's strength against al Qaeda based on his endorsement of the surge in Iraq , which contributed to driving some elements of al Qaeda out of that country .
Myriad foreign policy experts -- and the Obama campaign -- have argued that the Iraq war has allowed al Qaeda to regenerate in Afghanistan and Pakistan ; Obama has said rooting out al Qaeda there would be his primary goal .
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden has not released a tape expressing his own views since this spring .
CIA analysts concluded that the tape he released before the 2004 election was designed to bolster President Bush 's re-election efforts .
Even McCain acknowledged the video's impact .
" I think its very helpful to President Bush , " McCain said at the time , while stumping in Stamford for U.S. Rep. Christopher Shays .
" It focuses Americas attention on the war on terrorism .
Im not sure if it was intentional or not , but I think it does have an effect . "

The latest AP - GfK poll was released this afternoon and it shows that the election of Barack Obama has led to a new wave of optimism among Americans .
The poll found that most Americans are hopeful about the Obama administration , and 72 % believe that he will make the changes needed to improve the economy .
Since Obama ’s election the number of Americans who think that the country is moving in the right direction has more than doubled .
In October , only 17 % of those surveyed thought that things were going in the right direction .
This has more than doubled to 36 % .
Almost three quarters of those polled said that the election of Obama made them feel hopeful , and another 60 % said that they were proud that Obama had been elected .
This hope and optimism is strictly limited to Obama though .
President George W. Bush has a 28 % approval rating , while Congress is seven points lower at 21 % .
Seventy seven percent of respondents described themselves as very or somewhat worried that the federal debt being passed on to their children and grandchildren will harm their future .
It also seems that Americans want to see some bipartisanship , as 73 % said that Obama should appoint some qualified Republicans to some posts in his administration .
Forty two percent felt that having Democrats in control was good for the country , while 34 % said it was bad , and 20 % said that it did n’t matter .

According to the poll , the top four priorities for Obama should be improving the economy ( 84 % ) , create jobs ( 80 % ) , stabilize the nation ’s financial institutions ( 61 % ) , and reduce the federal debt ( 61 % ) .
Those surveyed believed that Obama would be able to implement his policy agenda .
Sixty eight percent were very or somewhat confident that Obama will be able to implement the agenda that he campaigned on .
It looks like Obama is in line for a honeymoon period .
The most immediate impact of Obama ’s election is that it has allowed the nation to start looking forward , and begin the process of putting the past eight years behind us .
The nation was ready for a fresh start , and what could be a more fresh beginning than a historic president ?
Obama seems to understand the enormity of the task and expectations that he is facing .
I do n’t think he needs to fix the economy all at once .
I believe that if he merely improves the situation , he will be widely regarded as a success .
People understand the mess that George W. Bush is leaving behind , and that it will take some time to get things back on track , but judging from Obama ’s early actions , he appears to not sit back and enjoy the honeymoon period .
It looks like he will be getting to work on day one of his administration .
If he governs with the same discipline and focus that he campaigned with , he will be an outstanding president .
Americans are willing to give him a chance , but he still will have to deliver .

Dustin Britt was working at his desk last Halloween when a huge explosion outside his window shook the building .
The lights went out , and one of his co-workers screamed , " Oh , my God , I think we 're going to die ! "
But no one in the office was injured .
The explosion had been caused by a car crashing into a telephone pole .
Matchstic , the Atlanta design firm where Britt is a project manager , did lose power for more than a day .
But it was prepared .
Matchstic 's computers either were laptops or had backup power supplies , which allowed them to be powered down without the loss of any work .
And the company 's servers are backed up once a day .
Employees worked from home until power was restored , and a presentation had to be held in a nearby coffee shop , but otherwise the company was unaffected .
Other companies have n't been so lucky .
No one comes to work expecting an IT crisis , but heart - stopping technical meltdowns happen every day -- important files get wiped out , or thieves get hold of sensitive data .
And data disasters of all sorts hit especially hard at small and midsize companies , where file backups , data security , and sometimes even basic protections like antivirus software frequently get overlooked in the scramble to make payroll and meet project deadlines .
We 've put together a guide to help you handle and possibly prevent four of the most common IT catastrophes .
1. Laptop theft
Half of all organizations had a laptop or other mobile device stolen last year , according to a recent survey by the Computer Security Institute .
And if the next stolen notebook belongs to your company , the replacement cost is the least of your worries .
Most states have laws requiring businesses to tell customers when a laptop containing unencrypted sensitive data , such as Social Security numbers and credit card numbers , goes missing .
Technology research firm Gartner estimates that each customer record lost costs a company from $ 150 to $ 250 in legal fees , notification costs , and other expenses .
Plus , laptops often contain company intellectual property and other files that you would n't like bad guys leafing through .
How to respond :
Your response depends on what you have done up front .
For about $ 40 and up per laptop per year , services such as MyLaptopGPS and Absolute Software 's Computrace LoJack for Laptops may be able to get the computer back .
If you have installed one of these programs , the stolen machine will report its location to the authorities as soon as the thief connects to the Internet .
Some services let you remotely wipe all data from the hard drive or will even covertly download files from the stolen laptop for you .
If you do n't have a tracing program , the best you can do is report the serial number to the police and the manufacturer and hope it winds up at a repair shop .
Preventive measures :
In addition to installing tracing software , make sure to encrypt the hard drive .
" If the data 's encrypted , thieves can't use it , and you 'll save yourself notice costs and bad public relations , " says Randy Gainer , who deals with many privacy and security cases as a partner in Davis Wright Tremaine , a Seattle law firm .
The enterprise edition of the Windows Vista operating system has an encryption feature , BitLocker , built in .
Other encryption programs , such as PGP Whole Disk Encryption or Veridis ' FileCrypt , can run about $ 50 to $ 120 per computer .
Other tips : Record your laptops ' serial numbers in a handy place .
And advise employees to treat a laptop like a wallet .
You would n't leave your wallet in the car , and you should n't leave your laptop there , either .
2 . Hard drive failures
Shortness of breath , nausea , and intense feelings of dread .
If you 're experiencing these symptoms , you may be having a heart attack -- or you may be reacting to the death of your computer 's hard drive .
Sean Marx recently suffered through the latter .
He 's CEO and co-founder of Give Something Back , an Oakland , California , supplier of environmentally friendly office supplies .
When he suddenly could n't get his computer to turn on , he knew he was in trouble .
Marx 's computer holds very large spreadsheets that track the company 's sales and accounting , and he is often the only person with up - to - date versions of those files .
He had n't backed up in six months , even though he knew better .
" I very quickly had that sinking feeling , " says Marx .
How to respond :
If your IT team can't bring your computer back to life , the only option is to send the drive to a data recovery service , which can charge anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars to rescue your files .
The services are n't always successful .
In Marx 's case , he spent $ 1,500 at a local data recovery shop , but almost all the files were corrupted .
He was able to recover many files attached to e-mails that were archived on the company 's server .
Preventive measures : Back up your hard drive often , and use online services such as Mozy , iBackup , or EVault , which charge monthly fees of about $ 10 and up per employee .
That way , even if a fire or flood ravages your server room , the data will be fine .
You could also swap your current hard drive for a system that uses two drives to store two sets of your data , otherwise known as a RAID .
So if one of the hard drives were to fail , you would still have the other .
3. Virus outbreaks
" Your files are encrypted with RSA - 1024 algorithm .
To recovery your files you need to buy our decryptor . "
This is the error message , misspelling and all , created by a recent version of Gpcode.ak , a so - called blackmail Trojan horse .
Gpcode.ak sneaks onto your computer , encrypts your files so you can't open them , and then demands a ransom for them .
About eight years ago , in the heyday of virus outbreaks , malware writers seemed to compete for the most attention .
Now , many virus writers have moved on to lower - profile -- and more profitable -- activities , like phishing , which tricks people into giving up their passwords , account numbers , and other personal data .
Viruses remain one of the most common data problems , according to the Computer Security Institute .
How to respond : Many viruses can be contained or removed with antivirus software .
The Gpcode.ak virus is an exception .
However , Kaspersky Lab , which sells antivirus programs , recently released a free program , StopGpcode , that may help you unlock your files without capitulating to the blackmailers .
Preventive measures : Install antivirus software on all company computers and keep the virus definitions up to date .
And make sure to back up your data frequently , just in case you need to revert to the last system - restore point before the virus hit .
You can also use services like Postini , which , for about $ 12 per user per year , will remove viruses from e-mails before they reach your inbox .
Companies of a certain size can try something called application whitelisting .
Programs like Bit9's Parity , which is available for about $ 30 per computer for a minimum of 100 machines , allow only software approved by the IT department to run on employee computers .
4. System hacks
It 's tough to keep up with hackers , because they are constantly finding new ways to infiltrate databases .
In January , Davidson Companies , a financial services firm based in Great Falls , Montana , announced that a hacker may have been able to access personal data on its current and former customers .
A handful of the estimated 226,000 affected customers have since filed a lawsuit .
Davidson Companies would not comment .
Hackers often target financial companies .
They also have an eye for e-commerce sites .
In January , the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Life Is Good , a Boston - based apparel maker .
The agency criticized the company 's e-commerce security after a 2006 incident , in which a hacker used an " SQL injection attack " -- an attempt to gain control of the database by typing code into areas like search boxes -- to grab customers ' credit card numbers and expiration dates .
The terms of the settlement require Life Is Good to beef up security and hire an independent security auditor to evaluate its systems for the next 20 years .
The company declined to comment on the settlement , but an FTC representative says the agency learns about the cases it investigates through a variety of sources , including suppliers and customers .
Often companies do n't even realize they have been hacked until well after the fact .
According to a recent security report by Verizon Business , 70 percent of firms did n't know they had been hacked until someone else -- a customer or a bank -- reported suspicious activity .
How to respond :
If you think there has been a breach , take action right away .
Davidson Companies immediately took its website offline , hired a security firm to investigate , and contacted the authorities , the credit bureaus , and its customers .
You 'll need to do the same , and also contact your attorney , if hackers may have gained access to credit card numbers or other sensitive information .
It has become the norm to offer customers a year of credit monitoring services , which can cost about $ 10 a month per customer .
Brace for customer defections , lawsuits , and possible fines from the FTC .
Preventive measures :
There is no foolproof way to stop all hacks .
So make sure your website encrypts your customers ' credit card numbers and passwords ( as opposed to storing them in a readable text format , which is what Life Is Good did before the attack ) .
That way , even if hackers get in , they wo n't be able to see the information .
And make sure that you apply the latest security patches to your software to protect against known vulnerabilities .
One in five hacks exploits a security hole that 's been public knowledge for six months or longer .
McAfee ( NYSE : MFE ) offers a service called McAfee Secure , which scans your website daily for known security vulnerabilities .
The service starts at about $ 1,700 to $ 2,800 a year for sites with fewer than 30,000 daily page views .
Sophisticated techies may also be able to create what 's known as a honeypot , phony files and decoy servers that are used to trap hackers .
It 's sort of like leaving a fake pile of gold out in the open -- if anyone tries to take it , you will know the system is under attack .

Scientists say asteroids can be deflected to stop them hitting the Earth
The international community must work together to tackle the threat of asteroids colliding with Earth , a leading UN scientist says .
Professor Richard Crowther 's comments come as a group of space experts called for a co-ordinated science - led response to the asteroid threat .
The Association of Space Explorers ( ASE ) says missions to intercept asteroids will need global approval .
The UN will meet in February to discuss the issue .
In the ASE report , the group of scientists and former astronauts point to the historical record to highlight the dangers of asteroids ; an impact 65 million years ago may have wiped out the dinosaurs , and the Tunguska impact in 1908 produced a 2,000 sq km fire in Siberia , big enough to engulf a city the size of New York .
They say the next major threatening event could occur in less than 20 years .
Asteroid Apophis is due to pass close to the Earth and analyses suggest a one in 45,000 chance of a collision .
It 's a single event , potentially causing a large number of casualties
Professor Richard Crowther , chair of the UN Working Group on NEOs
An impact by Apophis would generate the equivalent of a 500 megatonne blast , at least 100 times more powerful than the Siberian event .
Professor Crowther of Britain's Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , is the chair of the UN Working Group on Near Earth Objects .
He says the threat needs to be taken seriously .
" The issue is it 's a single event , potentially causing a large number of casualties , " be told BBC News .
The UN broadly agrees that action is necessary , though what form this should take is still under discussion .
Collision course Professor Crowther welcomed the ASE report and said it would be discussed by the UN action team tasked with coming up with a plan , when they meet next February .
" A lot of what 's in the report is consistent with what we 're suggesting anyway , there needs to be effective scientific co-ordination , enough observatory time , and people looking in the right place at the right time . "
Past space impacts have left huge craters
The document says most asteroids entering the Earth 's atmosphere are small and burn up before reaching the surface .
But it is the larger ones - perhaps 200 m or more across - that would need to be deflected away from a collision course with the Earth .
The researchers propose several ways of doing this , the most extreme methods being to crash a spacecraft into the asteroid to knock it off course , or to set off a nuclear explosion .
They say the earlier the threat is dealt with , the less drastic the course of action need be .
Professor Crowther says the natural forces of gravity can be used to deflect asteroids in many situations .
" We can use the natural attraction of a probe to one of the bodies , to slowly pull the object away . "
He says if done at sufficient distance from the Earth , the orbit of an asteroid can be changed slightly to take it away from a collision path .
ASE propose combining scientific monitoring and research with a global political strategy .
Professor Crowther says the scientific consensus is already broadly in place , but political consensus may take longer .
" We have to decide on a political framework , who 's going to act and under what authority .
That 's clearly a role for the UN within the next two to three years .
The key is to get it done before it 's needed , when people are much more reasonable , rational and objective . "

San Francisco - Five years after the Recording Industry of America ( RIAA ) began its massive litigation campaign against music fans suspected of sharing copyrighted music files over the Internet , the campaign has failed to get artists paid or reduce peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file sharing .
Meanwhile , the legal foundation of the campaign is being questioned by several federal courts .
Since September of 2003 , the recording industry has leveled legal threats against close to 30,000 American music fans .
In a report released today , " RIAA v. The People : Five Years Later , " the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) presents a comprehensive overview of the RIAA 's litigation campaign and concludes that it is hurting music fans and artists alike , without making a dent in unauthorized file - sharing .
The report notes increasing skepticism by courts , academics and state watchdog groups about the RIAA 's investigation tactics and legal theories .
For example , judges have repeatedly rejected the RIAA 's " making available " theory , the notion that merely having a music file in a " shared " folder on a computer constitutes copyright infringement , even if no one ever copies the file .
Just last week , a federal judge ordered a new trial for Jammie Thomas , found liable for more than $ 220,000 because the jury had been instructed erroneously that liability could be premised on this " making available " theory .
" If the RIAA wants to keep suing hundreds of people each month and collecting these huge settlements , it can't take shortcuts , " said EFF Staff Attorney Corynne McSherry .
" It 's not enough to say the law ' could have been ' broken and demand thousands of dollars to make the accusation go away .
The recording industry must prove its case and show that infringement actually occurred . "
EFF 's report collects evidence that suggests that the lawsuit campaign has not reduced file sharing .
Downloading from P2P networks continues unabated , while some people simply choose to share files in ways that are harder to monitor , like burning and exchanging CDs among friends .
EFF continues to call on the RIAA to help artists get paid for their creative work by embracing a voluntary collective licensing program , which would collect a reasonable , regular payment from music fans in exchange for the right to share music freely .
" More than 30,000 Americans have been targeted for legal action by the recording industry without putting a single penny into the pockets of any artists , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Fred von Lohmann .
" At the same time , everyone agrees that P2P file - sharing is more popular than ever .
The RIAA 's litigation campaign arbitrarily punishes tens of thousands of people for what tens of millions are doing .
It 's futile and unfair .
It is high time that the recording industry let fans pay them a reasonable fee for the P2P file sharing that we all know has become a fact of Internet life . "

7 Coolest Recycled Shipping Container Homes , Offices & Buildings
When it comes to functionality and sturdiness , nothing comes close to shipping containers .
But who ’d have thought they could make smart and cool space to live and work in ?
These great big metal boxes do n’t just ship every imaginable product between ports around the world , ( and often get washed off in the process ) they also provide a cheap , ready made architectural base for a huge variety of uses .
They wo n’t fit in every city , but in some settings they look awesome .
Here are seven of the best !
12 Container House
Far from being purely functional , some of these houses look great , are cheap and would be a cool place to live .
Huge warehouse size living space would n’t work in a cold climate , but the small narrow boxes would make fantastic and adaptable office , bedroom space .
If you need a bit more space , you can just ship another few boxes in .
Seatrain Container Homes
An industrial inspired house is one thing but here the storage containers make up the rooms of the house ; you hardly notice the metal boxes amongst the modernist design , clean lines , and huge glass windows .
Espace Mobile
These houses based in the Austrian countryside only cost around $ 87,500 and for that price you get a simple , elegant and retro design .
It may look a little out of place , but it ’s cheap and cheerful .
It ’s all made up for you , and shipping it would be simple .
It ’s a house that comes with a warranty , but floor to ceiling windows should keep you distracted for long enough to live in a shipping container in the long run with no complaints .
Freitag Shop
This shipping container shop is another project situated in Europe .
The messenger bag shop can be found in Zurich ’s industrial quarter , rather appropriately .
And this is n’t just a market stall hidden inside a metal box , as you can see these containers are stacked up , hitting 85 feet high .
The company continue the ethos of the goods they are selling , using recyclable material to create a retail space that you ’d have to have a look around in .
Stacking them so high may be overkill , but we love it .
Tempohousing Amsterdam
These boxes were intended to only be a temporary solution to a student accommodation problem in Holland , but shipping containers provide an effective solution to low - cost student housing .
We can only imagine that these containers can be simply shipped , and I would n’t blame students for trying to buy a couple after they graduate and make a cheap housing from the sturdy materials .
Pallotta Teamworks
Perhaps the smartest and most practical of all of our designs , shipping containers make perfect stackable office space for this warehouse in a design by Clive Wilkinson for a U.S. charity event company .
The idea is cheap , simple , maneuverable and by stacking the containers vertically , they use what space is available in the most efficient way .
The Nomadic Museum
Yes , shipping containers can be art too .
Or at least they can provide the walls for a huge warehouse providing outdoor art space .
The 45,000 square foot space is both mobile and made out of almost entirely recycled materials .
Purpose built for one event , Shigeru Ban , the Mozart of the sustainable building world , created something that was intended to be a cold , exposed building , but he also tried and succeeded to create a welcoming and open space .

McCain is now claiming that while he stayed at home yesterday , and then went out for a night on the town wining and dining Joe Lieberman at one of DC ’s richest restaurants , he was actually the guy responsible for everyone coming to a deal on the bailout .
Yes , it was n’t the folks on the Hill actually working on the deal – it was McCain , sitting at home trying to get the Betamax to stop blinking .
But McCain actually believes , apparently , that he was busy negotiating deals on Capitol Hill , when he was n’t .
Uh huh .
Maybe he was able to see the Capitol dome from his window .

If you 're a wingnut attacking Obama for his past ties with other people that 's just fine , but when confronted with controversial association on their side and they just say NO .
We wo n't talk about it because it 's irrelevant to us .
The same Michael Steele that I ran into the airport in Denver moments after McCain picked Palin as his running mate and who said he loved the choice was on Hannity and Colmes and really looked like a fool when confronted with the many screwy and dangerous associations McCain and Palin have made over the years .
The segment strayed away from the basis of the segment and became a usual FOX hit job on Obama .
Colmes :... but does n't it concern you about the links to Saddam Hussein to the McCain campaign ?
The lobbyists on the McCain campaign , the secessionists Party that Sarah Palin 's buddy - buddy with ?
The fact that they hate America ?
Does n't that concern you ?
Steele :
Who you asking ?
Colmes : Michael .
Steele : No. Colmes : Why Not ? Steele : Because it does n't .
Because you asked the question .
You 're concerned about Barack Obama associations but not these .
Steele :
You get to the point Alan where you do the tit for tat and the bottom line is whether Sarah Palin did this that or the other thing is irrelevant .
Barack Obama has not come out and fully explained or dealt into these issues .
That 's why we 're still talking about them .
Colmes : Neither has the other side but the same standards have to apply .
Steele :
The reality of it is , if you 're going to raise it then we 'll talk about it .
Sarah Palin's ties to the AIP are irrelevant because what , Michael ?
And he would n't answer the question at first .
Anyway , I found this little snippet interesting for what it reveals about the Steeles of the Republican Party .
Chapter 1 . Introduction
I ’ll use an analogy to introduce version control .
See the Wikipedia entry on revision control for a saner explanation .
Work is Play I ’ve played computer games almost all my life .
In contrast , I only started using version control systems as an adult .
I suspect I ’m not alone , and comparing the two may make these concepts easier to explain and understand .
Think of editing your code , or document , as playing a game .
Once you ’ve made a lot of progress , you ’d like to save .
To do so , you click on the Save button in your trusty editor .
But this will overwrite the old version .
It ’s like those old school games which only had one save slot : sure you could save , but you could never go back to an older state .
Which was a shame , because your previous save might have been right at an exceptionally fun part of the game that you ’d like to revisit one day .
Or worse still , your current save is in an unwinnable state , and you have to start again .
Version Control
When editing , you can Save As… a different file , or copy the file somewhere first before saving if you want to savour old versions .
You can compress them too to save space .
This is a primitive and labour - intensive form of version control .
Computer games improved on this long ago , many of them providing multiple automatically timestamped save slots .
Let ’s make the problem slightly tougher .
Say you have a bunch of files that go together , such as source code for a project , or files for a website .
Now if you want to keep an old version you have to archive a whole directory .
Keeping many versions around by hand is inconvenient , and quickly becomes expensive .
With some computer games , a saved game really does consist of a directory full of files .
These games hide this detail from the player and present a convenient interface to manage different versions of this directory .
Version control systems are no different .
They all have nice interfaces to manage a directory of stuff .
You can save the state of the directory every so often , and you can load any one of the saved states later on .
Unlike most computer games , they ’re usually smart about conserving space .
Typically , only a few files change from version to version , and not by much .
Storing the differences instead of entire new copies saves room .
Distributed Control
Now imagine a very difficult computer game .
So difficult to finish that many experienced gamers all over the world decide to team up and share their saved games to try to beat it .
Speedruns are real - life examples : players specializing in different levels of the same game collaborate to produce amazing results .
How would you set up a system so they can get at each other ’s saves easily ?
And upload new ones ?
In the old days , every project used centralized version control .
A server somewhere held all the saved games .
Nobody else did .
Every player kept at most a few saved games on their machine .
When a player wanted to make progress , they ’d download the latest save from the main server , play a while , save and upload back to the server for everyone else to use .
What if a player wanted to get an older saved game for some reason ?
Maybe the current saved game is in an unwinnable state because somebody forgot to pick up an object back in level three , and they want to find the latest saved game where the game can still be completed .
Or maybe they want to compare two older saved games to see how much work a particular player did .
There could be many reasons to want to see an older revision , but the outcome is the same .
They have to ask the central server for that old saved game .
The more saved games they want , the more they need to communicate .
The new generation of version control systems , of which Git is a member , are known as distributed systems , and can be thought of as a generalization of centralized systems .
When players download from the main server they get every saved game , not just the latest one .
It ’s as if they ’re mirroring the central server .
This initial cloning operation can be expensive , especially if there ’s a long history , but it pays off in the long run .
One immediate benefit is that when an old save is desired for any reason , communication with the central server is unnecessary .
A Silly Superstition
A popular misconception is that distributed systems are ill - suited for projects requiring an official central repository .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Photographing someone does not cause their soul to be stolen .
Similarly , cloning the master repository does not diminish its importance .
A good first approximation is that anything a centralized version control system can do , a well - designed distributed system can do better .
Network resources are simply costlier than local resources .
While we shall later see there are drawbacks to a distributed approach , one is less likely to make erroneous comparisons with this rule of thumb .
A small project may only need a fraction of the features offered by such a system , but using systems that scale poorly for tiny projects is like using Roman numerals for calculations involving small numbers .
Moreover , your project may grow beyond your original expectations .
Using
Git from the outset is like carrying a Swiss army knife even though you mostly use it to open bottles .
On the day you desperately need a screwdriver you ’ll be glad you have more than a plain bottle - opener .
US manufacturing has contracted for the third consecutive month
US manufacturing activity fell in October to its lowest level for 26 years , according to a new report from the Institute for Supply Management .
The report cited " significant demand destruction " , for the third consecutive month in which the sector contracted .
The figures were far worse than the market had expected and pushed the Dow Jones index briefly into negative territory in early morning trading .
However , US construction spending in September fell far less than expected .
The institute 's index of national factory activity fell to 38.9 from 43.5 in September .
Any score of less than 50 represents a contraction in manufacturing .
Manufacturing recession
October 's score is the lowest - recorded since September 1982 .
Every sector surveyed , apart from clothing and electronic products , reported a contraction for the month .
New orders , production , employment and supplier deliveries all fell , with only inventories of unsold goods increasing on September 's score .
Export orders fell for the first time following 70 consecutive months of growth .
Robert Macintosh , chief economist at Eaton Vance , described the figures as " pretty grim " .
" It means we 're in a recession , it 's as simple as that - a pretty solid manufacturing recession , " he said .
There was some good news for consumers , however , as prices fell by 16.5 points to 37 , the lowest level since December 2001 .
If the prices of raw materials are falling , then these savings can be passed on to consumers .
Car sales
There was more bad news for US manufacturing with the release of October car sales figures .
General Motors sales were down 45 % compared with October 2007 .
" This is clearly a severe , severe recession for the US automotive industry and something we really can't sustain , " said GM 's Mike DiGiovanni .
Chrysler 's sales fell 35 % and Ford 's dropped 30 % .
Overall , 838,156 vehicles were sold in October , down 32 % and the worst figures since January 1991 , according to Autodata .
Meanwhile , US construction spending in September fell 0.3 % , according to figures released by the US Commerce Department - less than the 0.8 % fall that many analysts had been expecting .
The US figures were released on the same day that Markit Economics published its Purchasing Managers ' Index showing eurozone manufacturing activity falling to 41.1 in October .
This is the lowest score recorded by the index since it was introduced 11 years ago .
One month with Emacs and counting - Part 1
other posts in the from Vim to Emacs series : part 2
Straight to the point : since mid September I 've been using Emacs , trying to evaluate whether I was willing to switch from Vim to it .
Yup , that 's true , me ( user of Vim since the day I 've started using GNU / Linux 10 years ago , ( not so ) active maintainer in Debian of vim and related packages , author of some popular Vim extensions and of vim - addon - manager ) it 's considering switching to Emacs .
What is worse is that I 've de facto already switched .
May jamessan forgive me .
OK , that was the hardest part to write , now ...
This choice will have an impact on me : partly because I 'm quite sure several fellow DDs will start making fun of this story , and partly because as many geeks I 've always had strong opinions on the editor war .
Switching side ai n't easy .
Hence , I 've decided to write a small ( 2 - 3 ) series of blog posts on the issue , to future memory .
The post you are reading is about why , since a few months ago , I was n't willing to give Emacs a try , and how I 've changed my mind .
Why I was n't willing to give Emacs a try , but then changed my mind
I love knowing tools which can improve my workflow , no matter the task .
Editors happen to be at the intersection of many tasks , hence knowing well his own editor and feeling satisfied about it is quite important .
This is even more so for free software hackers which , for a reason or another , happen to use the very same editor for a lot of different tasks ; in my case : programming , conf file hacking ( i.e. , playing the sysadm role ) , mail writing , and everything in between .
I 've started using vi on Solaris around 1998 , then switched to Vim starting from version 4.0 , and then followed all its releases up to 7.0 .
I consider my " Vim karma " to be quite hight and I 've delivered several talks about using Vim for LUGs and other free software - related events .
Still , I 've always been hit bit several minor nuisances and glitches of Vim which could n't be fixed by simple configuration tuning or add - on implementations ( more on this in a future post ) .
In the quest for the perfect workflow , those glitches have made me try several times other editors hoping for more satisfying work environments .
Of course Emacs was one of them , which I 've tried repeatedly during the years ; the last time was circa 2006 .
For one reason or another , after a few days of experiments , I 've always decided to give up with it .
Why ?
Various reasons , listed below , together with an explanation of what ( I think ) has changed since then .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
In a room full of television industry executives , no one seemed inclined to defend MSNBC on Monday for what some were calling its lopsidedly liberal coverage of the presidential election .
The cable news channel is “ completely out of control , ” said writer - producer Linda Bloodworth - Thomason , a self - proclaimed liberal Democrat .
She added that she would prefer a lunch date with right - leaning Fox News star Sean Hannity over left - leaning MSNBC star Keith Olbermann .
Olbermann was criticized by many who attended Monday ’s luncheon sponsored by the Caucus for Producers , Writers & Directors at the Beverly Hills Hotel .
The event was dubbed “ Hollywood , America and Election ‘ 08 . ”
Bloodworth - Thomason and others seemed especially critical of the way MSNBC -- and other media -- has attacked Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin while demeaning her supporters .
“ We should stop the demonizing , ” she said , adding that Democrats have been worse than Republicans as far as personal attacks on candidates are concerned .
“ It diminishes us , ” she said of her fellow Democrats .
Bloodworth - Thomason even suggested a defense of Palin and her supporters should be written into TV programing , just as she went out of her way to portray Southern women as smart in her hit TV show “ Designing Women . ”
Attendee Michael Reagan , the radio talk - show host and son of President Ronald Reagan , said he no longer will appear as a guest on MSNBC because “ I actually get death threats . ”
“ I ’ll stop sending them , ” joked Larry Gelbart , the writer , producer and director best known for the “ M * A * S* H ” television series and such movie screenplays as “ Tootsie ” and “ Oh , God ! ”
Pollster Frank Luntz , a regular guest on the Fox News , joked that MSNBC is “ the only network with more letters in its name than viewers . ”
On a more serious note , Luntz said it ’s a problem that the electorate chooses to watch news programs not for information but to confirm already - held beliefs , and that applies to viewers of CNN and Fox News as well .
Luntz predicted a Barack Obama victory and said that one of the many reasons the Democrats have been more effective with their message is because , while Republicans dominate talk radio , Democrats have begun to dominate the Internet .
“ I ’d rather have the Internet , ” he said .
Obama also gets credit because he ’s a better communicator than past Democrats , Luntz said , comparing the previous Democratic presidential nominee , John Kerry , to one of those trees that threw apples at Dorothy in “ The Wizard of Oz . ”
Actress Patricia Heaton noted that Hollywood workers too often just assume everyone they work with is a like - minded liberal .
When those around her belittle John McCain or Palin , the former “ Everybody Loves Raymond ” co-star politely reminds them that she ’s a Republican .
“ That ’s what you have to do in our town , ” she said .
Actor Beau Bridges lamented that there is “ too much entertainment ” in elections nowadays .
“ Just put ‘em in a room -- like we are now -- and let ‘em talk about the issues , ” he said .
Some of the most spirited debate came from the panel ’s moderator , outspoken conservative Lionel Chetwynd .
The writer , director and producer passionately defended the Iraq War and Palin , whom he called “ the ideal Jeffersonian political figure . ”
Chetwynd ’s performance prompted Gelbart to joke that Chetwynd was the most “ immoderate moderator ” he had ever seen .
“ It ’s a liberal organization , ” Chetwynd said of the Caucus .
“ But I ’m trying . ”

ASHLAND , Ohio 
As jobless numbers reach levels not seen in 25 years , another crisis is unfolding for millions of people who lost their health insurance along with their jobs , joining the ranks of the uninsured .
The crisis is on display here .
Starla D. Darling , 27 , was pregnant when she learned that her insurance coverage was about to end .
She rushed to the hospital , took a medication to induce labor and then had an emergency Caesarean section , in the hope that her Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan would pay for the delivery .
Wendy R. Carter , 41 , who recently lost her job and her health benefits , is struggling to pay $ 12,942 in bills for a partial hysterectomy at a local hospital .
Her daughter , Betsy A. Carter , 19 , has pain in her lower right jaw , where a wisdom tooth is growing in .
But she has not seen a dentist because she has no health insurance .
Ms. Darling and Wendy Carter are among 275 people who worked at an Archway cookie factory here in north central Ohio .
The company provided excellent health benefits .
But the plant shut down abruptly this fall , leaving workers without coverage , like millions of people battered by the worst economic crisis since the Depression .
Proposals to implement additional form of income tax while seizing private pensions raised in Congress
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , November 11 , 2008
Under the pretext of combating the financial crisis , Democrats in Congress have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate private retirement accounts and turn them into government - controlled accounts managed by the Social Security Administration , by implementing a new tax in the guise of mandatory savings scheme .
Teresa Ghilarducci , professor of economic policy analysis at the New School for Social Research in New York , testified before Congress last month , proposing that 401 ( k ) s and IRAs be confiscated and converted into universal Guaranteed Retirement Accounts ( GRAs ) managed by the Social Security Administration .
The GRAs would be enforced by means of a mandatory savings tax equating to 5 per cent of an individual ’s annual paycheck deposited to the GRA .
Social Security and Medicare taxes would still be payable , employers would no longer would be able to write off their contributions and capital gains would be taxable year - on - year .
In addition , workers could bequeath only half of their account balances to their heirs , unlike full balances from existing 401 ( k ) and IRA accounts .
Justifying government intervention , Ghilarducci cited a 2004 HSBC global survey in claiming , “ a third of Americans wanted the government to force them to save more for retirement . ”
In actual fact , the survey concluded that Americans wanted the government to “ enforce additional private savings , ” a vastly different meaning than mandatory government - run savings , as Karen McMahan points out .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The mandatory savings account scheme is actually a brainchild of lifelong Republican and former chairmen of the New York Fed , Peter Peterson , who proposed “ mandatory savings accounts , ” also called “ forced savings accounts , ” back in 1999 .
During a Seattle radio interview on October 27 , Ghilarducci explained the motive behind the plan , stating , “ I ’m just rearranging the tax breaks that are available now for 401 ( k ) s and spreading – spreading the wealth . ”
Unfortunately , as we have again painfully learned in light of the Federal Reserve ’s refusal to identify where $ 2 trillion of taxpayers ’ money has gone , governments that propose “ spreading the wealth ” under socialist - style financial reforms almost always collect the wealth under the pretext of being the saviors before greedily hoarding it all for themselves .
Ghilarducci let slip the true agenda being the move in her testimony before Congress and also acknowledged that social security payments are a form of taxation when she stated , “ Should we mandate savings in a recession ?
Yes , as long as fiscal policy provides for short - term stimulus .
No one is proposing we suspend Social Security taxes in recessions .
Households need a source of disciplined savings over the business cycles . ”
As Jim Capo highlights , “ Not only does Ghilarducci promote Peterson ’s call for mandatory savings , she also fesses up to the crime that is our Social Security system .
Social Security is not the mandatory retirement savings plan it was sold as to the American people .
It is simply another tax .
Ghilarducci admits the bait and switch in one breath and in the other proposes the next bait and switch .
Except , this time it will be different . ”
“ So , shock !
Democrats and Republicans alike are now proposing a new mandated retirement savings plan .
Like offering voters a choice between growing the government at 4 % or 6 % , all that is really being debated is whether our new “ savings ” tax will go through the federal government or not , before these protection racket proceeds are turned over to the crime syndicates in New York and London for ultimate management and control . ”
Would the government risk a widespread revolt and potential riots by confiscating 401 ( k ) s and IRAs ?
They probably would n’t brazenly do it under that banner , but in the name of financial reform and saving the economy , Americans could find their voluntary retirement savings stolen and replaced by a government promise of a completely devalued mandatory savings account .
As the Lew Rockwell blog notes , the intention of the move is clear , but it will be down to American citizens whether or not the government is allowed to get away with it .
Think of it as an ATM for the government .
Part two would be confiscating current 401Ks and IRAs and rolling them into the GRAs .
Knowing that could be very politically unpopular ( riots , perhaps ? ) , Ghilarducci said , “ Short term , I propose that since 401 ( k ) accounts and the like are financial institutions — the bank about where 38 % of the workforce can intend to save for their retirement —
Congress let workers trade their 401( k ) and 401( k ) – type plan assets ( perhaps valued at mid-August prices ) for a Guaranteed Retirement Account composed of government bonds ( earning a 3 % return , adjusted for inflation ) . ” —-
“ Short term ” ?
And surely , we ’ll all “ retire ” on 3 % ( or less ) returns . ”
“ So the battle will be to allow “ voluntary ” rollover or not , to confiscate or not .
You know what a democratic congress and its left - wing , academia elites want to do , but what will they be able to get away with doing ?
I suppose that depends upon peoples ’ reaction and their ability to make enough noise to make any confiscation or mandatory savings too unpopular to jam down our throats .
Argentina has already vowed to push through similar measures in the name of rescuing the wider financial system .
Last month , the government of the South American country signed a bill to mandate the National Social Security Administration takeover of $ 30 billion worth of private pensions .
The move sent stock markets plummeting with critics accusing the government of stealing the pensions to get their hands on extra money at a time of economic crisis , as citizens protested across the country .

Finally , I 've had the HD - DeaD version for what felt like forever !
Sure it looked good , and the sound was pretty good too , but there were hardly any extras !!!
I was about to break down and buy the special DVD version with all the extras , but now I 'll just wait for this one !
I just hope most of the extras are in HD1080 p and that tehy remix the sound for 7.1 ch .
A definite pre-order for me even if the audio is 5.1ch and ( most of ) the extras are SD .
One thing though , .. I love Summer Glau , but who is that woman on the cover with the big bazooms ???
Please give us a better cover graphic Universal !!!

( edit : ' Filammaking Fiasco ' , the HD - DUD version was HD - 30 ( GB ) NOT 15 BG !
I have a copy right in front of me and it IS 30 GB dual layer , and while it looked and sounded pretty darn good , I too hope for a remastering of the video too ( as long as they are giving us losssles audio ) for the best possible transfer .
The extras on the ' Red - ray ' version were all SD , so I hope they remake most ( if not all ) of those in HD as well !!!)

A report on cannabis prepared for next year 's UN drug policy review will suggest that a " regulated market " would cause less harm than the current international prohibition .
The report , which is likely to reopen the debate about cannabis laws , suggests that controls such as taxation , minimum age requirements and labelling could be explored .
The Global Cannabis Commission report , which will be launched today at a conference in the House of Lords , has reached conclusions which its authors suggest " challenge the received wisdom concerning cannabis " .
It was carried out for the Beckley foundation , a UN - accredited NGO , for the 2009 UN strategic drug policy review .
There are , according to the report , now more than 160 million users of the drug worldwide .
" Although cannabis can have a negative impact on health , including mental health , in terms of relative harms it is considerably less harmful than alcohol or tobacco , " according to the report .
" Historically , there have only been two deaths worldwide attributed to cannabis , whereas alcohol and tobacco together are responsible for an estimated 150,000 deaths per annum in the UK alone . "
The report , compiled by a group of scientists , academics and drug policy experts , suggests that much of the harm associated with cannabis use is " the result of prohibition itself , particularly the social harms arising from arrest and imprisonment . "
Policies that control cannabis , whether draconian or liberal , appear to have little impact on the prevalence of consumption , it concluded .
" In an alternative system of regulated availability , market controls such as taxation , minimum age requirements , labelling and potency limits are available to minimise the harms associated with cannabis use , " said the report .
It claimed that only through a regulated market could young people be protected from the increasingly potent forms of cannabis , such as skunk .
It is intended that the report will form a blueprint for nations seeking to develop a " more rational and effective approach to the control of cannabis " .
The authors suggest there is evidence that " the current system of cannabis regulation is not working , and ... there needs to be a serious rethink if we are to minimise the harms caused by cannabis use . "
Last night , the report was welcomed by drug law reform organisations .
" The Beckley foundation are to be congratulated for the clarity of their call for cannabis supply to be brought within government control , " said Danny Kushlick of Transform .
" We look forward to the same analysis being applied to heroin and cocaine . "
The report is being launched at a two - day conference , which will be attended by leading figures in the drugs policy world .
The conclusions are unlikely to be embraced by the government or the Conservative party , both of which are opposed to relaxing restrictions on cannabis use .
Not too long ago , the well - known economist Robert Hall presented this paper ( co- authored with Susan E. Woodward ) at my place of work .
Here is the abstract :
In the standard venture capital contract , entrepreneurs have a large fraction of equity ownership in the companies they found and are paid a sub - market salary by the investors who provide the money to develop the idea .
The big rewards come only to those whose companies go public or are acquired on favorable terms , forcing entrepreneurs to bear a substantial burden of idiosyncratic risk .
We study this burden in the case of high - tech companies funded by venture capital .
Over the past 20 years , the typical venture - backed entrepreneur earned an average of $ 4.4 million from companies that succeeded in attracting venture funding .
Entrepreneurs with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of two and with less than $ 0.7 million would be better off in a salaried position than in a startup , despite the prospect of an average personal payoff of $ 4.4 million and the possibility of payoffs over $ 1 billion .
We conclude that startups attract entrepreneurs with lower risk aversion , higher initial assets , preferences for entrepreneurship over employment , and optimistic beliefs about the payoffs from their products .
During the seminar it occurred to me that these results , assuming they are correct , are evidence of an absence of overconfidence , at least among the kinds of people who leave good jobs to form high - tech startups .
The reason is that if potential entrepreneurs were massively overconfident , one would expect to see lots of entry of startups based on weak ideas , which would lead to an expected payoff so low that forming a startup would be a losing proposition for the potential entrepreneur unless he / she started out extremely wealthy and / or had very low risk - aversion .
But what the authors actually find is that forming a startup with an average - quality idea * is a break - even proposition for a potential entrepreneur with quite modest wealth and with a more - or - less standard degree of risk - aversion .
After the talk , I asked Professor Hall if he agreed with this interpretation ( he seemed to ) , and if he would object to my posting about it on OB ( he did n't ) .
But I will make him aware of this post , and invite him to comment if he would like , and correct any mistakes that I might have made .
* The authors have no way to distinguish the quality of an idea , so there is an implicit assumption that the marginal quality of the idea is equal to the average quality of all ideas that actually get implemented .

This Week's Notes
Barack Obama is already seeing some movement back in his direction , and this is even before the Democratic Convention is being taken into account in state polling ( only the first day of the convention is being included in some states - Colorado , Florida , Nevada , New Mexico , and Pennsylvania - and even then it's only about 1/3 of the sample ) .
Also , state polling was fairly minimal this week , perhaps waiting until after the Democratic Convention was over before resuming polling .
Good polling in Pennsylvania and New Mexico has pushed both of those states back into the " Weak Obama " column , marking the first time Obama has increased his official total since July 22 , when he hit his peak .
The gains this weak have completely wiped away his losses in the official count from the previous two weeks , which were both good McCain weeks .
One thing that we have n't been able to see due to lack of polling data is whether any of McCain 's weak states , such as Missouri or Indiana , are trying to trend back towards being Too Close To Call or not .
The only state in McCain 's official count that was polled this week is Idaho , which remains a strong McCain state .
As a result , McCain 's numbers remain steady this week .
Obama also gained in the count with leaners this week for the first time since August 5th with Nevada flipping from lean McCain to lean Obama .
Overall , Obama has a 70 Electoral Vote lead in the official count , 243 to 173 with 122 Too Close To Call ( the lowest number since July 22 ) while Obama has a 56 Electoral Vote lead in the count with leaners , 297 to 241 .
This is the third straight week where Obama has had fewer than 300 Electoral Votes counting leaners , tying the longest stretch set in the first 3 weeks that I tracked polls : June 10 - June 24th .

The World from Berlin ' Certain Mistakes Just Can't Be Allowed to Happen '
Hundreds of millions of euros from a German government - owned bank went down the drain with Lehman Brothers on Monday after a strange deal that has left many people scratching their heads .
Why would a German bank transfer 300 million to an American Wall Street firm after it filed for bankruptcy ?
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Ann Nixon Cooper sits back in her dining room chair , her eyes closed tight and her lips clenched , when asked if she will attend Barack Obama 's inauguration in January .
Ann Nixon Cooper was born in 1902 , a time when women and black people were denied the right to vote .

" I could go and maybe would go , but I 'm not looking forward to it , " says the 106 - year - old former socialite .
What if Obama came to her house and asked her in person to attend ?
Cooper perks up and a big smile spreads across her face .
" Oh , yes , of course I 'm ready to go ! "
It 's been a whirlwind ever since Obama mentioned the African - American centenarian in his victory speech Tuesday night .
Throngs of media -- from the BBC to a Japanese station to national news outlets -- have descended on her Atlanta house .
Strangers have stopped by too .
She 's taking it all in stride .
She stayed up later than usual , until about 3 a.m. , after Obama 's speech and the phone began ringing off the hook .
She had been tipped off by the Obama campaign that he'd say something .
" Somebody told him what to say and what to do and he followed through , " she says .
Watch " I 'd be proud to meet him as anybody else " »
Cooper -- who was born during a time when women and black people could n't vote -- fully understands the significance of Obama 's victory .
" Things are changing , changing , changing , and I look for more change now that it 's the first black president in victory of faith over fear , " she says .
" Do n't you know , that 's quite something to be proud of . "
What would she tell Obama if she ever meets him ?
" I would n't have anything special to say about Obama .
I enjoyed listening to him , but that 's all , " she says .
" I would be proud to meet him as anyone else . "
She and her late husband , prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper , raised four children in her house .
The home was a center of Atlanta 's black society and the scene of many parties .
She knew Martin Luther King Jr. when he was just a boy and was close with his mother .
She sometimes refers to Obama as " that young man . "
In his victory speech , Obama praised Cooper 's fight .
The president - elect had learned of her story two weeks earlier after CNN profiled her when she went to the polls to vote early .
Obama called her soon afterward .
Watch Obama talk about Cooper in his victory speech »
" This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations , " Obama told the tens of thousands of supporters who had gathered in Chicago on Tuesday night .
" But one that 's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta .
She 's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing -- Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old .
" She was born just a generation past slavery ; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky ; when someone like her could n't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin .
" And tonight , I think about all that she 's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope ; the struggle and the progress ; the times we were told that we can't , and the people who pressed on with that American creed : Yes we can . "
Cooper watched Obama 's speech from her home .
" Yeah , I knew he was talking about me -- I had been told that he would be saying these things . "
See images of Cooper 's early voting extravaganza »
She added that her late husband " would be elated " a black man will be president .
" Yeah , he'd be so tickled to death , " she said .
" We looked forward to changes .
Everybody looked forward to a better life . "
One of her grandsons , Albert B. Cooper , said the family has been overwhelmed with pride since Tuesday .
" It was a bigger honor than you could ever imagine to be mentioned in Obama 's speech .
For her to be used as an example of the strength -- and all the changes that have gone on within the black community -- is stunning .
We were touched and proud and I can't come up with the words , " he says .
" It 's an amazing thing . "
Ann Cooper has called Atlanta home since the 1920s .
She co-founded a Girls Club for African - American youth and taught community residents to read in a tutoring program at Ebenezer Baptist Church , where King preached .
Celebrities , including the late singer Nat King Cole , often dropped in to visit .
One time many years ago , a young student from Morehouse College stopped to visit .
He spoke of dreams to become a filmmaker .
That man , it turns out , was Spike Lee .
" It 's been a house with a heap of living going on in it , " Cooper said .
Born in 1902 in Shelbyville , Tennessee , Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103 .
She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip .
On a typical day , Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood - paneled sitting room .
Her favorite shows are " The Price is Right , " " Oprah " and " Dancing with the Stars . "
Three of Cooper 's four children have died ; her surviving daughter is 83 .
She has 14 grandchildren living and many great - grandchildren and great - great - grandchildren .
When CNN first interviewed her in October , she said she only had one thing left to see in this world .
" I ain't got time to die ' cause I 've got to see a black president , " she said , giggling with excitement .
" I 've got to see that . "
Now , she says , " I would be very proud if I could just meet and shake his hand . "

Atlanta International Airport , 29th October
It 's been a fruitless day , waking well before dawn in Pennsylvania , and travelling to West Palm Beach , Florida where we were expecting a John McCain event .
In the end it was sealed off from all but the " pool " of reporters travelling with the Republican candidate .
So now we 're in transit yet again , heading back north where we hope to see John McCain again tomorrow .
The sun 's just setting over Atlanta airport , and we 've still got to get to Ohio .
Nineteen hours of travelling in all - assuming no delays !
In the last few days of these races it 's often hard to know where the candidates will end up on any particular day .
They make last minute changes to the schedule , knowing that a visit to one place rather than another could win - or cost - votes .
In the meantime , are there some signs of desperation within the McCain camp in these closing days ?
Remember the row over robo-calls ?
Well if this report is right , they are being used in John McCain 's home state of Arizona .
That should be a safe state for him .
He should n't need to use them there .
There 's also been a lot of talk about an " October surprise " , a possible curve - ball that might throw Obama off course .
It 's getting late in the month , and I would have thought too close to election day to make any real difference , but
this has been brewing on conservative websites for a day now ,
and shows signs of making it into at least regional newspapers .
Fox are also covering it a lot .
A McCain spokesman last night accused the LA Times of deliberately suppressing a video of Barack Obama talking in favourable terms about an American - born Palestinian academic .
The feeling I have is that many here have grown tired of these kind of reports , but perhaps one more link between Obama and that often misused and misleading word " terrorist " might change some minds ?
While there are mountains and mountains of scientific research and literature on human beings ’ impact on our planet , in terms of resource exhaustion , pollution , global warming , deforestation and habitat destruction , and animal cruelty and rights abuse , most people manage to largely ignore it .
Creatively constructed print and television advertisements however , are more captivating and tend to affect a lot more people .
Here is a collection of 29 such disturbingly creative advertisements from 5 different organizations trying to spread awareness and make a change – guerrilla style marketing for social justice and humanitarian causes .
They Were n’t Born to be Worn
For over 70 years now SAFE has been the voice for all animals , helping expose animal cruelty and abuse as well as fighting against animal testing across the world .
The organization mainly uses public awareness campaigns ( and advertisements ) and political lobbying to expose and question the needless use of animals in cruel experiments and commercial exploitation .
The ads above specifically target the latter , provoking questions about the use of animals as scarves , boots and other leather goods , and so on .
Stop the Chopping
2008 was a great year for WWF as well as forest conservation .
The organization was able to convince over 60 governments to sign a pact to work towards zero net deforestation by the year 2020 .
They were able to protect over 1 million hectares of forests including tracts of land in the Amazon and Congo .
The advertisements above address the issue of habitat loss due to deforestation which directly leads to endangerment and eventual extinction of species of animals .
Same Story , Different Ending
Greenpeace ‘s ‘ storytelling ’ campaign targets parents and children and aims to spread awareness of increasingly important issues such as deforestation , oil spills , and irresponsible consumerism and pollution by depicting the consequences of our actions in various popular fairy tales .
Imagine the future you ’re creating for your children by the actions you take today .
When they tell the same stories to your grandchildren , the little mermaid might not find her prince charming , the ugly duckling wo n’t have time to turn into a beautiful swan , and little red riding hood will be a sitting target for the big bad wolf .
Though they use fiction to get the point across , this is not a story , this might be our future .
You Can Help .
Stop Global Warming
Similar to the ‘ stop deforestation ’ campaign , the ‘ stop global warming ’ campaign also focuses on habitat loss but this time due to man-made global warming .
The campaign , which reads ‘ you can help , stop global warming ’ , urges people to prevent ecological imbalances by curbing irresponsible behavior such as keeping electronics like televisions , stereos , and computers running even when you ’re not using them .
The imagery used draws parallels between animals losing their homes ( penguins , polar bears , and seals – some of the most at - risk ) and human beings who lose their homes due to natural disasters , etc. , and are forced to live on urban streets as homeless individuals .
Diesel – Global Warming Ready
Diesel ’s campaign to spread awareness of global warming is stylish and provocative , a little absurd and perhaps even thought - provoking .
The campaign focuses specifically on people and places , using popular tourist destinations ( cities and landmarks ) including Rio , London , New York , Paris , and so on , and shows what the places might look like if global warming goes unchecked .
Though not scientifically accurate in terms of the actual impact that global warming would have on each location , the ads are nonetheless powerful in their message .
A desert surrounding the great wall , tropical gardens in Paris , London and New York submerged under water , and Macaws in Venice , how much worse could it get ?
While it is hard to take the Diesel campaign entirely seriously , it still packs quite a punch .
Money , Money , Money
What if you could help make the world a better place , from the comfort of your home , would you do it ?
That is the message of the ‘ … a few coins campaign ’ .
All it takes is a few coins from each of us to help endangered species , protect rain forests , save habitats of animals as well as humans ( after all we all share this planet of ours ) .
Simple and straightforward , the campaign does n’t try to guilt - trip you , just asks politely for a few pennies .
Will you spare some ?
The Cost of Beauty and Vanity
Ever wondered what the true cost of cosmetic beauty is ?
It ’s certainly not the $ 19.99 you pay as the retail price .
Lavera ’s ( a 100 % organic and cruelty - free skincare company ) ads are meant to spread awareness of what the true price of their competitors products is , i.e. , the animal cruelty side of things that these painstakingly hide from you using glossy advertisements and starved supermodels .
The company is proving that you can look cosmetically beautiful without harming any animals in the process .
Is This Their Evolution ?
Targeting China specifically ( because of their complete disregard for animal rights ) these WWF China ads use the concept of evolution to ask the question , is the evolution of animals supposed to lead to soup , or a coat , or ivory ?
The concept is subtle ( in that most of the evolution is natural , with the exception of the last step ) but powerful at the same time ( in that the animal evolves into a ‘ product ’ in the final step ) .
A reader writes : " I almost fainted when I saw this handful of preciousness .
He was dropped off in an empty box without food or water at the door of the rescue where I volunteer .
He was so cold when we brought him inside , he now just burrows into any warm thing he gets near .
Like armpits , cupped hands , jacket pockets , belly pouches ... "

An 18 - year - old New Jersey man agreed to plead guilty to federal computer hacking charges Friday for participating in a denial - of - service attack against Church of Scientology websites , as part of collective of online troublemakers known as " Anonymous . "
Dmitriy Guzner is charged with a single felony count of unauthorized impairment of a protected computer for the January distributed denial - of - service attack .
He faces a likely sentence of 12 to 18 months in prison based on stipulations in his plea agreement , which also obliges him to pay $ 37,500 in restitution .
Anonymous is best described as a collection of griefers who hang out in the net 's most juvenile corners looking for some outlet for their boredom .
Past targets include uncool virtual worlds , an epilepsy message board and a Neo - Nazi webcaster .
Most recently , the FBI charged a 20 - year - old Tennessee student named David Kernell with breaking into Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's e-mail account , and sharing the password , and partial contents , on an Anonymous message board .
Friday 's case , in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , marks the first prosecution of an Anonymous member for a series of attacks against the Church of Scientology that began in mid-January .
The secretive religious group strayed into Anonymous ' sights after trying to suppress the publication of a creepy Tom Cruise video produced for Scientology members .
The group 's efforts against the church included extended denial - of - service attacks , in which more skilled members of anonymous authored attack scripts that less - skilled members executed .
The scripts sent waves of fake traffic at various Scientology websites in an effort to overwhelm their servers .
Other tactics included swamping phone lines with crank calls and sending black fax pages to Scientology offices .
A core group graduated to real - world demonstrations outside of Scientology centers , where they were joined by mainstream critics of the church , who largely mistook
Anonymous as an anti-Scientology group , rather than anti-everything .
According to court papers , Guzner " knowingly caused the transmission of information , codes and commands and as a result of such conduct , intentionally and without authorization caused damage by impairing the integrity and availability of data , a program , a system and information on a computer system that was used in interstate and foreign commerce and communications , specifically websites belonging to the Church of
Scientology , thereby causing loss to one or more persons aggregating at least $ 5,000 in value [ ... ] "
His plea agreement estimates that the attacks cost Scientology between $ 30,000 and $ 70,000 in damage .
Guzner was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes
Task Force in Los Angeles , which says it worked with the FBI and Los
Angeles law enforcement groups .
It 's not clear whether others remain under investigation .

In a closely contested race the AP is now reporting that Mark Begich ( D ) has defeated incumbent Senator Ted Stevens ( R ) of Alaska .
Senator Ted Stevens has received a zero rating from the Human Rights Campaign indicating an anti-LGBT voting record .
While Mark Begich 's views are not as well known on the issue of gay rights , early indications appear positive .
He has appeared at the Anchorage Pride Parade and read the city proclamation marking the third Saturday in June as Gay Pride Day .
He attended Pride Fest every year since becoming mayor .
He has also come out on the record saying it is wrong to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation .
Senator Ted Stevens losing is a great way forward for LGBT rights , regardless of his replacement , but it appears we have a friend in Mark Begich .
From Conservapedia
Clinton Richard Dawkins , FRS , FRSL , ( born March 26 , 1941 , age 79 ) , is a British author , biologist , evolutionist , agnostic and leftist / liberal ( See also : Richard Dawkins and agnosticism ) . [ 3 ]
He is often referred to as the " world 's most famous atheist " and was one of the principle founders of the New Atheism movement ( See also : Celebrity atheists ) .
[ 4 ]
But when interviewed , he claimed that , on a scale of 1 to 7 , where 1 is perfect faith in God and 7 is perfect confidence in atheism , he is a 6.9 .
[ 5 ]
In recent years , Dawkins ' popularity has waned ( See : Richard Dawkins ' loss of influence ) .
Despite being an elderly , self - declared agnostic , in his book The God Delusion , Dawkins said that " permanent in agnosticism in principle " is " fence - sitting , intellectual cowardice " ( see also : Atheism and cowardice ) . [ 6 ]
Although Dawkins declared that he was an agnostic in 2006 and 2012 , in 2002 Richard Dawkins publicly argued for the position of militant atheism and claimed that he will not feel anything after death ( see also : Ex-atheists ) . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
Despite arguing for the position of militant atheism previously , Dawkins told the Archbishop Dr. Rowan Williams that he never said was an atheist . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
See also : Atheism and historical revisionism
Although Dawkins is an agnostic , he advocates evangelical atheism and is widely considered to be an atheist activist .
Author Vox Day wrote concerning this matter , " While the fact that Dawkins declared himself a literal agnostic in the very book in which he declared the importance of atheist evangelism is both ironic and incoherent , it will surprise no one who has read the chapter of The Irrational Atheist entitled " Darwin 's Judas " . [ 7 ]
Most of Richard Dawkins ' popular books have promoted evolutionary pseudoscience .
Dawkins is also the former holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University .
He is an ardent opponent of religion , which he dismisses as mere superstition . [ 13 ]
However , Dawkins has offered no effective rebuttal to studies which show that the irreligious are more likely to be superstitious than evangelical Christians . [ 14 ]
As noted above , Dawkins is one of the primary founders of the New Atheism movement , which is a form of dogmatic , militant atheism in terms of its rhetoric ( see : New Atheism , dogmatism and Jonathon Haidt 's study ) .
Dawkins said about New Atheism , " [ O ] ur struggle is not so much an intellectual struggle , as a political one : What are we going to do about it ? ” . [ 15 ]
In recent years , the prominence of Richard Dawkins and the New Atheism movement has greatly fallen ( see : Decline of New Atheism ) .
In terms of the theism vs. agnosticism and atheism issue , Dawkins has shown himself to be rather ignorant in matters of philosophy and theology .
For example , philosopher Dr. Michael Ruse declared concerning Dawkins ' book The God Delusion : " The God Delusion makes me embarrassed to be an atheist . " [ 16 ]
The philosopher Antony Flew , who was one of the most prominent atheist academics in the world before adopting deism , said about Dawkins : “ The fault of Dawkins as an academic …was his scandalous and apparently deliberate refusal to present the doctrine he appears to think he has refuted in its strongest form ” . [ 17 ]
As far as the origin of the universe , Dawkins wrote : “ The fact that life evolved out of nearly nothing , some 10 billion years after the universe evolved literally out of nothing , is a fact so staggering that I would be mad to attempt words to do it justice . " [ 18 ]

Dawkins is a vocal opponent of Islam .
Dawkins has said , " Islam is the greatest force for evil in the world today " . [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
Despite his opposition to religion / Christianity , Dawkins indicated : " Christianity may actually be our best defence against aberrant forms of religion that threaten the world " . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]

Biography of Richard Dawkins
[ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
After previously apologizing to feminists and others for the Elevatorgate scandal , Dawkins retracted his apology and said , " I do n’t take back anything that I ’ve said .
I would not say it again , however , because I am now accustomed to being misunderstood and so I will ...
I feel muzzled , and a lot of other people do as well . “
Richard Dawkins was born in Nairobi , Kenya . [ 24 ]
He was a child of a family of colonial forest officers . [ 25 ]
Dawkins was raised to have religious values , and confesses that when he was young , he acknowledged the complexity of life and believed that it indicated a designer .
However , during his teens , he chose to abandon this faith and embrace Darwinism instead , despite admitting that he had n’t actually read Charles Darwin ’s works . [ 26 ] [ 27 ]
See also : British atheism and UK and secularism
The atheist philosopher John Gray wrote of Dawkins ' time spent in Kenya while reviewing An Appetite for Wonder : The Making of a Scientist , the first of a two - part autobiography : " Unlike the best of the colonial administrators , some of whom were deeply versed in the languages and histories of the peoples they ruled , Dawkins displays no interest in the cultures of the African countries where he lived as a boy .
It is the obedient devotion of those who served his family that has remained in his memory . " [ 28 ]

Dawkins studied zoology at Oxford University , and graduated in 1962 .
As a undergraduate at Oxford , he studied zoology under the Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen and the two developed a strong student / teacher relationship . [ 29 ]
He remained at Oxford for his doctoral work , receiving his Ph.D in 1966 .
From 1967 - 1969 , Dawkins served as Assistant Professor of Zoology at Berkeley .
During this time , he was , in his own words , “ heavily involved ” in the unrest and liberal activism for which Berkeley is notorious . [ 27 ]
He returned to Oxford in 1970 and served as a Lecturer in Animal Behaviour and a Fellow of New College .
In 1995 , Dawkins became the Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science which was a post created by an endowment of £ 1.5 m from Dr. Charles Simonyi .
In September 2008 , Richard Dawkins retired from his post as Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
Despite this , Richard Dawkins might have remained a relatively obscure professor if not for the publication of his first book , The Selfish Gene , in 1976 .
This book became a bestseller , and brought Dawkins a celebrity which he has worked to maintain with further books and lectures .
In 1984 , Dawkins divorced his wife of 17 years , Marian Stamp ; later that same year , he married Eve Barham .
Dawkins also divorced Barham , though the precise circumstances of this divorce are unclear . [ 30 ]
He married science fiction actress Lalla Ward in 1992 and they separated after 24 years of marriage . [ 31 ]
Theodore Beale wrote in the his book The Irrational Atheist about Dawkins 's claim that teaching children about Hell is more harmful to children than " mild child abuse " :
“ Richard Dawkins is perhaps one of the last men on Earth who should be discussing what is the right and proper way to raise children , given that the number of his wives outnumber his offspring .
In his letter to his daughter Juliet , addressed to her at the age of ten and published in A Devil ’s Chaplain , there is little mention of love , no admission of regret , and no paternal promises .
As one British journalist noted , the letter is “ coldly impersonal ” and “ authoritarian . ”
There is no expression of interest in what might be important to her . [ 32 ] ”

The Christian Times reported :
“ The 75 - year - old evolutionary biologist , who suffered a stroke early this year , had stirred the public years ago when he denounced monogamy and fidelity in relationships .
In his article piece " Banishing the Green Eyed Monster , " Dawkins referred to " jealousy " in a relationship as " immoral and selfish . "
He defended that men should be allowed to keep mistresses and indulge in sexual pleasures with others . [ 33 ] ”
Since 2011 , Dawkins has been embroiled in controversies related to feminism / Islam and he has received a significant amount of criticism from his fellow secular leftists as a result ( see : Richard Dawkins and women and Richard Dawkins and Islamophobia accusations ) .
According to The Richest , " Richard Dawkins ..has an estimated net worth of $ 10,000,000 according to the Sunday Times in 2012 . " [ 34 ]

Women 's views of Richard Dawkins
See : Richard Dawkins and women , Elevatorgate , Feminist quotes about Richard Dawkins , New Atheism and women and Atheism and rape
Majority of web visitors to Dawkins ' website are men
Survey data and website tracking data of prominent atheist websites indicate that in the Western World , atheism is significantly less appealing to women .
According to the website tracking firm Alexa , women frequent the website of richarddawkins .
net significantly less than men . [ 35 ] [ 36 ]
In recent years , there has been a significant amount of friction between Richard Dawkins and feminists ( see : Richard Dawkins and women ) .

In July 2011 , Richard Dawkins was widely criticized within the atheist community and in various press outlets for his insensitive comments made to atheist Rebecca Watson about an incident which occurred in an elevator ( see : Elevatorgate ) . [ 37 ]
Prior to Elevatorgate , Monica Shores ' Ms. Magazine article titled Will “ New Atheism ” Make Room For Women ?
criticized the News Atheism movement for being sexist . [ 38 ]
She also cited Conservapedia in her article and indicated : " The lack of lady presence is so visible that Conservapedia commented on it by noting that Dawkins ’ website overwhelmingly attracts male visitors . " [ 38 ]

The atheist Rebecca Watson and Richard Dawkins were central figures in the Elevatorgate scandal .
On August 6 , 2014 , Dawkins apologized for his remarks related to his Elevatorgate scandal . [ 23 ] [ 39 ]
However , on November 18 , 2014 , Richard Dawkins retracted his apology and indicated that : he stands by his recent remarks about women / men relations , he feels muzzled by " thought police " and that Rebecca Watson 's experience in the elevator was " rather trivial " compared to events some Muslim women experience . [ 40 ]
Specifically , the Washington Post reported on November 18 , 2014 :
“ “ I do n’t take back anything that I ’ve said , ” Dawkins said from a shady spot in the leafy backyard of one of his Bay Area supporters .
“ I would not say it again , however , because I am now accustomed to being misunderstood and so I will .
“ He trailed off momentarily , gazing at his hands resting on a patio table .
“ I feel muzzled , and a lot of other people do as well , ” he continued .
“ There is a climate of bullying , a climate of intransigent thought police which is highly influential in the sense that it suppresses people like me . ”
Recent criticism of Dawkins has come from women , many of them within the atheist movement , which has long drawn more men to its ranks .
His online remarks , some women say , contribute to a climate they see as unwelcoming to female atheists ...
“ I concentrate my attention on that menace and I confess I occasionally get a little impatient with American women who complain of being inappropriately touched by the water cooler or invited for coffee or something which I think is , by comparison , relatively trivial , ” he said . [ 21 ] ”

An article by Sarah posted at Skepchick about a conversation between Richard Dawkins and David Silverman ( a former president of the American Atheists organization ) , which took place during the planning phase of the Reason Rally :
“ Richard was standing behind the podium , and he asked Dave something along the lines of , “ What exactly is the Reason Rally ? ”
Dave started explaining it , and as he did , someone who was waiting in the line outside opened the door to peek inside and we could all hear a lot of noise .
I rushed up the aisle and made frantic “ shut the door ” gestures at the people peeking inside , and they did .
As I walked the ten feet back , I could n’t hear everything Dave was saying , but I heard the name “ Rebecca Watson . ”
Richard suddenly had a very angry look on his face and I heard him almost shout , “ No , absolutely not !
If she ’s going to be there , I wo n’t be there .
I do n’t want her speaking . ” and then Dave immediately replied , “ You ’re absolutely right , we ’ll take her off the roster .
It ’s done . ”
Richard huffed for a moment , Dave continued to placate him , and then he made the video .
I was crushed . [ 41 ] ”

Post - Elevatorgate , Richard Dawkins is often criticized by secular leftists for igniting deep fractures in the atheist movement and hindering the atheist movement .
For example , on November 26 , 2013 , the atheist activist and blogger Jen McCreight posted at Twitter the message : " Did anyone on Dawkins AMA ask how he feels about singlehandedly destroying the atheist movement with the Dear Muslima yet ? " [ 42 ]
In December 2013 , atheist Jack Vance at Atheist Revolution called July 2 , 2011 , which is the day that Elevatorgate occurred , " The day the atheist movement died . " [ 43 ]

See also : Richard Dawkins ' health , Richard Dawkins ' stroke , Richard Dawkins and medical science and Richard Dawkins , Darwin and psychogenic illness
As a result of the controversy relating to a Dawkins Twitter post about feminism / Islam , Dawkins was disinvited to speak at the 2016 Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism ( NCSS ) ( See : Feminists cause Richard Dawkins to be disinvited to skeptic conference ) . [ 44 ]
Stephanie Zvan is an atheist blogger at Freethought Blogs .
She wrote an open letter to the Center for Inquiry ( CFI ) about the events surrounding the Dawkins '
Twitter post about feminism / Islam that " CFI now has a harassment denialist on its board , a harassment denialist who has tied his denialism to his work at your organization . " [ 45 ]
Dawkins said he was very upset about being disinvited to the conference . [ 44 ]
After his disinvitation , Dawkins gave some news about his health condition after suffering a minor stroke and he mentioned that his doctors advised avoiding controversies due to his chronic high blood pressure . [ 46 ]
In recent times Dawkins has been embroiled in a number of controversies involving the topics of feminism / Islam and he has faced a significant amount of criticism from his fellow skeptics / liberals ( see : Richard Dawkins and women and Richard Dawkins and Islamophobia accusations ) .
Atheist Hemant Mehta reported about Dawkins ' stroke and Dawkins ' report that he had been once again invited to the conference :
“ It was the result of stress - related higher blood pressure , which he says he may have had as a result of recent controversy , including being booted from the NECSS conference .
He added , however , that on February 5 , he received a letter from conference organizers apologizing for disinviting him and asking him back to the conference . [ 47 ] ”
On the morning of Richard Dawkins ' stroke , Dawkins received a letter from the NCSS apologizing to Dawkins for his disinvitation and once again inviting him to speak at the conference . [ 48 ]
Despite the medical advice of his doctors , Dawkins had a very active Twitter presence before his minor stroke ( with a number of Twitter controversies ) and numerous public controversies . [ 49 ]
Dawkins has accumulated over 30,000 Twitter tweets . [ 52 ]
The Independent reported , " Dawkins also admitted he was n't very good at managing Twitter and the strong reactions his posts tend to provoke .
' Twitter is very difficult medium to handle , ' he said .
' I ’m not much of a diplomat . ' " [ 53 ]
However , after his stroke , in May 2016 , Dawkins gave up posting on Twitter for awhile and the tweets that appeared in his name were done by his staff . [ 54 ]

In 2014 , the prominent New Atheist PZ Myers said of Richard Dawkins ' attitude towards women : " At a time when our movement needs to expand its reach , it ’s a tragedy that our most eminent spokesman has so enthusiastically expressed such a regressive attitude . ” [ 61 ]
Myers also said in 2014 concerning Dawkins :
“ Richard Dawkins : you ’re wrong .
Deeply , profoundly , fundamentally wrong .
Your understanding of feminism is flawed and misinformed , and further , you keep returning to the same poisonous wells of misinformation .
... you persist in presenting these anti-feminist caricatures as reasonable .
You say you are a feminist , and even find feminism an undeniable virtue , but at the same time you parrot absurd anti-feminist remarks . [ 62 ] ”
In 2010 , the Christian apologetics website True Free Thinker wrote :
“ The atheist and evolutionist Richard Dawkins just referred to Mary , the mother of Jesus , as a ‘ submissive cosmic doormat ’ ...
If Richard Dawkins had a better grasp of womanhood and a greater grasp of manhood , he would still be married to his first wife and not his third . [ 63 ] ”
Other reasons why many women hold unfavorable views of Richard Dawkins
Another plausible explanation for many women having a lack of enthusiasm for Richard Dawkins 's message is that many women who attend religious services and hold traditional beliefs and values find Richard Dawkins ' atheistic values repugnant .
In terms of traditional values , in 2007 , when asked in an interview , " If we do not acknowledge some sort of external [ standard ] , what is to prevent us from saying that the Muslim [ extremists ] are n’t right ? " , Dawkins replied , " What ’s to prevent us from saying Hitler was n’t right ?
I mean , that is a genuinely difficult question , but whatever [ defines morality ] , it ’s not the Bible .
If it was , we ’d be stoning people for breaking the Sabbath . " [ 64 ]

Richard Dawkins
The Guardian reported about Richard Dawkins ' book The God Delusion :
“ Richard Dawkins is responding to what he called the “ stirring towards atheism ” in some Islamic countries with a programme to make free downloads of his books available in Arabic , Urdu , Farsi and Indonesian .
The scientist and atheist said he was “ greatly encouraged ” to learn that the unofficial Arabic pdf of the book had been downloaded 13 m times .
Dawkins writes in The God Delusion about his wish that the “ open - minded people ” who read it will “ break free of the vice of religion altogether ” .
It has sold 3.3 m copies worldwide since it was published in 2006 – far fewer than the number of Arabic copies that Dawkins believes to have been downloaded illegally .
The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science recently merged with the Washington DC - based Center for Inquiry .
Dawkins said the CFI decided on “ a more systematic programme ” of translating his work in ebook form following “ stirrings toward atheism in Iran and other Islamic countries ” .
It will be the first time his work has been made available in Arabic , Urdu , Farsi and other languages of Islamic countries . [ 65 ] ”
The Center for Inquiry indicates on its website :
“ Announcing The Translations Project , a program of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science , part of the Center for Inquiry .
The books of Richard Dawkins — including River Out of Eden , The Magic of Reality , The Blind Watchmaker , and The God Delusion — are being professionally translated into languages such as Arabic , Urdu , Farsi , and Indonesian and made available to download free of charge . [ 66 ] ”

Dawkins is dismissive of the concept of Islamophobia and declared : " I ’m always being accused of Islamophobia , that ’s a non-word . " [ 69 ]
On December 28 , 2015 , the Daily Express reported about Dawkins :
“ The furious academic walked out of an interview when a Muslim journalist confirmed he personally believed the prophet Muhammad flew to heaven on a winged horse .
Dawkins , 74 , author of best - seller The God Delusion , told the New Statesmen 's Emad Ahmed that his belief was " pathetic " before angrily storming off . [ 70 ] ”
Ryan Kerney wrote at New Republic concerning Dawkins ' behavior towards Emad Ahmed : " Richard Dawkins is just as rude in person as he is on Twitter , apparently . " [ 71 ]
On the other hand , defenders of atheist criticisms of Islam / Muslims indicated that New Atheists should be able to criticize Islam without being accused of Islamophobia . [ 72 ]

Atheist Sikivu Hutchinson wrote :
“ The recent merger of the secular organization Center for Inquiry ( CFI ) and the Richard Dawkins Foundation ( RDF ) has been dubbed atheism 's supergroup moment .
Acknowledging the two organizations ' outsized presence in the atheist world , Religion News Service acidly declared it a " royal wedding " .
The partnership , which gives Richard Dawkins a seat on the CFI board , smacks of a vindication of Dawkins ' toxic , reactionary brand of damn - all - them - culturally - backward - Western - values - hating - Muslims New Atheism .
As one of the most prominent global secular organizations , CFI 's all - white board looks right at home with RDF 's lily white board and staff . [ 73 ] ”
The secular humanist document Human Manifesto II , which was written in 1973 by Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson , decried racism and it declared :
“ The beginnings of police states , even in democratic societies , widespread government espionage , and other abuses of power by military , political , and industrial elites , and the continuance of unyielding racism , all present a different and difficult social outlook .
In various societies , the demands of women and minority groups for equal rights effectively challenge our generation . [ 74 ] ”
Richard Dawkins wants people to eat manufactured human lab meat to " overcome our taboo against cannibalism ”

LifeSite News declares :
“ Richard Dawkins , the ( in ) famous atheism proselytizer , has mused about eating human meat .
No , he does n’t want to join the Donner Party .
Researchers may soon be able to manufacture meat from cell lines in the lab , and Dawkins has suggested in a tweet that we could “ overcome our taboo ” by eating human flesh so manufactured .
What if human meat is grown ?
Could we overcome our taboo against cannibalism ?
An interesting test case for consequentialist morality versus “ yuck reaction ” absolutism . [ 75 ] ”

On January 1 , 2015 , The Telegraph reported :
“ Richard Dawkins ’ insanity has now become an English institution – like warm beer and rain .
On Saturday morning , a tweet from his account asked why we do n’t send lots of " erotic videos " to theocracies , adding that it should be “ loving , gentle , woman - respecting ” ( I guess this involves the pizza delivery boy calling the next day ) .
If we ’re going down this road , I also hear that Islamists are n’t very keen on bacon , so perhaps we should bombard the Iranian countryside with pig carcasses ?
Also , miniature bottles of gin .
And photos of hot guys making out – in a “ men-respecting ” and “ gentle ” sort of way .
After a few minutes of mockery , the tweet was deleted .
Perhaps even he realised how utterly mad it was .
Which suggests a degree of self - awareness that I did n’t think possible in Britain ’s nuttiest professor . [ 82 ] ”

See also : Richard Dawkins ' cult of personality , Atheist cults , Atheism is a religion and Atheism and leadership
On August 16 , 2014 , Andrew Brown wrote an article for The Spectator entitled The bizarre – and costly – cult of Richard Dawkins which declared :
“ ... the Richard Dawkins website offers followers the chance to join the ‘ Reason Circle ’ , which , like Dante ’s Hell , is arranged in concentric circles .
For $ 85 a month , you get discounts on his merchandise , and the chance to meet ‘ Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science personalities ’ .
Obviously that ’s not enough to meet the man himself .
For that you pay $ 210 a month — or $ 5,000 a year — for the chance to attend an event where he will speak ...
But the $ 85 a month just touches the hem of rationality .
After the neophyte passes through the successively more expensive ‘ Darwin Circle ’ and then the ‘ Evolution Circle ’ , he attains the innermost circle , where for $ 100,000 a year or more he gets to have a private breakfast or lunch with Richard Dawkins , and a reserved table at an invitation - only circle event with ‘ Richard ’ as well as ‘ all the benefits listed above ’ , so he still gets a discount on his Richard Dawkins T - shirt saying ‘ Religion — together we can find a cure . ’
The website suggests that donations of up to $ 500,000 a year will be accepted for the privilege of eating with him once a year : at this level of contribution you become a member of something called ‘ The Magic of Reality Circle ’ .
I do n’t think any irony is intended .
At this point it is obvious to everyone except the participants that what we have here is a religion without the good bits . [ 85 ] ”
Theodore Beale noted that the Richard Dawkins cult has some similarity to the cult of Scientology . [ 84 ]
Dawkins was one of the founders of the New Atheism movement .
The New Atheism movement , which has waned in recent years , was called a cult by the agnostic , journalist Bryan Appleyard in a 2012 article in the New Statesman in which he describes the abusive behavior of New Atheists . [ 86 ]
Although the New Atheism movement does not perfectly fit the various characteristics of a cult , it does fit some of the characteristics . [ 87 ]

Gary Demar commenting on the abrasiveness and incivility of Richard Dawkins quotes Dawkins stating the following :
“ It is absolutely safe to say that if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution , that person is ignorant , stupid or insane ( or wicked , but I 'd rather not consider that ) . ”
Dr. R. Albert Mohler , Jr. has echoed Mr. Demar 's estimation of Richard Dawkins and has stated regarding Richard Dawkins the following :
“ His aggressiveness and abrasiveness have now prompted some of his fellow defenders of evolution to wonder if he is doing their cause more harm than good .
The September 2005 issue of Discover magazine features an article that raises this very question .
In " Darwin 's Rottweiler , " author Stephen S. Hall suggests that Dawkins is simply " far too fierce . " ....
Dawkins admits that he just may be " a bit of a loose canon . "
In reality , that is a significant understatement . [ 89 ] ”
In addition , Richard Dawkins appears to have had struggles maintaining marital harmony in his life and three of his three marriages have ended in divorce ( see also : Women 's views of Richard Dawkins ) .
In September 2010 , Richard Dawkins became nasty towards a woman in an audience he spoke before . [ 90 ]

Dogmatic arrogance of Richard Dawkins
See : Atheism is a religion , Atheism and arrogance and Atheism and intolerance
Using special text analysis software , the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt found that New Atheists , such as Richard Dawkins , very often wrote in dogmatic terms in their major works using words such as “ always , ” “ never , ” “ certainly , ” “ every , ” and “ undeniable . ” [ 92 ]
Yet , the works of New Atheists , including Richard Dawkins , often betray an amateurish knowledge of philosophy , religion and science .
For example , Vox Day 's book The Irrational atheist found multiple errors in reasoning and factual errors when it came to the works of New Atheist authors . [ 93 ]

Atheist philosopher John Gray on the dogmatic arrogance of Richard Dawkins
In a 2014 New Republic article entitled The Closed Mind of Richard Dawkins :
His atheism is its own kind of narrow religion , the atheist philosopher John Gray wrote :
“ One might wager a decent sum of money that it has never occurred to Dawkins that to many people he appears as a comic figure .
His default mode is one of rational indignation — a stance of withering patrician disdain for the untutored mind of a kind one might expect in a schoolmaster in a minor public school sometime in the 1930s .
He seems to have no suspicion that any of those he despises could find his stilted pose of indignant rationality merely laughable .
“ I am not a good observer , ” he writes modestly .
He is referring to his observations of animals and plants , but his weakness applies more obviously in the case of humans .
Transfixed in wonderment at the workings of his own mind , Dawkins misses much that is of importance in human beings — himself and others . [ 28 ] ”

Dr. Michael Brown wrote in the Christian Post about this matter : " It is becoming increasingly clear that Dawkins is something of an embarrassment , even to other atheists ( although he is still revered by many ) .
The only question that remains is this :
Are his irrational and immoral positions unique to him , or are they the logical outcome of his Darwinian evolutionism ? " [ 95 ]

Coverage of Richard Dawkins speaking tour
In 2016 , the Shadow To Light blog wrote in article entitled Fading Dawkins :
“ Dawkins has been on a speaking tour recently in the United States .
On Nov 1 and 2 , he had a “ public conversation ” with Sam Harris .
In the golden years of Gnu , there would have been a couple of news reports about this talk filled with some click - bait quote and I ’d probably be blogging about something they said .
But despite Dawkins ’ return to the speaker circuit , and despite him teaming up with Sam Harris for two days , I ca n’t find a single report .
No one outside that theater is interested in what two of the Four Horsemen had to say .
Look , Dawkins and Harris will always have their place among the Madalyn Murray O’Hair crowd .
But as far as breaking out into the mainstream is concerned , the fad has run its course . [ 104 ] ”
Survey of scientists : Richard Dawkins misrepresents science and scientists
Richard Dawkins
See also : Atheism and science
The Independent reported :
“ British scientists who mentioned Richard Dawkins during a recent study seem mostly to dislike him , with some arguing that he misrepresents science and is misleading the public .
Criticism of the British evolutionary biologist came up repeatedly in a new study looking at public understanding of science and how scientists feel that they are portrayed in the media – despite respondents never actually being asked about him .
The research was published in a recent edition of Public Understandings of Science as part of a broader study looking at how scientists feel about religion .
As part of the study , the researchers conducted a survey of over 20,000 scientists from eight countries .
In the UK , the researchers surveyed 1,581 randomly sampled scientists .
They then spoke to 137 of them for in - depth interviews to see what they thought .
Though Dawkins was n’t a part of the interview process , and researchers did n’t ask about him , 48 of the 137 British scientists they spoke to mentioned Dawkins .
Of those 48 that referenced him , 80 per cent said they thought that Dawkins misrepresents science and scientists in his books and public speeches , according to the study by Rice University , Texas . [ 105 ] ”

Within the evolutionary science community and the creation science community , Richard Dawkins has faced charges of engaging in pseudoscience and also has faced charges of committing elementary errors . [ 106 ] [ 107 ]
The website True Free Thinker notes :
“ Moreover , note that with regards to “ assertions without adequate evidence ” evolutionary biologist and geneticist , Prof. Richard Lewontin , referenced Carl Sagan ’s list of the “ best contemporary science - popularizers ” which includes Richard Dawkins .
These authors have , as Lewontin puts it , “ put unsubstantiated assertions or counterfactual claims at the very center of the stories they have retailed in the market . ”
Lewontin specifically mentions “ Dawkins ’s vulgarizations of Darwinism ” ( find details here ) .
Even renowned evolutionary biologists H. Allen Orr , David Sloan Wilson , and Massimo Pigliucci have called into question the power that Dawkins once had as an intellectual , since he has made elementary errors in The God Delusion . [ 106 ] ”

Many of Richard Dawkins detractors are conservative Christians which is not surprising .
As alluded to earlier , the Wall Street Journal reported : " A comprehensive new study released by Baylor University yesterday , shows that traditional Christian religion greatly decreases belief in everything from the efficacy of palm readers to the usefulness of astrology .
It also shows that the irreligious and the members of more liberal Protestant denominations , far from being resistant to superstition , tend to be much more likely to believe in the paranormal and in pseudoscience than evangelical Christians . " [ 14 ]

“ Richard Dawkins wrote in his book the God Delusion : " I am agnostic only to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden " ( God Delusion , page 74 ) .
In addition , Dawkins said in his book the God Delusion that on a 7 point scale of being sure that God does not exists : " I count myself in category 6 , but leaning towards 7 . "
In 2012 , in video recorded discussion with Rowan Williams Archbishop of Canterbury , Richard Dawkins said he was 6.9 out of 7 of sure that God does not exist and counted himself as an agnostic .
A 6.9 out of 7 would mean that Richard Dawkins believes there is about a .986 percent chance that God exists .
In short , according to Dawkins , there is about a 1 % chance that God exists .
Since Richard Dawkins likened God 's existence to fairies being at the bottom of the garden , why does Dawkins believe there is about a 1 % chance that fairies are at the bottom of the garden ?
Dawkins is either being disingenuous or he is being irrational or a combination of both is occurring .
Anyone who gives weight to Dawkins ' views on the existence of God or his views on the creation vs. evolution controversy is obviously displaying bad judgement .
Sin is very irrational .
Dr. Don Batten , a scientist at Creation Ministries International , wrote that despite Richard Dawkins ' skeptical protestations , Dawkins appears to be a God-hater .
This seems to be the best description of Dawkins ' behavior .
It really comes as no surprise that Dawkins has been noticeably quiet about the 15 questions for evolutionists of the Question Evolution !
Campaign .
He obviously cannot satisfactorily answer the 15 questions . [ 113 ] ”
Publisher 's notice of his upcoming book and the issue of inconsistency and flip - flopping
On June 5 , 2012 , the Christian Post reported :
“ Famed atheist and scientist Richard Dawkins has set out to write a new book that will focus on his own evolution toward the path of atheism .
" Dawkins will tell the story of his own intellectual evolution , explaining how his groundbreaking work as a scientist led to his work as an atheist , " states Dawkins ' new publisher HarperCollins ' Ecco .
The book has not yet been given a title , but is expected to be on bookshelves by 2014 . [ 114 ] ”

“ The publisher 's notice of the upcoming book using the term " atheist " can be found on several other prominent internet properties besides the Christian Post such as Publishers Weekly , The Blaze , Christianity Today and Galleycat ( Galleycat is on the Media Bistro domain ) .
First , Richard Dawkins has gone from being a militant atheist to being an agnostic .
Vox Day wrote about Dawkins ' inconsistency when it comes to the issues of atheism and agnosticism ...
Christians should call Dawkins on his disingenuous flip - flopping if his publisher continues to promote the book as a book focusing on his journey to atheism without mentioning the fact that Dawkins is presently an agnostic who has rejected atheism .
An author calling himself an atheist or a publisher giving the impression that someone is an atheist may sell more books as it is more provocative , but it is n't intellectually honest if the author has rejected atheism and is an agnostic .
If Dawkins claims to be an agnostic who is unsure if God exist or not , then he should clearly communicate this to the public and so should his publisher .
Dawkins has been unreasonable as far as his alleged agnosticism and I recommend reading the article
Why does Richard Dawkins have such a high belief in the possibility of fairies being at the bottom of the garden ?
Given the weakness of his argumentation and the vitriol which often accompanies it , I agree with Dr. Don Batten that the weight of the evidence points to Dawkins being a God-hater . [ 115 ] ”
Title of the book The God Delusion displayed odd and inconsistent behavior
A July 25 , 2012 article entitled Is Richard Dawkins a flip - flopper declared :
“ Another reason why Dawkins displays odd behavior in reference to the atheism and agnosticism issue is that he titled a recent book of his The God Delusion .
Obviously , this is an odd title for an agnostic author to name a book - especially one who asserts there is about a 1 % chance that God exist in his estimation .
This odd behavior leads me to the conclusion that the reason the book was titled The God Delusion was for crass marketing reasons as it is more provocative title which would grab more press headlines and sell more books .
Think about it .
If there was a 1 % chance that something existed , would you call your neighbor delusional if he believed it existed ?
No , you would not .
Sure , you would think the odds are against your neighbor in terms of his belief , but you would not think he is delusional .
The term delusional is generally used in connection with ideas that are insane to believe due to there being overwhelming evidence to the contrary . [ 116 ] ”

In 2008 , a video clip featuring Richard Dawkins became widely available to the public , showing Dawkins [ 119 ] being stumped by a question from the creationist interviewer .
A shortened version has been translated into 10 languages .
The clip was part of an interview included in the video and DVD From a Frog to Prince , produced by Creation Ministries International about the genetic information required by evolution , and the interviewer is asking Dawkins for an example of genetic information arising from a mutation .
In later interviews , Dawkins claims that he was not stumped , but instead shocked when he realized that the interviewer was a creationist , and the video was edited in a way to make him look like he was unable to answer the question . [ 120 ]
However , the question came after he had that realization , and after the creationists negotiated with Dawkins and he agreed to continue . [ 121 ]
However , despite being given a free reign in a sceptic publication to respond , he still did n't provide any examples .
Recently , a creationist produced an excellent YouTube video demonstrating the Richard Dawkins still has not answered the question posed to him by the interviewer and he uses Richard Dawkins own words to demonstrate this fact .
[ 118 ]
The video can be found at YouTube and is entitled Is Richard Dawkins Really Stumped ?
The Truth - In His Own Words - YES ... he is !
As noted earlier , Dr. Don Batten of Creation Ministries International theorizes that Richard Dawkins is a God hater and not a skeptic . [ 122 ]
The video in which Richard Dawkins clearly squirms when asked for an example of genetic information arising from a mutation and dodges the question with an unrelated monologue , certainly gives some credence to Dr. Batten 's postulate .
Richard Dawkins inept response relating to the existence of God during his interview with Ben Stein further bolsters the view that Richard Dawkins is more motivated by hatred towards God than any inward assurance Dawkins has concerning the validity of his skeptical contentions .

There is certainly historical precedence for evolutionists / atheists having inward doubts about the validity of evolution and atheism .
The evolutionist Charles Darwin wrote in a private notebook that he was a materialist ( a type of atheist ) .
[ 123 ]
Late in Charles Darwin's life , Darwin told the Duke of Argyll that he frequently had overwhelming thoughts that the natural world was the result of design . [ 124 ]
Richard Dawkins has been inconsistent concerning his supposed refusal to debate creationists and his refusal is merely a ruse to avoid losing debates to creation scientists .
Generally speaking , creationist scientists tend to win the creation vs. evolution debates ( see : Creation vs. evolution debates ) .

The evolutionist and agnostic Richard Dawkins said in an interview : “ What ’s to prevent us from saying Hitler was n’t right ?

As noted earlier , when asked in an interview , " If we do not acknowledge some sort of external [ standard ] , what is to prevent us from saying that the Muslim [ extremists ] are n’t right ? " , Dawkins replied , " What ’s to prevent us from saying Hitler was n’t right ?
I mean , that is a genuinely difficult question , but whatever [ defines morality ] , it ’s not the Bible .
If it was , we ’d be stoning people for breaking the Sabbath . " [ 64 ]
The interviewer wrote in response , " I was stupefied .
He had readily conceded that his own philosophical position did not offer a rational basis for moral judgments .
His intellectual honesty was refreshing , if somewhat disturbing on this point . " [ 64 ]

As far as Christianity vs. atheism public debates , in recent years there have been a number of notable instances of atheists being reluctant to debate and doing poorly in debates ( see : Atheism vs. Christianity debates ) .
Richard Dawkins has established a reputation for avoiding debates with his strongest opponents .
On May 14 , 2011 , the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph published a news story entitled Richard Dawkins accused of cowardice for refusing to debate existence of God . [ 125 ]
In The Daily Telegraph article Dr. Daniel Came , a member of the Faculty of Philosophy at Oxford University , was quoted as writing to fellow atheist Richard Dawkins concerning his refusal to debate Dr. William Lane Craig : " The absence of a debate with the foremost apologist for Christian theism is a glaring omission on your CV and is of course apt to be interpreted as cowardice on your part . " [ 126 ]
In October 2011 , Dr. Craig went to England and the Daily Telegraph declared that Dawkins is either a fool or a coward for his refusal to debate William Lane Craig plus declared that Dawkins is a " proud man " and a " coward " who puts on an " illiterate , angry schtick " for the public . [ 127 ]
In addition , Christian apologist Ken Ammi called Dawkins a " cowardly clown " because Dawkins and other prominent skeptics / atheists refused to debate Creation Ministries International at the 2010 Global Atheist Convention . [ 128 ]

Richard Dawkins is known for his vehement and sometimes vitriolic promotion of weak atheism and the evolutionary paradigm .
Dawkins has repeatedly likened religious faith to a mental defect .
Mr. Dawkins currently resides in the UK .
He was an assistant professor of Zoology at the University of California , Berkeley for two years before becoming a zoology researcher at Oxford .
Richard Dawkins lost a debate to a rabbi and then denied the debate ever took place

As briefly noted earlier Richard Dawkins had a debate with Rabbi Shmuley Boteach .
Rabbi Shmuley Boteach was named the London Times Preacher of the Year 2000 and is the author of 20 books . [ 129 ]
Recently Rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote :
“ ... Dawkins attacked me on his website and denied that he and I had ever debated .
My office quickly posted the full footage of a two hour debate which took place on October 23 , 1996 , a debate which Dawkins actually lost after a vote taken by the students as to which side , science or religion , caused more students to change their minds .
In my article on the subject responding to his attack I was extremely respectful of Dr. Dawkins and was therefore shocked to receive a letter in return in which he accused me of speaking like Hitler .
Had the noted scientist lost his mind ?
Hitler ?
Was this for real ? [ 129 ] ”
WorldNetDaily offers the following quotes of Rabbi Boteach about debate and the initial denial by Dawkins that the debate never took place :
“ That is a particularly bold untruth .
Our debate , which took place at St. Catherine 's College , Oxford on Oct. 23 , 1996 , attracted hundreds of students and featured , on the atheist side , Prof. Dawkins and chemistry Prof. Peter Atkins , and on the religion side , me and Prof. Keith Ward , Oxford 's Regius Professor of Divinity .
Student president Josh Wine was in the chair , " the rabbi explained .
" In a vote at the end of the debate as to how many students had changed their minds after hearing the arguments , Dawkin 's side was defeated and religion prevailed , which might account for his selective memory , " he wrote . [ 130 ] ”
Rabbi Boteach reported at Beliefnet :
“ I also gave Dr. Dawkins the opportunity to even score by accepting a further debate , at the time and place of his choosing ( within reason , of course ) , to which he has yet to respond . [ 129 ] ”
A video of the debate that Dawkins lost to Rabbi Shmuley Boteach is available at Rabbi Schely Boteach 's website .
A supporter of the Question evolution campaign wrote :
“ We do n't believe a word Richard Dawkins says and for good reason .
For example , he claimed to have never debated Rabbi Schmuley Boteach , but then he had to admit a debate took place as it was videotaped .
According to the student audience , the rabbi won the debate as he convinced more students of the validity of his position concerning the existence of God.
Furthermore , an angry and embarrassed Dawkins then claimed the rabbi shrieked like Adolf Hitler .
Now tell me , how do you forget a debate with a rabbi who supposedly shrieks like Adolf Hitler ?
Obviously , Dawkins exposed himself for the clown and fraud he is . [ 131 ] ”
Richard Dawkins and radio appearances

On February 19 , 2012 The Daily Telegraph reported :
“ ... some critics of Dawkins branded him " an embarrassment to atheism " after what many listeners considered a humiliation in a Radio 4 debate with Giles Fraser , formerly Canon Chancellor of St Paul 's Cathedral , in which the professor boasted he could recite the full title of Charles Darwin 's " The Origin of Species " , then when challenged , dithered and said : " Oh God . " [ 132 ] ”
On February 14 , 2012 , The Daily Telegraph reported regarding the radio debate :
“ Dr. Fraser skewered the atheist campaigner Richard Dawkins so fabulously , so stylishly , and so thoroughly that anti-religion ’s high priest was reduced to incoherent mumbling and spluttering .
[ 133 ] ”
Vox Day wrote concerning the embarrassing incident for Dawkins :
“ As I have said repeatedly , Richard Dawkins is a huge intellectual fraud , and perhaps those who previously expressed incredulity at the idea that I would quite easily trounce the old charlatan in a debate will find it just a bit more credible now .
This behavior is n't an outlier or a momentary lapse of memory , it is entirely characteristic .
The man quite frequently pretends to knowledge that he patently does not possess and assumes he knows things that he obviously does not , which is why he avoids debate with those who are aware of his intellectual pretensions and are capable of exposing them .
It 's bad enough that Dawkins could n't come up with the name of what he considers to be the most important book ever written immediately after claiming he could do so , but in addition to stumbling a little on the subtitle , he even forgot the rather important part of the title that refers to the actual mechanism supposedly responsible ! [ 134 ] ”
( The full title of Charles Darwin 's book is On the The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life and evolutionists rarely cite the book 's full title which is racist .

And it seems to me , truly every theatre of suffering I have ever been to , there is a dauntless nun , priest , clergy or religious person , who is working very selflessly and bravery there for the good of human beings .
But I do n't run into organized atheists who do this .
Richard Dawkins : " Perhaps there is not enough of them . " ...
Scott Simon , NPR : " But I do wonder am I just not seeing the world correctly to see large numbers of well - motivated atheists lending their lives to trying to better the world ...

New Atheism
See also : New Atheism and Causes of the New Atheism movement
The term New Atheism which first appeared in the November 2006 edition of Wired magazine , is used to describe a new incarnation of militant atheism and also frequently applied to a series of six best - selling books by five authors that appeared in the period between 2004 –2008 .
These authors include Richard Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens , Sam Harris , Daniel Dennett and Victor J. Stenger . [ 136 ]
The four most prominent writers of the New Atheist movement are Richard Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens , Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett .
The New Atheism movement was a reaction the September 11 , 2001 attacks on Manhattan and also due to antitheist anger over the failure of the secularization thesis ( the secularization thesis wrongly predicted that religion would fade away and it also did not predict the resurgence of religion in much of the world ) .

Impact of the New Atheism
See also : Desecularization and Decline of the atheist movement
New Atheism has not had much of an impact in terms of gaining new adherents to atheism .
In a March 10 , 2008 USA Today article Stephen Prothero stated the following regarding the impact of the " New Atheism " :
“ Numbers lie , but they also tell tales untrustworthy and otherwise .
So the key question stirring around the much discussed U.S Religious Landscape Survey released in late February by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life is what tale does it state about the state of the union .
For some , the story of this survey , based on interviews in multiple languages with more than 35,000 adults , is the strength of American Religion .
Not too long ago , I wrote that American atheism was going the way of the freak show .
As books by Christopher Hitchens and other " new atheists " climbed the best seller lists , I caught a lot of flak for that prophecy .
But atheist make up only 1.6 % of respondents to this survey .... [ 139 ] ”
YouTube atheist Thunderfoot said about the atheist movement after Reason Rally 2016 had a very low turnout :
“ I 'm not sure there is anything in this movement worth saving .
Hitchens is dead .
Dawkins simply does n't have the energy for this sort of thing anymore .
Harris went his own way .
And Dennett just kind of blended into the background .
So what do you think when the largest gathering of the nonreligious in history pulls in ... I do n't know .
Maybe 2,000 people .
Is there anything worth saving ? [ 140 ] ”
On the other hand , Stephen LeDrew wrote at Oxford University Press 's Academic Insights for the Thinking World website :
“ The ten - year anniversary of the publication of Richard Dawkins ’
The God Delusion is approaching , and it has already been over ten years since Sam Harris published The End of Faith .
Social science in general has not yet fully appreciated the significance of the New Atheism and has tended not to take it very seriously , with the exception of those working in the new sub - discipline of secularity studies .
But whatever one might think of the New Atheists ’ ideas , an honest appraisal would recognize that they have had a significant and lasting impact .
They should be remembered for catalyzing a movement for religious dissent and inspiring atheists to come together and find a voice in American public life .
But there ’s a much darker side to the legacy of the New Atheism that stems from its imperialist and xenophobic tendencies , to say nothing of some thinly veiled Social Darwinism and arguments for eugenics .
Sam Harris in particular is now known more for supporting the Israeli occupation of Palestine and ethnic profiling at airport security than for his science - based critique of religious faith .
Richard Dawkins ’ personal legacy has taken a heavy hit in the past few years , as his rambling criticisms of feminism and Muslim “ barbarians ” on Twitter have led to charges of sexism , racism , and general arrogance and intolerance . [ 141 ] ”
The liberal leaning British newspaper The Guardian said regarding the New Atheism :
“ Anti-faith proselytising is a growth industry .
But its increasingly hysterical flag - bearers are heading for a spectacular failure ...
These increasingly hysterical books may boost the pension , they may be morale boosters for a particular kind of American atheism that feels victimized - the latest candidate in a flourishing American tradition - but one suspects that they are going to do very little to challenge the appeal of a phenomenon they loathe too much to understand . [ 142 ] ”
In 2010 , it was reported that The God Delusion sold 2,086,402 copies and 907,161 of those copies were sold in North America .
Contrastly , in 2010 , the evangelical Christian Rick Warren sold between 25,000,000 to 50,000,000 copies of his book The Purpose Driven Life . [ 143 ]

On November 6 , 2015 , the New Republic published an article entitled , Is the New Atheism dead ? [ 144 ]
In 2015 , the atheist author Joshua Kelly wrote :
“ ... since the death of Hitchens : angry atheism lost its most charismatic champion .
Call it what you like : New Atheism , fire - brand atheism , etc. , had a surge with the Four Horsemen in the middle of the last decade and in the last four years has generally peetered out to a kind that is more docile , politically correct , and even apologetic . [ 145 ] ”

The Australian Conservative recently published an article by Ben-Peter Terpstra entitled Preparing for Richard Dawkins ’ crocodile tears which charges that Richard Dawkins exhibits selective outrage on the issue of child molestation .
In the article Terpstra cites Bendan Oneill who wrote :
“ The New Atheist campaign to have Pope Benedict XVI arrested when he visits Britain later this year exposes the deeply disturbing , authoritarian and even Inquisitorial side to today ’s campaigning secularism ...
In 2006 , Dawkins criticised ‘ hysteria about paedophilia ’ and said that , even though he was the victim of sexual abuse at boarding school , he would defend his abusive former teachers if ‘ 50 years on they had been hounded by vigilantes or lawyers as no better than child murderers ’ .
Yet now he wants to put abusive priests on a par with genocidaires . [ 147 ] ”
Ben-Peter Terpstra writes : " In all truth , Britain ’s clean - shaven atheists are n’t serious about children ’s rights , or they ’d be launching venomous attacks against the United Nations , in light of their more recent sex abuse scandals . "
Concerning Richard Dawkins recent selective outrage on child molestation the Christian apologetics website True Free Thinker writes :
“ His reputation has always been the very same and this Pope related publicity stunt is nothing new .
Moreover , why would he oppose the Pope considering that what the Pope may be complicit in , surely , relates to some gentle pedophiles .
What !
“ Gentle pedophiles ” !!!
Oh , no , no , no ; those are not my words but Richard Dawkins who , indeed , argues that there are gentle pedophiles and that way too much is made of pedophilia at times .
For these reasons and more Robert Fulford ’s referring to Richard Dawkins as a clown is very , very offensive — to clowns .
Clowns are lovable and funny whilst Richard Dawkins is belligerent , arrogant , belittling and shockingly lacking in knowledge with regards to many of the issues that he takes on ( find ample evidence here ) . [ 148 ] ”

Richard Dawkins on homosexuality
For more information please see : Richard Dawkins on homosexuality and Genetics , Homosexuality , Evolutionary Paradigm , and Creation Science and Atheism and homosexuality
Richard Dawkins , who is a liberal , speculates that a " gay gene " causes homosexuality , but science has not discovered such a gene ( see : Causes of homosexuality ) [ 152 ]
In 1993 , Professor Miron Baron , M.D. , the renowned medical researcher and Professor at Columbia University , wrote in BMJ ( British Medical Journal ) that there is a conflict relative to the theory of evolution and the notion of genetic determinism concerning homosexuality .
Dr. Baron wrote " ... from an evolutionary perspective , genetically determined homosexuality would have become extinct long ago because of reduced reproduction . " [ 153 ]
In the United States , liberals are more likely to believe in evolution .
[ 110 ]
Also , in the United States , twice as many liberals as conservatives ( 46 % versus 22 % ) believe people are born homosexual and liberals generally have more favorable opinions about homosexuality .
Given Dr. Miron Baron 's commentary about homosexuality , many American liberals are inconsistent on the issues of evolution and homosexuality .
An individual 's beliefs regarding creation science / creationism and the theory of evolution appear to influence their views on homosexuality .
Creationist scientists and creationist assert that the theory of evolution cannot account for the origin of gender and sexual reproduction .
[ 154 ] [ 155 ]
Creation Ministries International states : " Homosexual acts go against God ’s original design of a man and a woman becoming one flesh — see Genesis 1 and 2 , endorsed by Jesus Himself in Matthew 19:3 –6 . " [ 156 ]
In addition , the vast majority of creation scientists reject the notion of genetic determinism concerning the origin of homosexuality . [ 155 ]

Pitzer College sociologist Phil Zuckerman stated concerning atheism and suicide : " this is the one indicator of societal health in which religious nations fare much better than secular nations . "
Dawkins ' book " The God Delusion " along with a community college biology class , have been linked to the tragic suicide of Jesse Kilgore . [ 158 ]
Kilgore had several discussions with friends and relatives in which he made it clear Dawkins ' book had destroyed his belief in God .
This loss of faith is considered the cause of his suicide which is not surprising given that there is evidence which suggest that atheism can be a causal factor for suicide for some individuals .
[ 159 ] [ 159 ] [ 160 ]
Jesse 's father is quoted as saying " If my son was a professing homosexual , and a professor challenged him to read [ a book called ] ' Preventing Homosexuality ' …
If my son was gay and [ the book ] made him feel bad , hopeless , and he killed himself , and that came out in the press , there would be an outcry .
He would have been a victim of a hate crime and the professor would have been forced to undergo sensitivity training , and there may have even been a wrongful death lawsuit .
But because he 's a Christian , I do n't even get a return telephone call . "

Ben Stein Interview with the evolutionist Richard Dawkins
See also : Ben Stein Interview with Richard Dawkins
In the movie Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , Ben Stein demonstrated the folly of evolutionism in his interview with Richard Dawkins ( A clip of the interview has been uploaded to YouTube ) .
The Discovery Institute provides an transcript of part of the interview along with some commentary :
“ BEN STEIN : " What do you think is the possibility that Intelligent Design might turn out to be the answer to some issues in genetics or in evolution ? "
DAWKINS : " Well , it could come about in the following way .
It could be that at some earlier time , somewhere in the universe , a civilization evolved , probably by some kind of Darwinian means , probably to a very high level of technology , and designed a form of life that they seeded onto perhaps this planet .
Now , um , now that is a possibility , and an intriguing possibility .
And I suppose it 's possible that you might find evidence for that if you look at the details of biochemistry , molecular biology , you might find a signature of some sort of designer . "
Ho , ho !
That is precisely what the Raelians say : Years ago , everybody knew that the earth was flat .
Everybody knew that the sun revolved around the earth .
Today , everybody knows that life on earth is either the result of random evolution or the work of a supernatural God .
Or is it ?
In " Message from the Designers " , Rael presents us with a third option : that all life on earth was created by advanced scientists from another world .
Richard Dawkins and Rael ; " clear thinking " kindred spirits ! [ 162 ] ”
A Christian apologetics website provides some additional commentary on the Ben Stein / Richard Dawkins interview which focuses on Dawkins response to Ben Stein 's questions about the likelihood of the existence of God :
“ In this interview there is the following exchange between Ben Stein and Richard Dawkins .
Mr. Stein prefaces the exchange with this comment : “ Professor Dawkins seemed so convinced that God does n’t exist that I wondered if he would be willing to put a number on it . ”
Here is Professor Dawkins response , “ Well , it ’s hard to put a figure on it , but I ’d put it at something like ninety - nine percent against or something like that . ”
Mr. Stein responded with this question .
“ Well , how do you know it ’s ninety - nine percent ( “ I do n’t , ” Dr. Dawkins interjects . ) and not , say , ninety - seven percent ? ” Dr. Dawkins continues , “ You asked me to put a figure on it and I ’m not comfortable putting a figure on it .
I think it ’s … I just think it ’s very unlikely . ”
“ But you could n’t put a number on it ? , ” Mr. Stein clarifies .
“ No , of course not , ” said Dr. Dawkins .
“ So it could be forty - nine percent ? , ” Mr. Stein asks .
Dr. Dawkins replies , “ Well , it would be … I mean I think it ’s … it ’s … it ’s unlikely , but … but …
I… and it ’s quite far from fifty percent . ”
( He 's very difficult to quote . )
“ How do you know ? , ” Mr. Stein asks .
“ I do n’t know , I mean , I put an argument in the book , ” Dr. Dawkins responds . [ 163 ] ”
Stein expressed surprise in the narration that Richard Dawkins " believe [d ] in intelligent design . " [ 164 ]
Instead of attempting to defend abiogenesis , Dawkins actually suggested directed panspermia — the very thing that Francis Crick once suggested to explain life 's beginnings .
On March 20 , 2008 , Dawkins and colleague P. Z. Myers tried to gain entry to a special preview of the Ben Stein documentary , though no member of the production team had invited them .
Dr. Myers was not allowed in , but Dawkins was .
Accounts vary as to why this was so ; the production team asserts that they decided to grant Dawkins entry on - the - spot because
“ he has handled himself fairly honorably , he is a guest in our country and I had to presume he had flown a long way to see the film . [ 165 ] ”
On the other hand , Myers himself states that he guesses that Richard Dawkins was not recognized .
Richard Dawkins arranged to have a filmed conversation between Richard Dawkins and PZ Myers concerning this incident posted to YouTube [ 166 ]
In it Myers claimed that the production team had full knowledge of his attendance through the online RSVP system and Dawkins claimed that it was an " incredible piece of inept public relations " to " expel " PZ Myers from a film about people being expelled for their views .
Both PZ Myers and Richard Dawkins were featured in the film .

Dinesh D'Souza took Richard Dawkins to task for engaging in historical revisionism when it comes to the atrocities of atheist regimes and declared Dawkins " reveals a complete ignorance of history " .
VIDEO
In a recent interview D'Souza declared :
“ Richard Dawkins argues that at least the atheist regimes did n't kill people in the name of atheism .
Is n't it time for this biologist to get out of the lab and read a little history ?
Marxism and Communism were atheist ideologies .
Stalin and Mao were n't dictators who happened to be atheist ; atheism was part of their official doctrine .
It was no accident , as the Marxists liked to say , that they shut down the churches and persecuted the clergy ... ”
Dinesh D'Souza stated in another interview :
“ As one writer put it , “ Leaders such as Stalin and Mao persecuted religious groups , not in a bid to expand atheism , but as a way of focusing people ’s hatred on those groups to consolidate their own power . ”
Of course I agree that murderous regimes , whether Christian or atheist , are generally seeking to strengthen their position .
But if Christian regimes are held responsible for their crimes committed in the name of Christianity , then atheist regimes should be held accountable for their crimes committed in the name of atheism .
And who can deny that Stalin and Mao , not to mention Pol Pot and a host of others , all committed atrocities in the name of a Communist ideology that was explicitly atheistic ?
Who can dispute that they did their bloody deeds by claiming to be establishing a “ new man ” and a religion - free utopia ?
These were mass murders performed with atheism as a central part of their ideological inspiration , they were not mass murders done by people who simply happened to be atheist . [ 167 ] ”
Karl Marx said " [ Religion ] is the opium of the people " .
Marx also stated : " Communism begins from the outset ( Owen ) with atheism ; but atheism is at first far from being communism ; indeed , that atheism is still mostly an abstraction . " [ 168 ]
Vladimir Lenin wrote : " A Marxist must be a materialist , i. e. , an enemy of religion , but a dialectical materialist , i. e. , one who treats the struggle against religion not in an abstract way , not on the basis of remote , purely theoretical , never varying preaching , but in a concrete way , on the basis of the class struggle which is going on in practice and is educating the masses more and better than anything else could . " [ 169 ]
Dr. R. J. Rummel , professor emeritus of political science at the University of Hawaii , is the scholar who first coined the term democide ( death by government ) .
Dr. R. J. Rummel 's mid estimate concerning the loss of life due to communism is that communism caused the death of approximately 110,286,000 people between 1917 and 1987 .
[ 170 ]
The atheism in communist regimes has been and continues to be militant atheism that has committed various acts of repression including the razing of thousands of religious buildings and the killing , imprisoning , and the oppression of religious leaders and believers ( for details see : communism ) .
In the atheistic and communist Soviet Union , 44 anti religious museums were opened and the largest was the ' The Museum of the History of Religion and Atheism ' in Leningrad ’s Kazan cathedral . [ 171 ]
John Lennox 's discussion with New Atheist Richard Dawkins about the historicity of Jesus
See also : Atheists and historical illiteracy and Historicity of Jesus
John Lennox pointed out to Richard Dawkins that Dawkins claimed in his book The God Delusion that Jesus Christ may have never existed and that Dawkins errantly claimed that ancient historians have some disagreement on whether Jesus existed or not .
After some additional discussion with Dawkins , Dawkins conceded that Jesus existed and said , " I take that back .
Jesus existed " . [ 172 ]
Christian apologist Dr. William Lane Craig is Reported to Have Called Dawkins a Coward
See also : Richard Dawkins and William Lane Craig , Atheism and cowardice and Atheism and Debate
Dr. William Lane Craig is one of Christianity 's leading defenders and many individuals over the years have attempted to arrange a debate between Dr. Craig and Richard Dawkins .
Richard Dawkins has offered various ruses on why he will not debate William Lane Craig , which Dr. Craig supporters have shown were inconsistent and merely a dodge to avoid debating one of Christianity 's strongest advocates . [ 173 ]
Christian apologist Dr. Victor Reppert is the author of C. S. Lewis 's Dangerous Idea : In Defense of the Argument from Reason . [ 174 ]
In 2007 , Dr. Reppert wrote :
“ Bill Craig sent me a newsletter in which he will be debating twice in the UK on " Is God a Delusion " but will not be debating Dawkins himself .
Now that would be the debate to see !
Having seen this , I wrote him saying " Oh drat ! no debate with Dawkins ! "
He responded :
The coward !
He said , " I 've never heard of William Craig .
A debate with him might look good on his resume , but it would n't look good on mine ! " Bill [ 174 ] ”
There was public pressure for Dawkins to debate the Christian philosopher of science and Christian apologist Dr. William Lane Craig . [ 175 ]
For example , currently there is a petition for Richard Dawkins debate William Lane Craig . [ 175 ]
As far as Dawkins and and his comfort level around professional philosophers , the atheist philosopher Massimo Pigliucci wrote :
“ Interestingly , over lunch during one of those days , I experienced Dawkins in what is a rather uncharacteristically humble mood : he confided at our table that he felt a bit intimidated , being surrounded by so many professional philosophers ( he was n’t talking about me , I assure you , but more likely of Dan Dennett and Alex Rosenberg , among others ) .
It was interesting to see that rather unexpected ( from his public appearances ) side of him . [ 176 ] ”
Refusal of Richard Dawkins to Debate Christian apologist Dinesh D'Souza
See also : Richard Dawkins and Dinesh D'Souza , Atheism and Debate and Atheism and cowardice
Christian author Dinesh D'Souza wrote concerning Richard Dawkins refusal to debate him : " To be honest , I find your behavior extremely bizarre .
You go halfway around the world to chase down televangelists to outsmart them in an interview format that you control , but given several opportunities to engage the issues you profess to care about in a true spirit of open debate and inquiry , you duck and dodge and run away . " [ 177 ] D'Souza further wrote concerning Dawkins : " When he is confronted with history , philosophy , and logic , Dawkins seems to have very little to say . " [ 178 ]
Next , D'Souza indicated Dawkins was a " showman who takes on unprepared and unsuspecting opponents when you yourself control the editing , but when a strong opponent shows up you manufacture reasons to avoid him . " [ 177 ]
Lastly , D'Souza wrote : " So why doth Dawkins languish in his corner , attended by sycophants ?
Tremble not , Sir Richard .
' Cowards die many times before their deaths .
The valiant do taste of death but once . ' " [ 179 ]
Dr. Jamie Glazov wrote concerning the refusal of Richard Dawkins to debate Dinesh D'Souza :
“ As many readers can attest , D’Souza has debated Daniel Dennett , Christopher Hitchens , Peter Singer , Michael Shermer , Dan Barker , and other well - known atheists .
He intellectually cut those guys to pieces .
Harris and Dawkins are just afraid to meet D’Souza .
D’Souza writes : “ And my challenges to Dawkins to step into the arena have only met with pathetic rationalization : ‘ Richard is simply too busy and smart to debate you Dinesh . ’
Busy doing what besides being caught with his pants down by Ben Stein ?
And I guess he 's smart because he does n't want to risk further embarrassing himself and destroying his public reputation .
Wo n't it be hilarious if the ‘ party of faith ’ is unafraid of opposing arguments while the ‘ party of reason ’ cannot withstand the arguments of its critics ?
This is what Henry James might describe as a most interesting turning of the screw . ” ”
Richard Dawkins ' public refusal to debate creationists
For more information please see : Richard Dawkins ' public refusal to debate creationists , Atheism and cowardice and Global atheism
[ 180 ] Dr. The Greatest Hoax on Earth which rebuts Richard Dawkins ' recent book The Greatest Show on Earth . [ 180 ]
Recently , a Christian apologist called Richard Dawkins a " cowardly clown " for refusing to debate apt debate challengers such as the creation scientists at Creation Ministries International .
Dr. Jonathan Sarfati recently published the bookwhich rebuts Richard Dawkins ' recent book
Richard Dawkins has publicly declared that he will not debate creationists .
[ 173 ]
Yet , Richard Dawkins debated the theist John Lennox who adheres to the position of intelligent design . [ 173 ]
According to Richard Dawkins , intelligent design is a form of creationism . [ 173 ]
Therefore , Richard Dawkins is not consistent and trustworthy concerning his assertion that he will not debate creationists .
[ 173 ]
Evolutionists and atheists inconsistency concerning debating creationists was commented on by the Christian apologetic website True Free Thinker which declared : " Interestingly enough , having noted that since some atheists refuse to debate “ creationists ” but then go on to debate some of those people but not others , it is clear that they are , in reality , being selective and making excuses for absconding from difficulties ... " [ 181 ]
When Richard Dawkins refused to debate Dr. William Lane Craig one of the ruses Richard Dawkins used was supposedly because Dr. Craig was a creationist and Richard Dawkins claimed he did n't debate creationist .
[ 173 ]
Richard was called on his inconsistency and lack of trustworthiness concerning his excuses for refusing to debate Dr. Craig by the intelligent design advocate Clive Hayden . [ 173 ]
In 2010 , the prominent atheists who attended the 2010 global atheist conference , which included Richard Dawkins , were challenged to a debate by Creation Ministries International . [ 180 ]
Richard Dawkins , PZ Myers and other prominent atheists refused to debate the creation scientists at Creation Ministries International . [ 180 ]
As noted above , generally speaking , creationist scientists tend to win the creation vs. evolution debates ( see : Creation vs. evolution debates ) .
The refusal of Richard Dawkins and other prominent atheists to debate the staff of Creation Ministries International is not surprising given that there are several instances Richard Dawkins avoiding strong debate opponents .
In addition , creationists maintain that Richard Dawkins did not give a particularly strong showing at the Huxley Memorial Debate .
One of the more embarrassing debates ( particular the events surrounding the debate ) was the case of Richard Dawkins losing a video taped debate to Rabbi Boteach according to the college audience . [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
After the debate , Richard Dawkins denied the debate ever took place and Rabbi Boteach provided the video taped evidence that the debate did take place . [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
Mr. Dawkins has declined to debate Rabbit Shmuley Boteach another time . [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
Incidentally , Paul Humber notes there was a deception that occurred during email correspondence with Mr. Dawkins concerning the tally of vote counts that occurred for the Oxford debate between creation scientists Professor A.E. Wilder - Smith and Professor Edgar Andrews and evolutionists Richard Dawkins and John Maynard Smith ( see : Huxley Memorial Debate ) [ 182 ]
Mr. Humber did not indicate whether Mr. Dawkins committed the deception or was merely duped by someone who provided an altered account . [ 182 ]
The website True Free Thinker declared concerning the refusal of Richard Dawkins , PZ Myers and other prominent atheists to debate the creation scientists and other staff at Creation Ministries International :
“ In keeping with his constant attention getting shenanigans and his equally constant absconding from debating apt challengers via a barrage of illogical and excuses , the moniker of cowardly clown fits Richard Dawkins more than ever ( see Send in the Clowns – Richard Dawkins Obliges ) .
Enter Jonathan Sarfati ( PhD in chemistry ) , senior scientist at Creation Ministries International , who recently published the book “ The Greatest Hoax on Earth ?
Refuting Dawkins on Evolution . ”
Interestingly , Jonathan Sarfati sought to publish the book by the time that the 2010 Global Atheist Convention — billed as “ The Rise of Atheism ” — of March 12 – 14 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Center in Australia .
The most intelligent , well informed and vociferous atheists in the world , including Richard Dawkins , Dan Barker , PZ Myers , et al , were challenged to debate while their worldwide choir was gathered in one place and yet , one by one they each found excuses to cower from debate even whilst proclaiming to their adherents the intellectual superiority of atheism . [ 180 ] ”
Richard Dawkins excuses for not debating creationists
Richard Dawkins has offered some unjustifiable ruses for not not wanting to debate creationists but the true reason is that he knows he will lose the debates .
There are certainly reputable scientists , medical doctors and members of the public who hold the evolutionary paradigm in low esteem for valid reasons so Dawkins excuses for refusing to debate creationists simply have little to no weight and they are certainly not the best explanation for Mr. Dawkins ' behavior in this matter .
In 2007 , " Discovery Institute 's Center for Science and Culture today announced that over 700 scientists from around the world have now signed a statement expressing their skepticism about the contemporary theory of Darwinian evolution . " [ 183 ]
In addition , given that atheism is held in low esteem in many parts of the world and it is a minority position worldwide , Dawkins ' refusal to debate strong theistic debaters is quite odd given his allegation that he does n't debate creationists because he does n't want to give them respectability and publicity .
Furthermore , the Rabbi Boteach debate and the events surrounding it , shows the great lengths that Dawkins will go to avoid letting the public know about a debate loss to a theist ( As mentioned previously Dawkins lost his video taped debate to Rabbi Boteach and then claimed the debate never took place ) .
The reason why Dawkins refuses to debate creation scientists is that generally speaking , creation scientists tend to win the creation vs. evolution debates .
Opposition to Creationism and Religion
Professor Dawkins ' anti-religious views are based on two subjective opinions .
The first is that religious faith is irrational , the second is that religion causes wars and hatred , or as he puts it , ' Religion makes good people bad ' .
Richard Dawkins is a writer and media commentator on the debate between evolution and the opposing positions of creation science and intelligent design . [ 184 ] [ 185 ]
He is an ardent proponent of the evolutionary view of life in works targeted at the general public , such as his books entitled The Selfish Gene and The Ancestor 's Tale .
However , his efforts to promote the theory of evolution have not been very successful , and even in his native land of the UK , 40 % of the population believes that creationism or intelligent design should be taught in the school science curriculum . [ 186 ]
Lord Robert Winston stated Richard Dawkins is bringing science " into disrepute " .
As an evolutionist , Dawkins holds Charles Darwin 's view that " the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is , at bottom , no design , no purpose , no evil , no good , nothing but blind , pitiless indifference . "
In addition , he often comes across as having a mocking attitude towards religion . [ 187 ]
He stridently [ 188 ] opposes the traditional role of religion in educational institutions and in society in general .
[ 189 ]
Dawkins has derided belief in God as a " mind- virus " , [ 190 ] which is infectious and harmful to society .
In his 2006 book The God Delusion , he states his belief that fundamentalist religion " subverts science and saps the intellect , " a view that is contrary to the fact that many of the most productive scientists , from Isaac Newton to Louis Pasteur , were devout Christians .
The foundation of modern science was largely established by those who held a Christian worldview .
Dawkins often says that these men were rather a product of their time and , like many that came before them , lived in fear of persecution by Christians .
There is no substantive evidence for this .
Dawkins also cites in his book , the God Delusion , that not one winner of the Nobel Prize for Science is a theist .
While this has been openly debated , he cites his own personal relationships with many of these scientists .
Lord Robert Winston is a prominent scientist and British doctor who served as the President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science from 2004 to 2005 .
[ 191 ]
Currently , Lord Winston serves as Emeritus Professor of Fertility Studies at Imperial College in Britain .
In 2006 , Winston launched a broadside against Richard Dawkins and stated that he is bringing science " into disrepute " due to his refusal to " connect with spirituality " .
Winston also stated that Dawkins " sometimes does n't seem to understand the limitations of science . "
Alister McGrath , a Christian theologian who has a background in biophysics and is Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University , wrote :
“ Richard Dawkins ’ latest book The God Delusion fires off a series of salvos against religion .
It is perhaps his weakest book to date , marred by its excessive reliance on bold assertion and rhetorical flourish , where the issues so clearly demand careful reflection and painstaking analysis , based on the best evidence available . ”
Atheist philosopher Michael Ruse echoes McGrath 's estimation of The God Delusion and recently stated that the book makes him embarrassed to be an atheist .
Professor McGrath asserts that the aggressive rhetoric of Dawkins ' works is merely a mask to cover a deep insecurity about the public credibility of atheism .
McGrath recently wrote a book opposing the atheist ideology of Dawkins entitled The Dawkins Delusion ? : Atheist Fundamentalism and the Denial of the Divine . [ 192 ]
Richard Dawkins and the Huxley Memorial Debate
For more information please see : Huxley Memorial Debate
The September 2005 issue of Discover magazine had an article on Richard Dawkins entitled " Darwin ’s Rottweiler " .
[ 193 ]
The title is an allusion to Thomas Henry Huxley who became to be known as " Darwin 's Bulldog " .
[ 194 ]
Huxley is arguably most well known for his debate with Bishop Samuel Wilberforce over the theory of evolution , and evolutionists and creationist dispute whether or not a key claimed event in the debate actually occurred .
[ 195 ]
The Discover article stated the following :
“ Dawkins has become “ Darwin ’s rottweiler ” — as Alister McGrath , an Oxford theologian , reminded readers of his recent book , Dawkins ' God : Genes , Memes , and the Meaning of Life — so intent on prevailing in intellectual combat that he alienates others and undermines the dazzling quality of his argumentative skills . " [ 193 ] ”
The Simonyi Professorship Home Page promotes the idea that Richard Dawkins is " Darwin 's Rottweiler " and has an article published in the Seattle newspaper EastSideweek which states the following :
“ ... Thomas Henry Huxley , earned the nickname " Darwin's bulldog " from his fellow Victorians .
In our own less decorous day , Dawkins deserves an even stronger epithet : " Darwin 's Rottweiler , perhaps , " Simonyi suggests .
Now , thanks to Simonyi's gift of £ 1.5 million sterling to England 's venerable Oxford University , the Rottweiler is unleashed . " ”
Dr. Arthur Ernest Wilder - Smith
Now given that Thomas Henry Huxley 's is arguably most well known for his debate over the theory of evolution and given that Dawkins has stated he will no longer debate a creation scientists the title of " Darwin 's Rottweiler " can certainly be disputed .
