It was a different kind of road rage .
Brendan Pemberton , 42 , of Tyngsborough , had just learned he owed $ 165 for a 20 - year - old speeding ticket that resulted in his license getting suspended .
So he took out his frustrations on a towering statue of Moses in Worcester District Court on Thursday , police said , knocking the 148 - year - old sculpture off its pedestal and sending it crashing to the floor .
State Trooper James B. Ellis , who was standing 15 feet from the statue and dressed in full uniform at the time , said Pemberton walked over to the 8 - foot sculpture and angrily shoved it a couple of times .
" He was in a rage and really lost control , " Ellis said .
" It went right over . "
Pemberton now faces much bigger problems than a speeding ticket and a suspended license .
He was charged with malicious destruction of property , disturbing the peace , and being a disorderly person .
At his arraignment yesterday , a judge ordered Pemberton held on $ 10,000 bail and sent to Worcester State Hospital for a competency evaluation .
He could not be reached yesterday .
The statue had recently undergone $ 20,000 in renovations , according to court officials , in preparation for its new home in the city 's new $ 180 million justice center downtown .
For decades , the Moses statue , a replica of the Michelangelo sculpture that sits in a Roman basilica , was a fixture in the city 's old Main Street courthouse , where it sat in an unobtrusive alcove in the courthouse lobby .
In dire need of a cleaning and overall restoration , the Worcester Law Library paid to have the work done and had it reinstalled in the new courthouse just a few weeks ago .
Yesterday lawyers said the statue has always marked a meeting spot , with lawyers telling colleagues or clients to meet " at Moses . "
Edward W. McIntyre , Massachusetts Bar Association president , said he has worked in the Worcester courts since 1981 and " grew up with Moses . "
" I 'm very aggrieved , " he said .
" It 's an icon , and in a careless moment it 's gone . "
The crash happened shortly after noon .
Steven Power , a Worcester lawyer , said he was in the clerk 's office when Pemberton was told by the clerk that she could do nothing about his old speeding ticket .
Mary Carpenter , the office manager at the clerk 's office , said yesterday that the ticket was from a speeding infraction in 1989 , when Pemberton had been ticketed for driving at 75 miles per hour on the Mass Pike at a time when the speed limit was 55 miles per hour .
Power said the clerk told Pemberton he would need to resolve the ticket at the Registry of Motor Vehicles .
Pemberton did not take this news well .
" He pulled some of the paperwork out of her hand , and stormed out of the office , " Power said .
" The next thing I know some of the court officers are running out of the room . "
The court sees its share of upset customers and , Power said , Pemberton just seemed like " another disgruntled person . "
" I do n't think anybody would have expected he would have done that , " Power said .
Ellis said he and the others were stunned to see Pemberton cross the roped - off area around the statue and give Moses a couple of shoves at the waist .
When the statue fell , he said , it was " a little surreal . "
Ellis said a thud - like sound reverberated through the large foyer of the courthouse as the statue fell on its back and cracked .
Pemberton also watched as the giant crashed .
Ellis stood with Pemberton until Worcester police officers came and took him into custody .
It was unclear yesterday why Pemberton went to court to take care of the ticket after so long .
The Telegram & Gazette reported yesterday that Pemberton had also allegedly threatened to throw acid on artwork at the Worcester Art Museum as police arrested him .
The original speeding ticket was for $ 150 , plus $ 15 in court costs and fees after 20 years , Carpenter said .
Speeding tickets are typically not subject to a statute of limitations because the driver is charged and notified at the time of the infraction , according to Robert A. George , a Boston lawyer .
" It 's only when you are [ not charged ] that the statute of limitations applies , " he said .
Yesterday , courthouse staff mourned the toppled sculpture .
Carpenter and others said they were surprised to see that the statue was hollow on the inside .
Carpenter , who has worked in the city 's courts for 30 years , said she had thought that it was made of marble or granite because it looked extremely heavy .
Seeing Moses in pieces on the ground and covered with a sheet made her feel like there had been a death in the workplace .
" They have n't lifted him , " she said , heaving a deep sigh .
" I suppose anything 's fixable .
I just do n't know if anybody has the money to do it again . "

Boston police arrested a Boston University medical student yesterday in the slaying of a New York woman at a luxury Back Bay hotel last week and an earlier attack on another woman .
Both victims had advertised personal services on Craigslist .
After an intensive manhunt along the Eastern Seaboard , Philip Markoff , 22 , of Quincy , was stopped by police around 4 p.m. while driving south on Interstate 95 in Walpole , Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis said at a press conference last night at police headquarters .
The second - year medical student was charged with fatally shooting 26 - year - old Julissa Brisman April 14 at the Marriott Copley Hotel and with the armed robbery and kidnapping of a prostitute who was tied up at the Westin Copley in the Back Bay on April 10 .
Brisman had advertised her masseuse service on Craigslist ; the second victim was a prostitute who advertised through the online classified website .
" We are very , very happy to have this man off the streets in a timely way , " Davis said .
The arrest was made in two crimes whose brazen nature and swanky locale shocked Boston residents , drew national attention , and exposed the seamy world of prostitution fostered by the anonymity of the Internet .
Police in Warwick , R.I. , would not comment last night on whether Markoff is a suspect in a similar attack that occurred in a hotel there Thursday .
Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley called Markoff " a predator " who may have attacked other women he met through similar Craigslist ads .
" There may be other victims out there with a similar MO , a Craigslist MO , and if there are , we want to help you , " Conley said at the news conference .
Authorities arrested Markoff following what Davis called a round - the - clock investigation that relied on forensic evidence including fingerprints , electronic evidence , and photographs of the suspect taken by hotel surveillance cameras .
Federal and state investigators and police from Massachusetts and Rhode Island " followed high - tech leads and used old - fashioned shoe leather , " Conley said .
Ellen Berlin , chief spokeswoman for the Boston University School of Medicine , said Markoff has been suspended because of the criminal charges .
He is one of more than 600 medical students on the school 's South End campus and was featured grinning broadly in a 2007 Globe photograph as he showed off his white medical coat with other students at the school 's annual White Coat Day ceremony .
One medical school colleague recalled meeting Markoff at orientation and studying anatomy with him .
She said , " He seemed like a nice guy , and he was a helpful , smart kid . "
Markoff is engaged to be married and attended the State University of New York at Albany before entering medical school , according to two law enforcement officials .
NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
The tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson has led her husband , Liam Neeson , to set aside his career , at least for the moment .
Projects for Neeson , who left the Toronto set of the Atom Egoyan marital drama “ Chloe ” to be by his wife ’s side after she suffered a head injury while skiing Monday , are understandably on hold .
Neeson has been experiencing a career resurgence after the success of his most recent film , “ Taken . ” 20th Century Fox ’s modestly budgeted thriller was a surprise hit in February , earning a whopping $ 200 million at the worldwide box office .
On the heels of “ Taken , ” the actor has been under consideration for “ Unknown White Male , ” an international thriller that Joel Silver ’s Dark Castle is producing for Warner Bros .
As the title character , Neeson would play a doctor visiting Berlin who suffers an injury that leads to a coma .
When the doctor awakens , he finds he has been replaced by another man and then sets off on a quest to discover the truth .
But given the unfortunate parallel between the protagonist ’s story line and the circumstances of Richardson ’s accident , it remains to be seen whether the project will proceed in its current incarnation .
The immediate prospects of other projects Neeson has been weighing are uncertain as well .
Of most imminent concern among his films is the work - in - progress “ Chloe . ”
Playing opposite Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried , Neeson depicts a man whose wife suspects him of cheating .
The film began shooting in February , but it is not clear how much of Neeson ’s scenes had been shot or how a hiatus might affect production .
The Northern Irish actor has long been attached to “ Lincoln , ” a historical feature that Steven Spielberg has been developing about the 16th president during the Civil War .
The project was not expected to begin production soon , but Neeson ’s uncertain status could further cloud its fate .
Even if he opts not to jump back into work , Neeson has completed several films that could be released in the coming year .
He stars as a former Irish Republican Army rebel seeking forgiveness in Oliver Hirschbiegel ’s drama “ Five Minutes of Heaven , ” which recently played the Sundance Film Festival but has not yet sold to a distributor .
In the indie horror film “ After . Life , ” he plays an ominous funeral director .
The Plum Pictures production recently wrapped and does not yet have American distribution .
Tragic events in the personal lives of stars have tended to place actors ’ careers on temporary , but not permanent , hiatus .
When Mark Ruffalo lost his brother late last year in a shooting , for instance , his directorial debut , “ Sympathy for Delicious , ” was thrown into question before it got back on track at the end of January .
Introduction to the Archaean 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago
If you were able to travel back to visit the Earth during the Archaean , you would likely not recognize it is the same planet we inhabit today .
The atmosphere was very different from what we breathe today ; at that time , it was likely a reducing atmosphere of methane , ammonia , and other gases which would be toxic to most life on our planet today .
Also during this time , the Earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form .
It was early in the Archaean that life first appeared on Earth .
Our oldest fossils date to roughly 3.5 billion years ago , and consist of bacteria microfossils .
In fact , all life during the more than one billion years of the Archaean was bacterial .
At right is an artist 's depiction of what an Archaean coast might have looked like 3.5 billion years ago .
The mounds in the foreground are stromatolites , colonies of photosynthetic bacteria which have been found as fossils in Early Archaean rocks of South Africa and Western Australia .
Stromatolites increased in abundance throughout the Archaean , but began to decline during the Proterozoic .
They are not common today .
Subdivisions of the
Archaean :
The chart at left shows the three major subdivisions of the Archaean .
These divisions are somewhat arbitrary , and we have not attempted to prepare exhibits on each of them .
Dates and divisions follow those of Schopf ( 1983 ) .
The Archaean occurs between the Hadean and the Proterozoic .

Planetary geologists at Brown University have found a gully fan system on Mars that formed about 1.25 million years ago .
The fan offers compelling evidence that it was formed by melt water that originated in nearby snow and ice deposits and may stand as the most recent period when water flowed on the planet .
Gullies are known to be young surface features on Mars .
But scientists studying the planet have struggled with locating gullies they can conclusively date .
In a paper that appears on the cover of the March issue of Geology , the Brown geologists were able to date the gully system and hypothesize what water was doing there .
The gully system shows four intervals where water - borne sediments were carried down the steep slopes of nearby alcoves and deposited in alluvial fans , said Samuel Schon , a Brown graduate student and the paper 's lead author .
" You never end up with a pond that you can put goldfish in , " Schon said , " but you have transient melt water .
You had ice that typically sublimates .
But in these instances it melted , transported , and deposited sediment in the fan .
It did n't last long , but it happened . "
The finding comes on the heels of discoveries of water - bearing minerals such as opals and carbonates , the latter of which was announced by Brown graduate student Bethany Ehlmann in a paper in Science in December .
Those discoveries build on evidence that Mars was occasionally wet far longer than many had believed , and that the planet may have hosted a warm , wet environment in some places during its long history .
However , the finding of a gully system , even an isolated one , that supported running water as recently as 1.25 million years ago greatly extends the time that water may have been active on Mars .
It also adds to evidence of a recent ice age on the planet when polar ice is believed to have been transported towards the equator and settled in mid-latitude deposits , said James Head III , professor of geological sciences at Brown , who first approximated the span of the martian ice age in a Nature paper in 2003 .

" We think there was recent water on Mars , " said Head , who with Brown postdoctoral researcher Caleb Fassett is a contributing author on the paper .
" This is a big step in the direction to proving that . "
The gully system is located on the inside of a crater in Promethei Terra , an area of cratered highlands in the southern mid-latitudes .
The eastern and western channels of the gully each run less than a kilometer from their alcove sources to the fan deposit .
Viewed from afar , the fan appears as one entity several hundred meters wide .
But by zooming in with the HiRISE camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , Schon was able to distinguish four individual lobes in the fan , and determine that each lobe was deposited separately .
Moreover , Schon was able to identify the oldest lobe , because it was pockmarked with small craters , while the other lobes were unblemished , meaning they had to be younger .
Next came the task of trying to date the secondary craters in the fan .
Schon linked the craters on the oldest lobe to a rayed crater more than 80 kilometers to the southwest .
Using well - established techniques , Schon dated the rayed crater at about 1.25 million years , and so established a maximum age for the younger , superimposed lobes of the fan .
The team determined that ice and snow deposits formed in the alcoves at a time when Mars had a high obliquity ( its most recent ice age ) and ice was accumulating in the mid-latitude regions .
Sometime around a half - million years ago , the planet 's obliquity changed , and the ice in the mid-latitudes began to melt or , in most instances , changed directly to vapor .
Mars has been in a low - obliquity cycle ever since , which explains why no exposed ice has been found beyond the poles .
The team tested other theories of what the water may have been doing in the gully system .
The scientists ruled out groundwater bubbling to the surface , Schon said , because it seemed unlikely to have occurred multiple times in the planet 's recent history .
They also do n't think the gullies were formed by dry mass wasting , a process by which a slope fails as in a rockslide .
The best explanation , Schon said , was the melting of snow and ice deposits that created " modest " flows and formed the fan .
NASA funded the research .
This is pretty sick as far as Republican scandals go .
A wide - ranging investigation has been launched into allegations that a well - known Pueblo resident has molested many boys over the years , including most recently when he was the manager for Sen.
John McCain 's presidential - campaign office in Pueblo .
Under investigation is Jeffrey Claude Bartleson , 52 , who was arrested Jan. 29 and then re-arrested Wednesday after a campaign worker in the McCain office told police she believed Bartleson molested one of her sons .
{snip}
According to the woman , she and a co-worker were planning in October to attend a Sarah Palin rally in Colorado Springs but wanted to travel to the Springs the night before .
She told police that she mentioned the planned trip to Bartleson .
He offered to keep her 5 - year - old son overnight in Pueblo and then drive up to Colorado Springs the next day and meet them there .
She accepted Bartleson 's offer .
The woman said that her son told her that while at Bartleson 's home , Bartleson insisted on giving him a bath , during which he was sexually molested .
Later , said the child , Bartleson forced him into Bartleson 's bed , where he once again was molested .
In interviews this week with investigators , the child said that when he tried to get away from Bartleson , he kept pulling him back into the bed .
He was finally able to leave when Bartleson fell asleep .
No Toilet !
No Bride !
In the northern Indian state of Haryana , courtship is generally intricate business , but the mothers of the brides - to - be have simplified matters by clearing stating to potential grooms : “ If you do n’t have a toilet , you can not marry my daughter . ”
The slogan , which is a bit longer in Hindi and specifically reads : “ If you do n’t have a proper lavatory in your house , do n’t even think about marrying my daughter , ” has been plastered all across villages as part of a campaign to increase the number of available facilities .
The chronic shortage of proper plumbing is ironic in a region of the country where more households have TV sets than toilets .
Believe it or not , it is estimated that in India more than 660 million people still defecate in the open , causing a myriad of medical conditions ranging from diarrhea to polio .
With 8 % more men than women , the fairer sex in India have become more vocal about expressing their resentment at having to relieve themselves outside , giving brides more leverage in pre-marital bargaining .
“ Women suffer the most from this situation .
They must go outside and they have to do so before sunrise or after nightfall so they ca n’t be seen , ” said Bindeshwar Pathak , founder of Sulabh , a company that has built toilets for ten million Indians , and the recipient of this year ’s Stockholm Water Prize for developing eco-friendly lavatories to improve public health .
The campaign has yielded very positive results .
About 1.4 million lavatories have been built in the state since 2005 , many of them with significant government subsidies .
“ We have more toilets , less shame among women and less disease , ” said S.K. Monda , the official in charge of the program .
There are still those who fight progress , as some upper - caste communities are not happy having lavatories in their homes because it is believed such an arrangement is unclean .

A jetliner carrying more than 225 people slammed its tail into the runway during take - off from Australia because someone programmed the wrong weight for the plane into a flight computer , investigators said today .
No one was hurt when the Emirates airline 's Airbus A340 scraped its tail taking off from the southern city of Melbourne on March 20 , damaging the plane and runway and causing smoke to enter the cabin .
The plane dumped its fuel at sea then returned to Melbourne for an emergency landing .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a preliminary report that the weight of the plane entered into a computer used to calculate how much thrust was needed for a safe takeoff was too light by 100 metric tons ( 112 U.S. tons ) .
The result was some tense moments in the cockpit as the pilots realized they had not given the plane enough power to get off the ground .
As the plane reached takeoff speed , the captain called for his co-pilot to begin liftoff , but the plane 's nose did not rise off the ground , the bureau said .
With the end of the runway approaching , the captain again called for liftoff and the co-pilot tried again — this time succeeding in raising the nose but leaving the tail dragging on the ground .
The tail ripped out at least one runway light , and a flight data recorder at the rear of the plane was dislodged .
The captain then pushed the thrust levers to the maximum setting , the engines roared and the plane finally took off .
The bureau said Emirates had informed it that the airline was reviewing human factors , training , procedures and hardware and software aboard its planes in response to the incident .
Old Memories About Trisecting Angles
This is just some remembering .
When I was in middle school ( about 12 or 13 years old ) , I was convinced I could find a way to trisect an angle .
Of course , this is known to be impossible , by an argument that I now ( but did n’t , at the time ) understand .
That did n’t stop me from trying , though .
Here ’s the construction I spent most of my time on :
I started out with an angle , which is the two outermost lines on the given drawing .
Using the compass , I marked off points equally far along the sides .
I then constructed their midpoint .
Then I drew three overlapping circles centered at those three points , as shown .
The intersection points of these circles furthest from the vertex of the angle were used to draw my “ trisecting ” lines .
Of course , this does n’t really trisect an angle , since it ’s a construction with a compass and straight edge , and no such construction can possibly trisect an angle .
But if you did n’t know that , there are a few sanity checks you might perform .
Does it appears to work ?
Yes , it does , as it turns out .
In fact , I performed this construction fifty or sixty times , and measured the result with a protractor .
Each time , it was close enough to trisected that I chalked up the difference to human error .
( Having just performed the construction now using the Kig software , to capture the image above , I can now see that the result is visibly off for extremely small angles ; but of course these are the ones that I was least able to check without reasonable computer software at the time . )
Does it work for cases that are easily calculated ?
Yes !
A few easy examples :
If you start with a 180 degree angle , you get back 60 degree angles … perfectly trisected .
A zero - degree angle is vacuously correct .
It ’s a slightly more involved argument , but the construction also trisects a 90 degree angle correctly .
At this point , one ca n’t be blamed for getting a little excited .
We have a construction that gives a division of an angle into three parts .
The parts always seem to look equal , and are always close enough to be within reasonable measurement error .
It works for the cases we ’ve checked so far .
One ca n’t be blamed for shifting gears a little here , gaining a little confidence , and looking a little less for a counter - example , and a little more for a proof .
Of course , those familiar with the impossibility of this task will be looking for the case where we start with a 60 degree angle .
And , of course , it turns out not to work .
In particular , the “ trisected ” angle works out to about 19.1066 degrees .
Close , but not quite .
So what am I really constructing ?
Well , something pretty ugly .
I ’m leaving out the math ( basically , just pick out a couple triangles , and apply known triangle relations such as the law of sines and thelaw of cosines ) , but , the answer in Maxima notation ( and simplified as best as Maxima can ) is - asin ( ( sin( ( 3* % theta -5*% pi)/6 ) * abs( sin( % theta/2 ) ) ) / sqrt(-2*sin( % theta/2 ) * cos ( ( 3*% theta-5*% pi)/6 ) + sin ( % theta/2) ^2+1 ) ) .
Yeah , wow .
But how could we have fooled ourselves into thinking that mass of complicated stuff is actually theta / 3 ? Well , take a look at Maxima ’s plot of this angle versus theta ( that starting angle ) :
Ifthe construction were correct , that graph would be a straight line passing through ( 3,1 ) .
As it turns out , it may be somewhat difficult to tell the difference in this graph !
So while this construction is wrong , it ’s also remarkably close .

Today 's episode of Boing Boing video is an excerpt from OUTLAWED , a film produced by WITNESS , in partnership with more than a dozen other human rights groups around the world .
The future of the prison at Guantánamo Bay , and of the men held there , has been at the top of the news this week — President Obama has ordered the facility closed , one released detainee has now become the head of Al Qaeda in Yemen , and some around the world are calling for war crimes tribunals to be held over the torture some prisoners survived during rendition .
In this Boing Boing video episode , we are introduced to Binyam Ahmed Mohamed , an Ethiopian man in his thirties ( ACLU bio and a detailed report about his case here ) .
Mr. Mohamed survived extraordinary rendition , secret detention , and torture by the U.S. government working with various other governments worldwide .
The story of what he endured , which included horrific sexual violence during interrogation , was painful for us to watch in the studio , when we were editing this preview piece .
But all of us on the BB Video team felt like this was an incredibly important story for the world to hear , and we were grateful for the ability to draw greater attention to the story at this time .
Speaking on my own behalf here :
What happens with Guantánamo and the legal process surrounding the men still held there should matter to each person who reads this blog post .
The safety of our nation does not require us to abandon universally - recognized principles of human rights .
Torture and disappearances do not make America more secure .
Paraphrasing what one person from WITNESS told us in email — if more Americans realized they live in a nation where , on a street corner in the town where you live , any one of us could be picked up , pushed into an unmarked van , then moved around detention centers all over the world , tortured , without a charge or a word to your family , surely there would be more outcry .
OUTLAWED was produced around the time when the Council of Europe issued a report on the topic of extraordinary rendition and torture involving America 's " War on Terror . "
To document why those issues matter , WITNESS created a coalition with a number of US human rights and social justice ' project partners ' such as Amnesty and the ACLU to distribute the video .
Mr. Mohamed is still being held at Guantánamo Bay .
After the jump , a note with which we updated this BB video episode .

UPDATE , January 23 , 2009 :
In a declassified note to his lawyers dated Dec. 29 , 2008
but only released by US officials this week , Mohamed says :
It has come to my attention through several reliable
sources that my release from Guantanamo to the
UK had been ordered several weeks ago .
It is a cruel tactic of delay to suspend my travel till
the last days of this [ Bush ] administration
while I should have been home a long time ago . "
Mohamed 's lawyers said they are concerned for his health .
He has been on a hunger strike over his continued
detention for more than four weeks .
Britain has formally requested Mohammed 's release ,
The U.S. has so far declined , " due to security concerns .
Keira Knightley In Never Let Me Go – First Look
Then , Bill asked me :
Bruce , can you explain what you found when you started looking into Sarah Palin ’s religious background and affiliations ?
Well , to begin with we found talk of miracle healing and raising of the dead .
But that 's the outer , trivial mystery .
[ If you like this story you can recommend it on Digg : here and here .
Thanks for your support . ]
Miracle healing ?
Raising the dead ? -
Those are among the practices promoted at Sarah Palin 's key church , the Wasilla Assembly of God .
And , during the 2008 election , video surfaced showing a late 2005 ceremony from the church in which Kenyan evangelist Bishop Thomas Muthee blessed Sarah Palin against " every form of witchcraft . "
Witchcraft ?
It sounded a bit weird or perhaps medieval .
And , why had the African evangelist traveled to Alaska in the first place ?
Mainstream media did n't think to ask .
Over the course of September and October 2008 , I was one of a tiny group of writers who correctly identified the highly distinctive nature of Sarah Palin 's Third Wave and New Apostolic Christianity .
At the web site I co-founded in late 2005 with journalist Frederick Clarkson can be found over 20 unique stories and a score of short video documentaries including a 36 page report ( link to PDF of report ) concerning Sarah Palin 's churches and her religious associations .
In my new piece , Fighting Demons , Raising the Dead , Taking Over the World , published by Religion Dispatches , I describe Sarah Palin 's strange new Christianity , which is rapidly becoming the face of the new , globalizing Christian right .
[ Below : Thomas Muthee proposes Christian takeover of seven key sectors of society , then anoints Sarah Palin .
Meet the New Apostolics .
They 're coming your way . ]
Sarah Palin is in the same radical new stream of Christianity as is Ted Haggard .
As I wrote in my Religion Dispatches story ,
In 1996 a team from Ted Haggard ’s New Life Church flew to Mali and began furtively anointing entire towns with cooking oil .
The strangeness of it gripped Dutch missionary René Holvast , who later wrote : " It was confusing and produced a growing uneasiness .
It did not seem to fit our current evangelical theological and anthropological textbooks . "
The team from Haggard ’s church was a forerunner in a missionary wave that has washed over the world since the early 1990s , bringing what Holvast calls a ‘ new paradigm . ’
René Holvast has theological training , but his perplexed reaction was similar to that of Alix Spiegel , a radio journalist who went to Ted Haggard ’s New Life Church in 1997 to do a story for This American Life .
As I told Bill Berkowitz , for an interview entitled
The New Christianity : What the Mainstream Media Has Missed that 's also just appeared in Religion Dispatches ,
Sarah Palin is , broadly speaking , in the emerging postdenominational movement , which by 2000 encompassed 385 million Christians and is vastly different from the faith as it has been practiced in recent centuries .
We identified Palin as in a majority tendency of postdenominationalism known as the neocharismatic movement , or the " Third Wave . "
Evangelical missionary reference work World Christian Trends calls the Third Wave " a new and disturbingly different " kind of Christianity whose members " can accurately be called radical Christians with some pentecostal / charismatic parallels " and which has , as one of the distinctive characteristics of Third Wave Christian ministry , a heavy emphasis on healing miracles including raising the dead — an emphasis promoted from the pulpit in sermons at Palin ’s most central church , the Wasilla Assembly of God .
We also found extensive evidence that Palin is in a religious movement founded in 2001 that has coalesced out of Third Wave Christianity ; the New Apostolic Reformation ( NAR ) .
The NAR is bent on radically reinventing Christianity , and is fast becoming the vanguard of the global Christian Right .
As I 'll be describing in upcoming Religion Dispatches installments , Sarah Palin 's novel new Christianity is rapidly moving to achieve dominance in the GOP , but few Democrats appear aware that Palin 's rapidly growing new Christianity even exists .
Because of that , there exists the danger that the Democratic Party will be blindsided in the 2012 presidential election , as the New Apostolic Reformation / Third Wave Christianity gambit - of peeling away ethnic constituencies that have traditionally voted for the Democratic Party - comes into play .
****
One mainstream media journalist did , however get it : Laurie Goodstein .
In her Ocotber 25 , 2008 NYT story titled October 25 , 2008 .
YouTube Videos Draw Attention to Palin's Faith , Goodstein quoted me , ' Bruce Wilson , a researcher for Talk2Action , a Web site that tracks religious groups , said : " One of the imperatives of the movement is to achieve worldly power , including political control .
Then you can more effectively drive out the demons .
The ultimate goal is to purify the earth . "
'
Goodstein accurately pegged the nature of Palin 's religious associations : " Ms. Palin has had long associations with religious leaders who practice a particularly assertive and urgent brand of Pentecostalism known as " spiritual warfare . "
Its adherents believe that demonic forces can colonize specific geographic areas and individuals , and that " spiritual warriors " must " battle " them to assert God ’s control , using prayer and evangelism .
The movement ’s fixation on demons , its aggressiveness and its leaders ’ claims to exalted spiritual authority have troubled even some Pentecostal Christians .
Ms. Palin delivered an enthusiastic graduation speech for a class of young spiritual warriors in June at the Wasilla Assembly of God , the church in which she was raised . "

We ’d all love to hear that we ’re gods .
That way , we can choose what we want , and we ’re immune to consequences in reality .
As mortals , instead we not only face consequences , but suffer under them .
If we guessed wrong about how the world was going to respond to us , we get screwed .
Even worse , our fellow enlightened monkeys ( humans ) are constantly talking a good game into our head .
This or that is hot ; this or that is cool ; this or that is the way to beat the system .
They ’re influencing our ability to predict with our fear of results .
As a result , if you put a group of humans together and they have no forward agenda , the first thing they do is make a kind of tacit internal treaty : I wo n’t point out publically where you ’re out of step with reality if you wo n’t point out publically where I am .
Done deal , contracted sealed , and a crowd is formed — a crowd of individualists who behave like a mob .
Before we start talking about liberty , freedom and other negatively defined ( freedom = not unfree ) absolute symbols , we should look at the effects of liberty : tyranny — by the mob .
In the last few years , I have woken up – late in the day , but better late than never – to the way in which individual liberty , privacy and human rights have been sliced away in Britain , like salami , under New Labour governments that profess to find in liberty the central theme of British history .
Almost every week brings some new revelation of the way in which our government has taken a further small slice of our liberty , always in the name of another real or alleged good : national security , safety from crime , community cohesion , efficiency ( ha ha ) , or our “ special relationship ” with the United States .
As Dominic Raab writes in his excellent book The Assault on Liberty , this government “ has hyperactively produced more Home Office legislation than all the other governments in our history combined , accumulating a vast arsenal of new legal powers and creating more than three thousand additional criminal offences ” .
The peculiarity of Britain is that we have nibbled away individual liberty on so many different fronts .
The Guardian
Timothy Garton
Ash is correct in noting that liberty is being eroded ; he ’s being silly in demanding more of it .
We ’re talking about New Labour here , the most liberal government Britain has ever had .
They ’re in favor of diversity .
They want equal rights for gays .
They want you to be able to do whatever it is you want to — to act like a god without fear of consequences — but in return , you ’re going to have to empower the mob to crush those who do n’t agree .
That ’s the devil ’s bargain of every Revolution .
In Russia , they murdered the aristocracy , and reduced one of the most cultured places on earth to a backward third world mafia .
In France , they destroyed their aristocracy and began the process of slowly relinquishing the dominance on the arts , culture and letters that France had held for centuries .
In the New World , the domesticated natives have risen up and overthrown those who built the infrastructure that defines New World countries as separate from the third world ruins that went before .
Revolutions revert nations to third world status through this mob-mentality .
The mob wants the powers of a god , so it takes revenge on those who will know the difference between reality and illusion — those naturally gifted with intelligence .
This is why Nietzsche termed the liberal impulse — all liberal movements aim at Revolution — as “ revenge ” : it was designed to compensate through cognitive dissonance and violence for those who were not given what others got , namely the beauty , brains and health .
I do n’t think Lars Hedegaard realizes how accurate this quote is :
In a society where religion cannot be criticized , everything becomes religion — from the length of your beard to what hand to use when wiping your backside .
My only caveat : what about when that religion is secular ?
Like , say , liberty or Revolution .
We know that the broad Left â€ “ which in Europe would include various shades of the hard , Communist or Marxist Left , the New Left , which has now transformed itself into tree huggers , and the traditional Social Democratic parties â€ “ has vacated its traditional ideological positions in order to preach ideologies that used to be hallmarks of the far right .
Positions such as the need for censorship , kissing up to demands that â€œreligionsâ€ ( i.e. Islam ) must not be criticized or ridiculed , the institution of ethnic or tribal special privileges and inequality before the law â€ “ depending on what ethnic , tribal or clan chief or holy man can ingratiate himself to the top of the totem pole as most aggrieved victim .
This new weltanschauung takes us back to a legal order â€ “ or rather lack of order â€ “ the like of which we havenâ€™t seen in the civilized world since â€ “ when ?
The democratic revolutions of the 19th century , the French Revolution , the American Revolution , Englandâ€™s Glorious Revolution , John Miltonâ€™s Areopagitica , Magna Carta ?
The road chosen by the parties on the Left permits no return .
Having alienated â€ “ not to say discarded â€ “ large chunks of their traditional working class voters , they are now increasingly dependent on the Muslim vote , which they hope will guarantee them a perpetual foothold at least in the major populations centers .

Every human action has two layers .
The public layer , or how it is explained to others .
The inner layer , in which the biochemical workings of the mind are laid bare — in contrast to how the mind explains itself , which is part of the public layer .
The mind sees itself from outside .
The inner layer however can only be studied on the level of biology , sociology / psychology , and impetus to power .
Hindus and their offspring , Buddhists , explain this as mind / body dualism : the mind sees itself from outside , so its perception is part of that outside , in which we form ostensible reasons for our actions using the language of civilization and its reward structure .
“ I fired John because we need some order on this team ” frequently masks “ He challenged my authority or competed with me for females , so I had to destroy him . ”
Mother Nature triumphs over all our pretentious little justifications .
In the case of the modern liberal , the private layer comes out when they ’re given power .
All those justifications — help the poor , justice , liberty — get thrown out the window and we see liberalism for what it really is : a group of monkeys throwing out the more qualified monkeys because , since the Revolutionists have more numbers , they can grab power and wealth — so they will .
These liberty - monkeys use whatever groups they can to support them in their power grab .
This is why liberals on all continents always support the importation of foreign workers .
Why ?
These people should be grateful and dependent on the liberals , for a generation or two .
They ’re soldiers in the war against the Majority , or those who ’ve done well in life thanks to their inherent smarts , health and beauty .
This is why liberal movements all tend toward Stalinism as they gain power .
They need to assert total control in order to legitimize their power grab , and to cover their basic incompetence at ruling — if they ’d been good at anything , they would have been in power before the Revolution .
That reversal in action :
TWO decades ago , on 14th February 1989 , Salman Rushdie received one of historyâ€™s most notorious Valentine greetings .
Ayatollah Khomeini , then Iranâ€™s Supreme Leader , issued a fatwa ( a religious edict ) calling for the death of the Indian - born British author in response to his novel , â€ œThe Satanic Versesâ€ .
Horrific though these consequences were , many argued that freedom of speech itself was at stake .
To cave in , by withdrawing publication or sale of the work , would represent the crumbling of a defining principle of liberal societies .
Yet critics today , such as Kenan Malik , a writer and broadcaster , argue that the detractors have gradually won their war .
Mr Malik and others suggest that free speech in the West is in retreat .
Other publishers , faced with books that were likely to cause widespread offence , have been less resolute .
In 2008 Random House was set to publish â€ œThe Jewel of Medinaâ€ , a misty - eyed account of romance between Muhammad and his wife Aisha .
The firm reversed its decision after a series of security experts and academics cautioned them against publication ( one American academic described the work as historically inaccurate â€œsoft core pornographyâ€ ) warning it would be dangerously offensive .
Gibson Square , another publisher , took up the novel and saw its offices firebombed in September 2008 , 20 years to the day after the publication of â€ œThe Satanic Versesâ€ .
â€ œThe Jewel of Medinaâ€ has since been released in America , but it remains under wraps in Britain .
The Economist
The term “ civilized ” belongs to the public layer .
It means that we censor things by making them politically unpopular , thus taboo , thus economically unpopular , so those who were trying to use them to make a profit then withdraw them .
No one had to ban NWA ’s albums back in 1987 , but you could n’t find them in most record stores .
Now these Revolutionists want to tell us that we ’re ignorant and primitive , and they know better — and somehow , the new power grabbing liberty - monkeys have paired up with their old nemesis , The Corporate State :
Elite members of the World Economic Forum ( WEF ) meeting in Davos , Switzerland , recently considered a proposal for a new global television network to usher in a state of â€œglobal governance .â€ 
The concept strikes some as authoritarian , even totalitarian .
But the parent company of Fox News was one of the sponsors of this year ’s gathering .
The WEF is an exclusive club of very rich and powerful people from around the world .
It describes itself as â€œan independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to shape global , regional and industry agendas.â€ 
This yearâ€™s conference featured speeches by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and Chinese Premier We Jiabao .
Many U.S. corporations , including some getting Wall Street bailout money , were sponsors .
News Corporation , the parent of Fox News , was a â€œstrategic partnerâ€ of the event .
Other members of the Council on the Future of Media were Betsy Morgan of the left - wing Huffington Post ( former general manager of CBSNews.com ) ; Rui Chenggang of China Central Television , an official political propaganda arm of the communist regime ; and Zafar Siddiqi of CNBC Arabiya , a subsidiary of General Electric which is described as a 24 - hour Arabic language financial and business information channel .
World Tribune
It ’s not left - wing or right - wing propaganda .
It has one message : do n’t rock the boat .
We know what we are doing .
Our way is the best , and you are an uneducated hick who does n’t know anything .
Accept what we tell you , and do n’t rock the boat , because there ’s profit to be made .
Profit for the post - Revolutionary elites , that is .
The Soviet Union lost a generation of genetics research to the politicization of science when Trofim Lysenko , director of biology under Joseph Stalin , parlayed his rejection of Mendelian genetics into a powerful political scientific movement .
Yet the spectre of Lysenkoism lurks in current scientific discourse on gender , race and intelligence .
Claims that sex - or race - based IQ gaps are partly genetic can offend entire groups , who feel that such work feeds hatred and discrimination .
Pressure from professional organizations and university administrators can result in boycotting such research , and even in ending scientific careers .
Nobel prizewinner William Shockley became a subject of controversy in the 1970s , after his work turned to racial differences in intelligence .
In recent decades , the writings , statements and teachings of Arthur Jensen , Michael Levin and John Philippe Rushton , also on racial differences in intelligence , have met variously with acclaim , outcries and demands for job termination .
So have writings of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray on the differential distribution of IQ by race .
And Frank Ellis , a lecturer at the University of Leeds , UK , took early retirement in the face of an ethical storm that developed after he suggested in a student newspaper that intelligence levels were related to ethnicity .
The list goes on .
Many have been dissuaded from even looking at the research topic for fear of condemnation .
The outcries against those who speak of racial and gender gaps in IQ have become deafening , at times resembling Lysenkoism in language if not in deed .
Nature
This is why we must not allow politics to dominate us : it blocks our view of reality , and replaces it with an ethic of convenience that acts so we do n’t rock the boat .
200 years after Darwin , we cannot discuss Darwin ’s effects on us as people .
And there ’s an even more threatening aspect of social censorship of science :
Analyzing the last 40 years of data from the tens of thousands of Americans who contribute to the count , the Audubon Society has found that 177 of 305 species of birds common in early winter have “ moved ” as much as 300 miles north to follow warmer temperatures .
More bluntly , they are being evicted by global warming .
Sightings that were once “ preposterous , ” according to ornithologist Wayne Petersen of Mass Audubon , are continental evidence of planet alteration .
Boston Globe
Have we , er , come to a conclusion on Global Warming yet ?
I ’m pretty sure the elites want us to not rock the boat .
Recycle those condoms .
Buy those fluorescent bulb replacements .
Get yourself a new pair of Green ( tm ) cigarette lighters .
But do n’t talk about overpopulation or ecocide through humans consuming too much land for natural habitats to exist .
Climate change — which is a subset of the issue of human effects on the environment , at least in part — cannot be discussed because we ’ve politicized it .
Are you in the pro-camp ?
Or the con-camp ?
There ’s no voice for those who believe the Revolution has brought an elite which has allowed humanity to grow out of control .
Climate change is just one part of it .
We ’ve made our groundwater toxic and full of hormonoactive chemicals .
We ’ve divided up the earth with fences and roads , and shattered ecosystems in doing so .
Even worse , Malthusian man keeps growing — with no plans for stopping — and the worst damage is in third world populations ( first - world populations in Europe and North America are breeding below replacement levels ) .
We ’re out of control , thanks to our liberty , and the liberty it gave us to squash dissenters who rock the boat .
And what it leaves us with is empty debate , castrated science and lots of lies to keep us company as we watch our world crumble around us .
Liberty creates tyranny .
What prevents tyranny ?
Using power responsibly .
That means recognizing that to stay in power is to defend yourself against others ; that we are biological / sociological creatures , and almost all ideology is just justification ; implementing some form of Social Darwinism and being able to use censorship and law responsibility to eliminate destructive behaviors .
That probably requires too much maturity for those who want easy , one step answers like “ just implement liberty ! ” or “ just implement democracy ! ” , which they tell you with cheerfully blank faces , because everything else is too complicated — and crosses that public / private barrier described above .

While we had a look at an early version of the Adamo at CES , we 've finally gotten a chance to unwrap one from its ultra-sexy packaging and take it for a little spin .
In hand , the laptop is thinner and lighter than most of this size , though it is n't quite as svelte as the Air .
Its real competitor , however , appears to be the X301 .
We 'll be doing a full review in the near future , but for now , enjoy the gallery below , and check out our video unboxing after the break .
What happened to Neokast ?
It ’s a mystery to me .
But I suspect the answer will surprise us all soon enough .
Neokast , as readers of my old PBS column will recall , was a peer - to - peer live video streaming application developed by graduate students from Northwestern University near Chicago .
That ’s me talking about it there on the left , back in 2007 .
I loved the company instantly .
It was out of the Silicon Valley limelight , away from the technical mainstream for such software ( Neokast was a . NET application and therefore pretty much Windows - only ) , but most important of all , it seemed to actually work .
The potential was extremely compelling .
Here ’s how I described it back then :
“ … the more people who watch your Neokast the more efficiently will your server bandwidth be utilized .
According to Birrer , under normal circumstances the server bandwidth should plateau at 3 - 4 times that of a single stream NO MATTER HOW MANY VIEWERS ARE BEING SERVED .
With a per-stream bandwidth of 700 kilobits per second , this means that Neokast would never require more than a continuous three megabits per second of server bandwidth per video channel .
Let ’s put that in a real - world context .
Three megabits per second is almost precisely 1000 gigabytes per month , which is half the allotted monthly throughput for a $ 6.99 - per- month web site at 1&1 .
So if Neokast ’s claim is valid , it would be possible to broadcast American Idol or the Super Bowl or friggin’ CNN worldwide for $ 7 per month . ”
I called it “ The $ 7 Television Network . ”
Response to that column was electric , as was the reaction to Neokast , itself , when the beta software was shown shortly thereafter at a trade show in California .
Neokast was on a roll .
Now all they had to do was deliver .
But apparently they did n’t because now Neokast is gone .
Their web site is dark .
The entire technical team , as far as I can tell , left last September to start a new company in an new product space – content management .
The company ’s sole patent application even lost its legal representation in January when a Chicago - based law firm withdrew .
Only NeoKast CEO
Adam Johnson remains with the company and that ’s only according to his Facebook page , where he appears with a remarkable variety of very attractive young women .
It ’s a familiar story , right ?
The idea was good but the code was n’t .
OR the code was good but they ran out of money .
OR the code was good and they had enough money but the founders had a falling - out .
OR any other mundane reason that you might care to come up with .
Neokast is gone , so what ?
I ’ll tell you so what .
My 32 years in this industry tell me that none of those possibilities is true and that some aspect of Neokast is alive and well , though probably under a different name .
I put these guys on the map .
I wrote about them in a way that gained them a huge amount of attention at a time when they were getting no attention from anyone .
All that means , really , is that their mothers would teach them to be nice to me .
And sure enough , on January 28th , when Adam Johnson and I happened to share a birthday , though almost 30 years apart , we wished each other well within hours on Facebook .
But Adam DIDN
’T tell me then that his company was effectively dead .
It took a reader to point that out to me a couple weeks later .
And when I went down that same Facebook path I ’d used to wish Adam a happy birthday — this time to ask what happened to Neokast — I got no reply at all .
So I tried again , more forcefully .
Still no reply .
So I tried a couple of the ex-Neokast technical guys at their new startup .
No answer .
No answer ?
Do n’t these people want to promote their new technology ?
They know what I can do for them ; do n’t they want me to do it again ?
No answer .
This does n’t happen , not to me .
So what ’s the deal ?
I do n’t know .
But I have a theory .
I think Neokast was bought for a lot of stock or money by some well - known company .
The way the technical team was handled in this transaction it looks like the acquirer wanted the code , not the coders , which suggests a company with confidence , even arrogance , and technical depth .
The reason I ca n’t get anyone to respond is simple under this scenario : they have to all be under a particularly onerous non-disclosure agreement that will take back the money if they say anything – ANYTHING – about the deal .
They are n’t prohibited from just discussing it , they are prohibited even from ACKNOWLEDGING it , hence the total silence .
At one point last year I was told that Microsoft had made an offer for Neokast but was rebuffed .
So maybe Microsoft came back again , this time with the BIG checkbook .
I think this is most likely .
But there are other possibilities .
Apple could have acquired Neokast to kill it .
IBM could have acquired it to become a player in the streaming video business .
Or Sun. Or Cisco .
Or some other company , up to even a Comcast , though I do n’t see the cable company as being so techie as to rebuff the coders .
If you ’ve been paying attention to entertainment news you may have read lately that there is a lot of shuffling for position going on between cable companies , telephone companies , cable and broadcast TV networks , and various startups for dominance of live or on - demand TV channels over the web .
But all this talk so far seems to be based on using content distribution networks , not peer - to - peer .
Even Joost , the p2p video site from the founders of Skype , has publically given - up on using peer - to - peer distribution , leaving only Grid Networks , as far as I can tell , ostensibly in the live p2 p space , if just barely so .
Let ’s guess for a moment the acquirer IS Microsoft .
Because there has been no public announcement of such an acquisition the buyer has to be a big company like Redmond , where the size of the deal would n’t be considered “ material ” to their business , so they could avoid being required by the SEC to even issue a press release .
Of course it could just as easily be the other suspects I named .
But there are many reasons to believe the buyer is Microsoft .
They took a run at the company before , remember .
They are perfectly equipped to handle the technical job on their own , provided they keep the number of hands to a minimum .
They could still screw it up .
There ’s no indication , by the way , that Microsoft has done this .
Certainly none of my friends who know Microsoft have heard anything .
But that could just mean they changed the name and Neokast is now MicroKast or some such thing .
Now here comes Windows 7 – a perfect place to stash a Neokast p2 p client .
On the other hand , Microsoft could put Neokast code in its regular monthly update and get it running on 20 million .NET nodes overnight .
That ’s what I would do .
What ’s funny is if a startup did that there would be an uproar about security , but if Microsoft deploys Neokast overnight it will be seen mainly as a clever move .
Microsoft is desperate to have something new to control and media distribution is their target .
They want to control movies and television the same way they have long controlled software .
But right now Apple and Google are both doing better than Microsoft is in this space .
Ballmer will do anything to beat Apple and Google and the only way to do that – the ONLY way to do that – is by introducing some new game - changing technology like massive , really cheap , delivery of LIVE video .
Bring the TiVO video experience to the World Wide Web without requiring a cable box OR an antenna .
Well Neokast takes a good shot at doing just that .
And bringing the horsepower of 20 million servers to the task would make it even easier .
Maybe the acquirer is n’t Microsoft .
But I ’ll tell you right now that some big company somewhere has snapped - up Neokast , is continuing to develop the software and intends to introduce it soon with a big splash .
I just wish I knew who it was .
In my last post I criticized the C++0 x implementation of futures for their lack of composability .
I now feel obliged to show what I consider “ the right way ” to do futures .
I use the event library of Concurrent Caml ( actually , its version distributed with OCaml ) as my model .
The ideas behind it are described in J. H. Reppy ’s Ph.D. thesis , Higher - order concurrency .
Events and Futures
CML channels and events are more general than futures , but here I ’ll concentrate on the subset of their functionality that can be used to implement futures .
Below is a useful translation table between CML and C ++.
( I should add that CML channels , as opposed to C++ futures , are synchronous .
In practice it does n’t matter that much , since promise : : set_value –corresponding to channel send–is usually called right before the thread exits . )
CML C++ channel promise event future evt = receive chan ftr = prom.get_future ( ) sync ( send chan msg ) ( synchronous ) prom.set_value( msg ) ( asynchronous ) msg = sync evt msg = ftr.get ( ) choose evt_lst ???
evt ’ = wrap evt fun ???
As you can see , C++ has no equivalents of choose and wrap .
I will discuss those next .
choose
CML choose is a function that takes a list of events and creates a new composite event .
When the program sync s on this event , it blocks until one of the listed events completes .
The combination sync and choose is similar to Unix select or Windows WaitForMultipleObjects .
An example of the usefulness of choose is a situation when there is more than one algorithm to calculate a result , and the program runs them in parallel until the fastest one completes .
Linear search , for instance , is faster for small sets than binary search .
Instead of figuring out which one to use for each particular case , it might be cheaper ( on a multicore ) to run both and stop when the fist one is done .
What would choose look like in C ++?
One possibility is to implement it as a container object .
You would push individual futures into it and then call get_future to obtain a composite future .
Let me call this object future_or since it does the equivalent of logical OR for futures ( the equivalent of AND is called a thread barrier ) .
unique_future<int > ftr1 = promise1.get_future ( ) ; unique_future < int > ftr2 = promise2.get_future ( ) ; future_or < int > orf ; orf.push_back(std::move(ftr1 ) ) ; orf.push_back(std::move(ftr2 ) ) ; unique_future < int > compositeFut = orf.get_future ( ) ; ... int result = compositeFut.get ( ) ;
Another possible implementation , in C++0x , would be to define a variadic template function future_choose .
It would take a variable number of futures and return the composite future .
The advantage of such an approach would be to let the compiler infer the types and the number of arguments automatically .
You probably noticed that future_or can only accept futures of one type ( the same would be true about the function future_choose ) .
For instance , to create a composite future that returns a string upon get , you must build it from other futures that also return a string ( and not an int , for instance ) .
In principle , heterogeneous futures could be combined if they all returned different types through the same variant .
Then , after a composite of variant - returning futures returns a variant , program logic would fork depending on the actual type inside the variant .
This approach bypasses the static type system and is error prone .
CML provides a more elegant solution using wrap .
wrap
The trick is to combine ( wrap ) a particular future with a function that processes its output .
A future that returns an int is combined with a function that takes an int , etc .
The result of this combination is a new future usually returning void .
When a wrapped future is synchronized ( e.g. , by calling wait ) , it executes the associated function , passing it the result returned by the original future .
Just look at this example :
void handler ( Foo const & foo ) ; unique_future < Foo > fooFuture = prom.get_future ( ) ; // combine the future with a handler function unique_future < void > wrappedFuture = wrap_future ( fooFuture , &handler ) ; ... wrappedFuture.wait( ) ; // at this point fooFuture has returned a Foo object // and the handler has been executed with that object .
There ’s one thing worth mentioning : the compiler will assure type correctness of the arguments to wrap_future : the return type of the future must be compatible with the argument type of the function .
Mismatch errors will be discovered at compile time .
Compare this with the implementation using variants , which does not have this property .
Of course the usefulness of wrap really comes into play when you try to combine heterogeneous futures using future_choose .
You just wrap each future with its own post - processing function ( or callable object ) and pass them all to future_choose .
Wrapped futures are homogeneous –they all return void .
Here ’s an example that uses C++0 x lambdas ( one of them being a closure ) :
unique_future < Foo > fooFuture = prom1.get_future ( ) ; unique_future < int > intFuture = prom2.get_future ( ) ; int sum = 0 ; future < void > composite = future_choose ( wrap_future ( fooFuture , [ ] ( Foo const & foo ) { foo. Commit( ) ;} , wrap_future ( intFuture , [ &sum ] ( int i ) {sum += i ; } ) ; ... composite.wait ( ) ;
Wrapped futures would be useful , e.g. , in implementing a server that listens to several communication channels .
What about Haskell ?
As I described in my earlier post , unlike CML , Haskell implements asynchronous message passing .
The original Concurrent Haskell paper argued against choose .
Later however Avik Chaudhuri was able to show that the CML event library can be implemented on top of asynchronous MVar s.
So there are no theoretical obstacles to asynchronous implementation of futures .
Final remarks
The equivalent of choose called future_select has been proposed for Boost and C++0x , but it was turned down .
Interestingly enough , Microsoft ’s Task Parallel Library for .NET implements higher - order concurrency .
They have ContinueWith for wrapping futures and WaitAny for choice .
I can only assume that it ’s easier to implement those on a virtual machine .
I also wonder whether it would be more productive to implement the equivalent of the CML channels and events in C++ , and treat futures as a special case .

ZIP Attacks with Reduced Known - Plaintext

Abstract .
In [ BK94 ] Biham and Kocher demonstrated that the PKZIP stream cipher was weak and presented an attack requiring thirteen bytes of plaintext .
The deflate algorithm “ zippers ” now use to compress the plaintext before encryption makes it difficult to get known plaintext .
We consider the problem of reducing the amount of known plaintext by finding other ways to filter key guesses .
In most cases we can reduce the amount of known plaintext from the archived file to two or three bytes , depending on the zipper used and the number of files in the archive .
For the most popular zippers on the Internet , there is a fast attack that does not require any information about the files in the archive .
1 Introduction
PKZIP is a compression / archival program created by Phil Katz .
Katz had the foresight to document his file format completely in the file APPNOTE .
TXT , distributed with every copy of PKZIP ; there are now literally hundreds of “ zipper ” programs available , and the ZIP file format has become a de facto standard on the Internet .
In [ BK94 ] Biham and Kocher demonstrated that the PKZIP stream cipher was weak and presented an attack requiring thirteen bytes of plaintext .
Eight bytes of the plaintext must be contiguous and all of the bytes must be the text that was encrypted , which is usually compressed plaintext .
[ K92 ] shows that the compression method used at the time , implode , produces many predictable bytes suitable for mounting their attack .
Most zippers available today only implement one of the compression methods defined in APPNOTE .
TXT , called deflate .
This is in part due to [ BK94 ] ’s results , and in part to the better compression ratio it provides .
Deflate uses Huffman coding followed by a variant of Lempel - Ziv .
Once the dictionary reaches a certain size , the process starts over .
It ’s easy to see that the codes for any of the plaintext depend on a great deal of surrounding plaintext , and that there ’s almost no way to get it right unless you have the beginning of the file .
The difficulty of getting known plaintext was one reason Phil Zimmerman decided to use it in PGP [ PGP98 ] .
Practically speaking , if one has enough of the original file to get the thirteen bytes of plaintext required for the attack in [ BK94 ] , one has enough to break the encryption almost instantly .
Without the original file , all is not lost ; we have the file ’s type as indicated by its extension , and we have its size .
We have at least one byte of known plaintext used for filtering incorrect passwords .
Zippers also encrypt output from a pseudorandom number generator that may be vulnerable to attack .
It is the author ’s opinion that the only reason the PKZIP cipher has held up so well in light of [ BK94 ] is due to the deflate algorithm and the difficulty of getting enough plaintext .
This paper treats the question of how far we can reduce the plaintext requirement and still break the cipher in a reasonable amount of time .
1.1 The PKZIP Stream Cipher
The PKZIP stream cipher was designed by Roger Schaffely and is fully described in the file APPNOTE .
TXT found in most PKZIP distributions .
The internal state of the cipher consists of three 32 - bit words : key0 , key1 , and key2 .
These values are initialized to 0x12345678 , 0x23456789 , and 0x34567890 , respectively .
The internal state is updated by mixing in the next plaintext byte ; we follow [ BK94 ] in our description , combining the decrypt_byte ( ) and update_keys ( ) functions described in APPNOTE .TXT into a single function :
unsigned char PKZIP_stream_byte ( unsigned char pt )
{
unsigned short temp ;
key0 = crc32 ( key0 , pt ) ;
key1 = ( key1 + ( key0 & 0xFF ) ) * 0x08088405 + 1 ;
key2 = crc32 ( key2 , key1 >> 24 ) ;
temp = ( key2 & 0xFFFC ) | 2 ;
return ( ( temp * ( temp ^ 1 ) ) >>
8) &0xFF ;
}
where ^ is XOR , | is OR , & is AND , and >> is right shift .
For the purposes of this paper , we define crc32 ( ) to be
# define crc32(crc , b ) (( crc >> 8 ) ^ crctab [ ( crc & 0xFF ) ^ b ] )
The old CRC state is shifted right eight bits and XORed with the 32 - bit entry of a byte - indexed table to produce the new state .
The index is the low byte of the old state XORed with b .
The function is linear ; that is ,
crctab[x ^ y ] = crctab[ x ] ^ crctab[y ] .
The cipher is keyed by encrypting the user ’s password and throwing away the corresponding stream bytes .
The stream bytes produced after this point are XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext .
The crux of all of our attacks is the fact that there is almost no diffusion in the internal state .
Of the ninety - six bits of internal state , eight bits of key0 affect key1 ; eight bits of key1 affect key2 ; and fourteen bits of key2 affect the output stream byte .
1.2 Encrypted File Format
Zippers must prepend twelve bytes to the beginning of the file to be encrypted .
The ZIP file format specifies that the first eleven should be random and that the last should be the low byte of the archived file ’s CRC .
The entire CRC is stored in plaintext , and this byte serves as a password filter .
Some zippers , like InfoZIP [ IZ ] and WinZip [ WZ ] , store ten random bytes and the low two bytes of the CRC .
We assume that deflate was the algorithm used to compress the underlying data .
The author did a crude statistical test on a few hundred files of varying types and sizes and found that given the file type , as indicated by its extension , and its size , one can guess about the first two and a half bytes of the compressed file .
Since the checksum bytes are at the very end of the prepended header , we can use them to augment the plaintext from the file in mounting our attacks .
2 Biham and Kocher ’s Attack
For completeness , we review [ BK94 ] ’s results .
We begin with some terminology .
Bits are numbered from right to left : bit 0 is the ones ’ place , bit 1 is the twos ’ place , bit 2 is the fours ’ place , etc .
Let p i be the ith known - plaintext byte , i = 1 , 2 , 3 , ...
Let s i be the ith stream byte .
Let key0 i , key1 i , and key2 i be the value of key0 , key1 , and key2 after processing p i .
Note that s 1 is a function of the random header and the password ; it is independent of the plaintext .
In general , bits 2 through 15 of key2 i determine s i+1 .
Their attack proceeds as follows :
XOR ciphertext and known plaintext to get known stream bytes s 1 through s 13 .
Guess 22 bits of key2 13 .
This guess combined with s 13 is enough to fill in eight more bits of key2 13 , for a total of thirty .
s 12 provides enough information to derive 30 bits of key2 12 and the most significant of key1 13 .
In general , each stream byte s i allows us to calculate thirty bits of key2 i-1 and the most significant byte of key1 i .
We continue using stream bytes to make a list of the most significant bytes of key1 13 through key1 8 .
For each list , we find 216 possibilities for the low 24 bits of key1 13 through key1 9 by calculating the low byte of ( key1 i + LSB ( key0 i+1 ) ) such that you get the right high byte of key1 i+1 .
From each of the 216 lists of complete key1 ’s , derive the low bytes of key0 13 through key0 10 .
Once we have the low bytes of key0 10 , key0 11 , key0 12 , and key0 13 , we can use our knowledge of the plaintext bytes to invert the CRC function , since it ’s linear , and find the complete internal state at one point along the encryption .
Once we have the complete internal state , we can decrypt backwards as far as we want ; we decrypt the ciphertext corresponding to p 1 through p 5 and filter out wrong keys .
We can break a file with work equivalent to encrypting around 238 bytes and negligible memory .
We need a total of thirteen bytes of known plaintext : eight for the attack , and five to filter the 238 keys that remain .
2.1 Minor Improvement in the Amount of Plaintext Required
[ BK94 ] throws away six bits in key1 7 .
By using them , we can reduce the plaintext requirement to twelve bytes at the cost of increasing the work factor by four .
2.2 More Files in the Archive
If we have more than one file in the archive , we can make the reasonable assumption that they were encrypted with the same password .
“ Zippers ” encrypt at least one check byte into every encrypted file to verify that the user entered the correct password .
Once we have the complete internal state of the cipher , we can run it backwards to the beginning of the file and read out key0 , key1 , and key2 .
Since this state is the same at the beginning of each file ( it only depends on the password ) , we can decrypt the check byte in each file and use it to filter with instead of known plaintext from a single file .
This also works if the files are in different archives , but have the same password .
Since the attack is so fast , we can afford to guess a couple of stream bytes .
If we guess N of them , we get 240 + 8N keys to filter ; this increases the amount of work and the number of additional files we need , but reduces the amount of known plaintext required from a single file .
Consider the N=1 case : if the file was created in a zipper with two checksum bytes , we can break the file with work equivalent to encrypting 248 bytes .
We need two checksum bytes followed by only four more known plaintext bytes in one file , and three other files in the archive ( six check bytes ) to filter the 248 possible keys .
If there is only one checksum byte , we can break the file with the same amount of work , but we need seven files in the archive and five bytes of known plaintext in addition to the checksum byte .
3 Divide and Conquer
The limited diffusion of the internal state prompts us to ask how much of the state we need to guess to process one byte .
If it is small enough , we can guess it and filter out keys that wo n’t work with our known stream bytes , then proceed to the next part .
It turns out that we can get by with as few as 23 bits .
Note that we do n’t need to guess 16 bits of key0 0 to calculate the low byte of key0 1 : if we distribute the XOR in the definition of crc32 ( ) , we see that we only need to guess 8 bits of crc32 ( key0 0 , 0 ) :
LSB ( key0 1 ) = LSB ( crc32(key0 0 , p 1 ) )
= LSB ( crc32(key0 0 , 0 ) ) ^ LSB ( crctab[p 1 ] ) .
Now we distribute the multiplication across the addition in the next step :
MSB ( key1 1 ) = MSB ( ( key1 0 + LSB ( key0 1 ) ) * 0x08088405 + 1 )
( A) = MSB ( LSB ( key0 1 ) * 0x08088405 ) +
( B) MSB ( key1 0 * 0x08088405 ) + possible carry bit .
We separate the equation into parts we know ( A ) and parts we need to guess ( B ) , and find we need to guess nine bits , including a possible carry bit .
Note that since we know the low bits of ( LSB ( key0 1 ) * 0x08088405 ) , the carry bit will usually give us more than one bit of information in the form of an upper or lower bound on the rest of ( key1 0 * 0x08088405 ) that we have n’t guessed yet .
Given a stream byte s i+1 , we can find sixty four values for bits 2..15 of key2 i .
It ’s easy to see why : fourteen bits of key2 i produce eight bits of s i+1 , so there are six left over .
We can create a table of 256 x 64 bytes such that given s i+1 and bits 10..15 of key2 i , we can look up bits 2..9 of key2 i .
We call this the preimage table .
We guess bits 10..15 of crc32( key2 0 , 0 ) and use s 2 , the preimage table , and crctab [ MSB ( key1 1 ) ] to find bits 2..9 of crc32( key2 0 , 0 ) .
We end up with 223 key guesses .
To find the next part of the internal state , we have to guess about the same amount .
This guess is not illustrated , but we basically guess about eight more bits of information in each of the three keys .
The only complicated part is separating what we know about key1 from what we do n’t .
We guess bits 8..15 of crc32( key0 0 , 0 ) directly ; the next guess involving key1 is a little more complicated :
MSB ( key1 2 ) = MSB ( ( key1 1 + LSB ( key0 2 ) ) * 0x08088405 + 1 )
= MSB( LSB ( key0 2 ) * 0x08088405 ) +
MSB ( key1 1 * 0x08088405 ) + possible carry bit
= MSB( LSB ( key0 2 ) * 0x08088405 ) +
MSB ( ( key1 0 + LSB ( key0 1 ) )
* 0xD4652819 ) +
possible carry bit
( A) = MSB ( LSB ( key0 2 ) * 0x08088405 ) +
( A) MSB ( LSB ( key0 1 ) * 0xD4652819 ) +
( B) MSB ( key1 0 * 0xD4652819 ) + possible carry bit .
Again , ( A ) is known and we have to guess ( B ) nine bits , including a possible carry bit .
The carry bit establishes an upper or lower bound on ( key1 0 * 0xD4652819 ) .
We end this filter by guessing bits 16..23 and bits 0..1 of crc32( key2 0 , 0 ) and calculating a stream byte .
We have guessed 27 more bits , but the output byte has to match s 3 , so we expect 223+27 - 8 = 242 key guesses to pass this filter .
At this point , we have guessed 24 bits of crc32 ( key2 0 , 0 ) and we know s 1 .
From this we can calculate , on average , one full value of key2 0 .
There are also only around 213 possibilities for key1 0 due to the restrictions from the carry bits .
So the third stage consists of guessing bits 16..23 of crc32( key0 0 , 0 ) and running through the 213 possible values for key1 0 .
We expect 242+13+8 - 8 = 255 key pieces to pass this filter .
Finally , we guess the last eight bits of key0 0 and we have a complete internal state .
We will have 263 complete keys to filter with other bytes , whether they are in the archived file or in checksum bytes in other files .
The cost is approximately the same as encrypting 263 bytes under the stream cipher .
The plaintext requirement is four bytes total ; at least one of these may come from the file ’s own check byte(s ) .
This is 128 times faster than guessing three stream bytes and using [ BK94 ] .
4 Random Number Generation
InfoZIP is a cross-platform freeware zipper distribution .
Because the C source code is readily available and is free , it forms the basis of most non-PKZIP zippers , including the very popular WinZip and NetZip * .
APPNOTE .TXT does not specify how to generate the prepended random bytes ; it only says that they are used to scramble the internal state of the cipher and are discarded after decryption .
InfoZIP implements it as follows :
srand ( time ( NULL ) ^ getpid ( ) )
For each file in the order they are stored ,
Generate ten random bytes by calling rand ( ) ten times and discarding all but the high eight bits of each return value .
Initialize the cipher with the password .
Encrypt the ten random bytes .
Append the low two bytes of the checksum .
Reinitialize the cipher with the password and encrypt the twelve - byte header and the compressed file .
rand ( ) is usually implemented as a truncated linear congruential generator .
WinZip and NetZip use Microsoft Visual C++’s implementation , which has a 31 - bit seed :
unsigned long seed ;
void srand ( unsigned long s ) { seed = s ; }
unsigned short rand ( )
{
seed = 0x343FD * seed + 0x269EC3 ;
return ( ( seed >> 16 ) & 0x7 FFF ) ;
}
Let r i , j be the jth random byte in the ith archived file ; i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 , ...
Note that the internal state of the cipher is the same both times r i , 1 is encrypted .
Since XOR is its own inverse , r i , 1 is decrypted for all i .
Also , every r 1 , j reveals the high eight bits of the internal state of the random number generator .
Since rand ( ) is linear , we can compute two new constants for a generator such that it outputs every tenth output of the original .
We know the upper eight bits of the generator , so we guess the low 23 bits and start generating every tenth output and comparing them to the leaked bytes .
Four archived files suffice to uniquely determine the seed that was used in the random number generator , and therefore every r i , j .
Let us emphasize that we do not have known plaintext at this point , in the sense that [ BK94 ] requires , because the plaintext was encrypted twice , and we do not know the actual values of the stream bytes .
What we can derive is the XOR of the stream bytes in the first and second encryption .
5 Parallel Divide and Conquer
We can adapt the divide - and - conquer algorithm from section 3 to use this information .
Once we know the “ random ” headers , we can exploit the fact that the internal state was the same at the beginning of each embedded file and filter guesses with multiple known plaintext bytes in parallel , instead of being restricted to one byte as in section 3 .
Let s i , j , k be the jth stream byte of the kth encryption of the bytes in the ith archived file ; i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... ; k = 1 , 2 .
We guess the same 23 bits as in section 3 , but since we do n’t know the actual value of s 1,2,1 , we have to guess it , too .
It is equivalent , and more convenient , to guess bits 2..9 of crc32( key2 0 , 0 ) .
Now we have a prediction for s 1,2,1 , and can derive s 1,2,2 .
We do n’t have any information at all about s i, 1,1 , since it ’s the same as s i,1,2 and cancels out .
We guess it , and check to see that the second encryption spits out s 1,2,2 .
We have to guess a carry bit for the second encryption , too , so of the 223+8+8+1 = 240 key guesses , we expect 240 - 8 = 232 key pieces to pass this filter on this file .
We want to filter out all but the correct guess at this stage ; fortunately , we know that the state we are trying to guess was the same at the start of each encryption .
We have an eight - bit value to filter with in each file , s i,2,1 XOR s i, 2,2 , but we also guess two carry bits , so with four more files in the archive , we can reduce the number of false positives to around 232 - 6 * 4 = 256 .
Note that we now have ten carry bits putting restrictions on key1 0 instead of just one .
We continue to the next byte of each file .
This time we guess the same 26 bits as in section 3 plus two carry bits , one for each encryption .
With five files , we have 30 bits to filter with .
We expect that 28+26+2-30 = 26 = 64 key guesses survive the second stage .
Total work for this stage is 28+26+2 = 236 byte encryptions .
At this point we can derive key2 0 as before .
Due to all the carry bit restrictions , we only have on the order of 28 possible key1 0 ’s .
We guess eight more bits of crc32 ( key1 0 , 0 ) and run through all the remaining key1 0 ’s .
Since we are n’t guessing carry bits any more , we have 40 bits to filter with .
26+16-40 < 1 , and we expect that only the correct guess survives .
Finally , we guess the last eight bits of crc32 ( key1 0 , 0 ) and only the correct guess survives .
Experimentally , we have found that a key guess passes the second stage only if our guess for s i,1,1 is correct .
This usually occurs about one quarter of the way through the first 40 - bit keyspace .
After that , we only try one value for s i,1,1 instead of 256 and the rest of the attack takes at most a few minutes .
The work done in the first stage dwarfs the rest of the work needed .
The total work is therefore about the same as encrypting 239 bytes .
Cracking a file created with this kind of weak PRNG usually takes about two hours on a 500 MHz Pentium II .
One can then take the three keys and use [ BK94 ] ’s second algorithm to derive a password , if one desires , although the three keys suffice to decrypt the files .
6 Conclusion
The PKZIP stream cipher is very weak .
The deflate algorithm makes it harder to get plaintext , but in most cases we can reduce the plaintext requirement to the point where one can guess enough plaintext based on file type and size alone .
The most popular zippers on the internet are also susceptible to an attack that runs in two hours on a single PC based on known plaintext provided by the application and independent of the archived files themselves .

In issuing the writ for the inquiry , Judge Garzon indicated that the recently released OLC memoranda " reveal what had been just an intuition : an authorized and systematic plan of torture and mistreatment of person denied freedom without any charge whatsoever and without the rights enjoyed by any detainee . "
The targets of the probe include : " perpetrators , instigators , necessary collaborators and accomplices ' of what was referred to as systematic torture .
Likely the Obama Administration will seek dismissal of this inquiry , said to be based upon the law of Spain with allegedly allows for the investigation of human rights violations around the world .
Previously , and for years , it was Garzón who had sought the extradition of Augusto Pinochet for human rights violations .
This is a short diary , but this story is just developing .
UPDATE :
Philippe Sands , an attorney specializing in international law , and author of The Torture Team is currently on Fresh Air explaining this investigation .
According to his sources the targets of this investigation include Condoleeza Rice and Richard B. Cheney ,
What is likely to happen net is for the investigation to proceed , if unappealed , a court date will be set , and the targets will be advised to appear .
Garzón may then issue an arrest warrant that will be valid , at least in Spain , but possibly other countries .
Extradition by the Obama Administration , of course , is highly unlikely .
He is also in the process of strongly rebutting the publicly stated arguments of Steven Haynes and Jay Bybee , including the call to have Bybee removed from the bench .
He calls Bybee 's statements of last evening are " shocking . "
[ UPDATE 2 ]
Scott Horton , writing at The Daily Beast , reports further that :
Now , Garzón has announced a preliminary criminal inquiry into the Bush administration torture policy , specifying the evidence that a crime had been perpetrated against Spanish subjects , but not yet specifying the specific targets of the investigation .
Judge Garzón ’s decision revealed a deep engagement with documents which had been released in Washington in the last two weeks , particularly a group of memoranda prepared by lawyers in the Bush Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) a report of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a memo released by the Senate Intelligence Committee , making it likely that he would focus on the authors of the torture memoranda and other lawyers who worked with them . [...]
Garzon ’s investigation focuses on charges of conspiracy to introduce and implement a regime of torture at the detention facilities at Guantánamo in Cuba , where five prisoners investigated by Garzón were held .
Four of the prisoners have now filed claims with Garzón in which they press charges that they were tortured during their captivity and their claims were validated at least to some extent by a ruling of the Spanish Supreme Court in June 2006 which overturned a conviction on the grounds that it was secured with evidence gathered through torture .
The case has been pending since the time of their turnover from U.S. authorities with Judge Garzón , who has attempted to prosecute the five under counter - terrorism statutes .
Garzón is also seeking to have the criminal complaint of a Spanish human rights organization against the Bush Six — six top Bush administration officials — recently reassigned by the chief judge of the Audiencia Nacional to Judge Eloy Velasco , referred back to him for purposes of consolidation with his new preliminary investigation .
Note the article well .
The procedural history here is a bit complex , but it explains why are are at this point .
Note , too , that the article concludes with a statement from an unidentified lawyer who validates the assertion made in comments to this diary ( and thus my reason for posting it in the first place ) that :

Northern Trust -- the bank TMZ exposed this week for throwing a series of lavish parties and concerts in L.A. -- is giving back the $ 1.6 billion in federal bailout money !
We had our cameras out as the bank hosted fancy dinners for hundreds of clients and employees .
We had video of the

concert it threw after closing down the House of Blues .
And then there were concerts by

, as well as Earth , Wind & Fire ... and the Tiffany gift bags for the ladies .
The story triggered a furor in D.C. ... Congressman Barney Frank demanded that Northern Trust repay the money it blew .
Outrageously , the bank did n't even ask for the bailout money in the first place .
But now , under pressure , Northern Trust CEO Frederick Waddell sent a letter to members of the House Financial Services Committee , saying his bank will repay the government funds " as quickly as prudently possible . "
The next release of Firefox , code named Shiretoko and currently in development , will be labeled 3.5 instead of 3.1 as it had been originally planned .
According to today ’s Firefox meeting notes , the version bump aims to reflect more accurately the many changes introduced since the release of Firefox 3.0 , the latest major release , last summer .
These includes several changes to tabbed browsing , significant improvements to web standards compatibility , a deeply enhanced JavaScript engines , and several new privacy related including an all new private mode that allows users to clear all their browsing activities at the end of a session .
The next beta , Beta 3 , will still be labeled as 3.1 while all the necessary changes are made on Mozilla ’s several development tools .
The code for Beta 3 is now frozen and builds are already being produced .
Final release is expected for next week following QA procedures .
It also seems Beta 3 will not be the final beta as it was originally thought , but a fourth beta should follow in the near future with a chance of including some more new besides fixing the about 100 blocker bugs currently identified .
These small new features are a series of very specific developments ( sprints ) that may be ready on time for Firefox 3.5 , including tab searching via the awesome bar , some additional minor Windows theme retouches , an about : me page that profiles a user ’s web usage based on his history , the ability to clear history for more precise periods of time , and a few others .
Update : Mike Beltzner , Firefox product lead , clarifies that despite what the meeting notes may have suggested , the version bump is not a final decision at this point .
As a first step , delegates at the National Union of Teachers ' conference will seek a ban on opening any new faith schools – on the grounds that their admissions policies have created " segregated schooling " in many parts of the country .
The move would put the union on a collision course with the Government , which has openly sought sponsorship by religious groups for many of its flagship new academies .
Several of the new academies to be opened this year have church backing .
It is also likely to provoke fierce debate within the union , as many of its members work in faith schools .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At present , there are about 7,000 faith schools in the country – 600 secondary and 6,400 primary .
The vast majority are Christian : there are around 6,955 Church of England , Roman Catholic and Methodist schools .
The rest consist of 36 Jewish schools , six Muslim , two Sikh and one Hindu , Greek Orthodox and Seventh - Day Adventist .
The motion , which is set to be debated at the union 's annual conference in Cardiff on Saturday , states : " Religious groups , of whatever faith , should have no place in the control and management in the control and management of schools . "
It declares that " all children should have the opportunity and the right to meet and work with children from a variety of backgrounds and faiths within their day - to - day education " .
Supporters of the move argue that admitting pupils on religious grounds risks undermining the Government 's calls to them to promote community cohesion , which has just become a legal obligation on all schools .
The union 's leadership is prepared to back the motion 's main aim – to declare a long - term commitment to creating a single community comprehensive system that covers all state secondary schools .
However , it would rather place the emphasis on getting existing faith schools to change their admissions policies than campaign against all new proposals to establish religious schools .
It will seek to persuade delegates to back a call for all schools to adopt " non-discriminatory admissions procedures " .
Christine Blower , general secretary of the NUT , said : " Our preference would be that schools admissions rely on the proximity of the family to the school .
The important thing for us is to ensure that all schools have to abide by the duty to promote social cohesion , rather than select on religious grounds . "
The drive to create more faith schools gained impetus under Tony Blair 's premiership , when he sought to persuade faith groups to become one of the key sponsors of academies .

Since then , Schools Secretary Ed Balls has insisted the Government does not have a policy in favour of creating more faith schools .
However , department officials insist that ministers still value the work done by faith schools in the state education system .
Certain religious sectors agree that faith schools should do more to be more inclusive .
In 2006 , the Rt Rev Dr Kenneth Stevenson , the Bishop of Portsmouth and chair of the Church of England 's Board of Education , wrote to then Education secretary , Alan Johnson : " I want to make a specific commitment that all new ... schools should have at least 25 per cent of places available to children with no requirement that they be of practising Christian families .
The places would not be left empty if they were not filled by such children so this would technically not be a ' quota ' but a ' proportion ' . "
Religion 's role in a nation 's education
There are about 6,400 primary and 600 secondary faith state schools in England
Of these , about 4,700 are Church of England , 2,100 Roman Catholic , and 150 Methodist , with 36 Jewish , six Muslim , two Sikh , one Greek Orthodox , one Hindu and one Seventh - Day Adventist
There are a further 140 Muslim schools in the UK which are not part of the state system
The only state faith schools which existed before the 1997 general election were Christian or Jewish
The state pays up to 90 per cent of the running costs
All faith schools have to teach the National Curriculum
For religious education , more than half only teach their own faith , while the remained teach a locally agreed religious syllabus
Admissions are determined by school governors , and schools can insist on proof of baptism and regular church attendance .
National Secular Society claims that 80 per cent of the population disapproves of faith schools

The idea is to separate your office from the house with a easily constructed pod that provides both style and functionality .
Naturally , the OfficePod puts a premium of eco-friendliness and sustainability with recycled building materials and energy efficient lighting / cooling .
Apparently , the OfficePod is available to employers in the UK as a lease , but someone needs to sell something like this directly to homeowners .
As more and more people telecommute or move into self - employment , I would imagine a pre-fab office to put out in the garden would be in high demand .

Ill have to empty it one day ; what if it starts to smell ; is the water clean ; i spent $ 100 dollars on it ; what a waste of money ; i need to sell it .
I hate it .
I do n't know why I wanted it .
I do this almost evertime I spend more than 20 dollars .
Can a waterbed be dirty ?
It grosses me out that someone else slept in it before me ...
Today I decided to conduct an experiment .
I started calling people I knew , and I asked if they had one or more video games in the house .
Then I asked if they breast - fed their children .
To my great shock , most answered " yes " to both .
One couple I contacted switched to formula after their child 's birth , and told me that they did n't play video games .
The data , based on my first round of calls , was conclusive : if you play video games , you are much more likely to breast - feed your children .
You 're probably ready to shoot five thousand holes in my argument .
For one , I only called people I knew — we 're talking about a small sampling of individuals who happen to be friends with someone who writes about games for a living .
Second , my friends are firmly in their 20s and 30s , which means they grew up playing games .
I could have asked them almost anything and linked it with playing games .
I did my job though , and you clicked on the headline .
You may comment on this story , as well .
It 's a good way to get readers , this tactic of linking a popular topic on a tech website to any other controversial topic .
The reason for this experiment ?
The number of headlines linking violent criminals to video games is n't going down , and the link between playing games and violent , if not murderous , behavior is continually talked about in the mainstream media .
Gaming blogs , hungry to throw content to an insatiable audience demanding hundreds of posts a week , breathlessly report on other people reporting on this supposed connection .
If there is no problem , why do we continually make the finding of video games in the home of the killer of the week such big news ?
Video gaming is a hobby that the majority if Americans take part in , with 2007 research indicating that 63 percent of Americans play games .
Violent criminals are , no matter what the number of news reports would have you believe , rare creatures .
If you mix a limited sample with a hobby that the majority of the population takes part in ... ta-da !
You find that most killers have played video games .
The last media frenzy over a possible murder - video game link is the case of Erik Salvador Ayala , who allegedly shot nine people outside of a nightclub called The Zone .
Two were killed , the rest injured , and Ayala then turned the gun on himself .
It was widely reported that he played video games , although a detective on the case does n't believe in any kind of connection .
" There were a lot of video games in the apartment , " he told the Portland Mercury .
" Of a wide variety of the kind you might find in any 24 - year - old 's apartment . "
The story you wo n't hear , because it does n't sell , is that as gaming gets more popular , violent crime has gone down .
" The reality is that ... as violent video games have become more prevalent , violent crimes have decreased dramatically .
This is true both for police arrest data , as well as crime victimization data , " an article in the Journal of Investigative Psychology and Offender Profiling stated .
The data is striking .
" This is certainly not to say that violent video games are necessarily responsible for this decline , even partially .
However , this certainly cuts away the basis of any belief that violent games are promoting societal violence , " the article claims .
" The correlation ( an astonishing r = ? 0.95 ) is simply in the wrong direction .
This would be akin to lung cancer decreasing radically after smoking cigarettes was introduced into a population , which is simply not the case . "
The problem with that story is that it dies ; you can't keep repeating it ad nauseum .
If there is no direct link because gaming and violence , you can't run the same sensational story every time it turns out a shooter enjoyed a good game of Left 4 Dead .
This is a story that papers and blogs get to run with every few weeks , and it makes them money .
And the politicians , for their part , have a problem that they can take instant action on : if games are causing all these problems , then we should do something about it .
Video games are the gangsta rap of the 2000s
The ensuing legislation is often deeply silly , and always incredibly expensive , but it reads well to a scared populace .
People do n't like crime , and if games create crime , then we can show we care by trying to get those games in locked boxes and covered in warning labels , and we can fine those that sell the games to minors .
Poverty , broken families , and decaying schools are subtle , perhaps impossible problems to solve ... so it 's not worth thinking about them .
Video games , on the other hand , are a " problem " that you can legislate away .
In imagining the homes of these killers , you could tell what time of history you are in by what makes the news .
A few years ago you might have made news by finding gangsta rap CDs in a stereo .
Years before that ?
Jazz on the turntable .
It must be like pulling the sheet off a ghost and looking for clues about what this person was like , and why they did what they did .
We simply look for the most obvious and easy - to - solve causes .
The solution would be to stop reporting on these things , unless there is a strong , provable link between gaming and the crime committed .
Stop turning these stories into two - parters , with the first report remarking on the link , and the second debunking it .
Pointing and laughing at the mainstream media perpetuates the issue , and comes off as snarky instead of helpful .
We 're all guilty of riding this issue for easy readers , and lawmakers use our publicity for easy points with their constituents .... it 's time we stopped .
Then again , I got you this far by bringing up breast - feeding .

With less than six months to go until Norway 's general election , increasing tensions over immigration and Islam appear likely to play a significant role in the vote .
The headscarf is a bone of contention in Norway , as elsewhere in Europe
The leader of the country 's main opposition party has warned that it is facing " sneak - Islamisation " , while some prominent Muslims say they face growing " persecution " .
The heated debate is a sign that Norway , renowned as one of the most peaceful and tolerant nations in the world , is facing the same issues with its Muslim minority as are now familiar in other parts of Europe .
Siv Jensen , the 39 - year - old leader of the opposition Progress Party , has objected to moves to introduce special measures in order to accommodate Muslims ' religious sensitivities , traditions and rules .
" The reality is that a kind of sneak - Islamisation of this society is being allowed , " she recently told a Progress Party conference .
" We are going to have to stop this . "
We are portrayed as uncivilised people living double lives - orderly behaved when in public , but at home fundamentalists suppressing and physically abusing women
Khalid Mahmood
Norwegian Labour Party Opinion polls suggest the party could win as much as 30 % of the vote in the election for the national parliament , the Storting , in September .
" If the Progress Party gets to govern Norway , we will enforce Norwegian law and Norwegian rules .
We are not going to allow special demands from any single group in society , " Ms Jensen added .
' Islamophobia ' Khalid Mahmood , a Pakistani - born member of the governing Labour Party believes Muslims are being persecuted , and Islam confronted with hatred .
Polls suggest Siv Jensen 's party could win as much as 30 % of the vote " Muslims are the Jews of our times , stigmatised , generalised and presented as a threat to society " he says .
" It is not any longer immigrants who are targeted , but simply Muslims " , he adds .
" We are portrayed as uncivilised people living double lives - orderly and behaved when in public , but at home fundamentalists suppressing and physically abusing women . "
Last month , the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance ( ECRI ) , the racism watchdog of the Council of Europe , published a report warning that Islamophobia was on the rise in Norway .
Specifically , the commissioned highlighted the increasingly aggressive rhetoric of the Progress Party .
With an estimated 150,000 of Norway 's almost five million population being Muslims , Islam is the second - biggest religion in the country .
But while Norway was ranked the most peaceful country in the world by the World Peace Index in 2007 , it is struggling to integrate its religious minorities .
In some places , Islamic traditions clash with the largely non-religious Scandinavian way of life .
Culture clash Earlier this year , the Labour Party 's governing coalition suggested it would allow police officers to wear headscarves with their uniform , in the hope that it would attract more Muslim women to the police force .
The success of the Progress Party has forced the ruling Labour Party to react
But after widespread criticism of the proposal , the government dropped the idea .
On International Women 's Day in March , Syrian - born Sara Azmeh Rasmussen protested against headscarves by burning hers in public in the capital , Oslo .
Ms Jensen 's Progress Party has produced a list of special measures it says Muslims have requested to accommodate their religious sensitivities and traditions .
On top of changes to the police uniform , the list mentions prison inmates wanting Halal food , and parents of teenage girls demanding that schools separate their daughters from boys during sports lessons .
Most of her supporters say it is her hardline stand against Islamic values and rules that make her their favourite candidate .
Some polls suggest that Ms Jensen 's party could win the election , and that she could become the country 's next prime minister - though to do so she would have to secure the support of other parties like the Conservatives , the Liberals and Christian Democrats .
' Empty rhetoric '
The significant success of the Progress Party has forced the governing Labour Party to react .
Earlier this year , the government tightened asylum rules despite earlier pledges not to do so .
In Norway , extreme Islamist activity is carried out by small groups
Norwegian Police Security Service
And last month , senior members of the Labour Party called for a fight against radical Islam in Norway .
However , the former prime minister and Labour Party leader , Thorbjoern Jagland , called it an unnecessary fight that would only lead to confrontation .
While he argued that it was empty rhetoric , saying there was no radical Islam in Norway , the Norwegian Police Security Service ( PST ) insists radical Islam does represent a threat .
" In Norway , extreme Islamist activity is carried out by small groups .
However , the international connections the persons in these groups represent , in addition to activities they carry out , are such in nature that they can also influence that national threat picture , " it said in a recent report .
While the debate is getting more heated , not all Muslims agree with Mr Mahmood .
" Three to four articles critical of religion and the burning of a headscarf is not persecution of Muslims ; it is a process of modernising , " says Shakil Rehman , another Labour Party member .
" Criticism is n't a smear campaign , but necessary progress . "

I expect some flack for saying this , but this sends a fucked up message because what actually happens in the video is n't nearly as violent as what 's being described .
It says that he hit her head against the door and punched her , but what they show is actually some shoving .
According to police reports , both Rihanna and the car were covered in blood .
In this video , there is n't any blood .
I do n't know whether I think they should have made it more realistic , but the way this is depicted it just looks like something she could walk away from with no physical after effects .
It really bothers me because I feel like it could have the opposite effect .
I could see a teenage girl watching this and then saying something like " See , it was n't that bad what Chris Brown did to Rihanna .
In the video they made of it , that girl did n't have any bruises or anything . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday vowed to pump an additional $ 1 trillion into the U.S. economy in an aggressive bid to battle a deep recession , partly by buying government bonds for the first time since the 1960s .
Concluding a two - day policy meeting , the central bank said it would buy up to $ 300 billion in longer - term Treasuries to bring down borrowing costs , harkening back to a program called “ Operation Twist ” that ran from 1961 to 1965 .
The decision caught many off guard and jolted markets .
While the Fed had said it was considering such a move , it had downplayed it in recent weeks .
As recently as March 6 , New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley had said buying longer - term government debt was not the most efficient way to ease credit market strains .
The price of U.S. government bonds surged after the announcement , with yields taking their biggest one - day tumble since 1987 .
Stock prices also shot higher , while the dollar plunged .
“ It ’s an attempt to keep rates low , particularly on the mortgage side , which is seen as critical to a big revival of the housing market , ” said Rick Meckler , president of Libertyview Capital Management in New York .
“ I think it fits in well with the overall plan the government has to be more creative about how it can bring mortgages more in line with the movement that ’s appeared in Treasury rates , ” he said .
In addition to purchasing Treasury debt , the Fed said it would expand an existing program to buy debt and securities issued by mortgage finance agencies by $ 850 billion to $ 1.45 trillion , an effort to lower mortgage rates .
Quicken Loans said rates on 30 - year mortgages fell as much as 0.375 percentage point to 5.0 percent on the announcement .
RATES NEAR ZERO
The Bank of England ’s recent success in driving interest rates down by buying government debt may have been a factor in the U.S. central bank ’s decision .
By driving down yields on benchmark debt , the Fed hopes to lower a wide array of credit costs for consumers and businesses .
“ This is a pretty dramatic move ...
They are trying to bring down all consumer rates , ” said James Caron , head of global rates research at Morgan Stanley in New York .
The New York Fed said it would begin buying the Treasury debt late next week and planned to focus on securities with maturities ranging from two years to ten years .
It said it would make purchases about two to three times a week .

In addition to ramping up its efforts to pump money into the recession - struck economy , the Fed unanimously decided to hold its target for overnight interest rates in a zero to 0.25 percent range -- the level reached in December .
One Fed official , Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker , returned to the fold after dissenting in January .
The Fed said rates would stay low for “ an extended period , ” a more explicit vow to stay on hold with rates for a prolonged time than it had offered in recent months .
Twelve of the 16 so - called primary dealers that trade securities directly with the Fed said in a Reuters poll they expected the central bank to hold overnight rates near zero into next year , if not further .
CREDIT EASING II
Having pushed overnight rates virtually to zero , the Fed has turned its focus to flooding stressed credit markets with cash in the hope of restarting lending and restoring growth -- a policy Fed chief Ben Bernanke has dubbed “ credit easing . ”
But even as financial markets cheered the Fed ’s moved on Wednesday , some investors focused on the impact to the U.S. central bank ’s balance sheet .
“ Bottom line is the Fed is adding a trillion dollars to their balance sheet and that ’s a lot of taxpayer money , ” said Greg Salvaggio , vice president for trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington .
Some investors said the action would be inflationary , and warned of the downside risks .
“ It ’s overtly inflationary and will inflate most assets , including crude and paper assets like stocks and bonds , ” said Joseph Arsenio , managing director at Arsenio Capital Management in Larkspur , California .
Bernanke on Sunday said repairing the tattered financial system was necessary to secure a recovery for the U.S. economy , which has been stuck in recession for more than a year .
The Fed on Wednesday pointed to worsening prospects for the economy , dropping any specific reference to the likelihood of the recession ending this year .
The central bank instead said only that the near - term outlook is “ weak ” and that stimulus measures should lead to a gradual resumption of growth .
This week , the Fed began taking bids under another marquee program designed to spur student , auto , credit card and small business lending .
This program will initially aim to inject $ 200 billion into the economy , but the Fed has said it could be ramped up to $ 1 trillion .
While the Fed has gone to extraordinary lengths to try to get credit flowing , the economy is still in a nose dive .
U.S. gross domestic product shrank at a 6.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter , the deepest contraction since early 1982 , and economists expect a decline of 5 percent or more this quarter .
The unemployment rate , which has already hit a 25 - year high of 8.1 percent , is expected to climb through the year .
Coleman attorney Joe Friedberg has predicted that Franken will be on top after the court rules .
In Minnesota , it 's still November
Texas Sen. John Cornyn is threatening “ World War III ” if Democrats try to seat Al Franken in the Senate before Norm Coleman can pursue his case through the federal courts .
Cornyn , the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , acknowledges that a federal challenge to November ’s elections could take “ years ” to resolve .
But he ’s adamant that Coleman deserves that chance — even if it means Minnesota is short a senator for the duration .

A three - judge panel is expected to rule any day now on legal challenges to the November election .
Coleman attorney Joe Friedberg has predicted that Franken will be on top after the court rules , arguing that an appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court could swing the election back in Coleman ’s favor .
But what if that does n’t happen ?
Nobody really knows .
As Roland Burris will recall , you ca n’t take a seat in the Senate without an election certificate from your state .
And it ’s not clear whether the candidate who ’s ahead after the Minnesota Supreme Court rules could get an election certificate from Minnesota if his opponent is seeking review from the United States Supreme Court or challenging the results in a new lawsuit in federal court .
Sen . Charles Schumer , the New York Democrat in charge of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee , says that Minnesota gets its second senator as soon as the state case ends .
“ Whatever the state Supreme Court decides , as I understand it , the law requires it to be certified , ” Schumer says .
But Cornyn believes that Minnesota ca n’t certify Franken the winner if Coleman seeks review from the U.S. Supreme Court or files a new federal case .
And Ben Ginsberg , a Coleman attorney and a central player on the Republican side in the 2000 Florida recount , says it ’s “ an open question ” whether a federal court challenge puts a pause on the certification process .
Minnesota has been down a senator since the beginning of the year , and Democrats — who expect Franken to prevail eventually — view themselves as down a vote they ’re entitled to have .
Without Franken in the Senate , the Democrats hold a 58 - 41 vote advantage over the GOP ; getting to 59 - 41 sooner rather than later would make it easier to move President Barack Obama ’s agenda through Congress .
Franken currently leads in the counting by 225 votes .
In a radio interview this month , Friedberg — asked if he was “ confident ” that Coleman would lose before the three - judge panel — said : “ I think that ’s probably correct that Franken will still be ahead and probably by a little bit more .
But our whole argument was a constitutional argument , and it ’s an argument suitable for the Minnesota Supreme Court , not for the trial court .
So we ’ll see whether we were right or not . ”
The Coleman campaign subsequently released a statement saying it was “ confident ” that Coleman would win before the three - judge panel .
It could takes months — or longer — to resolve a petition for review from the U.S. Supreme Court and even longer if the loser before the Minnesota Supreme Court files a new case in a U.S. District Court .
What happens in the meantime could come down to Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican who was on John McCain ’s vice president shortlist and is contemplating a run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 .
So far , Pawlenty is n’t saying what he ’ll do once the court rules .
“ The recent Minnesota Supreme Court decision indicated that an election certificate could be issued once the state courts process is complete , ” said Brian McClung , a spokesman for the governor .
“ However , if one of the parties appeals to a federal court , a question will arise whether the federal court might stay the issuance of a certificate .
“ We ’ll see what the courts determine , ” he said .
McClung was referring to a March 6 opinion in which the Minnesota Supreme Court denied Franken ’s request to compel Pawlenty and Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie to sign an election certificate declaring him the winner while Coleman was appealing the results of a hand recount before the three - judge panel .
In that ruling , the Minnesota Supreme Court said that “ a certificate of election cannot be issued until the state courts have finally decided an election contest . ”
But can it — must it — be issued then ?
“ The question is , when does the state process end ? ” said Richard Hasen , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .
Hasen said it ’s “ not clear ” whether the state process ends when the state Supreme Court rules or continues to run as the loser seeks review from the U.S. Supreme Court .
But , Hasen said , the state process definitely “ would not wait ” if the loser in the state proceeding chose to file an entirely new lawsuit in federal court — for example , to argue that his due - process rights were violated during the state court review .
Legal experts say Coleman or Franken would have a hard time making that kind of case .
But Coleman refused to rule out the idea last week , saying only that “ at this point ” he does not anticipate that the case will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ I ’m not ruling out anything , ” Coleman said at the Capitol Tuesday .
“ I think Minnesotans deserve to know each and every vote was counted fairly — that there ’s a uniform standard .
If that can be done at a trial level , that ’s great .
If it takes an appellate level to do that , then , you know , we have to look at that . ”
Both sides are girding for a long battle .
Eric Schultz , a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , accuses Cornyn and the Republicans of holding the Minnesota seat hostage to prevent Democrats from getting a 59th vote in a chamber in which 60 are needed to move major pieces of legislation .
“ Gov . Pawlenty ought to make clear that if former Sen.
Coleman chooses to appeal the outcome of the contest in the state Supreme Court that this is the end of the road — and that , consistent with the law , he will certify Al Franken the winner following that state court appeal , ” Schultz said .
Air Obama
President Obama ’s European visit this week has strained Air Force heavy - airlift capabilities and obliged the military to hire more foreign contractors to help resupply U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan , according to military sources .
The large delegation traveling with the president in Europe required moving several transports , including jumbo C - 5s and C - 17s , from sorties ferrying supplies to Afghanistan to European bases for the presidential visit , said two military officials familiar with the issue .
They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid any misunderstanding with White House officials .
The Air Mobility Command , part of the U.S. Transportation Command , was ordered to provide airlift for the president ’s entourage of nearly 500 people , including senior officials , staff , support personnel , news reporters and some 200 Secret Service agents for the European visit , which began Tuesday in London .
Airlift for the traveling entourage also was used to move the president ’s new heavy - armored limousine and several presidential helicopters used for short transits .

To make up for the shortfall , the Air Force had to increase the number of Eastern European air transport contractors hired to fly Il - 76 and An - 124 transport jets into Afghanistan loaded with troop supplies , the two officials said .
The airlift crunch comes at a particularly difficult time , as the military is stepping up deliveries of supplies in advance of a surge of 21,000 U.S. troops .
One official said the problem was not only the vehicles and helicopters that were needed for presidential security , but also the unusually large number of people traveling with the president .
The official said U.S. taxpayers are paying twice for airlift , once for Air Force jets that are not available for a war zone and again for foreign contractor aircraft that are .
White House spokesman Tommy Vietor declined to comment .
Col. Gregory Julian , a spokesman for the U.S. military in Afghanistan , said he was unaware of a transport shortage but noted that it was not unusual for the military to hire air - transport contractors in such circumstances .
Presidential logistics for such trips involve a complicated military process that involves insuring smooth travel and having backup aircraft ready for use .
Such large trips as the current European one generally cost millions of dollars .
Navy Capt .
Kevin Aandahl , a spokesman with U.S. Transportation Command , said there was no link between increased contractor airlift in Afghanistan and the aircraft used for presidential travel this week .
“ Contractual airlift [ IL - 76 and AN - 124 ] used to support Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan is not in any way connected to presidential movement requirements , ” he said .
Transportation command “ routinely ” contracts with U.S. air freight lines that subcontract with companies flying Il - 76s and An - 124s to move large military vehicles .
“ This is simply a ‘ best business practice ’ that allows us to meet the needs of our warfighters at the best cost for the taxpayer , ” he said .
The spokesman also said budgets for Afghanistan and presidential travel come from different accounts .
“ The taxpayer does indeed pay for strategic lift for our warfighters in Afghanistan , but they also pay for presidential support , ” he said .
“ These missions are distinctly separate and are therefore funded separately . ”
Mr. Obama and his group , which includes medical personnel and food specialists , will spend eight days in Europe visiting five nations for the G - 20 , NATO and European Union summits and side visits to the Czech Republic and Turkey .
After the first three days in Britain , the party will travel to Strasbourg , France , and Kehl , Germany , for NATO ’s 60th anniversary summit before traveling to Prague on April 5 and then to Ankara and Istanbul , Turkey on April 6 .
Capt .
Aandahl would not say how many transports were used to move the presidential group , nor provide costs .
So long GWOT
The U.S. government is playing down the Obama administration ’s decision to do away with the term “ global war on terrorism , ” known for the past eight years by the acronym GW0T .
A survey of several departments and agencies shows that the term “ global war on terrorism , ” while not specifically banned , is in disfavor due to the new administration ’s decision not to label counterterrorism efforts a war .
A White House official said the terminology change is less about semantics and more about the focus of the Obama administration , “ keeping America safe . ”
A military official close to Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said budget guidance from the White House recommended ending use of GWOT for budget documents .
Instead , the favored term will be “ overseas contingency operations . ”
Adm .
Mullen for the past two years avoided using the term and has encouraged others not to use it , the official said .
An FBI official also said there is no ban on using the term GWOT within the main domestic counterterrorism agency .
“ The administration has stopped using the phrase , and I think that speaks for itself , ” Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters en route to Europe earlier this week .
“ I have n’t gotten any directive about using it or not using it .
It ’s just not being used . ”
A Pentagon spokesman referred to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ’ response Sunday to a question about war terminology .
Mr. Gates did not answer directly but suggested that dropping the term was part of a “ broader kind of strategy ” and noted that “ people [ are ] looking for differences where there are none . ”
A CIA spokesman pointed to recent comments by CIA Director Leon Panetta , who , like Mr. Gates , sidestepped directly answering a question about the terminology change .
“ Well , there ’s no question this is a war , ” Mr. Panetta said .
“ We are engaged in a war in which , you know , when our men and women are at risk and are being killed on the battlefield and when there are those who threaten to come here and kill Americans , there ’s no question in my mind that we are facing the terrorists , and we are facing a threat to this country that requires we do everything possible to try to protect our safety … . ”
A counterterrorism official explained that jettisoning the term “ war on terror ” is more rhetorical than political .
“ The people fighting against al Qaeda and its sympathizers understand both the nature of that fight and the nature of the enemy .
It is not a war against a tactic .
It is a war against terrorists who want to attack our country , ” the official said .
The Air Force has ruled out the possibility that a burning Russian rocket booster re-entering the atmosphere was the cause of the bright light in the sky seen recently along the East Coast .
The Joint Space Operations Center , known as “ JSPOC , ” which monitors man-made objects in space , concluded that a Soyuz rocket body that some experts thought was the cause actually came through the atmosphere near the Philippine Sea .
“ The JSPOC is not aware of any phenomena that would explain the events near Virginia , ” Stefan T. Bocchino , a spokesman for the 30th Space Wing , told Inside the Ring .
The Air Force will not say whether a meteor caused the light show and booms Sunday night , viewed and heard by people from southern Virginia through northern Maryland .
“ We do not track natural phenomena , so we really ca n’t speculate what it was , ” Mr. Bocchino said .
Bremer ’s Surge
He was the man President George W. Bush tapped to run Iraq in those highly chaotic post - invasion days when a deadly insurgency was taking hold .
Special correspondent Rowan Scarborough recently caught up with L. Paul Bremer III , the former ambassador and aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger who nows does consulting and sits on a Catholic Charities board .
The topic : the troop surge that even Mr. Obama , who opposed it and said it would not work .
Mr. Obama later called it a surprising success .
“ I have always been optimistic about the long run in Iraq , and I continue to be , ” Mr. Bremer said .
“ I think the success of the surge has made a very important difference and allowed the provincial elections to go off actually very well , considering .
It brings the Sunnis back into the political process , which was important .
They made a strategic mistake by not participating in the election in ‘ 05 .
And now I am glad to see the president show flexibility and obviously following the guidance of his military guys on the withdrawal .
We just have to be steady , and I think they ’re going to make it . ”
Mr. Bremer was lambasted by some in Congress during his 14 - month reign .
Democrats , in particular , criticized his decisions to abolish the Iraq army and flood the country with sequestered Iraqi oil cash , huge amounts of which went missing .
Today , Mr. Bremer defends those decisions .
He points out that early on he recognized a need for more American troops to quell the violence but was rebuffed by the Pentagon and White House .
“ I was one who called for more troops and a coherent counterinsurgency strategy right from the start , even before I went to Iraq , ” Mr. Bremer said .
“ I was pleased when the president finally decided to do that at the end of 2006 .
The reason I ’m optimistic in the long run about Iraq is because , if you look at it , particularly if you compare it to Afghanistan , this is a country which has a highly educated population , urbanized .
About 75 percent of the people live in towns .
They have a tradition of a well - educated middle class .
They ’ve obviously got wealth , both in oil and water .
There ’s no reason , because they are proud of their history , why the Iraqis ca n’t make a success of it .
It turned out to be harder than we thought it was going to be , and it certainly took longer to get the right strategy in place . ”
Asked what was done right in 2003 - 04 , Mr. Bremer said , “ I think the most important political measure we helped with was the constitution .
And , indeed , the constitution has basically bounded the political life of Iraq since we left . ”

A March break holiday in the U.S. sunbelt is getting more expensive for Canadians as the loonie continues its downward slide .
Today , the Canadian dollar closed at its lowest level in nearly five years after the economy was hit with more bad news , this time in the housing sector .
The loonie fell to close at 76.98 cents U.S. , down 0.45 of a cent today , its lowest level since September 2004 .
The dollar traded down as much as 1.20 cents earlier in the day to as low as 76.53 cents US .
A report today showed Canadian housing starts fell for the sixth straight month in February , down 12.3 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 134,600 units .
February 's figures are a 30 per cent drop from the same period last year .
The drop in the Canadian dollar came despite a rise in oil prices .
The April crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $ 1.55 to US$ 47.07 – its highest close in two months .
Typically the loonie rises with oil prices because of Canada 's strong oil and gas sector .
" Given the fact that the TSX is doing so badly , reflecting pessimism in the economy , and the cutting of interest rates ... .
These are n't good for the Canadian dollar , " said CIBC economist Benjamin Tal .
BMO Capital Markets economist Douglas Porter said the Canadian dollar 's fortunes are tied to global stock markets , which are falling along with the Toronto Stock Exchange .
That 's despite recent kudos Canada has received for having one of the more stable global economies .
The World Economic Forum said last fall that Canada had the soundest banking system in the world .
" Unfortunately all of Canada 's wonderful fundamentals are n't standing in the way of an even weaker Canadian dollar and they are n't standing in the way of what is a tidal wave of very negative news from outside our borders , " Porter said .
He said the loonie 's dive today was also due to the U.S. greenback gaining ground against most major global currencies .
" During these times of extreme stress on financial markets globally , investors are going to the old safe harbour of the U.S. dollar , " Porter said .
" Despite all the warts on the U.S. economy and the U.S. financial markets , it is still the most liquid market there and is still seen as a relatively safe haven . "
Travel agencies say while most March break vacations are booked , the dollar 's slide will impact spending money for those travelling down south , or west .
Tom Sherlock , manager of Travel By Design in Vancouver , said Hawaii is one destination where the all - inclusive packages are n't a common concept , so travellers headed there will be forking over more Canadian dollars if the loonie keeps dropping .
Sherlock also said the " psychological " impact of the loonie 's descent began when it fell below 80 cents U.S.
He said the next noticeable change will happen if the loonie dives below 75 cents US .
However , Sherlock said what is affecting people most when booking a vacation is not the dollar , but the overall economy .

" The lack of confidence that people are going through is the major factor on the dwindling travel revenue that is out there , " he said .
Over a month since hostilities halted , much of the Gaza Strip remains in ruins , untouched since it was obliterated by the Israeli invasion .
The issue is n’t money : Saudi Arabia ’s pledge of $ 1 billion soon after the war ended has been followed up by major pledges from across the world .
But even flush with promises of donations , the reconstruction cannot begin in earnest , because the Israeli government is continuing to block raw materials .
Before the war begin , the Israeli government had already enforced a massive blockade on the strip , barring the importation of everything from clothing and shoes to key construction materials like steel , cement and glass , citing their fears that any of those things might have a military use for the Hamas government .
But the blockades have remained in place even after the war ended , and with no reliable source of cement or steel , all the money in the world cannot rebuild the strip .
And even though the Gaza issue has moved off the front page in the wake of Israel ’s contentious election results , the US State Department is concerned by what Israel is doing , not just with reconstruction supplies but with humanitarian aid .
The outgoing Olmert Administration has stalled the shipment of aid as a bargaining tool to try to force Hamas to return a captured soldier , and Secretary Clinton has had officials warn Israel that “ the US expects Israel to meet its commitments on this matter . ”
Israel has a strict list of approved “ humanitarian aid items ” and refuses to broaden it .
One source condemned it as outrageous , adding “ why should a senior American official issue a protest on pasta in order for us to recognize that we need to allow it into the Gaza Strip . ”
Consider the paradox .
We are living , as politicians never tire of saying and everyone under the age of 80 now agrees , through unprecedented economic times .
Yet , at the same time , domestic party politics still goes on more or less as before .
Common sense and history both say this disjunction cannot last .
Right on cue , this week brought early evidence of a bit of potential reshaping of British politics .
If nothing else , the fresh Labour leadership speculation is a sign that the economic hurricane is starting to shake some political trees .
But perhaps it is also the start of a wider uprooting .
History suggests that seismic events redraw the British political map , though always in different ways .
Both world wars certainly had an effect of this kind .
The first war completed the " strange death " of the once mighty Liberals and opened the way for Labour .
The second war allowed Labour to re-emerge as a party of majority government and to create the welfare state .
More significantly in the current context , the slump of 1929 - 31 also rewrought the political calculus .
The creation of a national government split both the Labour party and the remaining Liberals , rekindled the Independent Labour party , and gave both communists and fascists their moment on the national stage .
Throughout all these changes there was only one significant constant .
The Conservative party won working majorities before and shortly after the first war , before and after the second , and before and after the 1930s slump .
Today the polls suggest the party is poised to bounce back once more to form another majority government .
Those polls also suggest something else .
Since the turn of the year , they have been marked by three distinct party trends .
The Conservatives are strengthening .
Labour is weakening .
But , third , the Liberal Democrats are recovering too .
Granted , the green shoots of this Lib Dem recovery are distinctly modest so far .
There are also 15 months to go before probable polling day , so a lot can change .
The headline events have been two scores of 22 % in separate polls this month - the same level of support the Lib Dems reached in the 2005 election .
In other polls the party still languishes in the teens , as it has done for much of the last three years .
Compared with the second half of the last parliament , when Lib Dem ratings rarely dipped below 20 % , this is not spectacular .
But the momentum is currently upwards and is reflected in net gains in local byelections since the turn of the year too .
If a Lib Dem recovery really is happening , why is this ?
Part of the answer is that Lib Dem strength reflects Labour weakness and decline .
As voters who have stuck with Labour through the early part of the recession lose confidence in Gordon Brown 's government and see it as a spent force , a proportion of them are turning not to the Conservatives , as they did for much of the last three years , but to smaller parties , particularly the Lib Dems .
But there is also a more positive logic to the slow accretion of support .
Everyone agrees that treasury spokesman Vince Cable is having a good crisis .
Cable saw the collapse coming and he continues to set the agenda - currently over bonuses and bank nationalisation .
His appeal reaches beyond party .
If the Lib Dems have any sense they will put Cable front and centre of everything they do before the election - a double act with Nick Clegg rather like those of the Alliance in the 1980s is being planned .
Thanks to Cable , the Lib Dems also think they may have stumbled upon their Iraq moment .
It is certainly possible .
Just as the party 's opposition to the Iraq war reaped large electoral dividends in 2005 - when a million Labour voters moved to the Lib Dems - so their clarity of analysis and prescription on the financial crisis equips the party to make a powerful pitch to voters in 2010 .
The longer the recession goes on , the stronger will be its three - part pitch - Labour has failed , you can't trust the Tories and the Lib Dems got it right .
It will frame the attempt to defend the party 's 63 seats next year .
More important still , it provides them with a powerful weapon in the northern Labour seats in which the Lib Dems are looking to pick up new victories when the election comes .
Judged by the big picture , it may seem perverse to argue that this embryonic shift from Labour to Lib Dem is yet a major development .
The main shift in public opinion , after all , remains from Labour ( and Lib Dem ) to Tory .
But this secondary Labour to Lib Dem swing , if sustained through to a general election that Labour loses badly , may do more than simply enable Clegg 's party to hold its own .
If accompanied by the Lib Dems ' usual campaign dividend ( a 6 % improvement from start to finish in both 1997 and 2001 , but only 2 % in 2005 ) , and by significant tactical voting ( a recent internal poll for the party found only 15 % of voters would never think of voting Lib Dem ) we could be witnessing the first election since 1983 in which there is a real contest for second place in the popular vote .
Such a result would have lasting effects on British politics , putting the Lib Dems in a position to reclaim the mantle of progressivism from Labour .
Whether this happens will depend above all on what happens to Labour before and after the election .
If current trends are continued , however , Labour is looking at the loss of up to 150 seats .
That would take the party back towards its 1983 level of 209 MPs , but without the organisation and collective ethos that enabled the Neil Kinnock - era party to begin the march back to power .
Irrespective of who succeeds Gordon Brown , the defeated Labour party of 2010 will be a much weaker , more confused and rudderless party than its 1983 predecessor , in which there was a clear strategy about how to proceed .
By comparison , the 2010 Labour party will struggle to articulate what it is for and to whom it wishes to appeal .
A generation ago , there was much hot talk about breaking the mould of British politics .
It did n't happen , and the sensible pragmatist will still say such a thing is unlikely .
But these are exceptional times and the old political order cannot expect to emerge unscathed .
The strange death of Labour England ?
It ca n't be ruled out .

Everything in the universe has some degree of free will .
Even quantum particles .
An elemental particle “ decides ” which way to spin .
A cosmic ray decides when to decay .
Not consciously , but choose they do .
A new paper co-authored by mathematician John Conway , inventor of a cellular automata demonstration known as the Game of Life , argues that you ca n’t explain the spin or decay of particles by randomness , nor are they determined , so free will is the only option left .
The Strong Free Will Theorem ( PDF ) is a technical paper , but they insert a few passages in English :
It asserts , roughly , that if indeed we humans have free will , then elementary particles already have their own small share of this valuable commodity .
More precisely , if the experimenter can freely choose the directions in which to orient his apparatus in a certain measurement , then the particle ’s response ( to be pedantic — the universe ’s response near the particle ) is not determined by the entire previous history of the universe .
***
Some readers may object to our use of the term “ free will ” to describe the indeterminism of particle responses .
Our provocative ascription of free will to elementary particles is deliberate , since our theorem asserts that if experimenters have a certain freedom , then particles have exactly the same kind of freedom .
Indeed , it is natural to suppose that this latter freedom is the ultimate explanation of our own .
COLORADO SPRINGS — Disgraced minister Ted Haggard will be establishing a youth camp for good - looking teen boys .
A press release issued from Haggard ’s bedroom touts the camp as a “ place for handsome teenage males to explore their attractiveness and bond with other like - bodied boys and an older man . ”
COLORADO SPRINGS — Disgraced evangelical preacher Ted Haggard will be establishing a youth camp for good - looking teen boys .
A press release issued from Haggard ’s bedroom touts the camp as a “ place for handsome teenage males to explore their attractiveness and bond with other like - bodied boys and an older man . ”
In 2006 , Haggard was removed from his position as head pastor of the New Life Church after admitting to ongoing sexual encounters with a male prostitute .
“ When you ’re a good - looking teenage boy , you are often shunned by your less - than - pretty friends and misunderstood by your jealous families , ” explained Haggard in an interview with CNN ’s Larry King .
“ We want to make these young men feel included , feel desired , feel anything they want .
It will be a positive , spirit - raising two weeks , spent with a compassionate male mentor in a secluded garden section of my backyard . ”
Some in the community have expressed skepticism at Haggard ’s motives .
Jane Fendall , president of Mothers Against Pedophile Pastors ( MAPP ) , said this is all a ruse for Haggard to have more gay sex .
“ We know this creep has had sexual encounters with other men and then lied about it , ” she said .
“ We ’re warning parents : keep your kids away from this so - called ‘ camp . ' ”
Haggard denied the allegations .
“ Sure , it will be hard for me to refrain from having certain feelings for the boys , ” he said .
“ I admit that every day that I tutor these fine - looking lads , I will be tormented with lust and possessed with demonic sexual impulses that I must control .
But it ’s the price that I will pay to make sure these hunks of male adolescent flesh are able to experience the wonders and joys of a simple touch of same - sex genitalia , the flash of a man-teat , the moist tip of an understanding tongue , and the comfort of watching videos from the lap of an unclothed father figure . ”
Haggard claimed the camp will be open to boys of every kind .
“ We ’ll have boys there with tall , slender bodies , boys with sinewy calves and boys with sweaty biceps , ” said the pastor - cum - gay sex addict .
“ Discrimination will not be tolerated at Camp Haggard . ”

Like Final Fantasy XII before it , it looks like FFXIII will be a huge game .
But just how big will it be ?
Well , according to producer Yoshinori Kitase , the game will use all of the processing power of the PlayStation 3 console .
" Does n't the demo use about 50 percent of its power ?
Of course , I think the retail version will make use of nearly 100 percent , " Kitase told Dengeki PlayStation 3 magazine ( translation via Kotaku ) .
He also added that because of the space afforded by Blu - Ray and the PS3's hard drive , the game wo n't require any form of disc - swapping .
In Japan the game will only be seeing release on the PS3 , so Kitase made no mention of the Xbox 360 version that will be coming to other territories .
But if the title does indeed rely so heavily on Blu-ray and the processing power of the PS3 , it makes us wonder how that will affect the 360 version .
It 's likely the 360 version will end up shipping on multiple discs .
While we still do n't have a release date for the game , Japanese gamers are gearing up for the long - awaited demo , which will ship with the Blu-ray release of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children .
As for when we can expect to play the full game , Kitase only said that " we are finishing up the tail end of the development . "

Getting into Broadmoor is almost as difficult as getting out .
It 's not just the mobile , tape recorder and camera that have to go .
Watches , phone cards , sticky tape and Tic Tacs are off limits too .
On the second of two full - body searches , a security guard discovers a tiny plastic sachet containing a spare button still attached to the inside of my new shirt .
" No plastic bags , " she barks , confiscating it .
Passing out of the gauntlet of security and into the hospital courtyard , there is an eerie silence , disturbed only by quiet footfalls on gravel and the vague clink of security gates .
The towering , wire - topped fences that loom in every direction around the leafy grounds belie the hospital 's apparent pleasantness .
The Moors Murderer , Ian Brady , the Yorkshire Ripper , Peter Sutcliffe , and the East End gangster Reggie Kray have all been guests inside these walls .
Beyond the courtyard is the redbrick arch of the entrance to the old lunatic asylum .
Broadmoor opened in 1863 , in the Berkshire village of Crowthorne , as the country 's first purpose - made home for the criminally insane .
Its hanging clock must once have had a foreboding aspect for hapless " lunatics " offloaded underneath it from horse - drawn ambulances , unlikely to ever again see the outside world .
Today , it looks toy - like , almost comical , dwarfed by the colossal , snaking walls that shield it , along with a jumble of newer buildings , from the outside world .

Newest of all is the Paddock Centre , its smooth , clean curves out of place against the crumbling charm of the Victorian buildings .
The £ 36 m centre was made to accommodate some of the most difficult patients a psychiatrist is likely to encounter : sex offenders with Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder ( DSPD ) .
These individuals number among Britain 's most dangerous criminals .
Until recently , many psychiatrists had washed their hands of these offenders .
Patients with DSPD are not mentally ill , and so technically they cannot be " cured " .
Their disorder is considered to be permanent : it is , quite simply , a severely anti-social personality .
Some are still serving sentences but others served their time long ago .
They are held here indefinitely , not because they need treatment for a mental illness , but because they are simply too dangerous for release into the community .
The DSPD programme aims to do what some psychiatrists believe to be impossible : to teach these individuals to control the destructive impulses which make them a danger to the public , and to eventually release them .
The project is being piloted at four secure locations nationwide and will cost the taxpayer about £ 126 m over three years .
We 're here at the invitation of Tony Maden , a professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College , who is the head clinician at the Paddock Unit .
He is keen to explain the work undertaken here and to destigmatise its therapeutic techniques .
" It 's true that you can't ' cure ' DSPD , " he says .
" But whether you can help these people is rather more complicated .
Can you help people with terminal cancer ?
You certainly can't cure them .
But you can give them things to help them to live a more normal life . "
Professor Maden is a slight man , weighed down at the waist by a pendulous jangle of keys and a personal attack alarm .
As we make our way through the Paddock unit 's long , primrose - coloured corridors , our dialogue is punctuated by an unrelenting rhythm of slams and bolts .
We pass through wave after wave of heavy , reinforced doors which must be unlocked and then immediately locked again after we pass through .
From the safety of the nursing station , which sits like a goldfish ball between the two DSPD wards , there is an opportunity for a guilty sideways glance at the patients themselves .
Professor Maden gestures towards a group of tubby , unkempt men slumped listlessly on a sofa in front of Escape to the Country .
" Obesity is a bit of a problem here , " he admits .
Many of the patients receive benefits , because they are no longer serving time , but have nothing to spend them on except ready meals from the Broadmoor convenience store .
Some of them , he says , eat two of these a day on top of their three free canteen meals .
Arguably , the extra pounds are the least of their worries .
Each one of these men is a serious , violent offender .
The nature of their disorder means these patients are typically bullying , manipulative , pathologically deceptive , and highly impulsive .
They act recklessly , with appalling consequences , and often fail to feel remorse .
Most are paedophiles , rapists or murderers .

" You never become hardened to the terrible things these patients have done , " says Professor Maden .
" One patient I treated would assault boys of the age of about six .
He 'd just jump on them in a toilet or something .
Very frightening for the child , of course .
He could not stop doing it .
He would be in prison for five years – and it's no fun being in prison as a sex offender – and then three months after being released he'd do it again .
And if you let him out now , give him three months and he'd be jumping on a six - year - old boy again . "
Excited by the appearance of Professor Maden in the nursing station , a patient approaches the glass window , and starts shouting through a small hatch between patients and staff .
" Tony ? Tony ? "
He shouts .
" I want an interview with you .
I want the request form . "
Professor Maden smiles apologetically .
" All right , All right , " he replies without looking up .
Bored , the patient walks away , leaving a faint circle of condensation on the glass .
While held in the unit , the patients must complete a range of courses , which aim to teach them to manage their anger and sexual impulses .
" It 's not about them lying on a couch and talking freely , " says Professor Maden .
" It is very much like adult education .
It is very structured and directed .
They have to complete specific courses and meet certain goals .
And if they 're not toeing the line , they 're out . "
But treating these individuals is a laborious process .
It can take months – and sometimes a lie detector test – before a patient will start to tell doctors the truth .
" They start off by saying , ' I did n't do it ' . "
Professor Maden explains .
" Self deception is practically universal in sex offenders .
Then they will say , 'oh , it just happened ' , or ' I was provoked into it ' , or ' I was led on ' , or ' I was drunk ' . "
Patients are then offered group therapies , which they often attempt to subvert .
" That 's a daily occurrence " , says Professor Maden .
" They go off on a tangent , verbally attack other people , deny that they 've ever had any problems . "
Finally , they are taught how to reduce their risk of re-offending in the community .
" In the same way that you tell alcoholics not to structure their social lives around pubs , you would say to a paedophile : look , you can't work as a babysitter . "
So what motivates them to complete the treatment ?
" Self interest , " says Professor Maden .
" The key to treating people with psychopathy is getting them to understand that it is in their best interests to do it because otherwise they will be locked up for the rest of their lives .
We are dealing with people who are very , very selfish . "
Inevitably , the idea of spending large amounts of public money on such individuals has been controversial .
The service has attracted criticism for its alleged " cushy " treatment of offenders .
In the Paddock unit , the computer lab , football table and indoor cinema - style projector give the impression of a youth club , even if the windowless isolation cells , where patients are locked up when they are violent , tell a different story .
Even more controversial is the prospect of releasing individuals which society has marked as dangerous .
When the rapist Lee Porritt was released from the Paddock unit last June , he boasted to The Sun that he had blagged his way through the therapies , convincing medics he was cured , when really he still had fantasies of raping , burning and biting girls aged 11 or 12 .
The result was a PR disaster for the DSPD programme .
The Sun ran a front - page story with the headline " I 'm a psycho rapist ... why did Broadmoor let me out ? " and a leader which accused the hospital of " criminal irresponsibility " in releasing Porritt .
Patients on the DSPD unit now like to wind staff up by threatening to " go to The Sun " if they are released .
Professor Maden will not be drawn on Porritt 's case , although he points out that doctors at Broadmoor do not have the final say on a patient 's release .
And he says The Sun 's criticism of the service was " ridiculous " , insisting that it is in the public interest to treat people with DSPD .
" The worst thing for the victim of a sexual offence is knowing their attacker had done it before , and no one had done anything to prevent it happening again , " says Professor Maden .
" I am interested in victims and I see the programme that we run as part of doing something to reduce the chances of re-offending .
Some psychiatrists do n't see that as a proper job for doctors .
I do . "
Professor Maden concedes that some of his patients , particularly those who are psychopathic paedophiles , are unlikely to ever be suitable for release into the community .
" If you have these sexual impulses , combined with psychopathy , which is essentially an inability to feel empathy with your victims , that is a very toxic combination , " he says .
" With some patients , you are unlikely to make any process without chemical castration . "
But he insists that , even in these extreme cases , the treatments offered at Broadmoor are a justifiable use of resources .
" The question for me is : do we as a society want to label any specific group as a subhuman species beyond all help ?
I just think socially that 's wrong .
Just as it is no longer acceptable to say that someone who has had a brain injury is incurable , with all that that implies , to me it should no longer be socially acceptable to say : you 're a psychopath , so nothing can be done for you . "
Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder
DSPD is not a clinical diagnosis .
It refers to a group of patients who have a severe personality disorder , who pose considerable risk of harm to others , and who meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act .
The term was not introduced by psychiatrists , but by a 1999 government consultation paper .
Within psychiatry , opinion is divided on whether DSPD is a useful term , and on whether therapies for this group are effective .
Some medics argue there is no proof that the treatments actually work .
The efficacy of new medical treatments is usually tested in randomised control trials , which compare the progress of patients receiving treatment with a " control group " of patients who are not .
However , because patients with DSPD are so dangerous , some medics claim it is inappropriate to have a control group who are not receiving care .
A recent report claimed that there was still " an absence of evidence from any source for most of the interventions currently used in the programme , " due to the lack of effective randomised control trials .
Psychiatrist Professor Peter Tyrer , who has conducted leading research on DSPD , says he found little evidence that the patients were responding .
" Every treatment known to man has been suggested for this group and the costs are absolutely enormous , " he says .
" And we 've got no idea what 's working and what is n't working because nobody has really run a control group . "
However , if treatments were not available to this group , it would be unlawful to detain them under the Mental Health Act .

Nearly 20 million consumers had their credit lines reduced or eliminated over a six - month period in 2008 through no fault of their own , but credit scores overall were largely unaffected , according to a study released today by credit scoring giant FICO .
FICO conducts ongoing research to see how well its scores hold up under real - world conditions .
As banks continued to tighten access to credit last year , FICO decided to consider how lowered credit limits and closed accounts were altering borrowers ’ FICO credit scores .
The key finding of the study : Not much .
Although consumers who saw negative items appear on their credit reports experienced a slight drop in credit scores , borrowers overall experienced little change to their FICO scores , since lenders primarily targeted consumers with already solid credit histories for account closures and line reductions .
For borrowers as a whole , the median FICO score remained unchanged over the time period considered .
That is good news for consumers worried about how changes beyond their control could impact their access to credit .
“ For approximately 88 percent of consumers , the movement of their scores during this period was relatively small and would have had little to no impact on credit - granting decisions , ” FICO says .
What about FICO ?
FICO scores are snapshots of consumers ’ borrowing behavior condensed into to a three - digit number .
Part of the score ’s calculation depends on the amount of credit currently in use compared to the total amount of credit the borrower has available .
This ratio , known as the credit utilization ratio , therefore changes when a bank suddenly decides to trim a borrower ’s access to credit .
Since FICO scores consider more than just a borrower ’s credit utilization , the movement of other factors also have an impact .
“ If we could hold all other conditions constant , we would expect that a reduction in available revolving credit would either have no impact on an individual ’s FICO score or would cause it to decrease , ” FICO says in a press release .
“ In reality , the information on credit reports seldom stays fixed or constant .
Our research shows that an individual ’s score may go down , go up or stay the same after the lender reduces a borrower ’s credit limit or closes the account . ”
Interactive : How FICO 08 changes
will impact you After a number of delays , credit score creator FICO ( formerly known as Fair Isaac ) finally introduced its updated scoring model in late January 2009 .
That new credit scoring model — known as FICO 08 — is designed to more accurately predict consumer borrowing behavior , such as the likelihood that a borrower will be able to repay a loan .
While FICO acknowledges that credit card issuers have traditionally lowered the amount of revolving credit offered to borrowers or closed inactive credit card accounts to control risk exposure , the latest moves by banks come during a time of unusual strain for the lending industry .
As losses mount , banks are actually targeting borrowers with solid credit histories .
“ What appears unusual in the current environment is adjustments by many lenders to the amount of credit available to customers whose credit reports do not contain recent indications of increased riskiness , ” FICO says .
Solid credit histories mean little change
During the period considered by the study — April 2008 to October 2008 — FICO found 16 percent of consumers had their credit limits reduced .
The bulk of that group ( 11 percent ) was made up of borrowers who did n’t have any record of a “ risk trigger ” — a late payment , account in collections or public record — added to their credit report during those six months .
That group appears to be most representative of the U.S. population at large , since FICO says approximately 80 percent of U.S. borrowers had no risk trigger added to their credit reports between April and October of last year .
One major reason credit scores did n’t suffer is that card issuers snatched credit from those who had good scores to start with .
Banks apparently targeted borrowers with inactive or low credit card balances , a group that was generally very low - risk , with a median FICO score of 770 and credit cards that tended to have very low balances , low credit- utilization ratios , very few ( if any ) missed payments and lengthy credit histories .
On average , FICO says that lenders cut the total revolving credit available to borrowers with no risk - triggers by $ 2,200 — a total FICO deems “ a relatively small amount . ”
FICO says that was about 5 percent of the total revolving credit available ( $ 44,000 ) to this group during the six months it considered in the study .
For nearly 44 percent of the group , FICO says credit reductions amounted to $ 1,000 or less .
As these reductions were taking place , credit utilization ratios for this segment of borrowers rose , but only slightly , from 22 percent to 26 percent .
FICO says that slight increase indicates that many of these borrowers were maintaining or reducing ( rather than increasing ) their credit card balances .
“ Such credit behavior would help to minimize the impact to their FICO scores , ” FICO says .
Still , consumer advocates do n’t necessarily find the data reassuring .
“ I find it interesting that so many people suffered reductions in credit limits apparently for no good reason , ” says Linda Sherry , national priorities director for nonprofit consumer rights group Consumer Action in Washington , D.C .
Meanwhile , according to FICO ’s study , an interesting thing appears to have happened : Low - risk borrowers saw little movement in their FICO scores , with a median of 770 in October .
FICO says those scores are due to lender updates to credit reports which “ reflected good credit habits such as paying bills on time , paying down revolving debt and taking on new credit sparingly . ”
More widely , when credit scores did change , they did n’t change by much .
FICO says that the majority of score movements over the six months remained within a range of 20 points up or down .
Some borrowers did see larger swings : Roughly 4 percent saw their FICO scores tumble by 40 percent or more , and about 6 percent saw their FICO scores climb by 40 points or more .
That could raise borrowing costs for an unfortunate few .
“ I think a 40 - point reduction , depending on where you were to begin with , can put you into a higher interest rate category on new credit , ” says Sherry .

Deflation returned to Britain for the first time in nearly five decades last month as prices measured by the retail price index ( RPI ) were lower than the same time a year ago .
That will add to the chancellor , Alistair Darling 's problems as he prepares to deliver his latest budget tomorrow .
Figures out tomorrow morning are likely to show another big jump in unemployment to the highest level in over a decade .
David Kern , chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) , said : " The RPI is in negative territory and fell by more than expected .
Deflationary pressures could make the recession worse in the short - term , despite quantitative easing and the huge budget deficit posing inflationary pressures over the medium - term .
" The chancellor must address both these conflicting risks in his budget .
He must support business and administer targeted fiscal stimulus for the year ahead .
But , he also has to present a credible medium - term plan for restoring the public finances back to health . "
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury , Philip Hammond , said : " The return of deflation to Britain for the first time in nearly 50 years adds to the woes of the British economy .
" With unemployment rising at the fastest rate on record , our public sector deficit the highest in the G20 , and our recession looking likely to be the longest since the war , this is another nail in the coffin of Gordon Brown 's economic reputation . "
The Office for National Statistics said the RPI was 0.4 % lower in March than it had been in March 2008 .
That was the first negative reading since March 1960 , when Harold Macmillan was prime minister and John F Kennedy was running for the US presidency .
On the government 's preferred consumer price index measure , which excludes housing and mortgage costs , inflation was still comfortably in positive territory , at 2.9 % .
CPI is much higher here than the 0.6 % figure for the eurozone and economists say the falling pound has pushed up some import prices , delaying the drop in the CPI .
A short period of falling prices should help consumers because it will make their increasingly squeezed income go further .
However , if prices continue falling for a long period and deflation becomes entrenched , that can have an adverse effect on the economy as consumers continually hold off making purchases in the expectation of lower prices .
This in turn forces firms to cut wages and sets off a damaging spiral .
Committed to quantitative easing
Figures from the Bank of England show that a third of firms have agreed pay freezes in recent months and some have cut pay .
Workers at Honda 's car plant in Swindon were recently told they will have to take a 10 % pay cut this year , after a similar announcement by Toyota to its workers in Derby .
Japan suffered a prolonged period of deflation in its " lost decade " of the 1990s and policy makers in Britain have thrown a huge stimulus at the British economy in the shape of tax and interest rate cuts in a bid to prevent deflation taking hold .
Colin Ellis , economist at Daiwa Securities , said : " With deflation now having arrived , the overwhelming priority is to ensure that this period of falling prices is short - lived . "
Speaking to the Treasury select committee today , new Bank of England monetary policy committee member Paul Fisher said he was concerned that the Bank could miss its 2 % CPI target " on the downside " as the big oil price rises of spring 2008 drop out of the figures in the coming months .
Fisher stressed that the MPC remained committed to its policy of " quantitative easing " , by which it is seeking to pump £ 75 bn of new money into the economy to breathe life into it .
Fuel and vegetables
The ONS said the largest downward effect on inflation came from falling gas and heating oil bills .
Food and non-alcoholic drinks also pushed inflation down with the largest effect coming from vegetables , where prices fell by more than a year ago across a range of products .
Transport costs also pushed the figure down .
This was mainly because of lower air fares on European routes .
There was also an effect from fuel , which is rising less this year than it was at the same time last year .
The average price of petrol rose by 0.9 p a litre between February and March to 90.4 p but this compares with a rise of 2.3 p a litre last year .
" The inflation data do little to dispel expectations that interest rates are set to stay at 0.5 % for an extended period and that the Bank of England could eventually extend its quantitative easing programme , " said Howard Archer , economist at IHS Global Insight .
" The danger of an extended , deep recession still outweighs inflation risks . "

Reform of the financial system is on top of the agenda at the G20 summit China 's central bank has called for a new global reserve currency run by the International Monetary Fund to replace the US dollar .
Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan did not explicitly mention the dollar , but said the crisis showed the dangers of relying on one currency .
With the world 's largest currency reserves of $ 2tn , China is the biggest holder of dollar assets .
Its leaders have often complained about the dollar 's volatility .
China has long been uneasy about relying on the dollar for trade and to store its reserves and recently expressed concerns that Washington 's efforts to rescue the US economy could erode the value of the currency .
His speech was , unusually , published in both Chinese and English , signalling it was intended for an international audience .
CURRENCY RESERVES
Foreign currency held by a government or a central bank Used to pay foreign debt obligations or influence exchange rates
The dollar is viewed as the world 's reserve currency as the vast majority of reserves are held in the US currency Smaller amounts are held in euros , pounds and yen
China presses G20 reform plans
" The outbreak of the crisis and its spillover to the entire world reflected the inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system , " said Mr Zhou in an essay on the People 's Bank of China website .
Mr Zhou said the primacy of the US currency in the financial system had led to increasingly frequent crises since the collapse in the early 1970s of the system of fixed exchange rates .
On Tuesday , the dollar weakened against most major currencies following the announcement of a US plan to buy up toxic debt .
' Light in tunnel '
Mr Zhou said the dollar could eventually be replaced as the world 's main reserve currency by the Special Drawing Right ( SDR ) , which was created as a unit of account by the IMF in 1969 .
" The role of the SDR has not been put into full play , due to limitations on its allocation and the scope of its uses , " he said .
" However , it serves as the light in the tunnel for the reform of the international monetary system . "
The essay comes before the G20 summit in London on 2 April , at which reform of the international financial system is top of the agenda .
" This confirms that China intends to play fully its role of global economic and political power at the next G20 summit , " said Sebastien Barbe , an analyst at French financial service firm Calyon in Hong Kong .

65 Observations about the 2009 NFL Draft
I ’m going to channel my inner Peter King and dole out a crap load of quick - hit thoughts on last weekend ’s NFL draft , which by the way , was one of the more unpredictable drafts I have ever witnessed .
Below are 65 observations from the 2009 NFL Draft .
Why 65 ?
I do n’t know – do n’t worry about it .
Originally I came up with 62 , but I know that some people freak out when things are n’t in round numbers , so I added three more .
But the number 65 means nothing , so do n’t waste time searching for its meaning .
Obviously these are all my opinions and feel free to debate them .
But before you do , I already know that it supposedly takes three seasons to fully grade a draft and that no prospect is a sure thing .
Again , I ’m projecting here – so lighten up and let ’s strike up some good debates .
1. Outside of the fact that he ’s now a millionaire and could buy a small country , I kind of feel bad for Matthew Stafford .
You know some halfwit fan or media member can’t wait to utter the comment , “ For $ 72 million , he should have made that pass . ”
I hate the fact that money plays such a huge role in sports because when you get down to it , completing a pass , making a catch or kicking a field goal has nothing to do with how many zeros are on your paycheck .
2 . I know I ’m not saying anything new here , but the rookie salary structure is a joke .
When teams do n’t even want a top 5 pick anymore because of the financial burden that comes with it , there ’s a huge problem .
3 . The kid could turn out to be the next Ryan Leaf on the field , but Lion fans have to at least take comfort in the fact that Matthew Stafford is saying all the right things at this point .
He did an interview with the NFL Network on Sunday and he talked about how he wants to be a starter right away , but also wants to learn and be patient in his development .
From all accounts , he looks like he has a great head on his shoulders .
4 . If Tyson Jackson turns out to be the next Richard Seymour like Chiefs ’ GM Scott Pioli believes , then nobody is going to remember ( or care ) that he was taken with the third overall pick in a weak draft class .
5 . Out of all the prospects to come out of this draft class , I ’m going to find myself rooting the hardest for Aaron Curry .
It was incredibly heartwarming to see him bring a 12 - year old leukemia survivor to the draft and it was touching to see how emotionally happy he was on the stage after his name was announced .
You can tell that the young man takes nothing for granted in life .
6 . Jet fans are excited that they have a quarterback for the future , as well they should be .
But I ca n’t help but think about how if Mark Sanchez had waited to come out next year , there ’s a good chance he would be the third quarterback taken behind Sam Bradford and Colt McCoy .
Yet he was a top 5 pick in this year ’s draft and the Jets had to trade two high picks and three players in order to select him .
Yikes .
7 . I absolutely loved what Cleveland did in the first round .
They not only saved a truck load of money by trading out of the top 5 , but they also did n’t reach for a prospect just to fill a need and acquired a ton of picks by continuously trading down .
8 . I loved all of Cleveland ’s wheeling and dealing in the first round , but not as much as I loved the acquisition of safety Abram Elam as part of the deal for the No. 5 pick .
He is one of the most underrated players in the league and he obviously is a fit for Eric Mangini ’s defensive scheme .
Besides having the desire to get out of the top 5 , Elam was the key component to that entire trade for the Browns .
9 . Some may hammer the Browns for taking a center in the first round , but many considered Alex Mack the type of prospect that could change the way teams draft the position in the future .
Plus , you have to love how Cleveland continues to upgrade the most important unit on the football field : the offensive line .
10 . The Bengals never learn do they ?
Andre Smith is incredibly talented but he carries more baggage with him than a 787 .
11 . Darrius Heyward - Bey could turn out to be a solid deep threat in the NFL , but Michael Crabtree has the potential to be one of the best receivers in the game for a very long time .
Not that he cares , but Al Davis is nuts for passing on the talented Texas Tech product .
12 . Speaking of Crabtree , one of the potential reasons of why he fell as far as he did could be because of his attitude .
Cleveland was apparently turned off by his “ diva ” persona during a pre-draft visit , but if there is any person that can humble the young man , it ’s 49ers ’ head coach Mike Singletary .
13 . The Jaguars did incredibly well in the first two rounds .
It was n’t a flashy draft , but how often does a team land two starting - caliber offensive tackles in their first two picks ?
This was a team crippled by injuries along the O - line last season , so adding Eugene Monroe and Eben Britton was fantastic .
( Somewhere , Maurice Jones - Drew is smiling . )
14 . I ’ve hammered the Packers for much of the offseason because of the lack of attention paid to filling needs in their new 3 - 4 defense .
But GM Ted Thompson came through at No. 9 with the selection of B.J. Raji , who could play end this year and then nose next year if the team decides not to bring back Ryan Pickett , who becomes a free agent after this season .
15 . I was surprised the Bills passed on offensive tackle Michael Oher at No. 11 , but teams were worried about his ability to grasp an offense at the next level so at least Buffalo addressed its need for a pass rusher in Penn State defensive end Aaron Maybin .
16 . Should anyone really be surprised that new Broncos ’ head coach Josh McDaniels went offense at No. 12 ?
17 . Speaking of that pick , Knowshon Moreno has the best vision of any running back taken in this draft .
He ’s a stud and should do well in Denver .
18 . Washington got one of the steals of the first round when Texas defensive end Brian Orakpo fell to them at No. 13 .
He was an absolute force against Oklahoma and Texas Tech last year and should be motivated after falling out of the top 10 .
19 .
I know he had a brutal showing at the NFL scouting combine , but trust me – Malcolm Jenkins can play .
He was highly productive at Ohio State and was less of a risk than fellow cornerback prospect Vontae Davis , even though Davis has the superior athletic skills .
( More on Davis later . )
20 .
You have to hand it to the Texans .
This was the second year in a row that some believed Houston would address the running back position in the first round , but they continued to build their defense with the selection of linebacker Brian Cushing .
Maybe 2009 will finally be the year this team makes a playoff run .
21 . Larry English might not be an every down player at the next level , but what a pick by the Chargers .
They really did n’t have a ton of needs to address and English was a monster in the MAC last year .
The Bolts will find ways to get him on the field and do n’t be surprised if he piles up 7 - 10 sacks next year .
22 . I have several issues with the Bucs ’ decision to draft Josh Freeman in the first round .
First and foremost , in a better quarterback class , he might be a second or even third rounder given how raw he is as a prospect .
Secondly , why the hell did Tampa trade up to get him ?
Did they really think Denver was going to take him at No. 18 with so many holes to fill on the defensive side of the ball ?
23 . Were n’t Jon Gruden and GM Bruce Allen ridiculed and essentially ( in part ) ushered out of Tampa for concentrating too much on the quarterback position ?
Yet , the new regime of Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik have already re-signed Luke McCown , signed free agent Byron Leftwich and drafted Josh Freeman .
And oh - by - the - way , they still have Brian Griese and Josh Johnson on the roster .
I have no idea what Morris and Dominik are doing in terms of a game plan to rebuild the Bucs .
24 . Is n’t Jeremy Maclin essentially the same receiver as DeSean Jackson ?
I ’m surprised the Eagles did n’t add a bigger complement to Jackson if they were focused on drafting a receiver in the early rounds .
25 .
It ’s easy to slam Detroit ’s selection of Brandon Pettigrew at No. 20 , but what is always considered a young quarterback ’s best friend ?
A tight end – and Pettigrew is one of the better tight end prospects to come out in some time .
26 .
That said , how did the Lions not address their middle linebacker need with the No. 20 pick ?
Rey Maualuga was there for the taking and he would have filled a bigger need than Pettigrew .
Jordon Dizon is your middle linebacker , Lions ?
Seriously ?
27 .
One more note on the Lions drafting Pettigrew ; tight end is also viewed as an extension of the O - line , which was a major need for Detroit coming into the draft .
For better or worse , Pettigrew was essentially Martin Mayhew ’s answer in addressing that need .
28 . I was shocked that the Vikings selected Percy Harvin at No. 22 – not because they did n’t need a receiver , but because it was reported that Brad Childress had removed all prospects with poor character from his draft board .
This was just another example of how you ca n’t believe everything reported before the draft .
29 . Baltimore got a first round steal in offensive tackle Michael Oher .
As previously noted , some teams were worried about whether or not Oher could grasp a pro offense , but at No. 23 , he was worth the risk .
30 . Peria Jerry fits a major need for the Falcons – or does he ?
Scouts believe he ’s an under tackle at the next level and Atlanta already has a productive player at that position in Jonathan Babineaux .
Obviously Thomas Dimitroff and Mike Smith feel as though Jerry can play the nose and after the draft those two compiled last year , I trust their judgment .
31 . Vontae Davis does n’t really seem like a Bill Parcells - type does he ?
Regardless , he ’s loaded with talent and if he can keep his emotions and attitude in check , he could turn out be a solid corner .
32 . My coworker John Paulsen and I are going to do more on this topic soon ( so check back ) , but I thought the Packers ’ deal with the Patriots at No. 26 was the worst trade of the first round .
Green Bay filled a huge need with the selection of outside linebacker Clay Matthews , but they gave up a second round pick and two third rounders in doing so .
Considering Matthews might be one of the more overrated prospects in the draft , I was shocked that GM Ted Thompson would give up so much for that pick .
33 .
It ’ll be interesting to see which receiver taken in the bottom of the first round ( Hakeem Nicks or Kenny Britt ) goes on to have the more productive career .
They both have great hands , above - average speed and will play for decent offenses in New York ( Giants ) and Tennessee , respectively .
34 . How did Chris “ Beanie ” Wells fall all the way to No. 31 ?
I know there are injury concerns , but he had the best blend of size , speed and strength of any running back prospect in the draft and Arizona might have gotten a steal .
35 . Some have compared Western Michigan safety Louis Delmas to Bob Sanders .
Too bad Delmas might rot in Detroit .
36 .
Far be it for me to question Bill Belichick on draft day , but Patrick Chung at No. 34 in the second round ?
That ’s freaking high .
37 . Ohio State prospect prediction # 1 : Linebacker James Laurinaitis will struggle finding a position in the pros .
38 . Ohio State prospect prediction # 2 : Brian Robiskie is going to flourish as a quality possession receiver in the NFL .
39 .
I love Alphonso Smith and think he could turn out to be a solid corner , but why would the Broncos give up a first round pick in 2010 to trade up in the second round of a weak draft ?
40 .
As long as I ’m crapping on the Broncos , did anyone tell Josh McDaniels and Brian Xanders that teams are usually more successful when they trade down , not up ?
Every time they announced a trade , it was usually Denver moving up .
I do n’t necessarily dislike the prospects they wound up with , but their approach in this draft was bizarre .
41 . Whose mother did Rey Maualuga punch for him to fall all the way to No. 38 ?
Nice pick , Bengals .
42 . Whose baby did Duke Robinson punch for him to slip all the way into the fifth round ?
How the hell does a first - round talent drop to the No. 163 overall pick ?
Nice value , Carolina .
43 . Before the draft , word was that the Patriots were absolutely in love with Connecticut cornerback Darius Butler at No. 23 .
After completely trading out of the first round , New England snagged Butler with the No. 41 overall pick in the second round .
That ’s the genius of Bill Belichick on draft day .
44 . See No. 38 , but replace the name Alphonso Smith with Everrette Brown , and the word Broncos with Panthers .
45 .
What better team for Pat White to go to than the one that founded the “ Wildcat ” formation last season ?
46 . I have no idea how he fits into an already stacked Giants ’ linebacker corps , but I love their pick of Virginia ’s Clint Sintim at No. 45 .
The guy was a monster in college .
47 . I think it was hilarious that Mel Kiper and Todd McShay bashed the Raiders ’ selection of Michael Mitchell with the No. 47 pick in the second round ( they said they could have gotten him much later ) , yet the Bears were reportedly ready to take him at No. 49 .
If Mitchell was good enough for Jerry Angelo in the second round ( I said second , not first – Lord knows Angelo ca n’t judge talent in the first ) , then chances are he ’s a better prospect than Kiper and McShay thought he was .
48 . The Eagles took two boom or bust picks in Jeremy Maclin and “ Shaddy ” McCoy in the first two rounds , but there ’s no question they added some athletic talent with each of the selections .
49 .
I do n’t care what anyone says – William Moore ( Falcons ) was the steal of the second round .
I know he had a bad senior year , but he was nicked up and had he come out after his junior season , he would have been a top 15 pick .
50 .
I still prefer NFL Network ’s coverage to ESPN’s , but Marshall Faulk and Jamie Dukes continue to bring nothing to the table .
And what was with the on - going camera trick where they kept making everyone ’s heads look bigger ?
It was funny once , but by the fourth time enough was enough .
51 . Penn State wideout Derrick Williams ( Lions ’ third round pick ) could turn out to be the next great kick returner in the NFL .
52 . Arizona might have found a gem in the third round in Alabama safety Rashad Johnson .
He ’s not a thumper , but some have compared him to a poor man ’s Ed Reed .
53 .
If Wisconsin ’s Travis Beckum ( Giants ’ third round pick ) could ever stay healthy , he could have a nice career as a pass - catching tight end .
54 . The Bears got the steal of the fourth round in Vandy cornerback D.J. Moore .
The only reason why he dropped so far was because of his lack of size ( he ’s only 5 ’ 8 ” ) .
If he were two inches taller , he would have probably been a second rounder .
Yet another mid-round gem by GM Jerry Angelo .
55 . Speaking of mid-round Jerry Angelo gems , throw Ohio State outside linebacker Marcus Freeman and Abilene Christian wideout Johnny Knox into that group , too .
56 . Atlanta had a really solid second day .
Quarterbacks mostly stayed away of cornerback Chris Owens ( third round ) at San Jose State last year and Lawrence Sidbury ( forth round ) of Richmond could turn out to be a solid pass rusher .
All in all , the Falcons filled needs and got a ton of defensive help throughout the draft .
57 .
I hate to crap on any prospect , because clearly they have more talent than I do , but I think Seattle wasted their sixth round pick on Rutgers ’ quarterback Mike Teel .
He has good arm strength , but he really struggles in his decision making I doubt he ’s long for the NFL .
But still – good luck , Mike !
58 . I know I hammered Packers ’ GM Ted Thompson for his first round trade at No. 31 on this list , but he really did put together a solid draft .
Georgia defensive end Jarius
Wynn was a nice find in the sixth round .
59 .
Someone explain to me how Fresno State tight end Bear Pascoe is not on his way to Chicago right now .
60 . Your 2009 Marques Colston Seventh Round Sleeper Award goes to : Rutgers ’ wide receiver Tiguan Underwood ( Jaguars ) .
61 . I know teams are always enamored with size and arm strength when it comes to drafting quarterbacks , but how do guys like Mike Teel and Tom Brandstater get selected before Graham Harrell ?
I know Harrell had grossly inflated numbers because he played in Texas Tech ’s offensive system , but I still ca n’t believe that no team took a flier on him in the seventh round , yet Bradstater and Teel go in the sixth .
62 . After not selecting a running back the entire draft , keep an eye on the Texans ’ interest in Edgerrin James if / when he is released by the Cardinals .
63 .
After not selecting a pass - rusher in the entire draft , keep an eye on the Patriots ’ interest in free agent defensive end Jason Taylor .
64 . One has to wonder what Anquan Boldin ’s fate is after the Giants and Titans each drafted first round receivers .
Are the Ravens still a possibility ?
And would Arizona be willing to scale back their trade demands ?
65 . Quote of the NFL draft weekend : “ How fitting is it that this year ’s Mr. Irreverent is a kicker ! ” – Rich Eisen , NFL Network .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
At least 350,000 people were affected by flooding in Namibia during the annual rainy season in southern Africa in March 2009 .
According to a report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , at least 92 people had been killed and 13,000 people were displaced as of April 1 .
Among the places affected by the heaviest rains and most severe flooding was the Caprivi Strip , a narrow “ peninsula ” of Namibia that stretches out along the Zambezi River between Zambia to the north and Botswana to the south .
This pair of natural - color images of the area was captured by the Advanced Land Imager sensor on NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 ( EO - 1 ) satellite on March 28 , 2009 ( top ) , and the Landsat 5 satellite on October 18 , 2002 ( bottom ) .
Flood waters pooled across a wide swath of the Zambezi flood plain on March 28 , and numerous towns and villages were either underwater or surrounded by floods .

the scary world of sex
For humans , sex is usually fun and exciting .
For insects and arthropods , it 's terrifying and all too often fatal ...
Generally , we humans like to think of sex as something exciting and filled with pleasures which take years to fully understand and appreciate .
But if we were certain insects or a very particular species of nautili , sex would be just plain terrifying for a very long list of reasons ranging from disembowelment to genitelia resembling torture weapons you ’d find in a Medieval knight ’s armory .
And for many of the insect world ’s males , sex is the last thing they ever do .
Literally .
Imagine yourself as a web weaving spider .
Compared to the females of your species , you are a tiny little creature and it ’s your task to somehow try and mate with her .
Now , provided that you somehow managed to tap out the right tune on her web without being run through by her huge poisonous fangs , you need to attach yourself to her underbelly and deposit your gametes .
But as you do , she ’s chewing on you .
That ’s right .
As a spider male , you ’re your mate ’s dinner and as she ’s chomping on your lower half , you have to make sure you can finish the mating before she finally digests something vital .
Another mate who might just eat you during the act is the mantis female .
While there are a few controversies about how common sexual cannibalism really is in mantises , there are cases in which a hungry female will bite off the head of her mate who continues to deposit his gametes at an even faster rate as he dies .
So if you ’re a male mantis and your potential mate is hungry , you have to wrestle with her to make sure she does n’t reach back and chew on your face with a pair of powerful mandibles .
Can you say ouch ?
Speaking of ouch , how about a little disembowelment with your climax ?
During mating , female bees which will eventually become queens of their own hives lock onto the genitals of the male drones .
When the mating is done and they separate , the male endophallus is left in the female .
The end result ?
The closest an insect can come to disembowelment .
It ’s known as popping the drone because of the popping sound as the drones ’ reproductive organs tear off .
If any males do somehow survive the mating or do n’t have a chance to mate after the females extracted all the sperm they ’ll ever need from them , they ’re chased out and soon die as their only purpose in life is to mate with a female and shed their mortal coil while she builds a new colony .
But it ’s not all bad for the males .
Sometimes , male insects get to turn the tables on the females with some frightening biological adaptations of their own .
Direct your attention to the detailed snapshot of what the penis of a male weevil looks like .
This horrifying instrument which seems to be better suited as a knight ’s flail than a reproductive organ , brutally maims whatever mates the weevil has .
A theory as to why something like this evolves states that the weevils make sure that the fertilized female wo n’t mate with anyone else while she heals her wounds , ensuring his unique genetic profile is the only one that will be transferred to the offspring .
This is backed up by the fact that the most successful males have the most menacing and spikiest genitals .
You can insert your own dirty joke here because due to this blog ’s readership , I ’d really rather not .
Finally , here ’s a trick I ’m glad never evolved in humans .
Male paper nautili reproduce by taking their reproductive organ filled with sperm packets and actually shooting it into a female which is enormous by comparison to them .
Were humans to adopt such a trait , we could never have bars , nightclubs or college parties .
Someone with a bad aim would be a menace to everyone in range and half our time would be spent trying to dodge the crossfire .
Oh and one other thing .
Humans borrowing the biology of the paper nautilus would only have one shot .
Sad , is n’t it ?
Tony 's I - 75 Restaurant in Birch Run sells a sandwich as big as your head loaded with 20 strips of bacon -- nearly 1 pound of artery - clogging , salt - cured meat .
Its banana split includes a half - gallon of ice cream .
The behemoth BLT attracted the attention of the nation via an appearance on the Travel Channel 's " Sandwich Paradise " last November .
Now , the Food Network 's " Diners , Drive-ins and Dives " wants to highlight the restaurant , 8781 Main .
" They got an overwhelming amount of calls about us being on their show , " said Steve Fritzler , 10 - year owner of the restaurant .
" You have to get a certain amount of referrals from customers . "
Fritzler said producers contacted him about three months ago and indicated they wanted to tape this summer .
On the day of filming , posted notices will warn patrons not to enter if they do n't want to appear on TV .
A representative from show producer Page Productions of Minneapolis , Minn. , would not confirm whether taping would take place .
The 25,000 - circulation Canadian " Scope RV Camping Magazine " also featured Tony's , Frankenmuth 's Bavarian Inn Restaurant and Zehnder 's Splash Village Hotel and Water Park , Old City Hall Restaurant in Bay City and the Halo Burger in the Flint area .
" Sandwich Paradise " producers and crew , four people in all , flew in from California in September to tape the Travel Channel show at Tony's .
They spent eight hours interviewing the owners , employees and customers , Fritzler said .
Business picked up after the broadcasts , including reruns earlier this month , he said .
No reruns are scheduled now , according to tvguide.com .
" I 'd say two out of 10 customers comment on seeing the show , " Fritzler said .

In the late 14th century Michel Menschein , a wealthy Viennese cloth merchant , commissioned local artists to paint a series of frescoes on the walls of his banqueting hall .
The paintings depicted a cycle of songs by Neidhart von Reuental , a 13th century minnesinger , who was particularly fond of satirising the erotic relationships between knights and peasant maidens .
While the steamy subject matter doubtlessly enlivened many of Menschein 's dinner parties , it did n't go down so well with subsequent occupiers .
When the banqueting hall came into the possession of a Catholic priest in the late 16th century , the frescoes were painted over , and remained hidden for 300 years , until their chance re-discovery in 1979 .
They now represent the oldest instance of non-religious wall painting in Vienna , and provide a unique glimpse into medieval humour and society .
But the centuries under layers of paint and plaster , as well as the laborious process of exposure , took their toll on the frescoes .
All were damaged and some were almost completely destroyed .
A restoration effort , led by Wolfgang Baatz of the Viennese Academy of Fine Arts , was duly taken up , and it was supported by a group of mathematicians , including Peter A. Markowich , Massimo Fornasier and myself .
It was an unusual collaboration , perhaps , but one which makes a lot of sense in this age of digital imagery .
Digital photographs of the frescoes are essentially mathematical objects , and this puts the vast toolbox of mathematics at the restorers ' fingertips .

Number pictures
A digital image is a mathematical object because it is an array of numbers .
Jpeg photographs created with digital cameras are rectangular objects consisting of a finite number of image points ( called pixels ) .
The image content is described by numerical values corresponding to the pixels ' colour .
To make things easier , we 'll concentrate on grey value images .
Here every pixel comes with a number between 0 ( black ) and 255 ( white ) .
The mathematical representation of a digital grey value image is a so - called image function , defined on a two - dimensional ( in general rectangular ) image domain .
The function value denotes the grey value of the image at the image point in the image domain .
Figure 2 visualises the connection between the digital image and its image function .
Figure 2 : Digital image versus image function :
The image on the left shows a zoom into a digital photograph where the image pixels ( small squares ) are clearly visible ; in the middle the grey values of the red selection in the digital photograph are displayed in a matrix form ; on the right the image function of the digital photograph is shown , with the grey value u(x , y ) plotted as the height over the ( x , y ) - plane .
In a damaged image the value of the function is unknown for a number of points
The mathematical challenge is to use the information from surrounding pixels in an optimal way , to guess what the missing values should be .
A prime candidate for completing this guesswork is an equation from an area which , on the face of it , has nothing to do with images , let alone art .
Heat flow
The heat equation Assuming , for simplicity , that the rod is flat and two - dimensional , the rate of change of temperature over time at a point is given by the partial derivative of the function with respect to time .
Fourier 's heat equation reads where are the second order partial derivatives of with respect to and respectively , and where is the thermal conductivity of the metal , a constant describing its ability to conduct heat .
whereare the second order partial derivatives ofwith respect toandrespectively , and whereis the thermal conductivity of the metal , a constant describing its ability to conduct heat .
In the early nineteenth century the mathematician Joseph Fourier became interested in the way heat propagates in solid bodies , for example metal rods : if you heat up one end of it at time zero , what will the temperature be at any point of the rod at time ?
Fourier realised that a relatively simple equation describes the way temperature changes at a given point on the rod in an instant of time .
From this information on the rate of change of temperature over time , and from information on the initial temperature conditions at time zero , it 's then possible to work out the function .
Mathematically , rates of change are described in terms of derivatives of functions , and the heat equation is what is known as a partial differential equation .
See the box on the right for more detail on the heat equation .
Diffusing images
Fourier 's equation , also known as the diffusion equation , works not just for the propagation of heat , but versions of it can be applied in many situations where the concentration of some quantity at point changes over time .
And this is where the application to images comes in .
As an example , let 's start with a function which randomly allocates a grey value to point on our rectangular image , giving the image on the left - hand side of figure 3 .
We can now let the diffusion equation do its work on the image : rather than heat , it is now the information from the various pixels that " migrates " across the image over time , changing each grey value using the information from surrounding ones .
The image on the right shows the solution for at time
The content of the initial random distribution ( which may also be identified with white noise ) is smeared out by the application of the diffusion operator .
Figure 3 : In the image on the left grey values have been randomly allocated to the pixels .
The image on the right shows the solution to the diffusion equation for t = 10 .
What happens now if we solve the diffusion equation for the image function of a real image ?
In figure 4 you can see the answer at time for an image of the sculpture V Tiempo de la VI Sinfonia Pastoral de Beethoven by Leone Tomassi , which stands in the botanical garden of Buenos Aires .
The result is not really surprising .
It 's more or less the same diffusive effect as for our random function in figure 3 .
Figure 4 : The diffusion equation applied to a digital image of a sculpture .
If we add some noise to the image before feeding it to the equation , we obtain the right image in figure 5 ( the solution for to the diffusion equation ) .
Now we might get an idea of the use of the smearing effect , namely the elimination of noise in images .
Figure 5 : The diffusion equation applied to a noisy image of the sculpture .
But let 's return to the task of repairing a damaged image .
Consider figure 6 , where several small holes have been cut into the image .
It turns out that we can rescue it using a slightly modified diffusion equation .
Roughly speaking , we now only solve the diffusion equation inside the black holes in the sculpture photograph , using the grey values from the surrounding of the holes as an input to the equation .
In other words , the grey values inside the holes are constructed by " averaging " the grey values located around the holes .
This process is called inpainting .
The right image in figure 6 shows the result .
Figure 6 : The diffusion equation applied to a damaged image .
The process of inpainting using the diffusion equation is just a first naive approach to the challenge of completing damaged images .
Several more sophisticated approaches involving partial differential equations have been proposed in the last eight years .
Among them is inpainting using a so - called total variation flow ( TV ) , instead of the pure diffusion process .
While the pure diffusion process equally diffuses all the image content , also edges in the image which indicate the boundary between regions of different colours , the TV flow preserves edges in an image and continues them into the damaged parts .
An example of the application of a partial differential equation containing a modified TV flow to a damaged image is shown in figure 7 .
Figure 7 : A modified total variation flow applied to a damaged image .
Edges in the image are preserved .
Figure 8 shows a zoom of the damaged image in figure 7 , and compares the result from inpainting using a total variation flow to that from a diffusion - like process .
Clearly it is worth to investigate more sophisticated approaches like the total variation flow for these tasks .
Figure 8 : From left to right — zooming in on the white rectangle in figure 7 , the result using a total variation flow , and the result using pure diffusion .
The Neidhart frescoes and beyond
A first approach to the restoration of the Neidhart frescoes is shown in figures 9 , 10 and 11 .
Here the mathematicians first used a technique known as Cahn - Hilliard inpainting , which is based on a differential equation from material science , the Cahn - Hilliard equation .
Traditionally , the equation is used to model a process called phase separation , in which a fluid mixture spontaneously separates into its two pure components .
This occurs , for example , in metal alloys .
In inpainting , this equation is used to reconstruct the binary ( black and white ) structure of an image .
In a second step the respective grey values are filled into the missing parts using both the reconstructed binary structure and TV inpainting .
( You can see a movie of the Cahn - Hilliard equation in action . )
Figure 9 : Zooming in on a damaged part of a Neidhart fresco .
Figure 10 : A specific structure in the fresco is selected and then reconstructed using Cahn - Hilliard inpainting for black and white images .
From left to right : the original image ; the relevant structure is identified ; the structure is binarised ( turned into a black and white image ) ; the missing domain is identified ( grey rectangle ) ; the image structure is diffused into the missing domain , the structure is sharpened .
Figure 11 : Based on the result gained from the structure reconstruction in figure 10 , TV inpainting is used to fill the suitable grey values into the hole .
And here is an image of the fresco shown in figure 1 after the restoration .

To be fair , in the case of the Neidhart frescoes , the role of mathematics was limited — it was the mathematicians who learned from the restorers , rather than the other way around , and the mathematical approach served mostly as a rough inspiration .
However , the collaboration helped to perfect existing mathematical techniques and inspired new ones .
In future projects , mathematics will no doubt start pulling its full weight .
What 's more , applications of inpainting go far beyond the restoration of art .
Ever since the pioneering works of Masnou and Morel in 1998 and Marcelo Bertalmio et al. in 2000 , it has found wide applications in image processing in a wider sense .
These include applications in computer vision , the use of inpainting as an artist 's tool , and even medical applications .
Diagnostic imaging , for example using PET ( positron emission tomography ) scans , often suffers from incomplete data and from noise added in the process of recording .
In this case total variation - like approaches are used to pre-process the images .

KUK - I1 -007-43 . )
NEW YORK : Hours after high drama and frenzied bidding , Mahatma Gandhi 's personal belongings were bought for USD 1.8 million by industrialist Vijay Mallya , who said he " bidded for the country " at the auction after last - ditch attempts by India to stall the sale of the memorabilia fell through .
Just before the auction , owner of the items James Otis had agreed to withdraw them from the auction but the auction house did not agree .
It argued that it could have a big liability if it allowed the items to be withdrawn from the auction as more than 30 bidders had already registered for them and some have even sent in written bids .
As soon as the auctioneer announced sold , a large number of Indian - Americans who had come to witness the auction or to bid burst into loud round of applause .
The auction activity was suspended for several minutes as the community leaders congratulated each other .
The community leaders expressed relief that the promise of keeping Gandhi 's iconic items , including his glasses , sandals , pocket watch , plate and a bowl , in India has been fulfilled .
But the sale would take two weeks to finalise .
The items would be kept with the Auctioneer for two weeks to resolve any claims .
Tony Bedi , who bidded on behalf of Mallya said that he was " bidding for the country " and this sale means that Gandhi 's items would now return to India .
The US Justice Department , whose intervention was sought by the Indian government to implement the injunction issued by the Delhi High Court against auction of Gandhi 's belongings , had earlier sent a notice to Antiquorum Auctioneers that items be not transferred to the buyer and kept in escrow account until it takes a view on the Indian request .
But it had allowed the auction go on .
Just before Gandhi's items went under hammer , the auctioneer explained the position and said it plans to keep the items for two weeks pending the decision of the Justice Department .
Mallya's move came as a total surprise as his name was never mentioned among those who might bid for the items .
The bid on the floor was made by his representative Bedi and it was not until the auction was over that the liquor baron 's name surfaced to the surprise of everyone present .
One of the bidders was a South African , who was very much interested in the items .
Bids were received over the phone and Internet from overseas .
None of the bidders were identified .
So much interest was aroused that the auctioneers showed a small clip of Gandhi 's everyday activities before bringing his belongings to auction .
And the bid increased so fast that it was impossible to keep track .
Within three minutes , the bid had reached USD one million .
After that it slowed downed a bit but picked pace against .
Once it reached USD 1.8 million , the person auctioning the items waited for quite a while before bringing down the hammer .
Originally , Antiquorum Auctioneers had fixed the base price of the items between USD 20,000 and 30,000 but the media hype and interest shown by the Indian government helped to shoot up the prices and bid itself began around USD 300,000 .
After the auction , Chairman of the auction house Robert Maron expressed satisfaction that the items would go back to India and explained his position as to why the auction could not be stopped .
For hours before the auction started , Indian American leaders had consultations on the strategy at the Indian Consulate here with top Indian diplomats including Consul General Prabhu Dayal .
Talking to reporters , Sant Singh Chatwal , a leading hotelier and community leader who took lead in the negotiations , said it was decided that Indians would not bid against one another as it would have sent up the price .
It was decided that Mallya would bid for the items , Chatwal said , adding he had been in touch with him throughout .
Chatwal too had shown interest in bidding for the items and repeatedly asserted that Indian American would not allow them to be bought by a private collector .
During the auction process , Chatwal and Bedi were sitting side by side and were seen consulting often .
Confusion over whether Otis could take the items off the hammer prevailed with contradictory statements being made by him .
He had made a proposal with tough conditions to the Indian government on Wednesday which , analysts said , were impossible for New Delhi accept .
But even in the unlikely event of India accepting Otis ' proposal , in all probability , the auction still could not have been stopped in view of the position taken by the auctioneers and in terms of contract signed by him with them .
Though Otis ' lawyer Ravi Batra said he would not take any action for auctioneers going ahead with the auction despite his last minute bid to stop it , the Antiquorum officials assert that Otis has no case once he has handed over the items to them for sale under the contact signed by him .
QnA : Why ca n't Gandhi 's belongings be in a national museum ?
QnA : Did Mallya buy Gandhi's items out of respect to the Mahatma or to garner public admiration ?
Oh , glad you did n't miss it .
I was really pleased with this one .
Actually had 5 hours of pure concentration available and for once think I gave it my best shot .
Thank you !
Hell yes .
I 'd love to talk about pics with you , but I do n't know if I can tell you anything useful as I seem to have a process called " random guesswork "
Solid carbon dioxide , commonly known as dry ice , thaws directly to gas and forms starburst patterns under the seasonal carbon dioxide ice caps when spring comes to Mars ' polar regions .
Image taken by the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
A Martian orbiter has spotted seasonal footprints ofspring creeping up on the red planet .
Seasonal polar caps formed from carbon dioxide have begunvaporizing or changing directly from solid ice to gas , and have kicked off achain of events detected by NASA 's MarsReconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) .
" Spring on Mars is quite different from spring onEarth because Mars has not just permanent ice caps , but also seasonal polarcaps of carbon dioxide , familiar to us on Earth as dry ice , " said CandiceHansen - Koharcheck , an MRO scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena , Calif .
Ice caps form each Martian winter as carbon dioxidechanges directly to frost and builds dry ice layers more than three feet thick .
The arrival of warmer spring temperatures thaws the solid carbon dioxide andthins the ice cap from both top and bottom .
The carbon dioxide gas beneaththe ice cap often flows in the same places each year , eventually creatingchannels or troughs in the planet 's surface .
MRO has spotted many such spiderynetworks of cracks that remain even after the ice caps have vanished .
Pressure from the newly thawed gas also builds up beneaththe thinning ice cap , which can lead to puffs of escaping gas and dust wherethe ice cap has cracked .
" What happens on Mars , we think , is that as theseasonal ice cap thins from the bottom , gas underneath the cap builds uppressure , " Hansen - Koharcheck said .
" And where gas under the ice findsa weak spot or a crack , it will flow out of the opening , often carrying alittle dust from the surface below . "
That dust ends up swirling about in the wind beforesettling in fan - like or starburst patterns , pointingin the direction of the prevailing wind at the time .
Each patternrepresents a jet of gas that was active at one time .
The Martian process differs from springtime thaws onEarth , where frozen water melts from solid to liquid and becomes runoff .
Scientistshave yet to spot flowing water on the Martian surface , though some suspectliquids may lie beneath the surface or even insidea volcano .
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - A gunman has shot dead a photo radar operator on a busy freeway near Phoenix , police said on Monday .
Police officers were called to the radar enforcement vehicle after reports of gunfire late on Sunday , and they found the employee shot several times , the Arizona Department of Public Safety said in a news release .
The victim , 51 , was taken to a local hospital , where he died from his gunshot wounds , the department said .
He worked for RedFlex Traffic Systems Inc. , which has a contract with DPS to operate photo radar vehicles on the state ’s highways .
Police said they were treating the shooting as a homicide and were searching for a man driving a white Chevrolet Suburban , a popular SUV .
Arizona is the first U.S. state to implement a state - wide photo radar system , though similar programs have been used in other countries .

Fictional corrupt politicians are a mainstay of The Wire , David Simon 's celebrated television series about life on the Baltimore streets .
But the show 's creator says he fears a real - life explosion of rampant corruption in American political life if the newspaper industry , in which he worked for more than a decade , is allowed to collapse .
In an exclusive interview with the Guardian , the award - winning writer and producer launches a tirade against newspaper owners who , he says , showed " contempt for their product " and are now reaping the whirlwind .
But he rejects the idea that newspapers should seek ways to embrace the new world of free information , arguing that they must urgently start charging money for content distributed online .
" Oh , to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years , before somebody figures out the business model , " says Simon , a former crime reporter for the Baltimore Sun .
" To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city , as a local politician !
It 's got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption . "
The only hope , Simon insists , is for major news outlets to find a way to collaboratively impose charges for reading online , and to demand fees from aggregators such as Google News , which profit from their journalism .
" If you do n't have a product that you 're charging for , you do n't have a product , " he says .
" If you think that free is going to produce something that 's as much of a cost centre as good journalism – because it costs money to do good journalism – you 're out of your mind . "
The number of readers willing to pay a small fee each month might never rival the heyday of newspaper circulation , but it would attract enough " people who care what 's going on in the world " to fund crucial reporting , he maintains .
" And once they do that , and go to Google and Yahoo and every other search engine and say : ' No , ai n't no free . ' "
He scoffs at the notion that amateur " citizen journalism " , or new online - only outlets , might take the place of newspaper reporters :
" The internet does froth and commentary very well , but you do n't meet many internet reporters down at the courthouse . "
Critics of the paid model for online news argue that it has been tried and rejected – notably at the New York Times , which abandoned its TimesSelect service in 2007 – and that those instances in which it has proved successful , including the Wall Street Journal , are exceptional cases .
They say media outlets must find ways to embrace and profit from the exposure offered by aggregators such as Google News , and that walling off their material will hasten their irrelevance .
Anti-trust laws also present severe legal obstacles to collaboration between news organisations .
Jeff Jarvis , a new media consultant who writes a column for the Guardian , said : " The traditionalists are trying to transplant elements of the old business model into a new business reality ... when you put your content behind a wall , you lose more than you gain .
You lose a lot of readers and the advertising revenue associated with them , you lose the ability to be discovered by new readers , you lose out to free competitors , of whom there 'll be an unlimited supply , and you lose influence , because you 're taken out of the conversation . "
Having completed five seasons of The Wire and Generation Kill , a mini-series about the Iraq war , Simon is currently shooting a pilot for Treme , his proposed new series about musicians in post - Katrina New Orleans .
It will feature at least two veterans of his earlier work : Clarke Peters , who played Lester Freamon in The Wire , and Wendell Pierce , who played Bunk Moreland .
If commissioned by HBO , Simon promises , Treme will remain true to the philosophy he pungently encapsulates in the phrase " Fuck the average viewer " .
His shows , he explains , reject the conventional TV wisdom that everything must be explained upfront , instead demanding intense concentration from viewers , who must grapple with an unfamiliar world .
Rather than writing for a general audience , he says : " I want to write for the guy living the event . "
On Monday , BBC2 will start giving The Wire its first airing on British terrestrial television , screening all five seasons in a late - night slot five nights a week .
Britain and Iraq have begun a " long - term partnership of equals " , Prime Minister Gordon Brown declared today as the end of UK combat operations there was announced .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
After talks in Downing Street with Iraqi counterpart Nouri al - Maliki , Mr Brown said : " Today we are taking steps to strengthen and deepen our relationship and to make it a long - term partnership of equals .
" Today marks the closing chapter of the combat mission in Iraq .
The flag of 20 Armoured Brigade will be lowered as British combat patrols in Basra come to an end and our armed forces prepare to draw down . "
Mr Brown paid tribute to the British service men and women who had lost their lives in Iraq .
" They will always be remembered for the service they have given .
Our country owes them a huge debt of gratitude , " he said .
He said that the memorial in Basra honouring their memory would be " preserved for ever " at the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas , Staffordshire .
" Today Iraq is a success story .
We owe much of that to the efforts of British troops .
Our mission has not always been an easy one , many have said that we would fail , " he said .
" Britain can be proud of our legacy that we leave there . "
Mr Maliki said his country needed investment from Britain and co-operation across many fronts , including science , the economy and business .
Mr Brown said : " We hope to sign an agreement with the Iraqi government about the future role that we can play in training and in protecting the oil supplies of Iraq .
" That will be an agreement between our two countries , rather than any new United Nations resolution .

" I gather this will go to the Iraqi parliament within the next few days and this is part of a new , deeper relationship between our two countries . "
Mr Brown said he and Mr Maliki had signed a new declaration of friendship , partnership and co-operation between their two countries , setting out a new basis for relations between them .
He said negotiations would be opened on an investment promotion and protection agreement while a review of export credit guarantees would be brought forward .
" This is a clear message for companies worldwide : Iraq is open for business , " he said .
Co-operation would also continue on oil exploration in the Gulf , and on education - bringing Iraqi students to the UK and increasing English language training in Iraq .
" Britain and Iraq have deep historical ties .
The last six years have changed our relationship again , " he said .
" Today we open the next chapter in our relations , a chapter which I preface with my deep respect and appreciation for Iraq 's achievements and my gratitude to Britain 's armed forces who have made such a lasting contribution . "

After a long weekend break , both sides have returned to the Stockholm court room .
Day 6 of the trial was a rest day , so we skip to Day 7 where the IFPI 's evidence collector relies only on screenshots and admits he's not a BitTorrent expert .
Furthermore , the Prosecution do n't know where policeman Jim Keyzer is .
Today ’s scheduled witnesses are Magnus Mårtensson , a lawyer for the IFPI , Anders Nilsson of Antipiratbyrån and John Stéenmark .
Prosecutor Håkan Roswall begins by saying that Tobias Andersson from Piratbyrån , John Stéenmark and police officer Jim Keyzer no longer have to testify .
The Judge asked the Prosecution about Jim Keyzer , but they said they had n’t been able to get hold of him but had sent an e-mail to try and find out .
The defense says they will hear Tobias Andersson tomorrow .
The Prosecutor then further modified the charges against the defendants .
He no longer claims that all The Pirate Bay ’s components are necessary in order to share files .
He further added to the charges that TPB allows its users to upload torrents and that TPB then store the torrents on their server .
There was no immediate objection to the changes .
IFPI lawyer Peter Danowsky introduced yet more new evidence , but the defense wo n’t comment on it until they have had a chance to examine it .
First up to testify was Magnus Mårtensson , a lawyer for the IFPI .
The court heard that Mårtensson has been working for the IFPI for 15 years , specializing in anti-piracy work .
He explained that he worked gathering evidence against The Pirate Bay by downloading various music albums via . torrent files he obtained from the site using the Azureus client .
Mårtensson ’s evidence gathering equipment consisted only of screenshots , as quickly became apparent .
Mårtensson ’s technological ability was called into question and he acknowledged that it was difficult for him to answer some technical questions .
When asked if he had any network equipment logging exactly what was going on ‘ behind the scenes ’ of any of his sample downloads , he replied that he did n’t .
When asked if he verified in any way during the download process that he had any contact with The Pirate Bay ’s tracker , again the answer was negative .
Defendant Gottfrid Svartholm questioned Mårtensson on his evidence gathering techniques .
The following questions are particularly interesting as they show that the prosecution has no evidence that the Pirate Bay trackers were actually used .
Gottfrid : Before taking the screenshot , did you turn off DHT and Peer Exchange ?
Mårtensson : DHT was obviously on .
I wanted to be like an average user .
Gottfrid :
So in other words , you ca n’t check if the tracker was used ?
Mårtensson :
The tracker address was visible on the screen .
From that I assumed it was used in some way .
Gottfrid :
But since you had DHT on , you have no possibility to state to the court as to whether The Pirate Bay ’s tracker was actually used or not ?
Mårtensson : No .
It seems unthinkable that the Prosecution has gathered ‘ evidence ’ in this way .
Mårtensson was further asked if he was aware that Google can also act as a torrent search engine .
The IFPI lawer seemed to be unaware of that , and he stated that they never had any problems with Google .
After a short break ex-policeman Magnus Nilsson of the Anti-Piracy Office was next up .
He described how he downloaded several . torrent files from The Pirate Bay as part of his evidence gathering , and he explained in detail how one downloads files with BitTorrent .
Nilsson told that he downloaded several games and movies , all with uTorrent .
Then , Nilsson came out to say that he was sure that a majority of the content on The Pirate Bay was copyrighted .
However , he had no evidence that supports this claim .
The defense lawyers pressed him on this and he had to cave in , “ I have no documentation as to the claim that most material is copyrighted .
It is just an opinion , ” Nilsson said .
One of the defense lawyers ( Carl Lundtröm ’s ) used the same line of questioning as he did with Magnus Mårtensson .
He asked what BitTorrent program Nilsson used .
Then he asked if he downloaded that program from The Pirate Bay .
When told no , he asked a couple of questions about the download process to show that TPB is n’t involved in the actual transfer .
“ So the actual downloading [ of the pirated works / files ] happens outside of TPB ? ” Carl Lundström ’s lawyer asked .
“ Yes , ” Anders Nilsson replied .
Gottfrid Svartholm , one of the defendants , asked Nilsson to confirm that he is an investigator working for an entertainment industry lobby group , and that the lobby group gave him instructions on what files and works to investigate .
This was obviously to clarify to the court that Anders Nilsson is not an objective investigator .
After only two hours the court decided to end the hearings for today .
Tobias Andersson of Piratbyrån and John Kennedy of IFPI will be heard tomorrow .

The Guardian today launched Open Platform , a service that will allow partners to reuse theguardian.com content and data for free and weave it " into the fabric of the internet " .
Open Platform launched with two separate content - sharing services , which will allow users to build their own applications in return for carrying Guardian advertising .
A content application programming interface ( API ) will smooth the way for web developers to build applications and services using Guardian content , while a Data Store will contain datasets curated by Guardian editors and open for others to use .
Emily Bell , the Guardian News & Media director of digital content , described Open Platform as a " new chapter in our history and a new foundation for the future of our journalism " .
She said that Open Platform would allow Guardian content " to be woven into the fabric of the internet " as people outside the organisation saw the value of adding Guardian content to their projects .
The Cass Sculpture Foundation is using the service to add Guardian articles about British artists to its site .
Other partners for the launch of the service include web design firm Stamen and OpenStreetMap , a free , open alternative to commercial map data services .
Stamen and OpenStreetMap developed a service that they hope will encourage Guardian readers to " geo-tag " the newspaper 's content , positioning every article , video and picture on a map so users can find news , commentary , video and other content related to their area .
The Guardian experimented with geo-location during last year 's US presidential election , and hopes the project will help add location information to its vast archive of content .
The other part of Open Platform , the Data Store , provides statistics and data curated by Guardian editors .
The Guardian has always collected statistics and data , but traditionally this data has appeared in the newspaper or appeared in a table on a Guardian website .
Now , these statistics will be made available for anyone to use .
The Data Store launched with 80 data sets from trusted sources , including figures on child poverty in England and world carbon emissions by country .
Simon Rogers , news editor , graphics , at the Guardian , will highlight some of the data sets in a Datablog , suggesting ways that the sets could be combined , or mashed up .
It will also be a place where the Guardian highlights some of the best projects from its partners .
The Guardian content API will initially include only written articles from Guardian and Observer staff and freelances to whose work the Guardian has rights .
The BBC launched a developer network , Backstage , in 2005 .
Backstage provides summary feeds from the BBC news and sports sites , weather data and programming data from its radio and television channels .
The developer network encourages developers to " use our stuff to build your stuff " .
The Guardian is positioning its Open Platform as a commercial venture , requiring partners to carry its advertising as part of its terms and conditions , while BBC Backstage states clearly that its proposition is for individual developers designers and not for " big corporates " .
Some parts of the Open Platform have yet to be finalised , and the network was described as a " beta trial " , a programming term for software ready for testing but not ready for final release .
Both the content API and the Data Store are available for free , but the Guardian has plans to create an advertising network .
Matt McAlister , the head of Guardian Developer Network , said : " We 're looking forward to seeing how our partners use Guardian content across the internet .
We want them to take our content and to be more successful because they have partnered with us .
These partnerships are key to Guardian News & Media 's long - term open strategy . "

To avoid dangerous climate change of 2C , the world can only burn another half a trillion tonnes of carbon , climate change experts warn
The world has already burned half the fossil fuels necessary to bring about a catastrophic 2C rise in average global temperature , scientists revealed today .
The experts say about half a trillion tonnes of carbon have been consumed since the industrial revolution .
To prevent a 2C rise , they say , the total burnt must be kept to below a trillion tonnes .
On current rates , that figure will be reached in 40 years .
Myles Allen , a climate expert at Oxford University who led the new study , said : " Mother Nature does n't care about dates .
To avoid dangerous climate change we will have to limit the total amount of carbon we inject into the atmosphere , not just the emission rate in any given year . "
The scientists say their research could simplify political attempts to tackle global warming , which encompass a range of targets and timetables .
Such proposals usually set future limits on the amount of carbon dioxide allowed to build up in the atmosphere , such as 450 parts per million ( ppm ) , or as future emission rates , such as the UK 's pledge to slash emissions 80 % by 2050 .
The new study effectively re-frames such targets as an available budget - to avoid dangerous climate change of 2C the world can only burn another half a trillion tonnes of carbon .
Writing in today 's Nature , Allen and colleagues say a trillion tonnes of carbon burnt would be likely to produce a warming of between 1.6C and 2.6C , with a " most likely " 2C rise .
Chris Huntingford of the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said : " Research often reveals new complexities , but this analysis could actually simplify matters for policy makers .
The relationship between total emissions and future warming can be inferred largely from quantities we can observe , and is remarkably insensitive to the timing of future emissions . "
The key implication of the research , the scientists say , is that access to fossil fuels must somehow be rationed and eventually turned off , if the 2C target is to be met .
" If country A burns it then country B can't , " said Bill Hare , a climate expert with the Potsdam Institute in Germany .
" It 's like a draining tank . "
The research also highlights that continued high rates of fossil fuel use in the next decade will demand extraordinary cuts in emissions in future decades to hit the 2C target .
Allen said : " If you use too much [ carbon ] this year , it does n't mean the planet will come to an end .
It means you have to work even harder the next year . "
A separate study , also published today in Nature , led by Malte Meinshausen at the Potsdam Institute , use a similar approach and sets a different carbon budget .
They say the world can only emit 190bn tonnes of carbon between now and 2050 if it aims for a 2C rise .
Emissions over 310bn tonnes in that time lead to a 50 % chance of going over 2C .
The new research does not say anything about the likelihood of reaching the 2C target .
They simply change the way progress towards the target is measured .
In an accompanying commentary article , the scientists behind both studies say : " These results are not incompatible with current proposals for near - term emission targets -- the small size of the cumulative emission budgets to 2050 reinforces the need for global CO2 emissions to peak around or before 2020 so that emission pathways remain technologically and economically feasible . "
They add : " Having taken 250 years to burn the first half trillion tonnes of carbon we look set , on current trends , to burn the next half trillion in less than 40 .
No one could credibly suggest that we should carry on with business as usual to the 2040s and then somehow suddenly stop using fossil fuels , switch to 100 % carbon capture or just shut down the world economy overnight . "
The Obama administration may be revealing some of the war on terror 's ugliest secrets .
Meanwhile , in the bowels of the federal bureaucracy , they can't even manage to declassify documents from World War II .
Despite " $ 30 million and 10 years " to do the job , National Archives and Records Administration has n't been able to okay for public consumption all of the " records on the involvement of U.S. intelligence agencies with Nazi and Japanese war criminals , " SpyTalk reveals .
Congress has just budgeted another $ 650,000 to finish the job - really , they 're serious this time – of poring through some 8 million postwar pages .
*" There 's a million pages of Army and CIA documents left " to read and catalog , said Miriam Kleiman , a spokeswoman for NARA . *
Naturally , Kleiman says her group of paper - pushers should n't be blamed for the lag .
It 's some other bureaucrats ' fault , she insists .

Two years ago , Rupert Murdoch bestrode the media world like a colossus .
News Corp.’s ( s nws ) stock simmered above $ 25 a share as properties from MySpace to American Idol to Fox Sports stood tall .
A business news channel was in the works , and Murdoch was gunning for Dow Jones as the jewel in his media crown .
Today , if you listen closely , you can hear the air leaking out .
It ’s not just the Great Recession ( to use the name currently in vogue ) .
Ever since the purchase of Dow Jones , signs of fatigue and weakness have been appearing in nearly every area of Murdoch ’s empire .
News Corp .’s share price has fallen 77 percent from its 2007 high to $ 6 Friday , compared to a 56 percent fall in the S&P 500 .
That ’s not to say Dow Jones was a bad move .
( Although it was a mightily overpriced one ; News Corp . ’s $ 14 billion market cap is only two and a half times the $ 5.6 billion it paid for Dow Jones . )
Dow Jones has given News Corp. a strong foothold in online news .
Its sites ’ traffic grew 76 percent last year , and while the Wall Street Journal ’s page views are significantly smaller than the New York Times ’ , its growth is twice as fast .
So why did operating income at News Corp . ’s newspaper division fall 9 percent last quarter ?
Because other newspapers it owns are n’t being as spry as the Journal and its sister sites about driving traffic .
Many are clinging desperately to print formats .
As has been said over and over , it ’s not the news ( paper ) business that ’s dying , it ’s the print platform .
Operating income is falling faster in other divisions : down 93 percent in television last quarter , 84 percent in satellite and 72 percent in film ( Fox studios had only two of the top 20 grossing movies last year ) .
New technologies are undermining these and other areas of its empire .
Why bother with cable or satellite TV when you can get the many best programs online ?
Many are canceling their pay TV subscriptions to save precious dollars .
Others who keep watching are using TiVo ( s TIVO ) or other personal video recorders that let them skip channels commercials .
But News Corp. is n’t showing signs it can capitalize on digital media .
Many MySpace pages , once lovingly nurtured , have gone to seed , and the site ’s revenue was down 3 percent to $ 226 million , while operating income fell 85 percent to $ 7 million .
The move by Hulu , of which News Corp. owns 45 percent , to box out Boxee is not only unpopular , it ’s becoming a PR black eye .
These challenges could grow more daunting as Peter Chernin , the executive with a reputation for really understanding digital media and issues like digital - rights , heads for the exits .
That leaves News Corp. with a sprawling empire of businesses struggling to keep up with a fast - changing world .
And it leaves Murdoch looking like an old media baron — which he may have been all along .

During his tenure as CTO of Washington DC , Vivek Kundra , 34 , moved to put government videos on YouTube ( GOOG ) and encourage staff to post to Twitter .
Now Vivek gets a promotion : Today Presdent Obama tapped Vivek as the first " federal chief information officer " .
Not to split hairs , but there 's been widespread speculation over who might be named as " America 's CTO , " a position still outstanding .
WashPost :
The newly created federal position will operate under the auspices of the White House .
Kundra , 34 , is expected to oversee how government agencies purchase and use information technology and will be in charge of all federal technology spending .
He also will be responsible for making sure agencies ' networks and systems work together and share information while maintaining security and privacy standards ...
Kundra will have budgetary authority to launch entirely new systems within government departments , or kill existing multimillion - dollar IT projects .
His decisions could have a large impact on government contractors , such as SAIC and Booz Allen Hamilton , that have come to provide the bulk of IT services to agencies .
He also will be charged with using technology to lower the cost of government operations and making government data more accessible to citizens , two things he championed as the District 's chief technology officer .
In that role , he got attention for letting independent developers create online applications using government information , for example , posting training videos on YouTube and creating an internal " wiki " site called DCpedia , for employees .

FIREBAUGH — Shawn Coburn is barreling down a country road in his white Ford F - 150 pickup , talking about how California ’s water crisis darkly reminds him of a scene from a movie aptly named “ Armageddon . ”
“ Billy Bob Thornton tells Bruce Willis that a huge asteroid is approaching Earth , ” says Coburn , 40 .
“ Willis asks Thornton who will get hurt , and Thornton tells him that he just does n’t get it — that everyone will be dead , that the game is over . ”
The disaster coming this spring and summer is no movie , and nothing menacing is falling from the sky .
It ’s about what ’s not falling from the sky — rain .
After three years of below - average rain and snowfall , coupled with new pumping restrictions to protect endangered fish , California ’s farmers are running out of water .
The devastating impact has trickled down to dozens of small Central Valley farming communities .
This is the story about one of those towns :
Firebaugh .
It ’s also about Armando Ramirez , a 63 - year - old barbershop owner on Firebaugh ’s main street who says business is down 90 percent from last year .
It ’s about Manuel Rivera , 20 , who is hoping against hope that he can keep the lights on at his clothing and jewelry store across the street .
And it ’s about Randy , Frank , Steve and Larry Gonzales , four friendly brothers who say their family ’s half - century - old auto - parts and repair business around the corner is withering because farmworkers are driving less and getting laid off in droves .
The farmers who will be slammed the hardest are those who depend on the Central Valley Project , the massive federal system of dams , reservoirs , pumps and canals that helped spawn California ’s $ 36 billion farming industry — the state ’s largest .
Within a couple of years , Coburn says , numerous small towns like Firebaugh could die and hundreds of thousands of once - profitable acres could turn into fields of dust .
Beginning today , the federal water spigot in California has been turned off for the first time .
And just as in “ Armageddon , ” the game might be over .
Across the Central Valley , warns a new University of California - Davis study , 80,000 jobs could be lost this year .
In Firebaugh , a historic town of 7,000 , one of the first casualties could be the Silver Creek Almond Co. , which Coburn co-founded five years ago to pack and market the almonds he grows on 1,500 acres .
All of the water used to nourish Coburn ’s orchards comes from the Central Valley Project .
And on Feb. 20 , federal water officials announced a “ zero allocation ” to farmers — most likely for the rest of the year .
Farmers who depend on water from the State Water Project are only slightly luckier — they have been told their allocation will be 15 percent of normal .
“ In a few years this will all be gone , ” Coburn predicted as he walked through a cavernous warehouse stacked with bins containing 10 million pounds of almonds , about 70 percent of which will be sent overseas .
“ Think of the business that will be lost at the Port of Oakland , ” Coburn said .
“ This is all going toward reducing our trade deficit . ”
Business way down
O Street , the main drag of downtown Firebaugh , is shrouded in sadness .
Ramirez , the barber , says he understands why many of his longtime customers can no longer afford even a $ 10 haircut .
Rivera , who owns the clothing and jewelry store Xavier & Sariah Styles with his mom , says his business is down the same as Ramirez ’s — 90 percent from a year ago .
“ We ’re now ringing up only $ 50 in sales a day , ” Rivera said .
The rough times for Firebaugh started in August 2007 when U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Wanger reduced the amount of water pumped from the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta to protect the delta smelt , a tiny fish , from extinction .
The new restrictions decreased farming on the west side of the Central Valley , which is much more dependent on federal water than the east side .
The water nightmare caused by the pumping restrictions and dry weather has hit Main Street at a time when the recession and housing foreclosure crisis already are pummeling valley towns .
In the past year , a third of Firebaugh ’s downtown businesses have closed .
They include an ice cream shop , a Western clothing store and a once - popular Mexican restaurant .
Even the lone bar catering to farm laborers was shuttered .
Firebaugh , settled during the Gold Rush as a major ferry crossing for prospectors heading up the San Joaquin River , is now about 90 percent Latino .
The city ’s official jobless rate is 23 percent .
But Jose Ramirez , Firebaugh ’s city manager , estimates it ’s probably closer to 35 percent because so many undocumented workers do n’t make it into the official statistics .
In the past year , sales tax revenue has plunged more than 40 percent .
And the nightmare is just beginning .
Wells no solution
The huge Westlands Water District , wholly dependent on federal water , predicts up to 400,000 acres of its 611,000 acres of farmland will lie fallow this year .
Farmers such as Coburn are spending millions of dollars desperately digging wells .
But the water underground contains so much salt and boron it will kill orchards and vineyards in two or three years .
“ Putting our well water on almond trees is like giving them chemotherapy , ” Coburn said .
“ It will fry them . ”
Back in town , Steve Malanca , general manager of the John Deere dealership , gazes at a former alfalfa field across the street .
Malanca does n’t just see bare dirt .
He conjures up the image of the tractor and the 30 - foot - wide disk needed to prepare the field to grow alfalfa .
He sees all the irrigation and seeding equipment — and crews — needed to get the alfalfa seeds in the ground ; the companies needed to make the fertilizers and insecticides to ensure that the seeds germinate ; the experts with advanced degrees needed to inspect the fields and help farmers design their battle plans against pests and disease .
He sees four other pieces of equipment — a swather , hay rake , baler and harrow bed — that are needed before a semitrailer with a forklift loads the hay for delivery to a dairy .
“ Without water , ” Malanca said , “ none of that will happen . ”
The stress and depression that often accompany layoffs are taking their toll .
Firebaugh Police Chief Elsa Lopez has noticed a recent uptick in domestic violence calls .
And the number of people arrested on drunken - driving charges in January was double what it was a year ago .
With sales tax revenue tanking , the city is asking its employees to take one furlough day a month to try to head off layoffs .
But Lopez resisted calls for furloughs for her 12 sworn officers , fearing that layoffs on the farms will increase drug use , which in turn will lead to more burglaries and robberies .
In lieu of the furloughs , Ramirez is asking that the cops not be paid for any holidays .
If things in Firebaugh were n’t difficult enough , Premier Paso , the town ’s lone substance - abuse center , closed in September because state legislators were late passing a budget .
“ Losing them was a sad day for us , ” Lopez said .
Dr. Marcia Sablan and her husband , Dr. Oscar Sablan , who for the past 27 years have run a Firebaugh medical clinic , say they are treating many more farm employees for depression .
On Wednesday , Maria Linares , 38 , brought her 17 - year - old son to the clinic because he was sick .
While she was there , she spoke to “ Dr. Marcia , ” who also happens to be the town ’s mayor , about the anxiety at home .
Self - esteem issues
Linares ’ husband , an irrigation supervisor at an almond ranch in Firebaugh , is losing self - esteem , she said .
He is now working only one or two days a week and fears he ’ll lose his job .
And her job is also at risk :
She works on the almond processing line at Coburn ’s Silver Creek Almond Co .
If her husband does lose his job , Linares said , they will probably be forced to leave the trailer they paid $ 35,000 for three years ago so they could live on the almond ranch .
Once upon a time they looked forward to moving from the trailer into a house in the heart of town .
“ But that dream , ” she said , “ has all been erased because we have no water . ”

He took down two at once when he said José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of Spain “ may not be very clever , but I know people who were very clever and who did not make the second round of the presidential election ”  a slam at Lionel Jospin , the former French Socialist leader .

Mr. Sarkozy ’s model seemed to be Italy ’s prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi .
“ The important thing in democracy is to be re-elected , ” Mr. Sarkozy reportedly said .
“ Look at Berlusconi .
He has been re-elected three times . ”
( He has actually been re-elected twice . )
While Mr. Sarkozy ’s office denied Thursday that he had made such comments about Mr. Zapatero and said he had praised him instead , there were no similar denials about the other comments .
Mr. Obama , according to Mr. Sarkozy , “ has a subtle mind , very intelligent and very charismatic .
But he was elected two months ago and never ran a ministry in his life .
He does n’t have a position on a number of things . ”
Mr. Obama “ is not always operating at a level of decision - making and efficiency , ” according to the voluble Mr. Sarkozy .
Mr. Obama appeared unprepared on climate change when they met , according to Mr. Sarkozy , who told the legislators , “ I told him , ‘ I do n’t think that you have quite understood what we are doing on carbon dioxide . ’ ”
The Pirate Bay verdict is in , but the site operators are n't in jail , have n't paid any fines , and continue to run the site .
They have also filed their promised appeal in the case , ensuring that the whole episode will drag on for quite some time .
That 's just fine with The Pirate Bay 's administrators , though , who today speculated that the case will take another two to three years to wrap up .
In the meantime , " The site will live on ! "
The fact that the site lives on is a little weird , given the guilty verdict , the 30 million kronor fine , and the year of jail time for all defendants .
What 's missing from the collection of penalties ?
An injunction shutting down The Pirate Bay .
A spokesperson for the Motion Picture Association said after the verdict , " We now look to the Swedish authorities to end this criminal enterprise , " but that apparently wo n't happen without another win in court .
John Kennedy , head of international music trade group IFPI , told the New York Times last week that his group " planned to file additional litigation to try to get The Pirate Bay shut down . "
The Pirate Bay defendants do n't believe that will happen .
Moreover , they are convinced that " what we do is right " and that " millions of users are a good proof of that . "
In addition , they do n't want people to collect donations for them , " since we will not pay any fines ! "
Instead , people are encouraged to keep seeding torrents , start more BitTorrent sites , and vote for pro-pirate EU parliamentarians in this summer 's upcoming elections ( where the Swedish Piratpartiet , for instance , is hoping to pick up a seat ) .
The pride that the site 's operators take in their service ( " Say it loud , say it proud ! " ) seems to come from a belief that free access to music and movies paid for by others is n't just good for business ( certainly one plausible argument demonstrated by innovative artists like Trent Reznor ) but is a sort of civil right .
Such an attitude is certainly on display in many of comments left at The Pirate bay blog .
One user from India writes , " When I use uTorrent to download torrent files from TPB I notice most of my peers are from rich countries downloading the same music I want but is prohibitively expensive in my country .
Why are they downloading too if they are citizens of developed countries ?
It is only because they too feel that they are being over - charged for their entertainment about which they can do nothing but take subversive measures against the injustice and exploitation of cartels who have used their influence in government to enact laws which makes their own consumers thieves . "
When someone " feels " overcharged for something they want , taking it instead has become ethically allowable — a point confirmed by the fact that " millions of users " are doing it .
This may be the real weakness of The Pirate Bay verdict and the approach it represents : it will do nothing to address the underlying attitudes that drive copyright infringement ( though it has been successful at convincing other Swedish trackers to shut down . )
In other news , UK mobile ISPs are now blocking access to the site .
Mobile broadband ISPs such as BT are now blocking access to The Pirate Bay — not because it facilitates copyright infringement , but because it provides unrestricted access to " over 18 " content that can include pornography and hacking tools .
The new scheme is part of a self - regulatory UK initiative designed to block such content on mobile devices , lest they " fall into the wrong hands . "
Phone and laptop owners can contact their ISPs to request that sites be unblocked , though one suspects that calling up BT and asking for access to The Pirate Bay or goat - boned.org is not high on anyone 's list of fun things to do .
Warren D. Ward , 48 , was in high school when the swine flu threat of 1976 swept the U.S.
The Whittier man remembers the episode vividly because a relative died in the 1918 flu pandemic , and the 1976 illness was feared to be a direct descendant of the deadly virus .
“ The government wanted everyone to get vaccinated , ” Ward said .
“ But the epidemic never really broke out .
It was a threat that never materialized . ”
What did materialize were cases of a rare side effect thought to be linked to the shot .
The unexpected development cut short the vaccination effort -- an unprecedented national campaign -- after 10 weeks .
The episode triggered an enduring public backlash against flu vaccination , embarrassed the federal government and cost the director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control , now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , his job .

The pandemic fears of the time and the resulting vaccine controversy may be fueling some of the public ’s -- and media ’s -- anxiety about the current outbreak , said health officials who recalled the previous event .
Ward said his family discussed the vaccine in 1976 and decided not to get it .
If a vaccine is ordered for this latest threat , he said , “ I ’m not getting it .
I felt back then like it was a bunch of baloney . ”
The swine flu brush of 1976 -- some call it a debacle -- holds crucial lessons for the government and health officials who must decide how to react to the new swine flu threat in the days and weeks ahead .
For starters , officials must keep the public informed .
They must admit what they know and do n’t know .
They must have a plan ready should the health threat become dangerous .
And they must reassure everyone that there is no need to worry in the meantime .

It ’s a tall order .
Doubts about the government ’s ability to handle a possible flu pandemic linger , said Dr. Richard P. Wenzel , chairman of internal medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University , who diagnosed some of the early cases in 1976 .
“ I think we ’re going to have to be cautious , ” Wenzel said .
“ Hopefully , there will be a lot of good , honest public health discussion about what happened in 1976 . ”
Officials should be prepared for plenty of second - guessing , especially for any decisions regarding vaccination , which was at the core of the 1976 controversy , said Dr. David J. Sencer , the CDC director who led the government ’s response to the threat and was later fired .
“ There were good things and bad things about it , ” said Sencer , who is retired and lives in the Atlanta area .
“ People have to make science the priority .
They have to rely on science rather than politics . ”
Advertisement
The question of whether politics overtook science in 1976 has been the fodder of books , articles and discussions for 33 years .
The panic in 1976 was partly because of the belief -- now known to be erroneous -- that the 1918 - 19 flu pandemic , which killed half a million Americans and as many as 50 million worldwide , was caused by a virus with swine components .
Recent research suggests instead that it was avian flu , but that seems unlikely to assuage the current anxiety .
The episode began in February 1976 , when an Army recruit at Ft. Dix , N.J. , fell ill and died from a swine flu virus thought to be similar to the 1918 strain .
Several other soldiers at the base also became ill .
Shortly thereafter , Wenzel and his colleagues reported two cases of the flu strain in Virginia .
“ That raised the concern that the original cluster at Ft. Dix had spread beyond New Jersey , ” said Wenzel , former president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases .

At the CDC , Sencer solicited the opinions of infectious disease specialists nationwide and , in March , called on President Ford and Congress to begin a mass inoculation .
The $ 137 - million program began in early October , but within days reports emerged that the vaccine appeared to increase the risk for Guillain - Barre syndrome , a rare neurological condition that causes temporary paralysis but can be fatal .
Waiting in long lines at schools and clinics , more than 40 million Americans -- almost 25 % of the population -- received the swine flu vaccine before the program was halted in December after 10 weeks .
More than 500 people are thought to have developed Guillain - Barre syndrome after receiving the vaccine ; 25 died .
No one completely understands the causes of Guillain - Barre , but the condition can develop after a bout with infection or following surgery or vaccination .
The federal government paid millions in damages to people or their families .
Advertisement
However , the pandemic , which some experts estimated at the time could infect 50 million to 60 million Americans , never unfolded .
Only about 200 cases of swine flu and one death were ultimately reported in the U.S. , the CDC said .
The public viewed the entire episode as political farce , Sencer said .
But at the time , he said , the government erred on the side of caution .
“ If we had that knowledge then , we might have done things differently , ” Sencer said .
“ We did not know what sort of virus we were dealing with in those days .
No one knew we would have Guillain - Barre syndrome .
The flu vaccine had been used for many years without that happening . ”
Wenzel also recommended vaccination in 1976 .
“ It was a great effort , ” he said .
“ It just had unexpected , unfortunate side effects . ”

In Mexico , where 22 people have died from the current swine flu outbreak , government officials are under fire for their handling of the situation .
But people fail to understand the challenges faced by health officials with such a mysterious threat , said Dr. Peter Katona , an infectious disease expert at UCLA .
“ You have to look at not only 1976 but 1918 , ” he said .
“ The pandemic flu that occurred in 1918 lasted a year and a half .
In 1976 , we did n’t know what was going to happen .
The virus might burn out .
It might proliferate .
These viruses have a mind of their own , and we do n’t know how to predict what will happen . ”
CDC officials have been wisely circumspect in their comments about the current outbreak , Sencer said .
“ I like the fact that they have said , ‘ We may change our minds , ’ ” he said .
“ Do n’t expect health officials to have the answers overnight .
These things need time to be sorted out .
We ’re still in the learning curve . ”

Dr. Richard Krause , who headed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in 1976 , has noted drolly that public health officials involved in the next pandemic flu threat “ have my best wishes . ”

Should President Obama have the power to shut down domestic Internet traffic during a state of emergency ?
Senators John Rockefeller ( D - W. Va. ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) think so .
On Wednesday they introduced a bill to establish the Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor — an arm of the executive branch that would have vast power to monitor and control Internet traffic to protect against threats to critical cyber infrastructure .
That broad power is rattling some civil libertarians .
The Cybersecurity Act of 2009 ( PDF ) gives the president the ability to “ declare a cybersecurity emergency ” and shut down or limit Internet traffic in any “ critical ” information network “ in the interest of national security . ”
The bill does not define a critical information network or a cybersecurity emergency .
That definition would be left to the president .
The bill does not only add to the power of the president .
It also grants the Secretary of Commerce “ access to all relevant data concerning [ critical ] networks without regard to any provision of law , regulation , rule , or policy restricting such access . ”
This means he or she can monitor or access any data on private or public networks without regard to privacy laws .
Rockefeller made cybersecurity one of his key issues as a member of the Senate intelligence committee , which he chaired until last year .
He now heads the Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation , which will take up this bill .
“ We must protect our critical infrastructure at all costs — from our water to our electricity , to banking , traffic lights and electronic health records — the list goes on , ” Rockefeller said in a statement .
Snowe echoed her colleague , saying , “ if we fail to take swift action , we , regrettably , risk a cyber - Katrina . ”
But the wide powers outlined in the Rockefeller - Snowe legislation has at least one Internet advocacy group worried .
“ The cybersecurity threat is real , ” says Leslie Harris , head of the Center for Democracy and Technology ( CDT ) , “ but such a drastic federal intervention in private communications technology and networks could harm both security and privacy . ”
The bill could undermine the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ( ECPA ) , says CDT senior counsel Greg Nojeim .
That law , enacted in the mid ’ 80s , requires law enforcement seek a warrant before tapping in to data transmissions between computers .
“ It ’s an incredibly broad authority , ” Nojeim says , pointing out that existing privacy laws “ could fall to this authority . ”
Jennifer Granick , civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , says that granting such power to the Commerce secretary could actually cause networks to be less safe .
When one person can access all information on a network , “ it makes it more vulnerable to intruders , ” Granick says .
“ You ’ve basically established a path for the bad guys to skip down . ”
The bill ’s scope , she says , is “ contrary to what the Constitution promises us . ”
That ’s because of the impact it could have on Internet users ’ privacy rights :
If the Commerce Department uncovers evidence of illegal activity when accessing “ critical ” networks , that information could be used against a potential defendant , even if the department never had the intent to find incriminating evidence .
And this might violate the Constitutional protection against searches without cause .
“ Once information is accessed , it can be used for whatever purpose , no matter the original reason for accessing something , ” Granick says .
“ Who ’s interested in this [ bill ] ?
Law enforcement and people in the security industry who want to ensure more government dollars go to them . ”
Nojeim , though , thinks it ’s possible the bill ’s powers could be trimmed as it moves through Congress .
“ We will be working with them to clarify just what is needed and how to accomplish that , ” he says .
“ We ’re hopeful that some of the very broad powers that the bill would confer wo n’t be included . ”

IS POKER a game of skill or luck ?
For regular players that ’s a no- brainer , but showing that skill wins out has proven surprisingly difficult for mathematicians .
Now two studies that tapped the vast amounts of data available from online casinos have provided some of the best evidence yet that poker is skill - based .
Many hope that the results will help to roll back laws and court decisions that consider poker gambling , and therefore illegal in certain contexts .
Most players insist that poker is predominantly skill .

The Quinn bill , which was passed in 1970 , supplies salary boosts to police officers who earn a law enforcement , criminal justice , or law degree .
The officer , who must attend a college approved by the state , gets a 10 percent boost in his base pay for an associate 's degree ; 20 percent for a bachelor 's degree ; and 25 percent for a master 's or law degree .
" It just does n't seem fair ; it 's not fair to just wipe it right out of the budget like that , " said Thomas Nee , president of the Boston Police Patrolmen 's Association .
" Certainly it was a surprise .
The many friends we have in the Legislature see through the fundamental unfairness of it all . "
House budget writers stunned police unions last week when their budget proposal completely eliminated funding for the Quinn Bill .
Union officials knew the money would probably be reduced - Governor Deval Patrick had proposed cutting spending on the program to $ 42.2 million - but they did not expect it to be scrapped altogether .
" I do n't think the state , given this economic time , should be telling people : ' By the way we 're going to be cutting your pay .
We 're gong to be cutting an incentive , ' " he said .
" I do n't know if you can emphasize enough the impacts of having an educated police force , " said Representative Christopher G. Fallon , a Malden Democrat and lead sponsor of the amendment to restore funding .
House members who signed on to two amendments to restore the money said the full range of police compensation and education incentives needed to be protected during a recession .
A wide network that includes public health , social services , and other advocates is planning a rally tomorrow at the State House to push for more taxes and restored funding to their programs .
Many lawmakers have been sympathetic to their pleas , but there has been nowhere near the groundswell that developed for the police unions .
The rapid success by the powerful police unions , scored just a few days after the House Ways and Means Committee unveiled the $ 50 million cut Wednesday , stands in contrast to the uphill battle facing social - service advocates who are lobbying lawmakers to restore funding to fight homelessness , provide home care to the elderly , and feed the needy .
The so - called Quinn Bill , passed in 1970 , awards thousands of dollars in extra money to police officers who have earned college degrees , and it has long been a source of complaints about unfair and expensive union benefits .
Police already have at least 81 representatives signed up to back their cause , a majority of the 160 - member House , assuring a win during next week 's budget debate unless House leaders try to reverse the tide .
Massachusetts police unions have won enough early support in the House to restore $ 50 million to the budget and protect generous pay bonuses for police officers who hold college degrees , securing a potential victory even as groups representing the homeless and disadvantaged struggle for funding .
The program typically costs taxpayers about $ 100 million a year , split equally between the state and local communities where the officers work .
The impact of eliminating state funding would depend on individual union contracts .
In some cases , it would mean that police officers would take a pay cut .
But in others , local taxpayers would have to pick up the state 's share and pay the full amount of the bonuses .
The union effort to restore the funding is providing a test of House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo 's leadership .
He has pledged to allow House members more latitude to decide issues for themselves , instead of attempting to strong - arm votes .
His next move could signal what direction he and the Legislature will take this year as pensions and other special benefits for public employees have become the focus of public ire .
DeLeo declined requests for comment yesterday .
Representative Charles A. Murphy , chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means , said that " we 'll have a debate on the issue , " but that other programs may have to be cut if the Quinn Bill funding is restored .
" The practical effect is for us to fund $ 52 million ; that 's $ 52 million not going to , well , pick a program , " Murphy said yesterday .
" It all comes down to : ' How you going to pay for it , folks ?
What are you going to cut so you can restore it ? '
The whole thing has been a balancing act . "
The number of lawmakers who signed onto the amendment demonstrates the political clout that police unions still carry .
Within two days , the unions were able to get 80 House lawmakers , including several Republicans , to sign onto two amendments that would fund the program at $ 51.2 million .
A third amendment , filed by an 81st lawmaker - Representative John H. Rogers , a Norwood Democrat - would establish funding at $ 50.2 million .
Rogers has no cosponsors .
There have been several unsuccessful attempts to change the Quinn Bill .
In 2001 , for example , the House abandoned an overhaul of the system after intense lobbying by police interests .
In 2003 , there was an effort to provide officers with lump sums , rather than a percentage of their base pay , but the changes collapsed when there were disagreements between legislators and Governor Mitt Romney .
The amendments to restore funding to the Quinn Bill are among 978 filed by last Friday 's amendment - filing deadline ; the overall number of amendments , mostly requests for local funding for pet projects , was down about 35 percent from last year , reflecting more realistic expectations among lawmakers .
" It 's a direct result of the budget downfall , " said Representative Martin J. Walsh , a Dorchester Democrat , filing half the number of amendments he has in the past .
" It 's definitely due to the economy .
I do n't want to give anyone false expectations by filing an amendment only to have it fail or have to withdraw it . "
While the numbers may be lower , lawmakers have still submitted a wide range of local earmarks .
Also , as expected , House members filed a wide array of tax - related amendments , including raising the meals taxes , sales taxes , and the gas tax ; efforts to get new taxes have not yet won broad support in the Legislature .

What 's the best way to make sure those who use the most bandwidth get charged the most money ?
How about a tiered , " consumption - based " billing system ?
That was Time Warner 's plan for its services -- that is , until huge protests at the national level down forced them to scrap the idea .
Rising Network Costs
Rising network costs are becoming a problem for providers like Time Warner , who struggle with the increasing popularity of downloadable songs , TV shows , and movies -- along with a deepening economic depression .
As Torrents and peer - to - peer ( p2p ) protocols continue to climb in popularity , the ability of these companies to keep up goes down .
At least , that 's what Time Warner claims .
Tiered Billing : A Great Deal of " Misunderstanding "
Time Warner 's solution was a billing system that would rate customers on the amount of bandwidth they consumed .
Those of us who use the web for news , email , and the occasional Windows game would n't notice a difference , but that system could have a dramatic impact on web surfers who enjoy media downloads or streaming video and music .
These people have , understandably , protested vehemently against that kind of a tiered plan .
In a statement released yesterday , CEO Glenn Britt admitted that there was " a great deal of misunderstanding " between consumers , lawmakers , and his company when it came to the new billing idea .
( Source : cnet.com )
Leading the charge against Time Warner is Congressman Eric Massa , who has vowed to fight the introduction of any tiered system .
Although Massa was clearly pleased with the news that Time Warner was backing down when he announced it at a rally this week , he has n't stopped his campaign to make metered billing impossible in the future .
( Source : arstechnica.com )
$ 150 / Month for Unlimited Usage
Originally , the plan called for download and upload caps between 10 and 70 GB a month , with prices ranging from $ 25 to $ 65 / month based on bandwidth usage .
Big downloaders would have been offered a 100 GB plan for about $ 75 a month .
Those not satisfied with that could push for unlimited bandwidth , but it would have cost them $ 150 each month .
Time Warner , America 's second largest cable provider , does n't appear finished with the idea .
However , it will have to silence Massa and his legion of followers before resurrecting tiered billing .
When I tell people about my diet , they smile and nod through just about every detail .
Oh , you make your own condiments ?
Great .
You cook everything from scratch ?
Great .
You source local , organic vegetables and meats ?
Great .
When I tell them I cook with animal fats — lots of animal fats — I lose them .
It just goes against the grain of all the nutritional and dietary advice we ’ve been fed .
Equating a low - fat diet with health goes back at least 30 years .
It ’s an ingrained prejudice we can’t easily overcome .
So , when I set out to create a series of empowering video tutorials , I realized one of the first things I ’d have to do was make the case for eating animal fats .
And that ’s what I did .
It ’s 18 minutes of video packed full of information — maybe too much information .
Hope you enjoy !

Are you struggling to give up your low - fat mentality ?
Or , like me , have you always been a lover of fats ?
Do you harbor a prejudice against saturated fats ?
Come on !

Rope jumping makes bungee jumping look completely sane and kinda cute .
There 's no flex :
The whole " not dying " part is determined entirely by where you anchor the rope — and where you jump .

Leave it to the nation who contrived Russian Roulette to come up with rope jumping .
It looks totally simple and straight forward , until you just think for a second about the physics involved .
If you jump straight down , you could dislocate some important part of your body , or worse , you could snap the rope and keep on falling .
The key is to jump so that you swing across the underside of the bridge , and to trust that your rope is attached to something that ain't going nowhere .
And you 'd better be coordinated when doing it in groups of , say , 54 — like above — lest someone on their backswing hits you as you 're heading down .

Still not dangerous enough ?
Well , according to English Russia , rope jumpers like to up the ante by jumping ...
... when there is no water under the bridge but raw firm ice , also they use to jump at that same moment when the train is going thru the bridge .
None for me , thanks , but good luck to you .

Provoking street campaign which can be seen right now in Melbourne for the Australian Childhood Foundation .
For their ongoing campaign Stop Child Abuse Now agency JWT used child size mannequins to represent children suffering neglect .
The mannequins were placed in high traffic locations around the city and then a billposter was pasted over the top of the figure so only the feet and legs could be seen .
Words on the poster read , “ Neglected Children are made to feel invisible . ”
When the mannequin is removed the text “ Thank you for seeing me ” become visible .

Has an airline refused compensation after a flight delay or cancellation ?
Thanks to the European Court of Justice , you can demand at least £ 225 .
Barrister Richard Colbey explains
Many passengers who have tried claiming compensation from an airline for a cancelled flight will have encountered refusals based on " exceptional circumstances " .
Until earlier this month , at least in airline speak , it could mean not only extraordinary events – like the foiled terrorist attack which forced Glasgow airport to close – but technical defects .
European law entitles passengers whose flights are cancelled or substantially delayed to a minimum of € 250 ( £ 225 ) compensation .
The airline is only excused liability if it can show its failure was caused by these ill - defined exceptional circumstances .
Friederike Wallentin- Hermann had booked Alitalia tickets for herself , her husband and daughter from Vienna to Brinidisi in south - east Italy , via Rome .
The first leg of her flight was cancelled at very short notice , leaving her to take a roundabout route on Austrian Airlines , which resulted in them reaching their destination nearly four hours late .
The cancellation was due to a " complex " turbine engine failure , which took 10 days to fix .
Predictably , the airline claimed this was an " exceptional circumstance " .
Wallentin - Hermann decided to pursue her claim for the standard compensation , plus a small amount for telephone charges , in her local commercial court .
Airlines have tended , since the current compensation regulations were introduced in 2004 , not to defend claims from those passengers who actually use the courts .
Most prefer not to risk setting an unfavourable and incontrovertible precedent , which could make it harder to fob off the majority who give up before resorting to litigation .
Alitalia , however , decided to put its head above the pulpit , fighting the matter not only in the Austrian courts , but , when unsuccessful , appealing to the European Court of Justice .
The resulting decision will be welcome confirmation for passengers that routine technical faults are not " exceptional " .
The court 's reasoning recognised that airlines invariably face technical problems .
Checking for , and fixing these , is an inherent part of their business .
The mere fact that an airline has complied with the legal minimum maintenance requirement will not exempt it from liability when something mechanical goes wrong .
The judgment does not go so far as to rule that mechanical defects could never amount to exceptional circumstances .
The court recognised that a warning by the aircraft manufacturer leading to the removal from service of an entire fleet , or mechanical defects caused by terrorists or sabotage , could be treated differently .
The judgment was given in December last year , when it probably became known to the industry , but was only formally published earlier this month .
This has a personal resonance , as I suffered a Swiss International Air ( SIA ) cancellation on Boxing Day due , apparently , to a failed autopilot .
My compensation claim – I only sought out - of - pocket losses , not the full EU set sum – was initially met with the same response as the Wallentin - Hermanns ' .
A couple of stroppy emails did persuade SIA to pay up , but it was disappointing that the airline continued to argue this issue even after the European Court decision .
Airlines have no excuse now for not paying up ; some will doubtless continue to try it on .
Anyone encountering this who refers specifically to the " European Court case of Wallentin - Hermann v Alitalia " may impress the airline sufficiently so that it does not waste time trying to bluster its way out of paying up .
My girlfriend ’s Israeli father is constantly hassled about his accent , asked where he is from , given dirty looks , made to feel unwelcome in his western Michigan city .
He once told me that it has never felt like home and it never will .
We have failed him .
I may be an idealist , but I am not foolish — I know it is impossible to make all feel welcome , and I know that despite past rhetoric , we ’ve never even really tried .
We must as a people embrace more intensely our new neighbors , our new colleagues , our new citizens .
This is what makes us who we are and what makes us the most we can be .
We must break this trend and turn it the other way .
I have a friend who will be deported in a few weeks .
He has worked in this country for several years , settling here in Michigan a few years ago , working at a nonprofit .
He owns a home , has a mortgage , car payments , and a girlfriend .
He pays taxes here , in a cash - stricken state .
Or rather , he did until his visa was declared inadmissible a few days ago .
You see , he was the accidental beneficiary of a clerical error by the U.S. government .
He mistakenly applied for the same visa twice and was incorrectly granted it a second time by the U.S. consulate in his home country .
When he recently returned from a trip to do relief work in South America , he was detained as part of a new government - mandated investigative crackdown on religious worker visas .
The error was discovered and now he has no job , no way to pay the mortgage , and a black mark on his international record .
He ’s lucky that he has n’t been banned from the country forever and was given time to take care of things here .
He is from a European country that is one of the wealthiest and most developed in the world .
He is paying for our clerical mistake .
I am frightened .
We build our walls higher and higher , peering over the sides as the hordes grow larger and larger — some desperate to get in , some desperate to destroy our way of life .
I am frightened because when I stop looking out and start looking around , I see our population fixated , cautiously staring over the wall with the same angry and terrified expression .
We have come to a standstill , too frightened to look anywhere but outward .
We see nothing but enemies and backstabbing allies .
I never saw the world from the top of the Statue of Liberty , watched the sun set over Manhattan – the same sun that my family must have seen 150 years ago .
I never will .
It is no longer open for business , no longer open for entry .
You can only sit at her feet looking upward , fear barricading the doors .
I admit to naiveté .
I believe in this country .
I believe what I have been told by teachers , read in books .
I believe we are safe from within because we are accepting and dynamic .
We are countrymen first , no matter where our fathers came from , no matter where we came from .
I believe there is no other population in the world that so readily accepts others as their own .
I may even be right about this .
But that is not enough .
I am still wrong .
There are places here where you will be welcomed , more warmly , more thoroughly than anywhere in the world .
I like to pretend everywhere is like this , but it can only be pretend .
It hurts me because I love every nook of this country as if it were mine , defend them to outsiders as if they were my home .
But there are neighborhoods , towns , and cities where we do not accept these outsiders .
We have stepped up our antipathy .
I am dumbfounded .
We have cast aside the very thing that brought us prominence that we now cower in fear of losing .
In his powerful book The Post - American World , Fareed Zakaria traces America ’s historical strength to its openness to people , cultures , goods , services , and ideas , despite the contentious , partisan , and static government .
While European and Asian nations watch their populations age and stagnate , America ’s continues to rise on the back of its immigrants , its native - born white fertility rate already having slowed to the low European levels .
Immigrants and foreign students account for half our scientific research , and half of all Silicon Valley start - ups have at least one founder who is an immigrant or first - generation American .
Immigrants , Zakaria writes , bring with them a hunger for success and a drive to create that keep America vibrant in a way that few developed nations can maintain .
Yet our government continues to be the weak link in our national character , casting an even greater shadow than the unwelcoming citizens among us ever could .
Our policy is this : impossible to get in , impossible to stay , and easy to get out .
The devastating economic climate has allowed a surge of anti-immigrant discussion and legislation to mash its way through our domestic policy .
A friend of mine works for an investment bank bailed out by TARP .
Two incoming bankers , offered jobs last summer , had their offers rescinded in the past few weeks .
The problem was not that they did n’t perform , not that they did not graduate , not that they got in trouble with the law .
Their mistake was being born in a different country .
As has been publicized , the bailed - out banks can no longer hire foreigners .
Why ?
Why would we , the champions of free trade , of capitalism , of competition , disallow the hiring of the most competent employees ?
Are we afraid that these investment bankers will hoard their salaries and remit them back to scary places filled with people that have colored skin ?
If we are trying to rebuild the banking system , trying to make the best use of government money , then why would n’t we want the best people working for us ?
( CNN ) --
Thousands of veterans in South Florida may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV because of contaminated equipment after getting colonoscopies at the Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System , officials announced Monday .
In a news release , Rep. Kendrick B. Meek , D - Florida , says such mistakes undermine the VA 's effectiveness .
Two Florida lawmakers are asking for an inspector general 's inquiry .
" The VA is a model of the type of health care we provide our veterans , and when mistakes like this occur , it undermines the efficacy of the entire system , " said Rep. Kendrick B. Meek , D - Florida , in a news release .
Meek , along with Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Florida , is requesting an official inquiry by the inspector general of the VA .
In a letter to retired Gen. Eric Shinseki , the secretary of Veterans Affairs , Nelson said he is also concerned about possible contaminated equipment at facilities in Murfreesboro , Tennessee , and Augusta , Georgia .
" I am requesting that the VA Office of Inspector General begin an investigation into the potential problems of contamination ; whether any patient has contracted an infection from unsterilized equipment ; and , most importantly , how we can prevent such problems from happening again , " Nelson wrote .
" Finally , I urge the VA to commit to providing ongoing medical care in cases where it is responsible for exposing someone to a disease . "
On Monday , the VA sent letters to 3,260 people who may have had colonoscopies between May 2004 and March 12 , 2009 .
Hospital officials said a review of safety procedures found that tubing used in endoscope procedures was rinsed but not disinfected .
In the first 24 hours after the letters were released , the Miami VA got more than 2,600 calls and checked out more than 350 patients .
Nearly 600 more are scheduled for examinations over the next two weeks , officials at the facility said .
Learn more about what happened »
Officials say the risk of infection is minimal .
" What happened should not have happened .
We are taking steps to change it right now , " said John Vara , the Miami VA 's chief of staff .
The problem at the Miami VA facility comes on the heels of similar problems with endoscopies at the VA clinic in Murfreesboro .
In December 2008 , an investigation found that clinic workers were not following manufacturer 's directions and switched out parts they were n't supposed to switch out , according to investigators .
About 6,000 people who underwent colonoscopies at the clinic were notified and offered free testing for infections .
The Charlie Norwood VA Medica Center in Augusta , Georgia , also said it had " recently notified 1,200 veterans they may have been exposed to infection when undergoing ear , nose and throat ( ENT ) procedures between January and November of 2008 . "
In Miami , the VA has opened " special care clinics " to test veterans who received the notice and to provide information .
" Screening is strictly precautionary and does not indicate that any patients have contracted a virus , " Mary D. Berrocal , director of the Miami VA , said in a statement on the VA 's Web site .
The special care clinics opened Tuesday morning , and officials say response from patients has been good .
" They are being proactive , and we are glad .
We want them to get tested , " said Susan Warren , a spokeswoman for the Miami VA facility .

For 200 years , Randy Mumme ’s family has raised cattle on the same plot of southeast Texas land .
Then , about 10 years ago , something began to change .
His steers were losing weight .
Cows were miscarrying ; one gave birth to a calf with three legs .
Many calves were stillborn .
The family ’s ranching practices had not changed over the centuries , but the environment had .
His ranch is four miles downwind of large industrial plants that spew tons of carcinogens and other toxic substances into the air .
Mumme and other ranchers in Point Comfort suspect the factories are contributing to the ill health of their cattle .
Now scientists have found DNA evidence that suggests the ranchers ’ suspicions might be true , heightening concerns about their cattle as well as their own health .
Tests have revealed that herds as far as six miles downwind of the factories have more DNA disturbances than other herds not downwind , according to scientists at Texas A & M University .
The changes in chromosome structure and other genetic damage can increase the animal ’s risk of cancer and reproductive damage .
At the request of local ranchers , the researchers collected white blood cell samples from 21 herds within an 11 - mile radius of the industrial facilities .
Because of the strong , steady wind from the southeast , researchers expected that if Formosa Plastic Corp. was the main culprit , cattle located downwind or northwest from the industrial complex would show larger genetic disturbances .
The results “ provided a strong indication of increased damage ” in herds downwind of the industrial complexes , according to the study , published in January in the science journal Ecotoxicity .
Cattle with the DNA damage were “ oriented around the [ Formosa ] facility , with the highest damage occurring with those nearby and those downwind , ” said Wesley Bissett , lead study author and a veterinarian at Texas A & M’s College of Veterinary Medicine .
Bissett reported damage to cattle both within close proximity of the facility and in areas where the prevailing winds would blow the toxic gases .
Formosa spokesman Jim Sheppard said there is no direct evidence that industry is to blame .
“ The highest evidence of DNA damage was some distance from the industrial plants , rather than close to them , ” he said , adding that the scientists said in their report that other environmental conditions or cattle herd management might be to blame .
Formosa , which has operated in Point Comfort for 25 years , has undergone two multi-billion - dollar expansions over the past 15 years .
Alcoa Inc. , an aluminum manufacturer , also has a large facility near the ranches but not downwind .
DNA damage occurs in every living organism , but in most cases , normal repair mechanisms can mend it , said Terry Clawson of the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality .
For example , ultraviolet rays from sunlight break DNA chains but in most cases cause no health effects .
The Point Comfort cattle , however , have such a high prevalence of genetic damage across multiple herds that scientists say it suggests an environmental cause .
Toxic substances can either bind directly to DNA or indirectly damage it by affecting enzymes and causing mutations that lead to increased risk of certain diseases , scientists say .
Niladri Basu , an environmental toxicologist at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study , said the findings indicate that living downwind of large industrial plants can harm DNA and perhaps harm the health of animals , ecosystems and people .
“ These results validate the health concerns raised by area residents and a human study is warranted , ” Basu said .
In 2002 , when the cattle study began , 1.4 million pounds of 43 toxic chemicals were emitted from Formosa and Alcoa plants , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
Many of the chemicals are known carcinogens , including butadiene , used in the production of rubber , and dichloroethylene , an industrial solvent .
Texas state officials fined Formosa $ 150,000 in 2000 for air pollution violations , including vinyl chloride and hydrogen chloride emissions that exceeded health limits multiple times .
Since then , the emissions have declined , Clawson said .
The area has long been known for other problems related to toxic substances .
Point Comfort is on the eastern banks of Lavaca Bay , which was classified as a Superfund site in 1980 due to mercury contamination from Alcoa .
A 2007 study conducted by the same Texas A & M researchers shows wastewater discharges into the bay may be associated with DNA damage in oysters .
Researchers say more studies are needed to confirm the link between the industrial emissions and the cattle ’s DNA damage , and to see if there are any human health effects .
Currently , no one is studying health of the ranchers .
Such studies are complex because people are exposed to a variety of chemicals and lifestyles , such as smoking , that can harm their health , Bissett said .
For now , many of the ranchers fear for their families ’ health and hope that further tests will help them recoup the costs of the calves that have been aborted or died before reaching full term .
Mumme , who is 59 , grew up on the ranch and began managing it for his uncle in 1986 .
“ The presence of that plant has negatively affected the quality and quantity of livestock production and I fully believe it has also affected human health , ” Mumme said .
“ The most important question now is what long - lasting effects will this have on me and on my kids ? ”

Mr Varnakulasingham wanted to draw attention to Sri Lanka 's civil war The UK - based family of a young Tamil man who set himself on fire in protest at the treatment of his countrymen in Sri Lanka have said they are proud of his actions .
Thousands of Tamils living in the UK and beyond attended the funeral on Saturday in Northolt , west London , of Murugathasan Varnakulasingham , 26 , who travelled to Switzerland last month to kill himself in front of the United Nations building in Geneva .
Mr Varnakulasingham , a computing graduate who worked part - time in a supermarket , had attended demonstrations to protest against the Sri Lankan military 's war against the Tamil Tigers .
The rebels are fighting for a Tamil homeland in the north and east of the island .
Thousands of people have been killed , and thousands more displaced on the island since fighting escalated after 2005 .
I decided to sacrifice my life ...
The flames over my body will be a torch to guide you through the liberation path
Murugathasan Varnakulasingham 's suicide letter Mr Varnakulasingham 's brother - in - law Thavaroopan Sinnathamby , 33 , said : " He was a very lovely guy and we miss him a lot , but he did this for the country .
" He was a sensitive guy .
He was a refugee in his own country before he came here , so he knew the pain of what the people were going through .
" He 'd go to the demonstrations and no - one was bothering and he wanted to make an impact .
I think he wanted to give his life , we feel proud for that . "
Before he doused himself in petrol and set himself alight in the Place des Nations in Geneva , Mr Varnakulasingham wrote a five - page letter .
It read : " We Tamils , displaced and all over the world , loudly raised our problems and asked for help before [ the ] international community in your own language for three decades .
" But nothing happened ...
So I decided to sacrifice my life ...
The flames over my body will be a torch to guide you through the liberation path . "
Copycat suicides
The young man 's family , said Mr Sinnathamby , did not know in advance of his suicide plans .
He said : " We had no idea .
If we did know , we would not have let him go . "
He said the first they heard there was something wrong was when friends and family started calling up asking where he was .
Then friends started calling to say they had seen his brother - in - law 's name on the internet .
The family checked online and on a Tamil news website , where they saw his name and date of birth .
" Unfortunately , it was true , " said Mr Sinnathamby .
Mr Varnakulasingham 's death appears to have inspired at least one other " copycat " suicide attempt in the UK - a man thought to be a Tamil who tried to set himself alight outside Downing Street last month .
Security tight Previously there were at least two other reported incidents of attempted self - immolation in the UK by Tamils , and there have also been more than a dozen other suicides - by - fire in India and worldwide .
There are estimated to be about 250,000 Tamils living in the UK - many of them refugees of Sri Lanka 's decades - long civil war between the Tamil Tigers and the majority Sinhalese government .
Speaking before the funeral , Thaya Idaikkadar , chairman of the British Tamil Councillors and Associates group said security would be tight .
On Saturday afternoon , after most mourners had paid their respects , a Scotland Yard spokesman said there had been a police presence at the funeral but there were no reports of disturbances .

Last week I provided a few basic green upgrades that can help you save money .
This time around it's all about tech that will save money and potentially increase the value of your home .

Saving Energy

In the previous Prof . Dealzmodo article , I talked about upgrades like switching to CFLs and investigating options for eliminating wasteful standby power like eco-oriented powerstrips .
These kinds of upgrades are affordable on most budgets — real no-brainers .
However , if you want to go the extra mile and make upgrades that could increase the value of your home , here are some products to consider :
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
• Solar Power : Okay , let 's get right to it .
When people think " green , " they think of solar panels .
But according to the most recent data compiled by the Energy Information Administration , the average US home uses somewhere around 30 kilowatthours ( kWh ) of electricity per day .
That translates into $ 1500 to $ 2000 a year on electricity bills .
Generally , a 1kWh ( 1000 watt ) system is recommended for every 1000 square feet of floor space ( depending on where you live ) and you can expect to pay around $ 8 to $ 10 per watt installed .
Throw in an inverter or two to covert the sun's DC power into AC and a battery bank and you are talking $ 20000 or more for a complete system .
So it seems that if you do n't live in a home for 20 years or more , you will not see a return on this investment .
However , there is a strong chance that your local government and utility companies will offer incentives like tax breaks , discounts or up - front cash rebates to subsidize the cost of your system , provided your homeowners association approves of your plans .
Advertisement
As CNN points out , Texas - based Austin energy currently provides rebates of $ 3.75 per watt — so right away you could probably shave nearly $ 4000 off of the $ 10000 price tag of a 1kWH system .
Texas also offers a tax exemption " of the amount of the appraised property value that arises from the installation or construction of a solar or wind - powered energy device . "
On top of that the Federal Government offers substantial tax credits for installing photovoltaic systems .
As far as home values are concerned , the US Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that the value of a home rises $ 20 for every $ 1 in reduced monthly electricity bills .

Obviously , the effectiveness of a photovoltaic system depends on a number of factors like the amount of sunlight your location receives and the position of the panels in relationship to the position of the sun in the sky .
But when you add up all of the possible incentives , and you figure out just how sunny it is where you live , the expense looks like it might be worth it .

• Wind Turbines : Harnessing wind power is often a great way to supplement an existing solar array and can generate a surprising amount of power if you live in a suitable climate .
A small residential turbine rated between 5kWh and 15kWh generally costs somewhere between $ 6000 and $ 22000 installed .
Again , there are local and federal incentives that can help to cut costs and recoup your expenses faster .
The downside is that if you do n't live in a very windy area , or can't get your neighbors to permit you to reach the height required to get a turbine really going , it 's a non-option .
• Energy Star Appliances :
This was mentioned in last week 's article but it bears repeating .
These devices use 10 % to 50 % less energy than their power - sucking counterparts , and you do n't have to ask your homeowners association permission to install them ( for the most part ) .
Do a little math , and you find that the premium price of these appliances will be paid back in good time — plus the energy savings will be attractive to buyers if appliances are part of the deal when you eventually sell your house .

• Greenswitches :
If you want a simple way to reduce the power consumption in your home , check out a company called GreenSwitch .
By quickly re-wiring your home with single - control outlets , each outlet can be designated as green or standard as needed .
All you need to do is flick a single switch and all of the electronics in the home that run on standby power — and plugged into green outlets — are turned off .
A system like this can save 8 % to 10 % a year in energy bills and " costs between $ 500 and $ 1000 for an average home . "
That means it 's paid off in three to five years .
If the installation prices get cheaper , it will be a pretty fast money - saver .
• Argon-Filled Windows :
Most double - paned windows are vacuum sealed , so there 's nothing between them at all .
But windows filled instead with argon or krypton gas are said to help insulate the interior of a home better , and block UV rays .
Prices of the units and the money saved vary of course , but some sources claim that the results are dramatic .
Finehomebuilding.com has provided a handy guide for anyone looking for more information .

• Solar and Gas-Powered Tankless Hot -Water Systems : Solar power is n't just for producing electricity .
There are also systems that are devoted to producing hot water — a process that can generate as much as 25 % of our utility bills .
There are several different configurations involving one of three types of solar collectors and storage tanks .
These systems can be either active systems with circulating pumps or passive systems without pumps .
Setting up a basic system can run you around $ 7000 to $ 8000 , but like traditional solar arrays , these installations are often subsidized by local utility companies and the federal government , and add value to a home .
Keep in mind that in most cases a traditional water heater will be necessary to fill in the gaps from time to time because hot water cannot be stored indefinitely — or sold back to the utility company .

Speaking of more conventional water heaters , replacing your standard electric or gas heater with a tankless version can save as much as 50 % on your hot water bill .
The main point :
If you 're not using hot water , it 's not using energy to keep water hot .
The life expectancy is twice that of a conventional heater , it takes up a lot less space , and it produces hot water whenever you need it , with a near instant " recovery time " — no more having to deal with people hogging all the hot water by taking really long showers .
Systems like this will cost over $ 1000 but , again , there are incentives in place .
For example , if you purchase a tankless heater from Rinnai between Jan 1 , 2009 and December 31st 2010 you will be eligible for a tax credit equal to 30 % of the full purchase and installation price , up to $ 1500 .
Saving Water
The water bill is another expense that can really bite you in the ass — especially if you live in arid climates or do a lot of yardwork .
If you are looking to go beyond simple rain barrels , here are some wise investments for homeowners looking to reduce their water consumption :
• Low - Flow Toilets and Showerheads : Low - flow toilets have come a long way in recent years .
Newer models can handle anything you and your butthole can dish out — all while using a modest 1.6 gallons per flush ( about half of a standard toilet ) .
Low - flow shower heads have also progressed to a point that they provide great water pressure with low consumption rates that range from 0.5 to 2.5 gallons per minute .
Advertisement
• Gray Water Systems :
In a nutshell , a gray water system recycles the water used in showers , sinks and washing machines — but not your toilets — to irrigate your lawn .
" Gray water " makes up as much as 80 % of our residential wastewater — water we could be re-using to save money .
A basic gray - water irrigation system can run as low as $ 500 to $ 2500 for an average home .
Apparently , untreated water is fine for most irrigation needs , but there are also companies like Pontos out there that use a bioculture and UV light treatment to purify the water .
It 's just for yard use , though — you 're not supposed to drink gray water .

• Efficient Irrigation Systems : I 'm not a big lawn guy , but I am a big gadget guy , and speaking of yards , some of the lawn - watering systems out there these days are quite impressive .
For example : Toro 's TIS - 612 Intelli-Sense controller uses pre-programmed information about your landscaping and collects daily weather information via satellite to determine how much water a specific plant should get and when .
Units range from 6 to 24 sprinklers , with prices falling between $ 320 to $ 1000 .
A subscription to the WeatherTRAK Everywhere Data Service will cost you a measly $ 48 per year in additional costs .
That 's pretty affordable , but the kicker is that because the system is so customized , the makers claim you can save between 20 % and 60 % on your monthly water bills .
With all of the focus on reducing energy costs and dependence these days , green tech is poised to become one of the biggest draws in the housing market in the decades to come .
You have to spend money to make money as they say , but government and utility company incentives combined with energy cost savings make many of these upgrades surprisingly doable and profitable over time .

Most importantly , if you 're pondering any kind of green upgrade , do n't spend a penny until you hear how many pennies are gonna come back your way .
If the dealer is mum on the subject , tell him to take a hike , because these subsidies are real .

They encouraged the local authorities to send them more and they have now created a complex of around 20 buildings using the beer bottles , comprising the main temple over a lake , crematorium , prayer rooms , a hall , water tower , tourist bathrooms and several small bungalows raised off the ground which serve as monks quarters .
Mr Blair ( L ) said others had envisaged a " worst - case scenario " in Iran Iran has no weapons - grade uranium , US military officials have said in an attempt to clarify recent statements from Washington and Israel .
National Intelligence director Dennis Blair told US senators that Tehran had only low - enriched uranium , which would need processing to be used for weapons .
He said Iran had " not yet made that decision " to convert it .
Mr Blair also said al - Qaeda was weaker now than a year ago thanks to sustained pressure on militant bases in Pakistan .
' Crossed the threshold '
Iran says its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful , but the West has long suspected the country of seeking atomic weapons .
Mr Blair 's comments came a week after Adm Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Iran had enough " fissile material " to make a bomb .
And earlier this week Israel 's top intelligence official Amos Yadlin said Iran had " crossed the technological threshold " and was now capable of making a weapon .
The Israelis are far more concerned about it
Lt Gen Michael Maples

But in his evidence to the Senate Armed Services Committee , Mr Blair said the Israelis were envisaging a " worst - case scenario " .
" We assess now that Iran does not have any highly enriched uranium " , he said .
Although analysts broadly agreed that Iran had some low - enriched uranium , the enrichment process to produce weapons - grade material would involve technology that the country is not thought to possess , Mr Blair added .
Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt Gen Michael Maples , testifying before the same committee , said Israel and the US had the same information but had come to different conclusions .
" The Israelis are far more concerned about it , " he told the committee .
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington says the tone reflects President Barack Obama 's wish to reach out diplomatically to Tehran .
Meanwhile , Mr Blair gave an upbeat assessment of the battle against al - Qaeda .
He said air strikes and raids carried out by the US and their allies in Pakistan 's tribal areas , near the Afghan border , had killed a number of al - Qaeda leaders .
He said this , combined with Muslim opinion turning against the organisation , had made the group less capable of launching attacks .
But the BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner , says analysts suspect that US intelligence may be underestimating the radicalising effect of the recent conflict in Gaza - in which Palestinian deaths outnumbered Israeli ones by 100 to one .

The casino gambling industry that began as a clutch of mob -grown casinos in Vegas and Reno is now said to sport between 850 and 900 casinos in 40 states .
This , according to critics , has not only wreaked economic and social havoc across the country — increases in crime , bankruptcies and suicides — but has compelled religious communities to rethink their historic approaches to the ancient debate over the morality of gambling .
New approaches have quietly developed in the shadows of the so - called culture wars that have pitted religious groups and factions so fiercely against one another for decades .
Undeterred by this history of conflict , the organized religious community has grown in its unified opposition to what they now term “ predatory gambling , ” maintaining a remarkable comity in the process .
“ It is a myth ” says Leslie Bernal , executive director of DC - based Stop Predatory Gambling , “ that liberal and conservative religious groups ca n’t get along . ”
The same , he says , goes for the many religious and secular groups that work comfortably together all the time .
“ This is something I take for granted . ”
The transformation of the religious community ’s understanding of and response to the situation turns on two key points .
One is distinguishing between what they call “ predatory ” forms of gambling and “ social gambling , ” such as church bingo nights , buddies playing poker , or the office football pool .
“ Predatory gambling , ” Bernal says , “ is the practice of using gambling to prey on human weaknesses for profit . ”
He points to the highly addictive nature of contemporary electronic slot machines and video poker as the primary source of the profound “ social costs ” related to gambling addition .
“ Slots are , ” he says , “ designed to make you play as fast as possible for as long as possible , ” and in gambling industry parlance , “ to play to extinction . ”
The other key transformational understanding is a growing recognition that state - sponsored casino gambling is incompatible with constitutional democracy itself .
This argument is being championed by eminent historian of the civil rights movement Taylor Branch , who says that raising revenue via state - supported gambling addiction is a betrayal of the citizens and an avoidance of critical questions about our democracy : what do we want our government to do and how we are going to pay for it ?
“ State - sponsored predatory gambling is essentially a corruption of democracy , ” he said recently .
“ [ T ] his violates our social compact , and the trust we must have in the belief that we are all in this together , ” he continued .
“ And the first step away from it is to play each other for suckers .
We ’re going to trick them into thinking they are going to get rich , but they are really going to be paying my taxes . ”
One of the reasons for the rapid growth of the casino industry has been the willingness of cash - strapped state governments to hear what they want to hear and disregard the rest .
In light of this alliance between industry and government Laura Everett , associate director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches ( a century - old coalition of 1700 Protestant and Orthodox churches ) says that their priority has shifted from an emphasis on gambling as a matter of personal responsibility , to confronting the issue as a matter of good government .
“ State - sponsored gambling , ” she says , “ is not an ethical way to raise revenue , because it hurts the poorest and the most vulnerable . ”
Clergy , she says , understand this because they are “ on the front line of the brokenness in their communities ” and because “ most clergy have interacted with gambling addicts . ”
The Battle of Massachusetts
Casino Free Mass ( CFM ) , a formal coalition comprising religious right , left , and secular organizations includes , among others , the League of Women Voters , the National Association of Social Workers and the National Association on Mental Illness , Massachusetts Catholic Conference The Massachusetts Family Institute , ( the state political affiliate of James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family Action ) the Massachusetts Council of Churches and the Boston Chapter of the Muslim American Society .
CFM epitomizes the transformational nature of the debate , highlighting both the predatory nature of gambling and the damage it does to democracy .
They also happen to mirror the national coalition formally opposed to state - sponsored gambling ; while religious and other demographics vary from state to state , the cohesiveness of the Massachusetts coalition is , Bernal says , typical .
Last year the group played a high profile role in defeating — by a better than 2 - 1 margin in the legislature — a major casino development proposal by the popular Democratic governor , Deval Patrick , which was backed by the state ’s two major newspapers , the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald .
Laura Everett said that the statewide media generally failed to hold a fair public discussion , which magnified the importance of smaller newspapers and bloggers .
“ The churches , ” she added , “ provided forums for public discussions that the media did not . ”
“ There is a long history of the churches being public forums for discussion , ” Everett said .
What made this particularly important as a factor in driving public conversation was that there were “ core groups of people who know their church ’s teaching . ”
“ People were ready to have that conversation . ”
This will no doubt be an important factor this year when Governor Patrick introduces a fresh casino proposal in the midst of a continuing budget crisis and a friendlier legislature due to the election of a new , pro-gambling Speaker of the House .
Governor Patrick and his allies have tended to play down the seriousness of the social costs in light of what they claim will be the economic benefits .
Whether there is much if any economic benefit remains a highly debated issue .
What is n’t debatable , however , are CFM ’s concerns about addiction and democracy .
Sacrificing Citizens
Slots were legal in two states in 1985 ( Nevada and New Jersey ) .
Today there are 800,000 machines in 40 states .
The new generation of electronic “ slots ” do not even use coins .
You purchase and swipe an electronic card like you do at the ATM .
The addictive nature of the electronic slots and their role as the main revenue stream of the gambling industry is not widely understood .
Industry data show that 70 - 80 % of the revenue of casinos come from these machines , and investors are not very interested in casinos without slots .
The rapid expansion of slots and the casino economy led Congress in 1999 to commission a major study of their economic and social impact .
Edward F. Saunders Jr. , Esq. , executive director of the Massachusetts Catholic Conference , summarized some of the major findings in testimony before the Massachusetts legislature last year .
“ [ G] ambling , whatever its benefits , ” he said , “ came with ‘ undeniable and significant costs . ’”
These included increases in crime due to “ desperate gamblers committing illegal acts to finance their problem and pathological gambling . ”
These crimes included forgery , credit card theft , domestic violence , child abuse and neglect , alcohol and drug offenses . ”
He also cited increases in homelessness and divorce .
Similar data have piled up from numerous reputable sources since the landmark Congressional study .
Casino Free Mass board member Leo Maley , writing in the Amherst Bulletin cited , for example , “ a 213 percent increase in suicides ( from 24 to 75 ) in the first two years after casinos opened ” in Gulfport , Mississippi .
“ Such numbers , ” he wrote , “ are replicated elsewhere . ”
In a powerful video recently posted by Casino Free Mass in anticipation of the next round of debate over introducing casinos in the state , a prominent medical researcher compares a multicolored brain scan of a cocaine addict about to receive a fix and that of someone sitting at a slot machine .
The same sections of each brain light up in ways that are indistinguishable .
“ I think it ’s cowardly , ” said Laura Everett .
” We are going to sacrifice our citizens .
We know that there are people in Massachusetts who will become addicted .
What Patrick is saying is ‘ you are expendable . ’ ”
While the trend in the industry is towards increasing predatory practices , Everett says that the “ nostalgic view of the slot machine ” leaves many people unaware of their malignant role at the center of the gambling industry , or that without slots there would be few if any casinos .
“ Everything else , ” Everett says regarding the surrounding casino “ is bells and whistles . ”
23 year old Lindsay Massaro , a teacher at Centenary College in Sussex County , New Jersey was arrested Monday on allegations that she had sexual relations with an eighth grade student from her class .
Police allege that Massaro had a week long fling in late March with the student , which involved both “ sexual penetration and sexual contact . ”
Her charges include sexual assault , endangering the welfare of a minor and criminal sexual contact .
Massaro was released from jail on $ 75,000 bail .
Until she faces court in May , she is not allowed near the school or to have unsupervised contact with minors under 16 .
For eight hours law enforcement and agriculture officials entered the ammonia reeking barns on Plains Road where 3 million laying hens are stacked on top of each other over manure pits , gathering photos , shooting video and removing dead and living hens for evidence .
The live hens had to be euthanized said state veterinarian , Don Hoenig .
Quality Egg of New England , registered to Mountain Hollow Farms , a division of Radlo Foods and the former infamous DeCoster Egg Farm produces 21 million eggs a week .
Yet to hear their customers tell it , not one of the eggs from the facility where live hens were kicked into manure pits and left to hang by their feet or suffocate in garbage cans went to their stores .
Eggs from the raided farm , stamped 1183 or 1203 , were found at Shaw's , Hannaford and Wal - Mart by the Sun Journal yet Shaw's , Hannaford 's and customer Stop & Shop denied doing business with Quality Eggs .
Hello ?
Even Eggland 's
Best -- which has three dedicated barns at one Turner facility site where it feeds hens vegetarian food and whose truck can be seen during the raid -- denies doing business with Quality Eggs !
P.S. Its birds are just as abused .
Take one look at the video
http://www.mercyforanimals.org/maine-eggs/ and photos click here captured by Mercy For Animals ( MFA ) , a national animal protection group , from December 2008 through February 2009 and you 'll see why the grocery stores are lying .
Barely live birds , their beaks oozing , limbs useless and unable to hold their heads up are kept alive to lay one more " incredible , edible " egg for Quality Egg factory farmers .
Oblivious , $ 7.25 - an - hour workers twist hens ' necks in incomplete " euthanasia , " casting them aside to flap on the floor in the death sequelae which is painful to watch .
Nor is the diary of the MFA investigator upon whose evidence the Department of Agriculture 's raid was based , pretty .
" A hen 's head and wing were trapped under the cage 's front wall .
One of her legs was stretched out and would not move or bend .
She had a gash on her right side , leaving the skin split open and mostly yellow inside .
A gash on her left side was red from fresh blood with a layer of dust partially covering the wound , " writes the investigator .
" Another live hen , also trapped under her cage 's front wall , had the side of her face on a moving egg belt .
I saw that the side of her face , including her eye , was encrusted in what appeared to be egg yolk and dust . "
Even point and click bloggers were turned off .
" Seeing how awful these hens look .
there hair falling out , and green stuff coming out of there eyes and nose .
Are the eggs safe even to eat ? " wrote Bob on the Sun Journal site .
" I wouldnt think so . "
Say that .
But even as state vet Don Hoenig told a state agricultural committee workshop in Augusta that conditions were " deplorable , horrifying and upsetting , " -- the search warrant has been turned over to Franklin County Assistant District Attorney Andrew Robinson as egg - laying hens are protected by Maine 's animal cruelty laws -- Quality Eggs Compliance Manager Bob Leclerc said shucks it was n't that bad .
Not only was the situation " isolated incidents committed by a couple of employees , " said Leclerc , " none of these incidents were ever brought to the attention of management before . "
Au contraire .
MFA video shows management briefed , repeatedly , about the ongoing animal mistreatment -- they said to ignore it -- including Jay DeCoster , the owner 's son .
Oops .
Leclerc also noted that Quality Eggs adheres to United Egg Producer guidelines -- which permit battery cages and other cruelty and are largely the reason California 's Proposition 2 passed by such a large margin -- and promised the egg farm will conduct is own investigation .
Maybe they 'll discover they have 3 million hens packed together so tightly they can't move with no vet or humane care .
While eggs can be produced more humanely , they are also an unnecessary food item say many animal welfare groups .
As protein , the cholesterol " grenades " contribute to strokes , heart attacks and diabetes .
And as a filler ingredient in food production they are easily replaced as proved by Kraft Foods ' high - growth meat alternative brand Boca Foods which announced in March it was going egg free .
It may have even gotten some new customers .

People in general have difficulty with this concept .
I guess the human tendency is to concern ourselves with what others are receiving .
We see this occur in school , the workplace , and with children .
The common phrase that goes along with it is " it is not fair " .
Of course , subs are no different .
When dealing with multiple subs , if you are poly , you will find that these tendencies arise quite often .
There might be some jealousy between them over the treatment each is receiving .
Instances where the sharing and gossiping occurs to the detriment of all involved .
Many times these circumstances will model the childish games which occurs between young siblings .
This is all par for the course .
There is added emphasis on this when we cross over into the M/s world .
There , since the power exchange extends into so many more areas , the tendency for comparing is great .
In the end , it is like dealing with a child .
Those of you who have multiple kids will understand this concept .
The bottom line is that no parent treats each child exactly the same .
That is because no two children are the same .
They are often different ages , with non-matching experiences .
The maturity level ( of the child ) is a factor which affects a parent 's decisions .
Yet , one child is not loved , nor more valuable to the parent .
Each are the same in that area .
The same is true for subs .
Each has different experiences and training .
Also , there are different maturity levels and limits to what each can handle .
They all desire to be treated the same yet that is impossible .
Some will gain a Dom 's favor in certain areas .
This is a part of life .
Any sub who spends her time comparing herself to her sister (s ) is in for a long afternoon .
It will put her on an endless loop which she will not mentally resolve .
There is no way to justify the situation positively in her mind .
Each relationship between a Dom and sub ( master / slave ) is individual .
Is it best to approach it in that way .
Whenever
One tries to approach subs collectively , negativity arises .
Human tendencies will take over .
Be mindful of this when you are interacting with more than one sub .

There are several reasons why Iraq has failed to rise to the occasion , and in this article I will attempt to address some of them :
However , six years after the fall of Baghdad , the country is nowhere close to producing 6 million barrels a day .
As a matter of fact , the country is still not producing at the same level it did before the war ( 2.2 m bpd vs 2.5 m bpd before the war ) .
It is worth noting that the pre-war level was achieved despite years of war and crippling economic sanctions .
Yet despite current access to capital and technology , the country could not yield better results than oil production under the Saddam regime in the midst of war and sanctions .
Ever since the fall of Baghdad in April 2003 , we have heard about the unlimited potential for the Iraqi oil .
Often news reports mention that Iraq has the third largest oil reserves in the world , and that Iraq 's oil ministry has a goal of producing 6 million barrels / day of oil over the medium term .
Investors and global oil companies such as Shell Petroleum , Eni , China National Petroleum , and Exxon Mobile betting on Iraq are certain to be disappointed .
This is a guest post by Nawar Alsaadi .
Nawar currently lives in Canada , but lived in Iraq until 1990 .
He still has close ties to the country , and has been following the situation closely there .
Endemic Corruption
As of last year , according to the corruption ranking of Transparency International , Iraq ranked 2nd worst in the world .
It was slightly higher then Somalia and in line with Myanmar .
Actually if we were to follow the survey from 2003 to 2008 , we see the following erosion in the country corruption score ( 10 being the highest , and 1 the lowest ) :
Based on analysis of Transparency International
Thus despite the Iraqi government assurances that it is doing its best to combat corruption , it seems that corruption is growing at an alarming rate , taking Iraq to the path of overtaking the failed state of Somalia in the near future .
Political Oil Reserves
It is often claimed that Iraq has the third largest oil reserves at 113 billion barrels .
The source for these numbers is rarely discussed .
Thus it is worth looking at the origin of those claims .
Iraq nationalized the oil industry in 1972 when it took full control of the western controlled Iraq Petroleum Oil Company ( IPOC ) .
At that time Iraq ’s oil reserves stood at 35.9 billion barrels according to the IPOC and were reported by Baghdad to be at 30 billion barrels as recently as 1982 .
However , interestingly enough , as the Iraq - Iran war raged and Iraq ’s need for additional revenues to finance the war grew , Iraq ’s oil reserves jumped to 41 billion in 1983 , followed by a jump to 48 billion in 1987 and finally they topped 100 billion by the end of the war in 1988 .
However after the complete halt of exploration due to the 1991 gulf war , Iraq oil reserves jumped to 112.5 Billion in 1995 , and this is where they stand today .
Iraq was not alone in significantly increasing its reserves , several OPEC nations did the same , one reason is that OPEC production quotes at the time where determined by the country ’s declared proven reserves , thus we see a race between the OPEC members to increase reserves within this period :
Data from Dr. Colin Campbell , in SunWorld , 1995 ( Click here for references )
Furthermore none of the above nations allow for any decrease in reserves to account for the already produced oil , as of 1995 when Iraq declared an increase of its reserves to 112.5 Billion , the U.S. Geological Survey calculated that at least 22 billion barrels of Iraq oil reserves have already been produced by that date , and if we were to update those number to 2009 , we can safely add an additional 10 billion barrels produced in the last 13 years .
So what is a reasonable estimation for the remaining Iraqi reserves ?
According to Dr. Colin Campbell a prominent oil geologist and founder of the Association for the Peak Study of Oil and Gas ( ASPO ) Iraq oil reserves stand at about 60 billion barrels , or about half the official estimates .
Bad Management
Since the fall of Baghdad and the start of the “ democratization ” process , the country has lost thousands of technocrats under the pretext of the their Baath political affiliation .
This has opened the door to mainly political appointments at key Iraqi ministries including the Ministry of Oil .
The lack of oil industry experience by the appointed , combined with the surging levels of corruption has conspired to limit the growth in the Iraqi oil production since 2003 .
This failure is amplified by the ministry ’s failure to bring production back to 2002 levels six years after the regime change .
However , what is more worrisome after several years of miss - management is that Iraqi oil production is on the verge of witnessing a sharp decline in production to possibly under 2 million barrels a day , as indicated from recent news reports :
February 24th 2009
A Guardian newspaper article talked about a 250,000 barrels / day decline in Iraqi oil output , and the alarm of the oil ministry in regard to the issue :
Pressure problems at two southern oilfields are the main reason for a decline of 250,000 barrels per day .
That , on top of oil 's $ 100 a barrel price collapse since July last year , has already forced Iraq to cut its budget twice .
Alarmed by the loss of output from its reliable southern oilfields , Baghdad sent a high - powered committee to investigate and devise a quick fix .
April 17th 2009
Creeping water cut levels , this second article from the Guardian indicates an aggressive plan by the Iraqi oil ministry to deal with wet crude through the issuance of several tenders to deal with the issue :
It has issued a blitz of tenders recently for degassing and dehydration plants , valves , control systems , pumping software , pumps , storage tanks , and equipment for treating wet crude -- oil mixed with high levels of ground water .
For those who do n’t know the significance of wet crude , as oil wells age , the extracted oil is often mixed with water .
An increased water to oil ratio indicates an imminent production problem and can lead to a total collapse in production , if not treated adequately .
The most dire warning came on April 23th 2009 , as reported in this MEED article :
The sources tell MEED the country 's oil output could drop by up to 10 per cent by December 2010 as production from state - run South Oil Company ( SOC ) falls by 220,000 barrels a day ( b/d ) as a result of a deterioration in the productivity of its wells at fields including South and North Rumaila , West Qurna and Missan .
SOC suffered a 100,000 b/d fall in production in 2008 .
The sources say the company will suffer further 100,000 - b/d drops in both 2009 and 2010 .
The drop in production has already forced SOC to cut supplies to local refineries to meet crude export requirements .
Furthermore :
" The reality is that there is a crisis in the making , " says one executive from an international oil company that has attended meetings with SOC to address the problem .
" Everyone is used to focusing on security and infrastructure problems whenever something is not going right in Iraq , but this time it is down to physics . "
Jabbar al - Luaibi , a former head of SOC who now advises the Oil Ministry on all oil projects in southern Iraq , says the collapse in production is due to Baghdad falling behind with its drilling programme over the past six years and the declining productivity of its existing wells .
" It has got to the point where we have 300 wells not flowing in some of our biggest fields , and that means a lot of work just to get us back on track to where we were a few years ago , " says Al - Luaibi .
" We know there has been a 100,000 - b/d decline in 2008 and we will see the same drop from the production platform in 2009 and 2010 .
After that , we could be looking at even sharper falls . "
Al - Luaibi says the problems in production can be attributed to a delay in the maintenance of existing wells , reservoir management problems and the amount of water leaking into the reservoirs .
As indicated from recent news reports , Iraq oil industry seems to be in a dire state , and the country is scrambling to maintain oil production at current levels .
However , if the performance of the Iraqi government over the past few years is any indication , their current efforts are unlikely to solve the issue .
Political Rivalry and Foreign Oil Company Stalemates
One of the main issues blocking the development of the Iraqi oil wealth is the political rivalry and mistrust between the various political factions governing the country .
The greed and the competition for power has lead to a multi- year stalemate in the passage of the key hydrocarbon law introduced in 2006 and revised four times so far .
And it does not seem that a passage is near , based on this April 17th 2009 headline :
Kurdish minister ' not very optimistic ' oil law soon passed
This headline is of key significance , since the Kurds are considered to be the stumbling block for the approval of the law mainly due to issues related to exploitation of the rich Kirkuk oil fields .
Thus , such a comment from Ashti Hawrami the Kurdish natural resources minister does not indicate a change in their stance anytime soon .
In light of the unlikely passage of the key hydrocarbons law , the oil ministry started looking for ways to invite oil companies into Iraq without the passage of the law , under what is called “ technical ” oil contracts .
The first plan for awarding such two - year service contracts to western oil companies was undertaken in 2007 , with a goal of increasing the country ’s oil production by 500,00 barrels / day through signing five 100,000 barrels / day contracts .
However , by 2008 , no such contracts were signed , and the terms where changed to one - year .
But due to growing political opposition to such no - bid contracts , the whole plan was scrapped by the end of the year .
Yet the Iraq oil ministry led by Mr. Hussain al - Shahristani was determined to sign deals with foreign oil companies .
It went ahead and signed a gas deal in September 2008 with Shell Petroleum to exploit Iraqi gas , which is estimated to be burned at a rate of $ 7 billion per year for lack of gas processing facilities .
However the $ 4 billion deal has faced opposition almost from the start , and as of April 17th 2009 , Mr. Jabir Khalifa Jabir , secretary of the Iraqi parliament 's oil and gas committee announced the following :
" We are going to do everything we can to revoke this deal and to push Shell out , " Jabir told Reuters .
" Both these deals are illegal because they did n't go through parliament ” .
“ The companies and their lawyers knew the old Iraqi oil law very well , " he added , saying that any new deals Baghdad signs in bidding rounds under way with BP and others would also be subject to revocation . ”
More recently , Iraq announced the opening of the Nassiriyah oil field for bidding to foreign oil companies , in an effort to produce 100 k barrels / day .
A decision was supposed to be made by the end of April ; however , by April 23rd 2009 , the deadline was pushed back to the end of June :
Abdul Mahdy al - Ameedi , deputy director general at Iraq 's Petroleum Contracts and Licensing Directorate , said the ministry had asked the three companies to review their previously submitted technical and commercial offers according to " new requirements " made by the ministry .
I believe one must wonder if the “ new requirements ” made by the ministry has anything to do with the corruption index highlighted in the start of the article !
So what does Iraq have to show for its efforts in inviting in foreign oil companies ?
The sole signed and progressing contracts are with an unheard of British oil firm named Mesopotamia Petroleum Company , and a $ 3 billion contract with China 's CNPC , a contract that was initially signed in 1997 under the Saddam regime .
Like the Shell Petroleum deal , the Iraqi parliament considers this contract also illegal .
Thus as indicated from the above issues , Iraq is facing significant political problems in its efforts to invite oil companies .
The Kurds and the central government are locked in a war to control Kirkuk oil ; the Kurds are unlikely to allow the passage of the oil law unless they have more control on Kirkuk ; while the Iraqi government is unlikely to allow any Kurdish oil to be fully developed or exported unless the Kurds submit to its wishes .
Meanwhile , the oil ministry is in a constant struggle with the politically driven parliament , as all of its plans are systematically blocked for political reasons and on suspicion of corruption .
Political Instability
2008 was a year of relative calm in Iraq .
However , it seems that 2009 is turning to be a year of further instability .
To better understand the current instability , it is worth looking into why 2008 was relatively stable .
2008 witnessed a weakening of the insurgency , largely due to the successful American efforts of recruiting 90,000 ex-insurgents in what is called the Awakening Councils , which are nothing more then Sunni armed militia ’s funded by the US at a rate of $ 300 per member / per month .
The US introduced this program in an opportune moment as Al - Qaeda ’s bloody methods and thirst for control created a significant rift within the insurgency .
This rift within the insurgency and the financial and armed support for the councils created a relative level of stability in the former hot spots such as Anbar , parts of Baghdad and Diyala .
In addition to the above , the Iraqi government was profiting handsomely from the explosion of oil prices to above $ 100 a barrel for most of 2008 .
This windfall in wealth helped the government fund an overly large security force and the creation of a massive welfare state where close to 80 % of the population is dependent one way or another on the government for employment , housing or food .
As a matter of fact , the government got so wealthy that Mr. Nouri al Maliki was walking down Baghdad ’s streets in the summer of 2008 handing out dollars .
The situation is much changed in 2009 .
The US passed the control of the Awakening Councils to Baghdad , but the Iraqi government has refused to incorporate more then 20 % of the members of the councils into the police and army , and only a handful have been recruited to the official security forces to date .
Furthermore , recent reports indicate that the government is arresting members of the councils .
By March 28th we had the following news reports :
On March 28 , clashes erupted in Baghdad ’s Fadhil district after Iraqi troops arrested the leader of the local Awakening Council , Adil al Mashhadani , one of many former Sunni insurgents who had allied with American forces in the fight against al Qaeda - inspired Salafi militants in Iraq .
Mashhadani ’s men staged a two - day uprising , which was put down by Iraqis with considerable help from American troops fighting against their former allies .
A few days later on April 7th 2009 , there was a wave car bombs attributed to the councils ' growing distrust of the government :
Seven car bombs exploded across Baghdad yesterday in a surge of violence linked to growing dissatisfaction among the Sunni militias that helped turn the tide against al - Qaida and other insurgent groups
And as recently as April 24th , several bloody attacks of a sectarian nature took place on Shia pilgrims , with the most dangerous aimed at the holy Khadamiya Shrine in Baghdad killing 65 people , and bringing memories of the Golden Dome in Samarra attack in February 2006 , which lead to a massive escalation in inter-ethnic violence in 2006 and 2007 .
To compound the above problem , the Iraqi government is running out of money due to the collapse in both oil prices and oil production .
As a result , the country ’s budget was revised down three times -- down to $ 58 billion from $ 80 billion a few months earlier .
It is likely to be reduced again , as the current budget is based on $ 50 oil .
( Iraqi oil trades at a discount to WTI . )
This situation prompted Iraq to consider an IMF loan .
The collapse in Iraqi revenues has significant implications with respect to the security situation .
The most obvious impact is the freezing of security forces hiring , which was announced on March 20th 2009 .
This freeze directly affecting the hiring of the ex-insurgent Awaking Council members .
Furthermore , the lowered revenues are curtailing significantly much needed investment in crumbling civil infrastructure , social services and much - needed investments to boost oil services .
In the midst of the above challenges , the current US administration is marching ahead with its plans to withdraw from Iraq , a move that will likely create a vacuum that will further weaken the Iraqi government and may very well lead to a civil war between the rival factions .
There are many questions that remain unanswered in Iraq .
The fate of Kirkuk remains illusive .
The recent UN report on Kirkuk was received coldly in Iraq , and the Kurds consider their parliament as the only appropriate venue to solve the issue .
The Sunnis remain deeply distrustful of the Shia , and today the Sunnis have well trained and well organized militia to defend their interests , while the Shia remain divided between loyalty to Iran by some and loyalty to the country by others .
The above discussion offers only a glimpse of the political , physical and operational limitations on Iraq 's ability to produce any significant amount of oil in the next few years .
These issues are an indication that Iraq is likely going to experience a sharp decline in production ( or perhaps stagnation at best ) in its production levels over the foreseeable future .
The implications of this discussion are of great significance to investors in the oil industry , as Iraq is often looked at as one of the potential bright spots for increased oil production over the medium term .
It is even more important within the context of an expected oil supply shortage starting in 2013 , as often repeated by the IEA .
Hence , while it might be profitable to invest in oil over the next few years , it might be wise for the oil industry and oil investors to await more stability and clarity in Iraq before moving into that country .

AM - Friday , 27 March , 2009 08:00:00 Reporter : Hayden Cooper TONY EASTLEY :
The career of the Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon has taken a direct hit overnight from friendly fire .
In an embarrassing about - turn the Minister has admitted that when he was in Opposition he accepted two trips to China , paid for by his long time close friend , wealthy Chinese businesswoman Helen Liu .
Earlier he declared to Parliament that he'd only received minor gifts from his friend of more than 16 years .
Last night the Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull said Mr Fitzgibbon should be sacked .
That has n't happened but the Prime Minister did n't appear to fully endorse Mr Fitzgibbon in his position as Defence Minister when he spoke to reporters in Washington , and we 'll have more on that shortly .
The issue of the minister 's relationship with Miss Liu came to light after allegations emerged that Mr Fitzgibbon 's own department had spied on the minister .
From Canberra , Hayden Cooper reports .
HAYDEN COOPER : It 's a relationship that sparked the interest of staff at Defence headquarters .
But Joel Fitzgibbon has been resolute in defending his dealings with family friend and Chinese businesswoman Helen Liu .
JOEL FITZGIBBON : No -one has ever raised any concern with me about that relationship .
HAYDEN COOPER :
In yesterday 's quick - fire media doorstop the minister was questioned directly on what gifts he 'd received .
REPORTER : Have any of your trips to Beijing been paid by Miss Liu or any of her companies ?
JOEL FITZGIBBON : I 've said on a number of occasions I 've had a close personal relationship for the Lius and the family for some 16 years now , and over that period of time there has been an exchange of a number of small gifts for example , on birthdays etc .
No -one has ever raised concern ...
( Sound of reporter 's muffled question )
No , very small gifts .
HAYDEN COOPER : But last night , a statement from the Defence Minister revealed he had misspoken .
In 2002 and again in 2005 Mr Fitzgibbon went to China , paid for by Helen Liu .
Neither trip was declared to Parliament .
He was also given a suit , but says that was later returned .
The minister says his failure to disclose the two trips was a mistake for which he apologises .
MALCOLM TURNBULL : Mr Fitzgibbon is a stumbler and a bungler .
HAYDEN COOPER : The Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull wants much more than an apology .
MALCOLM TURNBULL : This has now become a question of leadership for Mr Rudd .
He has a Defence Minister that has stumbled and bungled through one embarrassing episode after another .
He 's failed to pay our SAS appropriately and has not been able to provide a satisfactory explanation for the pay bungle .
He has now clearly lost the confidence of his own department .
And now we see he 's failed to disclose very relevant gifts from a business associate in the public register .
The real question now is for Mr Rudd :
Is he going to take his responsibilities as Prime Minister seriously ?
Is he going to leave in place a Defence Minister that has lost the confidence of the defence forces , the Defence Department and the public ?
Mr Rudd must act .
He must remove Joel Fitzgibbon from this position and put somebody in his place who can command confidence from the defence forces , the department and the people of Australia .
HAYDEN COOPER : Should the minister provide more information about the purpose of these trips to China ?
MALCOLM TURNBULL :
The minister should make a full disclosure .
The only way to deal with concerns of this kind is complete accountability and transparency .
Now how can we have any confidence that we have a full disclosure from the minister when yesterday morning he said he'd made a full disclosure ; by the afternoon we discover there were a number of trips that had not been disclosed ?
Who 's to say there are n't more yet undisclosed ?
Joel Fitzgibbon has stumbled and bungled through one embarrassing episode after another .
It is time for the Prime Minister to lead , to take responsibility and ensure we have a Minister for Defence who has the confidence of the defence forces , the Defence Department and the people of Australia - and that is not Joel Fitzgibbon .
TONY EASTLEY : The Opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull ending Hayden Cooper 's report .
Canada stands by claims to Arctic region
STRATEGIC INTERESTS : A Kremlin paper said Russia would strengthen its border guard in the region and create a new military force to ‘ ensure military security ’
AP
Canada will not back down from its claims to a disputed Arctic region even after reports that Russia is planning a new military force to protect its interests in the area , Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon said on Friday .
Cannon said he would make Canada ’s position clear when he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov meet , possibly this week .
“ Sovereignty is uppermost for us , ” Cannon said after a speech on Canada ’s Arctic strategy to an international relations group .
“ We will not be swayed from that . ”
“ We want to be able to work on bilateral and multilateral forums on environment , economic development , governance structures ... but let ’s be perfectly clear here : Canada will not be bullied , ” Cannon said .
A Kremlin strategy paper signed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev last fall and publicized in the Russian media on Friday said the country is seeking to strengthen border guard forces in the Arctic region , while creating a new military force to “ ensure military security under various military - political circumstances . ”
The report said the Arctic , which is believed to contain as much as 25 percent of the world ’s undiscovered oil and gas , must become Russia ’s “ top strategic resource base ” by the year 2020 .
Canada , Russia , the US and the Nordic countries are also seeking to assert jurisdiction in the disputed territory .
The UN rejected Moscow ’s initial claim in 2001 because of a lack of evidence , but Russia is seeking to prove its continental shelf extends to an underwater mountain range that spans the polar region .
A shrinking polar ice cap that has opened new shipping lanes , as well as opportunities to gain access to once - hidden resources has helped intensify the dispute in recent months .
On Feb. 18 , the day before US President Barack Obama visited Canada , two Russian Tupolev 95 bombers were turned away from Alaska and the Yukon about 200 km from Canadian and US airspace .
Ottawa has committed to strengthening Canada ’s own military infrastructure , creating a military training center in the region and beefing up the capacity of Canada ’s Arctic Rangers .
Ottawa has also moved to increase the jurisdiction of Canadian environmental law over northern waters and made it mandatory for foreign ships to register with the Canadian Coast Guard .
In his speech on Friday , Cannon stressed the need for countries to work together and repeated calls to focus on the Arctic Council , the main international forum on Arctic issues .
He plans to discuss Arctic issues further when council members meet next month in Norway .
He also plans to address bilateral Arctic issues with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during a meeting on April 6 .
When an application grows organically it accrues features like a snowball rolling down a dirty hill .
With a little careful engineering , this works great ( since the snowball is actually quite willing to be guided ) but sometimes you need to stop and rethink things , do a little refactoring .
We ’ve done this ( many times ) with all of our products .
Most recently , I ’ve been working on some cleanups and optimizations to the person avatar and company logo code in Basecamp .
The evolutionary snowball ( for the avatar feature , at least ) progressed something like this :
This brings us to today .
The code remains really clean , overall , because we ’ve continued to follow the pattern of moving related methods into modules , and just including those modules in the base model .
However , there are two issues with this approach .
First , when a class includes lots of modules ( as some of ours do ) , it becomes hard to keep track of where different methods are defined , and even which methods are defined .
This can lead to confusion when trying to find the definition of a method , and ( worst case ) can allow two or more methods with the same name , which is bad .
There is no warning if you have methods with the same name in multiple modules , so it is n’t hard to wind up with bugs where you ’ve clobbered a method with another .
You wind up double - namespacing your methods ( e.g. , method names in the Avatar module being prefixed with avatar_ ) , to avoid collisions .
( Do n’t misunderstand me , though .
Modules are awesome .
We use them a bunch , and love them .
It just helps to be aware of their weaknesses , too . )
There are more issues with the module approach .
What if you have different kinds of avatars ( e.g. , person versus group , or company ) ?
You ca n’t subclass modules in Ruby , so you wind up finding other ways to solve it ( like including modules in modules , etc. ) .
Also , you ca n’t reference the avatar as a separate entity ; instead , controllers that deal with avatars need to deal with the entity to which the avatar is attached .
Can anything be done about these issues ?
The avatar is a part of the Person model itself , after all , with attributes in the people table that define it .
Can the avatar code be split out further , somehow ?
Yes , it can .
We ’ll do this by making avatars a model of their own and using aggregation ( rather than module inclusion , or inheritance ) to pull it into Person .
For example :
class Avatar attr_reader : master def initialize ( master ) @master = master end def exists ?
master.has_avatar ? end def create ( file ) master.update_attribute : has_avatar , true # thumbnail and install the given avatar end def destroy master .
update_attribute : has_avatar , false # delete avatar file end # etc. end class Person < ActiveRecord :: Base # ... def avatar @avatar ||= Avatar.new ( self ) end end
What are the benefits of this ?
Here are a few that occur to me :
We can say things like “ person.avatar.exists ? ” and “ person.avatar.create ( io ) ” .
The Avatar class can be subclassed and extended , to support different avatar types .
The Avatar class can be tested independently of Person .
We do n’t need to worry about methods on the Avatar model shadowing methods on the Person model .
It ’s much more obvious where to look for the definition of “ destroy ” in “ person.avatar.destroy ” .
Also , we can now pass the avatar itself around , separate from the person :
class AvatarsController < ApplicationController before_filter : find_avatar def create @avatar.create( params [ : avatar ] ) end def destroy @avatar .
destroy end protected def find_avatar person = Person.find ( params [ : id ] ) @avatar = person.avatar end end
I definitely am not suggesting that this pattern replace the use of modules .
Modules are very handy , and as I said before , we still use them extensively .
But if you find yourself bumping into some of the limitations of modules in a specific instance , extracting the module in question into a model can provide some really nice benefits .
TOKYO , March 5 ( UPI ) -- Students at a Tokyo primary school will soon be learning from the first robot teacher , a Japanese science professor says .
University of Tokyo Professor Hiroshi Kobayashi has created a robot capable of teaching human students while also expressing a limited range of emotions , including anger in case of unruly children , The Daily Telegraph said Thursday .

The robot is named Saya and has been under development for 15 years leading up to the scheduled school trial .
The robot's 18 facial motors are what give it the ability to mimic certain human emotions while the humanoid 's other inner workings allow it to speak multiple languages and set tasks , the newspaper said .
Saya 's planned appearance at the primary school will mark the most recent attempt by Japan to integrate robotics into everyday life .
The Telegraph said the Japanese government is hopeful that by 2015 , each home in Japan will be equipped with a robot .
To meet this end , the government has invested $ 35 million in the technological field .
How to covertly train paramilitaries , censor the press , ban unions , employ terrorists , conduct warrantless searches , suspend habeas corpus , conceal breaches of the Geneva Convention and make the population love it
JULIAN ASSANGE / Wikileaks.org | June 23 , 2008
Wikileaks has released a sensitive 219 page US military counterinsurgency manual .
The manual , Foreign Internal Defense Tactics Techniques and Procedures for Special Forces ( 1994 , 2004 ) , may be critically described as " what we learned about running death squads and propping up corrupt government in Latin America and how to apply it to other places " .
Its contents are both history defining for Latin America and , given the continued role of US Special Forces in the suppression of insurgencies , including in Iraq and Afghanistan , history making .
The leaked manual , which has been verified with military sources , is the official US Special Forces doctrine for Foreign Internal Defense or FID .
FID operations are designed to prop up " friendly " governments facing popular revolution or guerilla insurgency .
FID interventions are often covert or quasi - covert due to the unpopular nature of the governments being supported ( " In formulating a realistic policy for the use of advisors , the commander must carefully gauge the psychological climate of the HN [ Host Nation ] and the United States . " )
The manual directly advocates training paramilitaries , pervasive surveillance , censorship , press control and restrictions on labor unions & political parties .
It directly advocates warrantless searches , detainment without charge and ( under varying circumstances ) the suspension of habeas corpus .
It directly advocates employing terrorists or prosecuting individuals for terrorism who are not terrorists , running false flag operations and concealing human rights abuses from journalists .
And it repeatedly advocates the use of subterfuge and " psychological operations " ( propaganda ) to make these and other " population & resource control " measures more palatable .
The content has been particularly informed by the long United States involvement in El Salvador .
In 2005 a number of credible media reports suggested the Pentagon was intensely debating " the Salvador option " for Iraq . [ 1 ] .
According to the New York Times Magazine :
The template for Iraq today is not Vietnam , with which it has often been compared , but El Salvador , where a right - wing government backed by the United States fought a leftist insurgency in a 12 - year war beginning in 1980 .
The cost was high — more than 70,000 people were killed , most of them civilians , in a country with a population of just six million .
Most of the killing and torturing was done by the army and the right - wing death squads affiliated with it .
According to an Amnesty International report in 2001 , violations committed by the army and associated groups included ‘‘ extrajudicial executions , other unlawful killings , ‘ disappearances ’ and torture .
. . .
Whole villages were targeted by the armed forces and their inhabitants massacred . ’’
As part of President Reagan ’s policy of supporting anti-Communist forces , hundreds of millions of dollars in United States aid was funneled to the Salvadoran Army , and a team of 55 Special Forces advisers , led for several years by Jim Steele , trained front - line battalions that were accused of significant human rights abuses .
The same article states James Steele and many other former Central American Special Forces " military advisors " have now been appointed at a high level to Iraq .
In 1993 a United Nations truth commission on El Salvador , which examined 22,000 atrocities that occurred during the twelve - year civil war , attributed 85 percent of the abuses to the US - backed El Salvador military and its paramilitary death squads .
It is worth noting what the US Ambassador to El Salvador , Robert E. White ( now the president for the Center for International Policy ) had to say as early as 1980 , in State Department documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act :
The major , immediate threat to the existence of this government is the right - wing violence .
In the city of San Salvador , the hired thugs of the extreme right , some of them well - trained Cuban and Nicaraguan terrorists , kill moderate left leaders and blow up government buildings .
In the countryside , elements of the security forces torture and kill the campesinos , shoot up their houses and burn their crops .
At least two hundred refugees from the countryside arrive daily in the capital city .
This campaign of terror is radicalizing the rural areas just as surely as Somoza ’s National Guard did in Nicaragua .
Unfortunately , the command structure of the army and the security forces either tolerates or encourages this activity .
These senior officers believe or pretend to believe that they are eliminating the guerillas . [ 2 ]

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico is canceling classes for millions of children in the heart of the country on Friday after influenza killed around 20 people in recent weeks .
Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordoba said schools and universities in Mexico City and the surrounding area would be temporarily closed and advised people with flu symptoms to stay home from work .
“ We ’re dealing with a new flu virus that constitutes a respiratory epidemic that so far is controllable , ” Cordoba said on Thursday .
Canada ’s government advised doctors to be on the alert for reports of illness from people who recently traveled to Mexico , although it did not advise against visiting the popular beach vacation destination .
Mexico ’s flu season normally ends in February or March , but it has extended longer this year , the government said .
“ We recommend avoiding places or events with a lot of people unless strictly necessary , ” Cordoba said in an unusual late - night live statement to media .
About 79 people , possibly ill with the flu , are being treated in Mexico and that number has not increased in recent days , the Health Ministry said .
Worldwide , seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people in an average year .
In the United States , seven people have been diagnosed with a new kind of swine flu in California and Texas , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported .
All seven people there have recovered but the virus itself is a never - before - seen mixture of viruses typical among pigs , birds and humans , the CDC said .
Canadian officials have been particularly sensitive to the international spread of respiratory illnesses since Toronto was hit by the SARS epidemic in 2003 , which was blamed partly on a slow response to early disease reports .

Why did the sea turtle cross the Florida Keys ?
To go to the doctor .
A loggerhead sea turtle nearly swam to the door step of the Florida Keys Turtle Hospital , the only licensed veterinary facility in the world that solely treats sea turtles .
The 73 - pound reptile was suffering from a bacterial infection and somehow knew exactly where to go for help -- no Yellow Pages needed .
Staff members at the hospital actually waited several hours before treating the turtle because they thought it may have just been lost when it showed up at the dock of the treatment center .
But the turtle stuck around , probably unaware of the Turtle Hospital 's " no walk - ins " policy .
Eventually , he was treated with meds and now has a new home in a blue tank until he 's all better .
No doubt , the hospital will get plenty of referrals from their new patient when he is back with his friends -- Michelangelo , Leonardo , Donatello and Raphael .

From today 's Washington Post : Palin Billed State for Nights Spent at Home ; Taxpayers Also Funded Family 's Travel , by James V. Grimaldi & Karl Vick :
Jack Bogdanski ( Lewis & Clark ) outlines the tax problems Governor Palin faces as a result of these per diem payments in Governor Palin , Your Tax Return , Please :
" Per diem " allowances received by an employee can legally be omitted from her gross income if they constitute reimbursements for amounts that the employee could have deducted as business expenses had the employee paid for them out - of - pocket and not been reimbursed .
Thus , for Palin , the tax question would appear to boil down to whether , had she not been reimbursed for the $ 60,441 of travel , meals , and lodging expenses , she could have legitimately taken business deductions for them .
It does not appear that such deductions would have been allowable for any amounts attributable to travel by her husband and children .
Section 274 ( m ) ( 3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code strictly forbids deductions for bringing spouses and dependents along on business travel unless the spouses and dependents ( a ) are employees of the taxpayer ( here , the taxpayer is the governor ) , ( b ) are travelling for a bona fide business purpose , and ( c ) would otherwise be entitled to deduct the travel on their own tax returns .
Unless Palin 's spouse and kids are also her employees and she can show that they were away on their own businesses , their expenses would not be deductible by the governor .
And therefore she cannot exclude from income any per diems attributable to any of them .
( By the way , since she 's the employee , the income would be required to be reported on her own return , not her kids ' . )
As for her own travel , Palin could also run into tax problems .
Only travel " away from home " qualifies for tax exclusion ( or deduction ) , and for this purpose , one 's " home " is generally the principal place of one 's business .
In this case , the governor reportedly works out of offices in both Anchorage and Juneau , but since she has only one state job , she can declare only one of those as her tax " home . "
If Juneau is her tax " home " ( which would seem to be the case , since that 's the capital ) , she cannot exclude or deduct meals and lodging expenses incurred in Juneau , and if Anchorage is her tax " home , " she cannot exclude or deduct such expenses incurred in Anchorage or Wasilla .
If she got per diem reimbursements for stays in both places , stays in only one place would appear to be excludible or deductible .
And perhaps more importantly , the cost of regular commuting between one 's residence and one 's tax " home " is not deductible at all , no matter how long the distance between them ; it is certainly possible that Palin 's treks between the two locales are simply long - distance commuting for tax purposes .

BBelievers Another week another big BBeliever story .
This time it was about patients dying at a hospital because they shut off power for Earth Hour .
Most of the BBelievers appeared on Fark or in the comments on BBspot itself .
I 'll highlight some of the better ones ....
* How insensitive can this hospital be ?
You got to be freaking kidding me .
I hope that they get their butts sued off .
*" The dead patients will no longer use any energy , and actually will be turned into energy in our patient incinerator " .
WTF ?
Why are these hospital administrators not in jail for this ?
* Earth Hour ?
Please , this is feel - good public relations garbage .
Leave it to San Fransisco to employ a hospital director who's " pleased " fifteen people died because the power was cut for what amounts to zero impact upon the ecological situations plaguing the planet .
What a travesty , and waste of human life .
*
This is a hoax article .
It 's entirely not true and the author would be smart to remove it or face legal trouble .
Google the article title .
There are NO other sources for this .
* According to UCSF 's employees list ( SF General is a teaching hospital run by the University of California , San Francisco ) at http://directory.ucsf.edu/ neither " Heart surgeon Dr. Gregory Morris " or " hospital administrator Lawrence Cho " exist .
Also , none of the San Francisco media is reporting anything of the sort .
I call utter bullshit .

To those posting comments of shock ...
THIS NEVER HAPPENED .
The part of you that thought , this can't be ... was correct .
Is it gullibility or a desire for worst case scenarios ?
Why the writer chose to author such a preposterous work of fiction is beyond comprehension .
One can only assume he still has issues stemming from school days .
Jealous of the cool kids , perhaps .
Why does right - wing humor always involve death and suffering ?
Because the stupid have trouble with empathy I do hope the writer remembers this article when he is in his last moments , relying on the very people he mocks and insults in this badly written mock news story .
Perhaps they will remember it too , and decide to have a very localized Earth Hour - limited to only the writers room ...
Right - wing humor ?
WTF ?
First of all , that 's an oxymoron .
Second , I 'm about as far from the right - wing as is possible .
The article was crafted to snag right - wing BBelievers and make them look stupid .
San Francisco ?
Earth Hour ?
Look there 's one right here ...
* YOU'VE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME ?????????
WELL JUST WANT OBAMA WANTED !!
WHAT'S NEXT ?????
ALL THE NEWBORNS ????????
THIS COUNTRY IS GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL FASTER THAN IT EVER HAS BEFORE , AND YOU'VE GOT OBAMA TO THANK FOR IT .
* every important equipment in hospitals have backup power , how can that happen ?
The article explicitly states they were disabled .
* This is the worst story ever reported .
I 'm smelling a lawsuit soon .
What heartless people would turn off power for an hour to conserve our energy , while patients are trusting them for help , yet their killed .
It sounds so ironic .
There are a few more in the comments if you want to check them out yourself .
And now from the Fark comments ...
Libruls wo n't be happy until everyone is dead for their stupid planet .
And now for some other message boards ...
* Wow .
That is just horrible .
* So we did nothing to preserve the Earth and 15 people died .
Why do people do this again ?
Not a BBeliever , but some coverage of the Twitter Premium story in the New York Times ...
Earlier this month , the tech humor site BBspot published an article announcing premium Twitter accounts for businesses .
DETROIT --
The Detroit Red Wings signed Henrik Zetterberg to the longest contract in team history , a 12 - year deal that will keep the star forward in Hockeytown until 2021 .
Financial terms were not disclosed , but ESPN.com 's Pierre LeBrun reported the deal was worth $ 73 million .
" Henrik is one of the world 's premier players at both ends of the ice , " general manager Ken Holland said Wednesday .
" This is a tremendous commitment on the part of the organization as well as by Henrik . "
" We are thrilled that a player we drafted and developed will play out his career in Detroit with this lifetime contract , " he said .
Zetterberg , a 28 - year - old native of Sweden , is in his sixth NHL season , all with Detroit .
He has 43 points in 45 games this season .
Zetterberg , a seventh - round selection in the 1999 draft , won a gold medal at the 2006 Olympics playing for the Swedish national team and scored the clinching goal in Game 6 of last year 's Stanley Cup finals , leading the Red Wings over the Pittsburgh Penguins .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
A gene that is arguably the most studied " schizophrenia gene " plays an unanticipated role in the brain :
It controls the birth of new neurons in addition to their integration into existing brain circuitry , according to a report in the March 20th issue of the journal Cell , a Cell Press publication .
The finding suggests that loss of the gene , as occurs in some cases of schizophrenia as well as bipolar disorder and major depression , may " tip the balance " in the brain , leading to an increased risk of compromised cognition and behavioral abnormalities , the researchers said .
What 's more , the protein encoded by the gene aptly known as Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 ( DISC1 ) exerts its influence through a well - studied molecular pathway .
Specifically , it interacts directly with and blocks the activity of GSK3b , a protein that is the target of the lithium treatments that doctors have used for decades in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
" Lithium is still the most reliable [ medication ] for bipolar disorder , " said Li-Huei Tsai of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
" This shows that DISC1 is almost like an endogenous lithium . "
The findings are part of a larger picture of the genetic and developmental causes of psychiatric disorders that has recently begun to emerge and may point the way to new approaches for therapeutic intervention , Tsai said .
Although people diagnosed with schizophrenia are typically resistant to treatment with lithium , she added , their observations should encourage scientists to " think creatively " about new and more powerful strategies for targeting GSK3b .
Schizophrenia is a severe brain illness that affects 0.5 % of the world population , the researchers said .
While its causes are poorly understood , accumulating evidence suggests that neurodevelopmental defects are involved and recent studies have identified many risk genes associated with schizophrenia , DISC1 among them .
Studies of a very large Scottish family with a high incidence of schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and major depression over several generations also found that those family members who develop psychiatric disorders carry a mutation in DISC1 .
Biochemical evidence later showed that DISC1 interacts with a growing number of binding partners , Tsai said , and functional studies have revealed a role for the gene in the growth and migration of neurons and in the integration of neurons into the brain .
Mice with the abnormal version of the gene also develop behaviors that are reminiscent of human psychiatric disorders , including schizophrenia and depression .
Now , Tsai 's team has begun to connect the genetic and biochemical evidence with the behavior in studies of mice .
In addition to the known role of DISC1 in the function of existing neurons , the gene is also highly expressed in neural progenitor cells and is required for their proliferation , they report .
This function of DISC1 involves regulation of the so - called b-catenin / GSK3b pathway .
In the adult mouse brain , loss of DISC1 function in the dentate gyrus , a portion of the brain that is important to the formation of new memories , led to reduced neural progenitor proliferation and elicited hyperactive and depressive behaviors in mice .
Importantly , they found , those behavioral abnormalities were reversed when the DISC1 - deficient animals were treated with a chemical that blocked GSK3b .
" These findings provide compelling evidence that DISC1 is a central player in the GSK3b / b- catenin signaling pathway that impinges on neural progenitor proliferation , " the researchers concluded .
Together with earlier findings , the new results suggest that behavioral abnormalities resulting from DISC1 loss of function in the dentate gyrus likely involve a combination of reduced numbers of newly born neurons and their aberrant integration into the existing circuitry , as well as effects on mature neurons .
" In the end , the human lesions may result in subtle functional changes that have an effect on the eventual size of the brain and the progenitor pool , " Tsai said .
While those changes might not be sufficient to cause psychiatric disorders on their own , she added , they may leave individuals more vulnerable to getting " pushed over the edge . "

In the distant future , most our problems will be solved - except racism .
Science fiction is full of crazy bigots , who hate aliens , robots and mutants .
We list SF 's most monstrous racism allegories , below .
Advertisement
Star
Trek rules the world of racial allegories with an iron tricorder .
There 's the amazing " Let This Be Your Last Battlefield , " as pictured above - the Cherons are half black , half white , but they discriminate based on which half is which .
They 're such awful bigots , flames appear in front of their faces whenever they start running .
It must make running a marathon kind of a challenge :
Advertisement
Also , in the book New Boundaries In Political Science Fiction , Wanda Raiford makes a strong argument that when Data is put on trial in the episode " Measure Of A Man , " it 's presented as a version of the Supreme Court 's famous Dred Scott case , only this time the court rejects slavery .
Also , Spock 's " half - breed interference " is frequently brought up , holograms like Voyager 's Doctor are discriminated against based on their photons , and alien prejudice is rife .
As Tom Lehrer would say , " the Romulans hate the Vulcans , the Bajorans hate the Cardassians , and everyone hates the Ferengi . "
Battlestar Galactica - the new version - also gets into racism with the use of the epithet " toaster " for the Cylons .
As New Boundaries notes , Baltar 's " Head Six " actually refers to " toaster " as a " racial epithet " and pleads with Baltar to stop Cally from saying it in one scene .
Baltar ignores her .

Doctor Who 's Daleks are basically space Nazis , as writer Terry Nation made clear on a number of occasions .
In their origin story , " Genesis Of The Daleks , " we see how the dark - haired Kaleds despise the blond - haired ( or wigged )
Thals , as their genetic inferiors .
It 's a " dislike for the unlike , " as Ian puts it in the first Dalek story .
So of course , the sneaky Russell T. Davies finds several ways to make the Daleks into genetic hybrids with other species , mostly humans , in the new series .
Plus there are the Silurians , who refer to the humans as apes or ape - descended primitives .
The X - Men used to be an allegory about racism and the " other " in our midst , but these days it 's more likely to be about homophobia .
Advertisement
The Chrysalids by John Wyndham also has a strong eugenics theme - the survivors of some kind of holocaust are living in Labrador , and they 're fanatically obsessed with purging all genetic abnormalities out of the human race .
Like a girl with six toes , or the cool telepathic kids .
Advertisement
Blade Runner 's Replicants are created for slavery on the outer worlds , and then hunted down and slaughtered by Deckard and his ilk .
Like the Cylons , the Replicants are referred to as " skin- jobs , " which Deckard says is a racial epithet .
Since the Replicants can pass as human and anyone could be a Replicant , it becomes another fear of the " other among us , " like Battlestar .

Top Ten by Alan Moore , Zander Cannon , Gene Ha et al .
This classic comics series uses human - robot relations as a clear parallel for those between white and black people , complete with terms like " clicker , " " spambo " ( instead of " oreo " ) , and " wetware " ( instead of " cracker " ) .
Also , the Godzilla - esque monster characters have aspersions cast on their intelligence on a regular basis .
The series is mostly presented from the perspective of non-robots and non-monsters , and we do n't really get to know any robots beyond the stereotypes until we meet Ferro - American cop Joe Pi .
Advertisement
Legion of Superheroes .
Over the past decade , this comic set in the thirtieth century has dealt a lot with anti-alien sentiment , which has posed a challenge for the mostly alien kids sworn to defend Earth .
In the recent Action Comics storyline , the imaginatively named human supremacist Earth Man took charge of the Legion and banished all aliens off the planet , going so far as to suggest Superman was really always from Earth .
This remains an ongoing concern in the Legion of Three Worlds .
Titan AE .
After the world blows up , aliens have nothing but disgust for the homeless , destitute survivors of humanity .

Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles .
As commenter DocWha points out , this show has been pushing the idea of " metal " as a slur against the machines pretty hard lately , including the variant " metal - lover . "
The Time Machine .
As commenter alphanumeric1971 points out , the whole Morlocks / Eloi thing gets pretty metaphorically charged .
Mostly because those Morlocks are always playing their music and stuff .
Advertisement
Babylon 5 Similar to some other shows , B5 showed a lot of racial animosity going on between different species , although the series also deconstructed this whole notion in " The Geometry of Shadows " , where the ethnic battle lines are totally arbitrary and change every five years .
Advertisement
Smallville : Kara Zor -El used the apparent racial slur " Red eye " to refer to Martian Manhunter in the seventh season episode " The Cure . "
Supergirl , how could you ?
Heroes this season has pushed the " persecuted mutants " theme pretty hard , and Danko ( aka " The Hunter " ) is a mouthpiece for all sorts of anti-mutant mutterings .
They 're taking our jobs !
Advertisement
The Teen Titans addresses anti-Tamaranian bias in the episode " Troq , " all about the prejudice which Starfire faces .
" Do you know what it feels like to be judged simply because of how you look ? "
Starfire asks , in one of the episode 's more sledge - hammery speeches .
Luckily , Cyborg does understand ... because he 's part robot .
Advertisement
Futurama .
Everyone has his / her little prejudices - Bender dreams about killing all the humans , for example - but the only group that really faces institutional racism is the mutant population , which is n't allowed to go on the surface unless with special passes ( which even then are n't always honored ) .
Although they themselves hate in turn the sub-mutants who live in the sub -sewers .
Oh , and Zapp Brannigan really hates the neutral people ( but then … what does it take to make a man turn neutral ? ) .
Oh , and the Native Martians are a clear allegory for Native Americans , complete with being tricked into giving up their entire planet for just a bead ( which turns out to be the biggest diamond in the universe , making it not such a bad deal after all ) .
The Animatrix – The whole Matrix origin story " The Second Renaissance " uses a lot of really obvious racism parallels to explain how humans and AI came to hate each other .
Planet Of The Apes .
I can't believe we left out the 1970s ' greatest racism analogy , until commenter UshaBibaculus pointed it out .
Damn it all to hell !
Advertisement
Isaac Asimov .
Some of his stuff about robots takes on racism overtones , but the condescension of space - going humans towards those still on Earth is way more blatant .
Pebble in the Sky has some of the most blatant anti-Earth sentiment , as even the hero , archaeologist Bel Arvadan , considers himself quite progressive and would allow an Earthling to join one of his digs – as long as nobody else objected too strongly .
Asimov 's short story " The Martian Way " also shows how Earth sentiment against the colonists on Mars forces them to find fuel around the rings of Saturn .
Considering the Earth politician who whips up public outcry against the colonists is actually called Hilder , I think it 's fairly clear this goes beyond simple dislike .
Meanwhile , in the real world , Asimov deleted aliens from his Foundation books entirely because he did n't want to deal with his editor John Campbell 's belief that humans would always be superior to aliens , which grew out of his belief in Anglo - Saxon superiority .
Advertisement
Alien Nation .
After a bunch of aliens come to live among us in this TV series , they experience prejudice and mistreatment at the hands of the anti-alien Purists .
The humans try to kill all of the Binnaums , the rare third gender which the aliens need to mate .
Even the most sympathetic human character , Matt , turns out to have anti-alien biases .

The Green - Sky Trilogy by Zilpha Keatley Snyder .
These books spend a lot of time delving into the mutual distrust and antipathy between the " fair - skinned , treedwelling Kindar and the darker - skinned , underground race of Erdlings " who live on the eponymous Green - Sky planet .
Wild Cards , created by George R.R. Martin –
In a world where aliens test out bioweapons on humanity , creating fully superpowered " Aces " and horribly mutated " Jokers " , both groups face bigotry at the hands of humans - although the Jokers generally have a much harder time of it , being horribly mutated and all .

Darkover by Marion Zimmer Bradley .
In this series of books about humans colonizing the world Cottman IV after their ship crashes , the native trailmen and catmen face a lot of nasty prejudice from the humans .
Someone Like Me by Tom Holt .
This book explores a post - apocalyptic world where the remnants of humanity spend all their time fighting evil , mindless monsters .
The only problem with that is that these monsters are n't evil or mindless at all , but in fact just as intelligent and human ( with all the attendant strengths and flaws ) as the humans , which the human protagonist discovers at the end of the book .

Humans assume their alien opponents are mindless cannibals and hate them accordingly .
Then the author explores the alien society , and the truth becomes far more complicated .

South Korea expressed disappointment and regret over the launch
North Korea failed in its attempt to get a satellite into space after a rocket launch early on Sunday , US and South Korean officials say .
Two stages of the rocket and its payload landed in the Pacific Ocean , a US military statement said .
Hours earlier North Korea claimed the satellite had successfully been put into orbit and was transmitting data .
The US , EU , Japan and South Korea condemned the launch , thought to be a cover for a long - range missile test .
US President Barack Obama urged Pyongyang to " refrain from further provocative actions " .
" North Korea broke the rules once more by testing a rocket that could be used for a long - range missile , " Mr Obama told a crowd in the Czech capital , Prague .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" This provocation underscores the need for action - not just this afternoon at the UN Security Council , but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons . "
Later a joint US - EU statement urged Pyongyang to abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and " policy of threats aimed at its neighbours " .
The launch " harms peace and stability in northeast Asia " , the statement added .
The Security Council approved a Japanese request for the emergency session .
Washington , Tokyo and Seoul regard the launch as a clear violation of Security Council resolution 1718 adopted in October 2006 , which bans North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile activity .
However , both China and Russia have urged restraint in the international response .
' No threat to US '
In a statement on its website , the US Northern Command said North Korea launched a three - stage Taepodong - 2 missile at 0230 GMT .
" Stage one of the missile fell into the Sea of Japan / East Sea .
The remaining stages along with the payload itself landed in the Pacific Ocean .
" No object entered orbit and no debris fell on Japan . "
US military authorities " assessed the space launch vehicle as not a threat to North America or Hawaii and took no action in response to this launch " , the statement added .
Earlier , state media in North Korea said that the " Kwangmyongsong - 2 " satellite had been placed in orbit .
The satellite was transmitting data and the " Song of General Kim Il - sung " and " Song of General Kim Jong - il " - references to the late founder of North Korea and his son , the current leader - the report said .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says a failure would seriously detract from North Korea 's ability to exploit the propaganda value of the launch , although it may never admit it to its own people .
In a previous satellite launch attempt in 1998 , North Korea said it was sending up a device that would orbit the world transmitting revolutionary melodies .
It claimed this was also successful but the launch is believed to have been a failure as no trace of the satellite was ever found .
Testing technology ?
North Korea gave prior warning of the launch and repeatedly said it was using it as part of the peaceful pursuit of a space programme , as is its right under international law .
But Pyongyang 's neighbours and the US are concerned about the potential military use of the launch vehicle .
They believe the real aim of the launch was to test long - range missile technology , specifically the Taepodong - 2 .
They believe it could put parts of the US within the communist nation 's military reach .
North Korea first tested a Taepodong - 2 in July 2006 .
It failed less than a minute after lift - off .
Three months later , Pyongyang carried out a nuclear test .
International talks involving the US , South Korea , Japan , Russia and China on an aid - for - nuclear disarmament deal are currently stalled .

The European duo who created Skype and sold it to eBay for billions may have another trick up their sleeve : buying it back .
Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis , the founders of Skype , have approached several private equity firms and are pooling their own substantial resources to make a bid for the Internet calling service , say several people with knowledge of their plans .
The two men sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $ 2.6 billion , and later received bonus payouts that increased the final price to $ 3.1 billion .
Since then , Mr. Zennstrom , a native of Sweden , and Mr. Friis , of Denmark , have created the venture capital firm Atomico and backed the online video service Joost , both based in London .
Skype has more than 405 million registered users , up from 53 million when eBay bought it , and the service had $ 145 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Calls are free between Skype users , and rates are a few pennies a minute for international calls to non-Skype users ; the low cost has helped the company gain 8 percent of the world ’s international calling minutes , according to TeleGeography , a market research firm .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is increasingly concerned about a populist backlash against banks and Wall Street , worried that anger at financial institutions could also end up being directed at Congress and the White House and could complicate President Obama ’s agenda .
The administration ’s sharp rebuke of the American International Group on Sunday for handing out $ 165 million in executive bonuses  Lawrence H. Summers , director of the president ’s National Economic Council , described it as “ outrageous ” on “ This Week ” on ABC  marks the latest effort by the White House to distance itself from abuses that could feed potentially disruptive public anger .
“ We ’ve got enormous problems that need to be addressed , ” David Axelrod , Mr. Obama ’s senior adviser , said in an interview .
“ And it ’s hard to address because there ’s a lot of anger about the irresponsibility that led us to this point . ”
“ This has been welling up for a long time , ” he said .
Mr. Obama ’s aides said any surge of such a sentiment could complicate efforts to win Congressional approval for the additional bailout packages that Mr. Obama has signaled will be necessary to stabilize the banking system .
India ’s special envoy on Climate Change has demanded that developed nations invest more in renewable energy projects and do more to reduce their carbon emissions .
[ social_buttons ]
The Indian government wants the developed nations to ‘ re - double ’ their efforts on funding clean energy projects and not let the current economic crisis be a roadblock in those efforts .
The envoy also reiterated that his government was not yet in a position to pledge to any mandatory emission reduction goals .
He reminded the developed nation of the ‘ historical responsibility ’ to bring down their carbon emission levels .
Continuing with his hawkish tone , the envoy added that the developed countries should carry on with their effort to reduce carbon emissions but should not expect the same from developing countries .
He said that any efforts to pressurize developing countries to sign up for mandatory emission cuts under the next climate treaty could jeopardize any international treaty .
It is highly unfortunate to see India ’s envoy use such hawkish tone to address such sensitive issue .
The Indian government wants the developed nations to act while it wants no share of the ‘ common but differential ’ responsibility of reducing carbon emissions .
It would be unfair and unjust to ask developed nations to invest more in clean energy projects without developing nations doing their bit since they ( developed nations ) have invested more than $ 200 billion in green energy projects in order to stimulate their recession - hit economies .
Many of them are plagued by billions of dollars of budget deficits , in order to invest more they would have to increase taxes on their companies and citizens .
But how governments of the developed nations would convince their citizens to pay up more taxes to start new clean energy projects even when the developing nations , which have almost similar emission levels , are taking no such measures .
And while the developed countries have numerous schemes to promote the use of renewable energy the developing nations have nothing to match it .
Developed nations provide millions of dollars to homeowners in the form of solar and wind subsidies , many of them practice feed - in tariff systems – making generation of energy through renewable resources profitable for citizens and almost every week a new solar or wind energy deal is signed up to create a renewable energy plant bigger than the previous one .
For almost a decade the United States , the largest GHG emitter at that time , refused to be a party to the Kyoto Protocol saying that it must include the developing nations .
Now the world leaders are busy negotiating a new international climate treaty but the same issue still remains ; so one has to ask the question , have we made any progress ?
Sadly the answer seems to be a defiant No .
The new climate treaty should include both developed and developing nations otherwise it would be inherently ineffective .
The developed nations should agree to stricter emission reduction goals while the developing nations should be required to achieve slightly weaker goals .
The negotiators should look at the success of the Montreal Protocol – arguably the most effective international climate treaty .

Cute as Hell is a new social network for pet owners that just launched in beta .
It 's created by Erick Laubach , who also has a travel social network called Driftr under his belt .
Pet - related social networks are n't exactly scarce , but Cute as Hell is interesting because it takes several tried and true viral concepts and integrates them into the network .
It can probably best be described as a cross between Cute Overload , Hot or Not ( for pets ) and MySpace .
Two features that make this so are the so called cuteness rating and the Thunderdome .
The former lets visitors rate pets by their cuteness , while the latter is a tournament where pets can compete for the title of the cutest pet .
The advantage of this approach is the fact that the site can be fun even if you 're not part of the social network ; you can merely browse it for cute animals .
Considering the popularity of sites like Cute Overload , it might bring in a significant number of visitors .
It also engages users to participate in the site more , instead of just maintaining their pet 's profile and adding friends .
Other features currently available are social shopping ( users can rate and review products ) , comments and photos ; videos , Facebook and iPhone app , as well as questions and answers are coming soon .

Jupiter now has only four large moons , but in the early days of the solar system it may have had 20 or more ( Image : JPL / NASA )
THE four giant “ Galilean ” moons orbiting Jupiter are the last survivors of at least five generations of moons that once circled the gas giant .
“ All the other moons – and there could have been 20 or more – were devoured by the planet in the early days of the solar system , ” says Robin Canup of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado .
The four Galilean moons have played a key role in the history of …

Night of 2009.03.21
I dreamed I was walking down railroad tracks .
After some time I started to fear that I would n't make it home before sunset .
I went into a school .
It seemed that I needed to pass through it in order to get home .
One of the kids shouted " lets get him ! " .
Another kid jumped on my back and wrapped his arms around my neck .
I threw him off and his teacher scolded him .
I looked through a glass window a moment later and she was beating him with a belt .
His teacher was very pretty , and had a young face .
I left the school .
I was no longer on a railroad , but on a dirt path instead .
I came to some kind of giant stone arch that went over the path .
It seemed ancient .
Next I came to a very old plantation home .
It was dark and rotten .
I went inside .
The house was full of shelves of books and old documents .
I wondered if anyone knew about them .
I wanted to look for something interesting but I knew I did n't have time .
I grabbed a book from one of shelves and put it in my backpack .
I left the house .
I had n't traveled far from the house when everything suddenly became pitch black .
I was very afraid .
I heard a rustling sound and some kind of pig - like animal ran past me .
I knew I could n't continue along the patch in this darkness .
I decided I would go back to the old house and sleep for the night .
I backtracked , looking for the house .
Quickly , I became lost in the darkness and was n't even sure if I was still on the path .
I began to panic .
I started running through the darkness .
I came to a very high chain link fence with razor wire at the top and red warning signs on it .
Through the fence I saw several dark buildings and what looked like guard posts .
An old white pickup truck pulled up on the other side of the fence .
An old man with a large bald spot got out .
He was holding a shotgon .
I ran .
I heard him shout " you can run but we 'll still get ya' " .
I ran faster .
Something was chasing me .
I came to another chain link fence , half as high as the first .
I flew up it .
I grapped the razor wire at the top and pushed it down .
I hit the ground on the other side running .
I ran for hours through the dark forest .
Eventually I saw my grandfather 's work shed .
The light was on and the large doors were open .
I could see him sitting on a stool as I got closer .
I ran inside and told him something was after me .
I searched for something to use as a weapon .
Suddenly two animals ran into the shed with us .
One was a black boar looking thing with porcupine needles .
The other was a pink pig - like creature .
My grandfather cut them up with an axe .

Samsung Digital Imaging on Monday introduced the NX series , a new line of digital cameras the company calls “ hybrid , ” for their DSLR - like design and features .
The cameras are expected to hit store shelves in the second half of 2009 .
The NX series cameras use an APS - C - sized sensor — the same type of sensor that many digital Single Lens Reflex ( DSLR ) cameras use , but it does not use a “ mirror box ” for viewfinding .
Instead , it employs an electronic viewfinder , which Samsung says enables the camera to be lighter and smaller than a conventional DSLR .
Pricing was not announced and Samsung ’s Web site had not been updated about the NX Series as Macworld posted this article .
( CNN ) -- America is a less Christian nation than it was 20 years ago , and Christianity is not losing out to other religions , but primarily to a rejection of religion altogether , a survey published Monday found .
Survey finds percentage of of Americans identifying themselves as Christian has fallen over two decades .
Seventy - five percent of Americans call themselves Christian , according to the American Religious Identification Survey from Trinity College in Hartford , Connecticut .
In 1990 , the figure was 86 percent .
William Donohue , president of the Catholic League said he thinks a radical shift towards individualism over the last quarter - century has a lot to do it .
" The three most dreaded words are thou shalt not , " he told Lou Dobbs .
" Notice they are not atheists -- they are saying I do n't want to be told what to do with my life . "
At the same time there has been an increase in the number of people expressing no religious affiliation .
The survey also found that " born - again " or " evangelical " Christianity is on the rise , while the percentage who belong to " mainline " congregations such as the Episcopal or Lutheran churches has fallen .
One in three Americans consider themselves evangelical , and the number of people associated with mega-churches has skyrocketed from less than 200,000 in 1990 to more than 8 million in the latest survey .
Watch CNN report on new study »
The rise in evangelical Christianity is contributing to the rejection of religion altogether by some Americans , said Mark Silk of Trinity College .
" In the 1990s , it really sunk in on the American public generally that there was a long - lasting ' religious right ' connected to a political party , and that turned a lot of people the other way , " he said of the link between the Republican Party and groups such as the Moral Majority and Focus on the Family .
Watch author on mixing religion and politics »
" In an earlier time , people who would have been content to say , ' Well , I 'm some kind of a Protestant , ' now say ' Hell no , I wo n't go , ' " he told CNN .
Silk also said the revelation that some Catholic priests had sexually abused children -- and senior figures in the church hierarchy had helped to hide it -- drove some Catholics away from religion .
And , he said , it is now more socially acceptable than it once was to admit having no religion .
" You 're not declaring yourself a total pariah .
The culture has changed in a way that makes it easier to say , ' No , I do n't have a religion .
Even in the past year , Mitt Romney and Barack Obama feel obliged to talk about ' those of no faith , ' " he pointed out .
Obama mentioned people without faith in his inaugural address in January , making him the first president to do so .
In the survey , one in five Americans said they have no religious identity or did not answer the question , and more than one in four said they do not expect to have a religious funeral .
The rise in what the survey authors call " nones " is the only trend reflected in every single state in the study , Silk said .
" We do n't see anything else in the survey that is nationwide , " he told CNN .
Still , Tony Perkins , the president of the Family Research Council , remained hopeful that people will return to their faith , noting there was a less dramatic decline in those affiliating themselves with a religion this decade than in the 1990s .
Perkins told Lou Dobbs he sees that decline easing , and he thinks soon religion will be an even greater part of people 's lives .
" If this poll is taken next year will the outcome be different ? " he asked .
" As the economy goes downward , I think people are going to be driven to religion . "
Other findings include :
• The percentage of Catholics in the United States has remained steady at about one in four since 1990 , while the percentage of other Christians has plummeted from 60 percent to 50 percent .
• The percentage of Muslims has doubled since 1990 , but remains statistically very small , only 0.3 percent in the original survey and 0.6 percent today .
• Mormons have remained steady as a percentage of the population , even as the number of people in the United States has grown .
They make up 1.4 percent of the population .
• The number of Jews in the United States is falling if the category includes only those who define themselves as Jews religiously , but has remained the same if the category includes people who consider themselves ethnically Jewish .
The survey polled 54,461 Americans between February and November of last year .
Pollsters conducted the research in both English and Spanish .
The survey is the third in a series , following polls in 1990 and 2001 .

The Alaska Senate has found former US vice presidential candidate Gov. Sarah Palin 's husband and nine state employees , including some of her top aides , in contempt for ignoring subpoenas to testify in the Legislature 's so - called ' Troopergate ' investigation .
The Senate said it would seek no punishment for the witnesses ' failure to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall in an investigation into the governor 's firing of her public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan .
" During the Monegan investigation , we were reminded that the legislative branch 's power of subpoena is an important one , and must be respected by the executive branch , " said Sen.
Hollis French , D - Anchorage .
" With this resolution , the Senate is making it clear that we are a coequal branch of state government . "
The witnesses later provided sworn written statements after a lawsuit filed on behalf of seven of the state employees by state Attorney General Talis Colberg was dismissed in Superior Court .
The case was appealed to the state Supreme Court .
The investigation was looking into whether Palin , assisted by aides and her husband , Todd , pressured Monegan to fire a state trooper — the ex-husband of Palin 's sister — and then fired Monegan when he refused .
Palin said Monegan was ousted over budget disagreements .
Attorney Thomas Van Flein , who represented Todd Palin , said there was no contempt because his client initially provided the proper objection to the subpoena and later complied with a written statement .
Van Flein said the Senate should have allowed witnesses an opportunity to state their case before issuing the resolution .
" They did n't allow any opportunity to present actual evidence and facts .
It appears to be pure political grandstanding , " he said .
Colberg was not immediately available for comment Friday .
Palin 's spokesman Bill McAllister said the governor had no comment .
French said the witnesses ' decision to eventually provide written statements led to the Senate 's decision not to impose any penalties .
State statute provides for fines and a maximum of six months in jail for contempt of legislative subpoenas .
French said the resolution was meant to strike a balance and , in so doing , represented the Senate at its best .
The lone dissenter in the 16 - 1 vote , Anchorage Republican Con Bunde , disagreed .
" We rehash an old issue and then decide to do nothing about it , I hope that 's not our best , " Bunde said .
Democrats and Republicans each have 10 seats in the state Senate , but it is led by a bipartisan coalition that includes all the Democrats and six of the Republicans .
Palin initially said she would cooperate fully in the legislative investigation but that changed after the matter became politically charged when she was named Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's running mate .
Two separate investigations looked into the matter of Monegan 's firing .
The legislative special counsel , Stephen Branchflower , found that Palin had abused her office but the firing was legal since Monegan was an at - will employee .
A subsequent investigation by the Alaska State Personnel Board found there was no probable cause to believe Palin or any other state official violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act .
The 10 people cited in the resolution are Todd Palin ; Sarah Palin's Chief of Staff Mike Nizich ; Deputy Chief of Staff Randy Ruaro ; special assistant Ivy Frye ; Department of Administration Commissioner Annette Kreitzer ; Department of Administration employees Dianne Kiesel , Nicki Neal and Brad Thompson ; Kris Perry , the director of the Palin 's Anchorage office ; and the governor 's scheduler , Janice Mason .

Sakthikulangara means " the coast of strength " in the local language .
But the hundreds of migrant workers in this fishing village in India 's southern state of Kerala who have been forced to return home from the Gulf in recent months due to the global economic crisis have never felt more vulnerable .
Everyday they gather in an open ground behind the unusually grand village church , modelled on St Peter 's Basilica , for a game of rummy .
None can afford to wager money ; but the card game provides an opportunity to meet others , exchange news from the Gulf , and keep spirits from flagging .
All the villagers had taken a big gamble in the past when they sold their fishing boats , borrowed money at usurious rates , and went off to work on construction projects in the Gulf .
But the building boom stalled last year - according to Morgan Stanley , real estate projects worth as much as £ 263bn have been delayed or scrapped in the United Arab Emirates .
The knock - on effects are being felt across south Asia , which has provided formidable legions of labour to the emirates .
" Around 1,500 to 2,000 fishermen from Sakthikulangara were employed in prestigious sea reclamation projects in the UAE , such as Palm Island or the World , " said John Cyril , a local businessman assisting the Gulf returnees .
" Due to the recession , almost 90 % are back . "
The return of labourers from Dubai to India is just one manifestation of a mass movement of people who have lost work because of the global recession and have to return home .
China is seeing vast numbers leave industrial cities for the countryside as factory closures sweep through urban centres .
Several other southeast Asian countries are experiencing similar movements , as well as witnessing the return of some of their now - unemployed expatriates .
The concern is not just that mass unemployment will lead to unrest , but that local economies will suffer as remittances from expatriates dry up .
About two million people from Kerala work abroad , almost 90 % of whom are in the Gulf and in Saudi Arabia .
Many are poor , semi-skilled labourers who have taken loans of up to £ 2,000 , often from moneylenders , to pay recruitment agents for overseas jobs .
They work 12 - hour days , live without their families in harsh conditions , earn between £ 500 - £ 1,000 a month , and send most of the money home .
Every year migrant workers remit some £ 5.5 bn to Kerala , money that has helped transform the state , and metamorphose places like Sakthikulangara .
The first time the coastal village saw a rise in its fortunes was in the 1950s , when a Norwegian aid project helped modernise traditional fishing .
But as the seafood business dried up due to overfishing in the 1990s , the Gulf provided a much bigger bonanza .
Testimony to this are the brightly painted concrete houses that have replaced the traditional thatched dwellings in the village .
" We can always find some work here , but to improve our lives , to build a nice house , we have to go to the Gulf , " said Peter Benziger , who was forced to return last month after working for four years as a construction worker .
The communist - led state government in Kerala is deeply concerned at the sudden influx of its own , and has announced a £ 15 m rehab package for returning workers .
" We could end up with half - a- million coming back in the months to come , " finance minister Thomas Isaac told India Today weekly .
Some experts are discounting a massive exodus of Indian workers from the Gulf , but are warning that the replacement rate for workers will fall .
" There 's been a 50 % drop in passenger traffic to the Gulf since December , " said KV Muralidharan , president of the Kerala Association of Travel Agents .
" Newspaper ads by recruitment agents have also dropped by half . "
The World Bank predicts a 5 % fall in remittances worldwide this year .
In 2008 , it ranked India as the top recipient with $ 45bn in remittances .
" The retrenchment is really bad only in the construction industry , " said KV Shamsudheen , who runs a workers ' welfare trust in the Gulf .
" But the UAE , especially Dubai , has a habit of converting a crisis into opportunity , and I feel they 'll do it again . "
The fishermen of Sakthikulangara have n't given up hope , either .
" I 'm going back after Easter , as my Gulf visa is still valid , " said Lenin Aloysius , his name testifying to the village 's mixed Catholic - communist heritage .
" If I do n't get a good Gulf job then I can't give a good education to my two sons , which is my first priority , " he said .
Aloysius worked for two years as a dredging helper in Dubai until he was asked to go home in November .
Ever since , like the other returnees , he has worked on a fishing boat earning £ 3 a day .
But like the others , he expects an economic revival in the Gulf soon .
Benziger said : " Everybody standing here believes this recession will end soon , at the most in six months ' time . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors is preparing to announce that the Pontiac car brand , once marketed as GM's " Excitement division , " will be killed off , according to a source familiar with the decision .
An official announcement is expected Monday .
GM spokesman Jim Hopson declined to comment on Pontiac 's fate , saying the automaker has no announcements to make at this time .
In its most recent " viability plan " - which will be updated to reflect this new brand cut - Pontiac was not named as one of GM 's four " core brands . "
Those are Chevrolet , Buick , GMC and Cadillac .
But Pontiac was also not to be killed or sold off , as were Saturn , Saab and Hummer .
Instead Pontiac was to continue on as a " niche brand " focusing on just a few models .
That was already a step down for Pontiac which in 2008 was the third - best selling brand behind Chevrolet and GMC .
That year the brand sold more than Cadillac and twice as many vehicles as Buick .
Cadillac is a high - profile - and high profit - luxury brand while Buick is a hugely popular brand in China and is seen as resurgent in the United States .
In 2005 , GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) vice - chairman Bob Lutz referred to Buick and Pontiac as " damaged brands " during a conference at the New York Auto Show .
That set off speculation that one or both of these brands was doomed .
With a focus on affordable luxury , Buick 's hopes have been revived by models like the popular Enclave crossover SUV .
Improvements in Buick Quality , which earned a top ranking in a recent J.D. Power dependability survey and a public acknowledgement by President Obama , have also helped Buick keep its place in the shrinking pantheon of GM names .
Pontiac performance
" There was a time , a long way back now , when you knew exactly what Pontiac stood for , " said Kevin Smith , editorial director for the automotive Web site Edmunds.com .
The GM unit 's identity as a performance brand dates back to the late 1950s and early 1960s .
Pontiac cars were designed with wider bodies for cosmetic reasons and the wheels were pushed out to match .
This " wide - track " design became a selling point and was advertised as giving Pontiac cars a distinct cornering advantage over other cars .
But the idea of Pontiac as a performance brand was solidified in 1964 with the creation of the Pontiac Tempest LeMans GTO .
That car quickly evolved into , simply , the GTO and is often credited with creating a new class of American car , the muscle car .
Under Lutz , plans were formed to bring back some actual excitement to the Pontiac brand , which had n't seen much since the Firebird - a flashier Pontiac version of the Chevrolet Camaro - ended production in 2002 .
One strategy floated for Pontiac was to sell only , or mostly , rear - wheel - drive cars .
That would set it apart from other GM divisions , and most cars sold in America .
Rear - wheel - drive is associated with performance brands like BMW .
Unfortunately , the re-introduction of the Pontiac GTO name on a performance coupe imported from Australia did n't result in big sales .
So far , the Pontiac G8 , a rear - wheel - drive four - door sedan also imported from GM's Australian Holden division , has n't been a sales success either , despite good reviews .
Pontiac 's most popular products remain the G6 , a decent but unexciting midsize car available as a sedan , coupe or convertible , and the Vibe , a small wagon shared with Toyota , which sells it as the Matrix .
Any plans to return Pontiac to the heavy - horsepower days of the ' 70s ended as gas prices rose and Congress prepared stricter fuel economy rules for the industry .
Those pressures resulted in GM quietly introducing the Pontiac G3 , which had been sold in Canada only .
Once again , Pontiac was selling a rebadged Chevrolet product , this time the Korean - built Aveo subcompact car .
Pontiac 's lack of focus as a brand may finally have brought its demise , said Smith .
" That 's just death in a marketplace where there 's so much competition and so much quality , " he said .
Pontiac 's current role in GM seems mostly to be to support GMC and Buick by providing a brand under which Pontiac - Buick - GMC dealers could sell non-luxury cars , filling out what then becomes a full - line showroom .
The brand - channel strategy now makes it easier for GM to phase out the brand because it would cause less harm to dealers , independent business protected by strong state franchise laws .
When GM phased out Oldsmobile in the early 2000's , it cost GM more than $ 1 billion to buy out the contracts of Oldsmobile dealers who were left with nothing to sell .
This time , most Pontiac dealers will have other products to sell .

Google Maps thinks so too !
In light of that , it 's no surprise that when Adrianne Ledesma called 911 , it took a few rings before someone was able to answer .
After calling once and getting no answer , she hung up and called again .
This time , it once again rang several times before anyone answered .
Understandably frustrated , Ledesma blurted out " what the fuck ? ! " as the phone was ringing .
Because 911 calls begin recording before they are even answered , somehow , the operator on the other end heard the foul language .
When Ledesma advised that she needed an ambulance and gave her address , the operator got right to the important business at hand : scolding the girl for cursing .

The teen responded to this ill - timed lecture the same way most any of us would .
Having apparently never been subjected to such unseemly behavior in his life , the 20 - year veteran of the Lincoln Park Police Department on the other end of the call got things back on a more professional course by hanging up on the caller .
We 're not emergency response professionals , but we maybe would have asked what the problem was before disconnecting the call .
In case you 're curious , the girl 's father was on the floor having a seizure .
But the fun did n't stop there .
After the teen called back , the officer continued on the moral highroad by asking if she was going to swear again before adding a nice pot -calling - the - kettle - black moment when he called her " a stupid ass . "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Classy !
Again , so taken back at the thought of a frantic teen having the audacity to curse , the officer still did n't ask what she was calling about and disconnected the call .
This display of pointless bickering even continued through a third call in which the officer called her " a buffoon . "
It should go without saying that she was hung up on that time also .
So , What Happened ?
There 's good news and there is bad news .
On the bright side , Officer Friendly finally did put in the call for help , although he was still unable to tell them exactly what they were being dispatched for .
In keeping with his FCC like devotion to family friendly emergencies , he made sure to bring up the cursing when putting in the call .
In a complete reversal , Sen. Chris Dodd admitted he inserted language into the stimulus bill allowing $ 165 million in bonuses to those AIG executives .
But the President made him do it !
Dodd , chairman of the senate banking committee , finally admitted to CNN ( see clip ) that his stimulus amendment allowed the universally - reviled bonuses , which went to the very AIG executives responsible for tanking the company .
In talking to CNN , Dodd used excruciatingly boring legislative / parliamentary language , probably to try and put the audience to sleep .
But his argument boils down to this :
The Obama administration asked him to put the bonus language in , and Dodd was afraid all other executive compensation limits would be stripped from the stimulus package if he did n't comply .
He did n't do it because , you know , AIG executives and political action committees donated all that money to the Connecticut Democrat .
It looks like there 's some actual truth behind this buck passing ; following Dodd 's admission , the president said at a town hall meeting in California , " I 'll take responsibilty .
I 'm the president . "
Also , " a Treasury Department official told CNN the administration pushed for the language . "
That points to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner as the one who pushed Dodd to allow the bonuses .
That would make sense ; at the New York Federal Reserve , Geithner served as a bridge between Wall Street and federal monetary regulators .
Top finance executives like Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase sat on his board .
Geithner was also said to be instrumental in arranging the bailout of Bear Stearns — and of AIG .
He 's been something of an embarrassment to Obama .
His senate confirmation hearings revealed Geithner had not paid self - employment taxes for several years .

On the Engineering Windows 7 blog this week , Microsoft again noted that it was planning to give the public a Release Candidate of Windows 7 before the final version is ready .
In other words , there is not going to be a " Beta 2 , " and the public would only see one public beta build : Windows 7 build 7000 .
However , a timeline for these versions is not disclosed : " This post is in no way an announcement of a ship date , change in plans , or change in our previously described process , but rather it provides additional detail and a forward looking view of the path to RTM and General Availability . "
The fact that Microsoft is not planning a second beta , that the first beta is the most stable Microsoft has ever given out , and that getting Windows 7 ready in time for the holidays is advantageous has all led to speculation that Microsoft wants Vista 's successor out this year .
Officially , Microsoft has always said " three years after the general availability of Windows Vista , " which was released on January 30 , 2007 , and that the release date was also dependent on quality .
As with any product in beta , enthusiasts have been making predictions all over the place , most in the timeframe of late 2009 to early 2010 .
Microsoft employees have been making their own predictions , but the average of their guesses is much earlier in 2009 : October 3 .
I asked Michael Bohlin , product , here are some dates more or less nailed .
February 26 , TechNet and TrueSec med with Microsoft Windows 7 Summit .
Microsoft Windows 7 Summit .
17 -18 March , Tech Days in V�ster�s , our largest Windows 7 event in the spring .
May 31 Microsoft itself installed .
Early in April , after CeBIT , the RC .
June , July , August , Summer Koll with many presentations .
RTM and launch company as it stands right now Q3 2009 .
The cut of all internal guesses here at the office right now is October 3 at 11.10 .
February 2010 the board of trade .
The above quote is a translated version ( � la Google ) of a Microsoft Sweden partner blog post that Neowin found .
It should also be noted that the timeline points to an RC being released in April .
Dates like those above are always subject to change , but it 's quite obvious that Microsoft is at least currently aiming to get Windows 7 ready for prime time by Q3 2009 .
We 'll just have to wait and see if they can pull it off .
Every brain has a soundtrack .
Its tempo and tone will vary , depending on mood , frame of mind , and other features of the brain itself .
When that soundtrack is recorded and played back -- to an emergency responder , or a firefighter -- it may sharpen their reflexes during a crisis , and calm their nerves afterward .
Over the past decade , the influence of music on cognitive development , learning , and emotional well - being has emerged as a hot field of scientific study .
To explore music 's potential relevance to emergency response , the Dept of Homeland Security 's Science &Technology Directorate ( S&T ) has begun a study into a form of neurotraining called " Brain Music " that uses music created in advance from listeners ' own brain waves to help them deal with common ailments like insomnia , fatigue , and headaches stemming from stressful environments .
The concept of Brain Music is to use the frequency , amplitude , and duration of musical sounds to move the brain from an anxious state to a more relaxed state .
Can the soundtracks in your brain be made useful ?
Credit : Created by Paul Wedig" Strain comes with an emergency response job , so we are interested in finding ways to help these workers remain at the top of their game when working and get quality rest when they go off a shift , " said S&T Program Manager Robert Burns .
" Our goal is to find new ways to help first responders perform at the highest level possible , without increasing tasks , training , or stress levels .
"
If the brain " composes " the music , the first job of scientists is to take down the notes , and that is exactly what Human Bionics LLC of Purcellville , VA does .
Each recording is converted into two unique musical compositions designed to trigger the body 's natural responses , for example , by improving productivity while at work , or helping adjust to constantly changing work hours .
The compositions are clinically shown to promote one of two mental states in each individual : relaxation – for reduced stress and improved sleep ; and alertness – for improved concentration and decision - making .
Each 2 - 6 minute track is a composition performed on a single instrument , usually a piano .
The relaxation track may sound like a " melodic , subdued Chopin sonata , " while the alertness track may have " more of a Mozart sound , " says Burns .
( It seems there 's a classical genius — or maybe two genii — in all of us .

After their brain waves are set to music , each person is given a specific listening schedule , personalized to their work environment and needs .
If used properly , the music can boost productivity and energy levels , or trigger a body 's natural responses to stress .
The music created by Human Bionics LLC is being tested as part of the S&T Readiness Optimization Program ( ROP ) , a wellness program that combines nutrition education and neurotraining to evaluate a cross population of first responders , including federal agents , police , and firefighters .
A selected group of local area firefighters will be the first emergency responders taking part in the project .
The Brain Music component of the ROP is derived from patented technology developed at Moscow University to use brain waves as a feedback mechanism to correct physiological conditions .
In British philosopher John Locke 's terms , Brain Music brings new meaning to his famous phrase : " A sound mind in a sound body , is a short , but full description of a happy state in this World .
" And then there 's always Cervantes , who coined , " He who sings scares away his woes . "
Colleagues of a man accused of murdering his ex-wife have told a south - east Queensland court he came to work with scratch marks on his face the day her body was found .
Up to six witnesses are expected to give evidence today at the committal hearing at the Hervey Bay Magistrates Court .
The badly burnt remains of 33 - year - old Lisa Keem were found in the Maria River State Forest at Kempsey on the New South Wales mid-north coast in June 2008 .
Her former partner , Richard Giardina , has been charged with murdering her in Hervey Bay .
In a statement submitted to Magistrate Graeme Tatnell , the police prosecutor said an autopsy found Ms Keem had been strangled .
Yesterday , two of Giardina 's former workmates told the court they noticed scratch marks on his face two days after she was allegedly murdered .
One of Ms Keem 's friends also gave evidence , saying Ms Keem described her relationship with Mr Giardina as " quite violent " .
The hearing is expected to continue until Friday .

Although social factors play their part , the age at which people first have sexual intercourse may be affected by genes ( Image : Image Source / Rex )
Sexual precociousness is in our genes , new research suggests .
A unique study of twins separated at birth finds a genetic link to the age at which a person first engages in sexual intercourse .
“ It ’s not like there ’s a gene for having a sex at a certain date , ” says Nancy Segal , a psychologist at California State University in Fullerton who led the new study .
Instead , heritable behavioural traits such as impulsivity could help determine when people first have sex , she says .
As genetic determinism goes , the new findings are modest .
Segal ’s team found that genes explain a third of the differences in participants ’ age at first intercourse – which was , on average , a little over 19 years old .
By comparison , roughly 80 % of variations in height across a population can be explained by genes alone .

However , determining the extent to which sexual precociousness is inherited is trickier than making a similar calculation for height .
A common family environment – whether it promotes or hinders early sex – could cause scientists to overestimate the effect of genes .
Social effect
By studying 48 pairs of twins raised apart , as well as 23 individual twins , Segal ’s team sidesteps this confounding factor .
“ This gives us a pure estimate about how much genes affect behaviour , ” she says .
On the other hand , conservative social mores might delay a teen ’s first sexual experience , causing scientists to low - ball the effect of genes .
Indeed , Segal ’s team noticed a less pronounced genetic effect among twins born before 1948 , compared with those who came of age in the 1960s or later .
Other factors may also make the effects of genes harder to discern .
For example , Segal ’s team also found that female participants who felt unhappy and unfulfilled in their home life were more likely to have sex at a younger age .
Essential function
As for the specific genes involved , another team previously found that a version of a gene encoding a receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine is associated with age at first intercourse .
Others have linked the same version of the gene – called DRD4 – to impulsive , risk - taking behaviour .
This might be one explanation for early sexual activity , says Joseph Rodgers , a psychologist at the University of Oklahoma in Norman .
Yet unlike other risky behaviours , such as drug use or reckless driving , sex serves an essential biological function .
“ For most of our evolutionary past , sexual behaviour has n’t been risk taking , it ’s about reproduction and success of the species , ” Rodgers says .

Last month , I covered the launch of real - time ray tracing startup Caustic Graphics , and I noted the skeptical chatter that I 'd heard about the company 's prospects in the graphics community .
In brief , anyone who 's pitching a custom coprocessor on an add - in board has a difficult road ahead of them in the current , price - sensitive market .
When you factor in the challenges of doing real - time ray tracing , plus the fact that most of the visuals produced by the technique can be serviceably approximated in games by traditional rasterization , it was tough to see where Caustic could have a chance at success .
But after a visit to Caustic 's San Francisco headquarters this past Friday , I came away with a much better understanding of what the startup is trying to achieve .
In a nutshell , Caustic is attacking the ray tracing problem not on the compute side but on the data side , as a database problem that 's constrained by bandwidth and memory locality issues .
" Ray tracing is a database problem , " Caustic cofounder James A. McCombe told me .
" The issue is how do you get data to those processors fast enough .
We set out to solve that fundamental database problem . "
Caustic attacks the problem with a combination of custom OpenGL extensions , which it hopes to see become an open standard .
Custom hardware for accelerating these database lookups is designed to work alongside the CPU and GPU , with the latter two components handling the math - intensive side of rendering ( e.g. , shaders ) .
The custom hardware component is a relatively small block of logic that does ray traversal and essentially accelerates a set of proprietary algorithms that Caustic cooked up .
" The hardware bears no resemblance to a stream processor , " McCombe told me .
" It 's a database and memory bandwidth accelerator of sorts . "
I 'm still very skeptical of Caustic 's prospects in the current market , when even high - end video cards have all but stopped selling , but these issues are out of Caustic 's control and are faced by pretty much anyone selling any kind of premium product right now , from handbags to servers .
The company is n't giving out many more details about its tech , especially the hardware 's architecture , at this time .
Speaking of the hardware , the first Caustic RT board is essentially an Altera 100MHz FPGA chip with a single lane of DDR2 memory .
This board , which costs $ 4,000 , is targeted at developers and at the content generation industry .
Games , movies , and automotive design are all target markets for the part , which at launch will greatly speed up the ray tracing capabilities of the rendering package Brazil .
Caustic is backed by $ 11 million in angel funding , and it used some of that to buy Splutterfish , which makes Brazil .
So by offering its card as a way to get near - realtime ( depending on resolution ) , interactive previews of ray - traced scenes with Brazil , Caustic hopes to tap a built - in audience .
If enough game developers see the benefits of doing RTRT with the Caustic hardware and OpenGL extensions , then the startup 's second - generation part , CausticTwo , will have a much better shot at reaching its target audience of gamers .
CausticTwo will be a 350MHz ASIC fabbed on TSMC 's 90nm process , and it should give up to a 14X speed boost over the first Caustic part .
This should make it fast enough to support games at 30 FPS , a framerate that is well out of reach of the first - generation part .
Caustic 's game plan
In my previous article , my two main criticisms of Caustic 's technology and apparent business model are reproduced below :
To do something truly interesting with ray tracing ( i.e. , something superior to what you can do with rasterization ) is very hard , and most of the bottlenecks are on the bandwidth , not the compute , side of the hardware problem .
And furthermore , the visual results often are n't better than what rasterization plus a collection of hacks can get you ...
Then there 's the economic challenge associated with any type of application - specific coprocessor .
I described these challenges in detail in this article on Ageia , another company that tried ( and failed ) to produce a custom , many - core coprocessor on an add - in board , and it 's mainly an issue of volume ...
The game and movie studio market that Caustic appears to be courting with this is way too small to support a custom coprocessor , especially one that 's likely to be a chip multiprocessor with substantial high - level similarities to Intel 's mass - market Larrabee GPU .
The criticisms above are still valid , but here 's how Caustic plans to get around these issues .
To start with the second issue ( volume and the size of the target market ) , it 's now clear that the part is not a parallel math coprocessor in the Ageia mold .
Instead , the ASIC 's architecture is relatively small and simple , and when implemented on TSMC 's very cheap , legacy 90nm process node it 's likely to remain fairly cheap at even at lower volumes .
So while Caustic could n't hope to survive by pitching a many - core math coprocessor on a leading - edge process at a market as small as the one they 're initially targeting , it 's possible that its target market can support a much less ambitious piece of hardware on a legacy process .
As far as the debatable visual merits of ray tracing versus rasterization - plus - hacks , that criticism still stands .
But Caustic 's true value proposition is n't so much in ray tracing 's alleged visual superiority to rasterization ( I 'll let the Caustic guys debate this with rasterization 's proponents ) as it is in ray tracing 's potential to cut down on game development costs .
For a rasterization - based game engine , artists have to generate shadow maps , reflections , and other lighting - related elements for a scene by hand .
So instead of just creating textures and models for a scene , the artists also have to compose the entire scene by putting all of the elements together and then manually filling in many of the lighting effects .
This sort of thing takes a lot of time , and it drives up the cost of game development by making it much more labor - intensive process .
Real - time ray tracing essentially shifts this lighting work from artists to the game engine , so that regardless of what you do with a scene , the lighting , shadows , and reflections are visually correct without any labor - intensive artistic sleight - of - hand .
So even if initial ray - traced games do n't quite live up to the visual standards of the current generation of rasterized games , they would be easier and cheaper to make because artists can spend more time on textures and models and less time fussing over how those assets interact with the lighting in a scene .
In this respect , Caustic 's value proposition is n't so much that the real - time ray tracing that its technology enables provides a vastly superior gaming experience , but rather that RTRT makes for cheaper game development .
I 'm still very skeptical of Caustic 's prospects in the current market , when even high - end video cards have all but stopped selling , but these issues are out of Caustic 's control and are faced by pretty much anyone selling any kind of premium product right now , from handbags to servers .
Once the larger economic situation takes a turn for the better and consumers start spending again , Caustic will still have to solve the same chicken - and - egg problem that bedeviled Ageia , because for a developer to get the full cost savings of RTRT it will have to ditch rasterization entirely , but before that can happen there must be a large enough installed base of Caustic cards .
( Note that CausticGL , Caustic 's ray tracing extensions to OpenGL , work without the Caustic RT add - in board .
But performance would be so slow that it 's not super clear why anyone would use the extensions without the hardware . )
No landmark has ever been quite as impressive as the huge statue of Jesus along Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton .
There are lots of different versions of socialism and lots of different arguments against them .
In this post , I am concerned with one particular question — whether , in order to get things produced , it is necessary to pay people to produce them .
Some variants of socialism , typically decentralist and perhaps utopian , argue that it is not .
In a well functioning society as they see it , workers will work for the pleasure of working , possibly reinforced by nonpecuiary motives such as status , feelings of social obligation , and the like — a craftsman model of the economy .
One might argue that World of Warcraft provides evidence in favor of their position .
After all , players spend many hours " working " at producing things of no material value .
A high level blacksmith or jewelcrafter or engineer has made the effort to learn and practice his craft , within the framework of the game , largely for the fun of it — possibly reinforced by various nonpecuniary motives .
If it works in virtual reality , why not in realspace ?
It does work in real space — within limits .
Quite a lot of effort goes into a wide variety of unpaid voluntary activities .
It may not result in as much effort or output as can be produced by material incentives ; I do not think I know anyone who puts forty hours a week into online crafting .
But we are , historically speaking , a very rich society , and may well grow richer still in the future .
Reducing output to , say , half its current level might be a reasonable price to pay for a society where nobody find that he has to do work he does n't want to do in order to pay the bills .
A more serious problem has to do with what work gets done , what goods get produced .
In a market society , one of the things determining what people do is what they like doing ; it is easier to hire people to do work they enjoy than work they do n't enjoy .
But the other thing determining what people do is what other people want done , since that affects how much you can get paid to do things .
In the sort of society I am describing , the second element comes in only through mechanisms much clumsier than the price system .
If nobody likes plumbing or ditch digging , someone may decide that it's his social duty to take it up or that other people will award him status for doing so .
Or he may simply hope someone else does it , while he gets on with writing the Great American Novel .
One of the attractive features of World of Warcraft and its competitors is that the virtual world has been constructed , in some cases with considerable care and ingenuity , to be a place that it is fun to do things in .
The real world has not .
Some of the things that need doing there are things that people enjoy enough to do them even when not paid to , and some things get done that way .
My guess , for instance , is that the vast majority of all novels written end up unpublished and that at least some people keep writing novels even after they realize that the chance of getting paid for them is very low .
But I am dubious that all , or even most , of the world 's work can get done that way .
An economy in which resources are allocated almost entirely on the basis of what people want to do rather than what other people want done is likely to end up with quite a lot missing .
The catalyst , the push that finally got me to overcome the fears that it would n't be worth it and the doubts that I could even do it , was that same impetus of so many changed lives : heartbreak .
I needed something to take my mind off the hurt , and I was barely eating anyway .
So I emptied the fridge , read a few articles on vegetarian nutrition - -" take B vitamins , get enough protein " -- and started my new life .
The first few weeks were tricky .
I craved meat constantly , even in sleep -- I dreamt about fried chicken every night .
Restaurants were the worst : menus were like propaganda pamphlets , covered with warnings about the challenges ahead ( " you mean you do n't serve a single thing I can eat ? " ) and succulently persuasive arguments to rejoin the carnivores surrounding me .
Eventually , I learned how to scan a menu for the edible - to - me dishes .
Cheeseburgers , once a terrible temptation , do n't even look like food anymore -- they look like little discs of dead muscle tissue , which , it 's easy for us to forget , is what they are .
That 's when the real challenge started : coming out of the closet .
I 'd kept it a secret at first , in case I faltered or changed my mind .
But soon I knew I was a veggie to stay , and that meant sharing it .
I had no idea what I was getting into .
Family members launched an orchestrated campaign of guilt and temptation .
A relative who remembers my fondness for smoked salmon has it out whenever I visit .
" Chicken is n't meat , " another still tells me regularly .
" You can eat it .
I got you some . "
Holidays became more like interventions .
Only easy - going Uncle Joel let me be -- although his frequent invitations to join him deer hunting raise some questions .
Of course , their attempts at reverting me were rooted in love -- they sincerely believed I was n't living as full or healthy a life without meat .
But giving it up has only made me healthier and increased my already - deep appreciation of food .
Sources of easy meals are gone -- restaurants from McDonalds to Bouley , deli counters , most takeout -- so I cook nearly everything , and am more skilled for the time and energy that must go into every meal .
People think vegetarians subsist on dreary , flavorless , tofu - filled meals , but the truth is that I 've never eaten better .
The most difficult part of being vegetarian is the misconception that we judge or , worse , want to convert meat - eaters , an assumption I blame on PETA 's vitriolic ad campaigns , which suggest a mindset of herbivore heroes versus carnivorous villains .
When I tell someone about my diet , their first reaction is almost always to apologize , as if even mentioning meat to me were like telling an evangelical Christian they 'd performed an abortion that morning for fun .
" You know , " they always tell me , " I barely eat meat , and I 'm seriously considering becoming a vegetarian . "
I 've learned to wait until the second or third date to let my secret slip , an announcement I make carefully , almost guiltily , as if admitting I had children out of wedlock .
And sometimes that 's about the reaction : " I did n't know you were one of them . "
But the most frequent is , surprisingly , relief - - more often than not , she 's a vegetarian too .
New McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh has just come out into the Sepang paddock to speak to the media after the news that Lewis Hamilton and the team have been thrown out of the results of the Australian Grand Prix for ‘ deliberately misleading ’ the stewards over the incident with Jarno Trulli , involving overtaking behind the safety car .
“ Lewis was instructed to give the place back to Trulli , “ said Whitmarsh .
“ The team thought , having not seen the incident , that it was the safest thing to do .
That instruction was given to Lewis and he did n’t agree .
Before that discussion was finished , Trulli had been passed .
If we look at the speed traces and compare it to other periods , he did n’t do anything abnormal and it ’s quite clear that Lewis should n’t have passed him .
As soon as that happened we spoke to race control to ask if we could retake the place .
race control was busy and could n’t answer us . ”
He added that the team then thought when they met the stewards that they were aware of the radio conversations .
This turned out not to be the case .
He went on : “ The stewards now believe that we were n’t explicit enough about that radio conversation and thought that was prejudicial to the decision that they reached .
We regret that and it was a mistake by the team .
“ There is not implication that Lewis lied to the stewards .
I do n’t know what they meant by ( deliberately misleading ) , you ’d have to ask them .
They clearly feel that the team did n’t give enough information about the radio conversation .
“ They believe that the omission of the information about the radio conversation between the team and Lewis was withheld and that is what they believe was misleading . ”
The suggestion being voiced here is that the FIA considers this matter so serously that it is considering taking this matter to the World Motor Sport Council where further sanctions might be applied .
Coming less than two years after McLaren was fined a record $ 100 million for the Ferrari spying scandal , the team is trying very hard to deflect the impression that it has acted dishonestly again .
Hamilton and McLaren being thrown out for misleading the stewards means that Trulli gets his third place back .
Ironically he and his Toyota team had been thrown out of qualifying for having rear wings which were overly flexible and therefore illegal .
Which of the two crimes is the worse ?
These two incidents certainly make two of the big manufacturer - backed teams in F1 , appear less than honest .. and this is only the first race of the season .

Jon Stewart is a funny man ?
we can all agree on that .
Whether it ’s his numerous quips on The Daily Show or his hosting of the Oscars , he very rarely fails to make us smile .
In fact , Jon Stewart is so funny he could probably make us laugh while telling us we have terminal cancer .
Or that our dog had just been run over .
He is so funny , politicians go on his show just to have the pleasure of getting the piss taken out of them .
He could even make us giggle at Stu’s TV programme , Tonightly , or Dane Cook .
Because he ’s that funny .
Actually , the last two are probably pushing it , but you get the gist .
He is a very funny man .
Not that he could be funnier , mind .
Employ a few hecklerspray writers and you really would be the funniest funnyman in the history of funny things , Jon .
You can do it , Jon !
Just pick up the phone .
Forget , Stu’s Tonightly programme , he was going through a bad time .
He can be much funnier than that , honest .
Just answer one of the million emails we sent you begging for jobs .
What ’s the matter , funnyman ?
Ca n’t handle the competition ?
Anyway , did we mention Jon Stewart is a funny man ?
And with Barack Obama ‘s inauguration happening tomorrow , we thought it would be nice to deliver a timely reminder of just how funny Jon Stewart is by recounting some of his most humorous quips .
Please feel free to suggest any more .
There must be millions , he ’s that funny ?.

“ They always throw around this term ‘ the liberal elite . ’
And I kept thinking to myself about the Christian right .

“ Senator John McCain , who spent over five years in a Vietnamese POW camp , publicly releases 1,000 pages of medical records .
Now people are left with only one nagging question : what kind of a freak has 1,000
pages of medical records . ”
14 . On an historic election
“ Democrats do have an historic race going .
Hillary Clinton vs. Barack Obama .

Bjork could not be here .
She was trying on her Oscars dress and Dick Cheney shot her . ”
12 . On the Republican party
“ This is inarguably a failure of leadership from the top of the federal government .
Remember when Bill Clinton went out with Monica Lewinsky .
That was unarguably a failure of judgment at the top .
Democrats had to come out and risk losing credibility if they did not condemn Bill Clinton for his behaviour .
I believe Republicans are in the same position right now .
And I will say this : Hurricane Katrina is George Bush ’s Monica Lewinsky .
The only difference is that tens of thousands of people were n’t stranded in Monica Lewinsky ’s vagina . ”
11 . On the US ’ international standing
“ Yesterday , the president met with a group he calls the coalition of the willing .
Or , as the rest of the world calls them , Britain and Spain . ”

4. On Liza Minnelli and David Gest , 2003
“ I do n’t know how it did n’t work out .

I am a brew fan through and through ; I take my beer enjoyment seriously and look at as an adventure more than just an excuse to drink .

The five beers that made this collection are not only on the extreme end of the wallet - crushing scale , but they ’re also highly sought after and rather rare or only available in select locations .
So , sit back , take a sip of whatever you ’re havin ’ , and pine along with me over the list of beers very few of us will ever enjoy .
Vielle Bon Secours – $ 1000 / Bottle
Where it ’s from :
Well , let ’s just say it ’s currently only available at London ’s Bierdrome for an astounding $ 78 a pint .
What ’s it taste like ? : From Beerpal.com
“ Reddish - golden — a bit darker than what I would have expected from a Belgian 8 % ABV Pale Ale named “ Blonde ” .
But no complaints .
Ditto for the aroma .
Enough complexity in the nose to pique the interest of the taster , and nothing more .
Could have been a bit more assertive .
The same can be said of the flavor profile .
Really could be a bit more assertive and bolder , especially in the front end .
As I drank this , I kept on expecting something to pop out at me from left - field .
Some sort of additional layer of complexity , or nuance that I missed earlier .
But no , this is not bad ( not at all ) , but did n’t really show off much in the way the complex nuances that I enjoy seeking out in beers of this style .
Rather , this seems to show it ’s cards early in the hand , and leaves nothing to imagination for later revisitation .
Easy to put down , but really kinda lacking in complexity in the flavor and the mouthfeel .
{ Shrug} but I ’ve had worse … . ”
Do I want one ? :
Um , hell to the yeah !
Samuel Adams Utopias – $ 100 / Bottle
Where it ’s from :
Believe it or not , it ’s from the same place you ’d find other Sam Adams beer : The Boston Brewing Company .
What ’s it taste like ? : From Jim Koch , brewer and founder .
“ You are about to experience the strongest beer ever brewed .
With an alcohol content of 25 % by volume , we ’ve broken our own record set by Sam Adams Utopias MMII in 2002 .
Beer enthusiasts have never enjoyed a beer like Sam Adams Utopias .
When served at room temperature in a two - ounce serving , Sam Adams Utopias is an ideal after - dinner drink .
Pour it into a wine glass or brandy snifter .
Note the aroma .
Take a sip and enjoy the ideal beer .
People have asked what inspired me to brew such a unique beer ?
Drinkers have long been familiar with light beers .
I wanted to show them the opposite end of the beer spectrum .
A beer that is strong , rich and dark .
Some would say , the ultimate beer .
A beer without carbonation , one to be savored slowly .
We started by using some of the world ’s finest ingredients , including all four types of Noble hops , which give the beer its earthy , herbal taste .
The hops also add a spicy note .
Carmel , Vienna , Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts add a rich amber color .
A variety of yeast were used during fermentation , including the same yeast used in champagne .
As a result of this unique brewing process , this flavorful , slightly fruity brew has a sweet , malty flavor that resembles the deep , rich grape taste of a vintage Port , fine Cognac or old Sherry ”
Do I want one ? : I have actually seen one here at a local purveyor of spirits and , as much as I ’d love to say I laid down the cash … well …
I could think of a million other things a hundred dollars could have been used for .
Tutankhamen Brew – $ 525 / Bottle
Where it ’s from : Egypt !
Well , originally .
Here ’s the story from DUI.com :
The beer ’s story reads like an Indiana Jones movie .
Archaeologists from Cambridge University ’s Egypt Exploration Society joined with Scottish and Newcastle Breweries six years ago , when the team uncovered a massive kitchen complex in the Sun Temple of Queen Nefertiti , a relation by marriage of King Tut. Archaeologists ’ key role
The archaeologists examined grains and seeds left behind by ancient brewers , and the dregs of beer from excavated jars were analyzed to determine how the beer was made .
“ Even the pure water of the desert wells was analyzed , ” said Jim Merrington , Scottish and Newcastle ’s project director .
“ We studied tomb paintings , deciphered ( hieroglyphics ) and excavated 10 or more brewing rooms in the quest for the liquid gold of Tutankhamen . ”
In reconstructing the recipe , Scottish and Newcastle brew masters used emmer , an ancient wheat grown by the Egyptians , and coriander , an herb found in the Nile region . ”
What ’s it taste like ? :
I could n’t find a whole lot on the flavor , since I guess it ’s some kind of secret , but what I could ascertain was that , judging by the ingredients , it most likely has a white wine note .
Still …
Do I want one ? :
Beer made from an ancient Egyptian recipe ?
Well yeah !
Carlsberg Vintage No. 1 – $ 400 / Bottle
Where it ’s from : Jacobsen Brewhouse , Denmark .
You can see it here .
What ’s it taste like ? :
From the folks at bornrich.org : “ The designer beer has a chestnut brown color , little foam and hints of prune , caramel , vanilla and oak tree from the French and Swedish wooden casks in which it is stored .
The beer goes well with cheeses and desserts according to the brewer . ”
Do I want one ? : I dunno .
With all the ‘ snobbery ’ attached to this , likely not .
Plus , prune ?
Carlsberg Jacobsen Vintage No. 2 – $ 600 / Bottle
Where it ’s from : Jacobsen Brewhouse , Denmark ( same as above )
What ’s it taste like ? :
According to some info I gathered , this is the second in the planned trilogy by this company and as you can see from the following description , it ’s quite different : “ Because of its stout - like origins , it has a jet - black color and espresso - like foam .
Jacobsen says Vintage No. 2 ’s aroma displays hints of tar and ropes , owing to the peat - smoked Scottish malt used for the brew .
It is best served at 15 - 20 °C and pairs well with oysters , shellfish , Parma ham and cheese but is equally at home with sweeter delights like chocolate and crème brûlée . ”
Do I want one ? :
Well , I have to say , as an avid fan of the darker brew , I think I would likely murder some folks for a sip .
To be frank .
Editor ’s Note : Removed Nantucket Whale ’s Tale Pale Ale and Chimay Premiere from the list due to inaccuracies , and they did n’t really fit with the others .
Sorry for the confusion
Wind turbines off U.S. coastlines could potentially supply more than enough electricity to meet the nation ’s current demand , the Interior Department reported Thursday .
Simply harnessing the wind in relatively shallow waters -- the most accessible and technically feasible sites for offshore turbines -- could produce at least 20 % of the power demand for most coastal states , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said , unveiling a report by the Minerals Management Service that details the potential for oil , gas and renewable development on the outer continental shelf .
The biggest wind potential lies off the nation ’s Atlantic coast , which the Interior report estimates could produce 1,000 gigawatts of electricity -- enough to meet a quarter of the national demand .
The report also notes large potential in the Pacific , including off the California coast , but said the area presented technical challenges .

The Interior Department released an executive summary of the report on Thursday .
It noted that “ strong wind resources also exist offshore California , Oregon , Washington and Hawaii , but it appears that the majority of this resource lies in deep waters where technology constraints are potentially significant ” -- a sentiment Salazar echoed when asked about Pacific wind potential .
The report also suggests vast oil and gas reserves off the Pacific coast : the equivalent of 10 billion to 18 billion barrels of oil .
Salazar told attendees at the 25 x ' 25 Summit in Virginia , a gathering of agriculture and energy representatives exploring ways to cut carbon dioxide emissions , that “ we are only beginning to tap the potential ” of offshore renewable energy .

The report is a step in the Obama administration ’s mission to chart a course for offshore energy development , an issue that gained urgency last year amid high oil prices and chants of “ Drill , baby , drill ” at the Republican National Convention .
Critics have accused President Obama and Salazar of dragging their feet on new oil and gas drilling , and Thursday ’s report does little to rebut those complaints .
It includes no new estimates of potential oil and gas reserves offshore and notes that some of the existing estimates are based on 25 - year - old seismic studies .
Meeting with reporters after his speech , Salazar said he would wait to decide whether to commission new seismic studies until after he convened a four - stop series of offshore energy hearings , which begin next week in Atlantic City , N.J. In San Francisco , a hearing will be held April 16 at 9 a.m. at the Mission Bay Conference Center at UC San Francisco .

Drilling advocates say updated estimates could show even more offshore oil potential .
In contrast , Salazar said he expected a push to expedite offshore wind development to be one of the most significant aspects at the hearings .
He pledged to finalize guidelines for such development , which the Bush administration failed to complete before leaving office , within about two months .

The Gestapo's list of torture techniques that fit into their " enhanced interrogation program " - a torture regime designed to avoid too - obvious or incriminating physical scars :
Bush and Cheney were , in fact , more brutal in their " enhanced interrogation " than the Gestapo was .
And note that I am not engaging in the slightest hyperbole here .
I 'm not saying that the US is Nazi Germany in any way .
I am saying that the torture program used by Bush and Cheney follows exactly the specific methods used by the Gestapo .
This is not in any historical dispute , although the irony of using the exact same phrase for the exact same methods is one reason the Bushies dropped the term .
We also have a very specific legal precedent .
When the US captured officials who had done to prisoners exactly what the last president did , the US prosecuted them , found them guilty and executed them .
The price Cheney pays is a fawning interview on CNN .
That 's who we are .
That 's what we 've become .

Does Darwin ’s theory of evolution apply to video games ?
This is just a fun photo montage showing how the characters of Mario , Link , and Donkey Kong have evolved over the years in video games .
From the early days of an 8 - bit Atari or Nintendo , to the current super systems on the market :
Once upon a time , real men really did n't eat quiche .
They did eat prodigious amounts of meat and potatoes : marbled steaks and juicy hamburgers , thick chops and slabs of roast beef – and many still do , despite health risks .
Great big hunks of bloody flesh , however , have never made most women salivate .
Salads with a slice of quiche or slivers of chicken are more appealing .
Or maybe a bowl of fruit .
U.S. research shows men prefer meat and protein while women are 22 times more likely to choose chocolate .
The difference was far less in Spain – leading researchers to believe the craving for chocolate is actually cultural .
But in both countries , 60 per cent of men craved meaty or salty foods while 60 per cent of women craved sweets .
And many more women than men simply do n't eat any meat at all .
Statistics show there are about three female vegetarians to every two males .
( In the Vegetarian Times some years ago , the president of the North American Vegetarian Society complained that she could n't find a potential mate who did n't eat meat . )
Man ( but not woman ) as meat - eater was the subject of a book published in 1990 .
The Sexual Politics of Meat by Carol Adams was promoted as " a detailed examination of male dominance and meat - eating . "
The tendency for men to be into meat and women vegetables begins in childhood .
Results of a 2004 study of more than 1,200 schoolchildren published in the British Journal of Nutrition found " girls liked fruit and vegetables more than boys did .
Boys like ... meat , processed meat products and eggs more than girls " – as well as sugary , fatty foods .
Nutritional needs may play a role in these preferences – menstruation , pregnancy , lactation all affect appetite and impose nutritional requirements .
But mostly , the differences are attributed to sociological and psychological factors .
Judith Wurtman , director of the Program in Women 's Health at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Clinical Research Center , explains that women naturally have only two - thirds as much serotonin , a key neurotransmitter , as men .
This means women are more susceptible to fluctuations that affect mood , appetite and behaviour .
Carbohydrates , which women crave , provide the body with amino acid L - tryptophan from which serotonin is synthesized .
Women who go on carb - free diets , says Wurtman , suffer from " Atkins attitude " – irritability and bad mood – sooner and more seriously than men .
It 's also been suggested that more women are vegetarians because they are more compassionate .
That 's the other side of the quiche - eating theory : real men do n't eat quiche , real women do n't eat flesh .
But research also shows women are more health - conscious .
Not so keen about meat to begin with , once they become aware of the positive effects of fruits and vegetables and the negative effects of meat , giving up meat is n't difficult .
Different expectations for each gender , as well as self - image , play a large role in eating behaviour and attitudes to food .
In the Health Psychology journal , psychiatrists from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine wrote that women eat the way they do , and differently from men , because women " experience more dissatisfaction with their body weight and shape than men do ... pressures to be thin are present in early adolescence , as noted by dieting behaviour starting in very young girls . "
In other words , even if these girls do prefer the same fatty , sugary foods boys admit to liking – say , a double - chocolate doughnut or half - pint of ice cream – they either wo n't admit it or they 'll avoid those foods .
A couple of years ago , Harvard University held a conference called " Women , Men and Food : Putting Gender on the Table . "
Panel discussions took place on everything from production to preparation to consumption .

One revealing demonstration of these gender differences is a University of Illinois study of eating behaviour in a social setting .
Lead researcher Kristen Harrison found that " men who are insecure about their bodies eat more in front of other men , while women who are insecure about their bodies eat less in front of other women . "
A man with an " actual body vs. ideal body self - discrepancy , " she says , " may be moved to eat even when he is not hungry , just to reassure himself and other men that he is sufficiently masculine . "
It 's hard to imagine any woman eating just to reassure herself and other women that she 's sufficiently feminine .
On the other hand , it 's hard to imagine any man , no matter what his " self - discrepancy " issues , craving chocolate , white bread , pastries and noodles only at certain times of the month .
These food cravings , according to a feminist women 's health website ( fwhc.org ) , may be caused by increased responsiveness to insulin before menstruation .
MIT 's Wurtman suggests the menstruating female craves carbohydrates to supply more serotonin to the body to counteract PMS .

BBC News , Jerusalem
The road to the outpost is being built on privately owned Palestinian land
An unauthorised settlement in the West Bank , illegal even under Israeli law , appears to be benefiting from state funding , the BBC has uncovered .
A road is being built from the established settlement of Eli , near the Palestinian city of Nablus , leading east to the illegal outpost at Hayovel .
Settlement expansion is a major barrier to an Israeli - Palestinian peace deal .
The international community regards all settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law .
Israel disputes this , but even under Israeli law , those newer , smaller settlements - known as outposts - which have not received authorisation from the government are deemed , by the Israeli government , to be illegal .
Outpost promise Drive up the twisting , landscaped roads of Eli , a mid-sized settlement in the heart of the West Bank , and you come across a scene of intense construction activity .
Lorries , tractors , and graders are digging , laying and smoothing a new road , more than a kilometre long .
The road leads east to the outpost of Hayovel .
The road - building is not difficult to spot .
But outside observers are not welcome .
The BBC was asked , twice , to leave the settlement , when we drew too close to the site of the road .
Since the publication of a government - commissioned report into outposts , four years ago , they were supposed not to receive any further support from the authorities .
Indeed , the outgoing Israeli government promised to start dismantling the existing outposts .
That did not happen .
Late last year , however , after an increase in violence from a minority of settlers , aimed at Israeli security forces , the cabinet announced an absolute cut - off in all public funding to the outposts .
The new road suggests that the reality is otherwise .
' Security measure ' A 10 - minute drive away , from Eli , four Palestinian villagers are clambering their way around an earth mound which is blocking their route by car .
The mound has been placed by the Israeli army for , it says , security reasons .
For Abdel Nasser , a civil servant with a job in Ramallah , there is a double bind .
Not only is his journey to work almost double the length it used to be - 43 rather than 22 kilometres .
But , as he shows on a map , the new road to the outpost carves straight through land which he says is owned by his village , Qaryut .
" The settlers took this land , " he says , " maybe 5,000 dunams ( 500 hectares ) .
They opened the road between Eli and Hayovel one month ago .
It 's private land , owned by our people . "
Enlarge Image
On his map , the road is marked by a red line .
It cuts directly through a patch of green land .
The significance of that colour is that it is the shading the Israeli authorities themselves use to indicate land which they regard as privately owned by Palestinians .
Mr Nasser says that neither he nor anyone else in his village has sold the land , or received a military seizure order .
The BBC asked the relevant government and military departments why this road was being built on what their own map indicates is privately owned Palestinian land ; and how this road tallied with the government policy of no public funding going towards outposts .
No -one was able to provide the BBC with an answer .
However , in a fax to the Israeli human rights group , Yesh Din , which has been investigating the issue of the road on behalf of the Palestinian villagers , an official from Israel 's Civil Administration said that the matter was now in the hands of " inspectors " .
Abdul Nasser says his journey to work has almost doubled For Dror Etkes , the veteran investigator who works for Yesh Din , the answer is simple enough .
The reason for the road - building , he says , is because of the " tragic " gap between what the government says and what it does .
" The Israeli government is simply not willing to take the most basic responsibilty - which is to enforce the law .
Historically , they have always preferred to allow the settlers to do whatever they want , in order to prevent unwanted confrontation with Israeli citizens living in the West Bank , " Mr Etkes said .
All this has been happening under a government which is publically committed to the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state , in the West Bank .
The future Israeli government , which is likely to come into office next week , will be led by a man , Binyamin Netanyahu , who sees no such need .
President Barack Obama may have reiterated , this week , his determination to see a Palestinian state .
That goal will not depend on Israel alone .
But , as it is , the momentum on the ground appears to be swinging the other way .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Mortgage modifications have a bad rap , yet President Obama is depending on them to stop the foreclosure crisis .
Modifications continue to be pushed as the best way to get struggling borrowers back on their feet .
The jury is out on whether modifications work long - term .
One recent study showed about half of borrowers with modified loans fell behind within six months .
Still , Obama is giving modifications a central role in his $ 75 billion foreclosure prevention program .
The program , which starts on Wednesday , calls for loan servicers to lower struggling borrowers ' interest rates so that total payments are no more than 31 % of their gross income .
The government will subsidize part of the reduction , as well as kick in incentives for the servicers , borrowers and mortgage investors to participate in the modifications .
( See " Do you qualify ? " )
The program is getting mixed reviews .
Industry experts applaud the president 's emphasis on making payments affordable , a criteria made popular last year by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief Sheila Bair .
But , they say , the plan will fall short without a stronger push to reduce loan balances for those who owe more than their homes are worth and without a better plan for those deep in all kinds of debt .
Modification problems
Servicers are increasingly turning to modifications as the foreclosure crisis escalates .
They have modified about 1.3 million loans between July 2007 and January 2009 , according to statistics released Tuesday by Hope Now , an alliance of the mortgage industry and housing counselors .
The efforts - which usually involve adjusting interest rates , loan length or principal balance - have been largely voluntary and uncoordinated .
In recent months , modifications have come under attack as a mere short - term fix .
In December , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency added fuel to that fire by reporting that more than half of borrowers with loans adjusted in the first half of 2008 were behind in their payments six months later .
The Hope Now survey shows that between 30 % and 40 % of modifications had re-defaulted within six months .
But many modification supporters said reports of redefaults do n't take into account how loans were modified .
Until recently , the adjustments often entailed increasing the monthly payments to make up for the arrears .
Some 34 % of mortgages modified in November resulted in a higher payment , while another 17 % had no change in payment , said Alan White , a law professor at Valparaiso University .
More than nine of 10 voluntary modifications in 2008 involved no cancellation of principal , past - due interest , late fees or expenses .
" The redefault problem has resulted in criticism of the very idea of modifying mortgage loans , " White wrote in a January report .
" On the other hand , there is considerable evidence that more aggressive modifications , especially those that reduce the principal debt , are much less subject to high rates of redefault . "
In recent months , however , more servicers have focused on adjusting borrowers ' payments to an affordable level , usually between 31 % and 38 % of a borrower 's gross monthly income .
Housing advocates , as well as industry officials , hope this will increase modifications ' success rate .
" Affordability makes sense , " said Faith Schwartz , Hope Now 's executive director .
" It 's certain a key factor in why modifications will work even better . "
It 's too early to tell how well this new breed of modifications will perform .
But an October Credit Suisse study showed that only 15 % of interest - rate modifications and 23 % of principal - reduction modifications made at the end of 2007 were delinquent eight months later , compared to 44 % of adjustments that resulted in higher payments .
" Lots of modifications have not been done with a rigorous ability - to - pay criteria .
As evidence of that , we see the high redefault rates , " said Rod Dubitsky , head of asset - backed securities research at Credit Suisse .
" Modifications that more carefully consider ability to pay should have a lower redefault rate . "
Advocates also take heart in the relative success rate of servicers who have long focused on affordability .
Take Ocwen Financial Corp .
The servicer boasts of a 19.4 % redefault rate , less than half the industry average .
The West Palm Beach , Fla . - based firm says most of its borrowers remain current because of its customized approach to modifications .
Ocwen looks at borrowers ' income and expenses and comes up with a payment plan that the homeowner can afford long - term .
The company says it has prevented more than 90,000 foreclosures since the mortgage crisis began .
" If loan modifications are to have an enduring impact , the reduced mortgage payments must be sustainable by homeowners , " Ocwen Chief Executive William Erbey said in a hearing before Congress a week ago .
Controversial principal reductions
Unlike most servicers , Ocwen has embraced principal reductions .
Nearly 19 % of its loan modifications include writing down the mortgage balance .
This is an important step to achieving an affordable payment while still maximizing the payout for the mortgage investor , the company says .
Obama 's plan has come under fire for not doing more to encourage servicers to reduce loan balances , a step which would help borrowers who have seen their home values plummet .
The program does allow servicers to reduce principal , but makes interest rate adjustments the primary method for achieving affordable payments .
One in six homeowners are " underwater , " meaning they owe more on their mortgage than the house is worth , according to Zillow.com .
Though experts are divided in their opinion , many say that the foreclosure crisis wo n't be stemmed until something is done to help these borrowers - namely , principal reductions to bring the loan balance in line with the home 's current value .
" Equity in the home is a significant driver of default , " Dubitsky said .
Also , many borrowers are drowning in many types of debt , experts said .
So just adjusting their first mortgage , or lien , is not enough .
Ocwen , for instance , takes into account all of a borrower 's obligations when calculating an affordable monthly payment .
Debt loads beyond the mortgage are a big factor in a borrower 's ability to keep up with payments , Schwartz said .
" When you have unexpected medical expenses and a lot of credit card debt , you can have an affordable first lien , but still have someone who 's in trouble , " she said .
DAI NGHIA VIL­LAGE , Viet­nam – A house sits vacant off a dirt path in Dai An ham­let .
The con­crete home has a rust­ed cor­ru­gat­ed met­al roof , and attached to the build­ing is a small , open - air struc­ture stand­ing on wood sup­ports .
Its met­al roof is pock­marked with holes that allow sun­light to fil­ter in .
When asked what she would say to the American people , the mother of one UXO victim says , ‘ The American people should take responsibility .
...
These are the consequences of the American War . ’
Peo­ple in the ham­let hear mourn­ful cries when they near the home .
Down the same path , about 160 feet away , a small­er build­ing hous­es the fam­i­ly that once lived in the vacant home – but the fam­i­ly has one less son .
And there ’s cry­ing here , too : the sobs of a mother .
Across the street , on the front steps of a blue - tinged home sits a woman , with red eyes and a tear - streaked face , who is all but over­come with grief .
Her young son clings to her arm and he blots her eyes with the ban­dage that nor­mal­ly cov­ers his scarred neck .
This is life in Quang Nam Province in cen­tral Viet­nam .
Two fam­i­lies wrecked .
Two chil­dren dead .
Two phys­i­cal­ly wound­ed .
One psy­cho­log­i­cal­ly dam­aged .
All a result of a con­flict – known in this coun­try as the Amer­i­can War – that may have ​ “ offi­cial­ly ” end­ed in 1975 , but con­tin­ues to claim lives .
Bombs , not gold
In 2004 , Nguyen Huu Tien , 43 , and his wife , Tran Thi Dam , 37 , suf­fered what all par­ents fear : the loss of a child .
Their son Nguyen Huu Truong , 13 , ​“ was very gen­tle .
He usu­al­ly stayed at home , he did n’t hang out , ” says his mother .
He was on his way home from school one Feb­ru­ary day when he found a small , spher­i­cal met­al object lying in a field where a new cloth­ing fac­to­ry was being built .
He picked it up and brought it home .
Once there , he and his cousin , Vo Van Trieu , used tongs and a ham­mer to open it while a 6 ‑ year - old neigh­bor , Nguyen Vu Lan , looked on .
What they had was a bomblet from a clus­ter bomb unit ( CBU ) , a U.S. mil­i­tary sub­mu­ni­tion with hun­dreds of tiny ball bear­ings inside .
Lat­er that after­noon , a neigh­bor called Nguyen Huu Truong ’s par­ents Nguyen Huu Tien and Tran Thi Dam at the fish fac­to­ry where they worked .
The neigh­bor gave no details , say­ing only that a fam­i­ly emer­gency required them to come home right away , Tran says before burst­ing into tears .
Stand­ing at the spot of the explo­sion , neigh­bor Nguyen The Van , 54 , says he entered the room to find the table and chairs bro­ken and Vo – the cousin – lying on the floor with his intestines snaking out onto the ground .
Nguyen Huu Truong , how­ev­er , had born the brunt of the blast .
The front side of his body had been shredded .
Six - year - old Nguyen Vu Lan , who had been sit­ting just a short dis­tance away from the oth­ers , had a bro­ken jaw and wounds to his throat , abdomen and legs .
His injuries kept him in the hos­pi­tal for three months .
Since then , he has spent two months per year in var­i­ous med­ical facilities .
Today , the lanky 9 ‑year - old with a scarred jaw is sad­dled with res­pi­ra­to­ry prob­lems , speak­ing only a few words in a whis­pery croak .
He looks frail .
With the ban­dage removed from his throat , tiny bub­bles of flu­id appear from a small wound amid sur­round­ing scar tissue .
His moth­er , Nguyen Thi Thanh Son , 36 , brings out a stack of med­ical doc­u­ments as we sit on her front step .
The fam­i­ly receives sub­si­dized med­ical care , but even with this par­tial sup­port of his treat­ment , their bills are immense .
She says her son needs a med­ical pro­ce­dure for his throat that offi­cials in Hanoi ca n’t provide .
“ I want my son to go to the U.S. for an oper­a­tion to return his voice , ” she says .
Asked what she would say to the cit­i­zens of the Unit­ed States if she could , she says , ​“ The Amer­i­can peo­ple should take respon­si­bil­i­ty . …
They should act in a human­i­tar­i­an man­ner .
These are the con­se­quences of the Amer­i­can War . ”
Amer­i­can bombs , artillery shells , rock­ets , land­mines , grenades and oth­er types of unex­plod­ed ord­nance ( UXO ) lit­ter Viet­nam .
And an untold num­ber of bomblets are a par­tic­u­lar killer of chil­dren , not only in Viet­nam , but also in Laos and Cam­bo­dia , where the Unit­ed States waged war dur­ing the 1960s and ear­ly 1970s .
Bomblets from clus­ter bombs are some­times small and round like a ball , some­times bright­ly col­ored , some­times both .
They often look like toys .
But these boys thought they had found rich­es , not a play­thing .
Tran Thi Dam – one of the dead boys ’ moth­ers – says that a friend of her son ’s lat­er told them that Nguyen Huu Truong had heard there was gold inside the met­al sphere .
An orphan ’s song
Pham Thi Hoa ’s fam­i­ly suf­fered griev­ous­ly from the Amer­i­can War .
One set of great - grand­par­ents were killed when their ham­let was bombed in 1969 .
That same year , a great - aunt and three of her chil­dren were killed in the same fash­ion .
Their loss­es , how­ev­er , did not end with the war .
Some­time after 1975 , Pham ’s oth­er great - grand­fa­ther was killed by a land­mine .
A great - uncle suf­fered the same fate in 1996 .
But Pham – born long after the guns of that con­flict fell silent – should have been immune from the rav­ages of war .
Yet in late 2007 , the same war that claimed the lives of so many mem­bers of her fam­i­ly tore this 8 ‑ year - old ’s world apart .
Her father , Pham Van Nghia , 30 , was a farmer by trade .
Born and raised in Ham­let # 6 , in Duy Nghia vil­lage , he grew sta­ple crops of this region – rice , beans and sweet pota­toes .
He also sup­ple­ment­ed his income by detect­ing met­als and sell­ing them for scrap .
He had found artillery shells in the past and they pro­vid­ed mon­ey for his wife , Le Thi Tai , two daugh­ters and 3 ‑ year - old son , Pham Van Thanh .
From the met­al of a 105 mm artillery shell , Pham Van Nghia could make rough­ly 100,000 VND ( about $ 6.25 ) – a large sum in a coun­try where the per capi­ta income , accord­ing to the U.S. State Depart­ment , is about $ 2 per day .
At approx­i­mate­ly 4:15 p.m. on Aug. 21 , 2007 , Pham Van Nghia was in his home , attempt­ing to take a 105 mm artillery shell apart .
His son and wife were close by , his elder daugh­ter was sleep­ing in the back room and young Pham Thi Hoa was just across the nar­row path that runs in front of the home , play­ing in a large sandy expanse .
Moments lat­er , every­one but her sis­ter was dead .
Today , the two daugh­ters spend a great deal of their time at their grand­par­ents ’ house – only a two - minute walk from their par­ents ’ home .
Both attend school .
That ’s where the elder girl was when I vis­it­ed the fam­i­ly farm .
I had resolved to learn about the tragedy , after read­ing a 66 - word arti­cle about the death of three mem­bers of a fam­i­ly from UXO on the Aus­tralia Broad­cast­ing Corporation ’s web­site – one of the dis­heart­en­ing­ly fre­quent news pieces of this sort that fil­ter into the West­ern media each year .
The girls ’ grand­moth­er , Le Thi Huong , told me that soon after the explo­sion , a del­e­ga­tion from the S.O.S. Children ’s Vil­lage – a char­i­ta­ble enter­prise that cares for young­sters who have lost their par­ents to war , famine , dis­ease or pover­ty – arrived and offered to care for the chil­dren until age 18 .
This , how­ev­er , would have meant the girls would have to live rel­a­tive­ly far away .
The girls reject­ed the offer , pre­fer­ring to stay close to home , where they could ven­er­ate their parents .
“ I can take care of them and , one day , if I pass away , their aunts and uncles will do the same , ” Le Thi Huong says .
I could n’t bear to ask the 8 ‑ year - old with big brown eyes and an infec­tious smile any­thing about the tragedy that killed most of her imme­di­ate fam­i­ly .
She was led out of earshot while her grand­moth­er began relat­ing the bare facts of the grue­some sto­ry .
Talk of bod­ies sheared in half and a child reduced to a bas­ket­ful of viscera .
When Pham Thi Hoa ulti­mate­ly bound­ed back in , I ask about her favorite activ­i­ties .
Danc­ing and singing , she replies .
With a bit of famil­ial prompt­ing , she begins to sing a haunt­ing Viet­namese song in her tiny voice .
After the finale , and our lauda­to­ry clap­ping , I ask where she had learned that song .
Her response near­ly rips my heart out .
It was a folk song , I was told .
A song about orphans .
“ That ’s the song my father sang when he was alive , ” she says .
​ “ When I sing it , I remem­ber him . ”
Aid­ing and abating
The team from Project RENEW had a good day .
The 16 - mem­ber Viet­namese unit , over­seen by Aus­tralian explo­sive ord­nance dis­pos­al super­vi­sor Mark Fitz­patrick , locat­ed an M‑79 round – a 40 mm high - explo­sive pro­jec­tile fired from a breach - load­ing , sin­gle - shot U.S. grenade launch­er – in a field .
Ini­ti­at­ed in Decem­ber 2000 , as a coop­er­a­tive effort between the non­prof­it , U.S. - based Viet­nam Vet­er­ans Memo­r­i­al Fund and the Quang Tri Province People ’s Com­mit­tee , Project RENEW focus­es on UXO aware­ness edu­ca­tion , vic­tims ’ assis­tance and explo­sives removal .
This par­tic­u­lar Project RENEW clear­ance project is sup­port­ed by Gold­en West Human­i­tar­i­an Foun­da­tion – a U.S. non­prof­it char­i­ty with 10 years of expe­ri­ence in explo­sive ord­nance abate­ment projects in Ango­la , Azer­bai­jan , Cam­bo­dia , Iraq and Mozambique .
The site , in cen­tral Vietnam ’s Quang Tri Province , is slat­ed to become the home of a new vil­lage , com­plete with a fac­to­ry and oth­er com­mer­cial enti­ties , on an eight - hectare plot with an adjoin­ing 19 hectares set aside for res­i­den­tial liv­ing space .
But first , dead­ly explo­sives lying on , and just below , the sur­face must be cleared .
Since 1975 , when the war end­ed and the coun­try was uni­fied , sim­i­lar explo­sives have caused more than 100,000 casu­al­ties in Viet­nam accord­ing to the Viet­namese Defense Ministry ’s Tech­nol­o­gy Cen­tre for Bomb and Mine Dis­pos­al ( BOMI­CEN ) .
Stand­ing next to an innocu­ous - look­ing , egg - sized met­al object lying in the dirt next to us – with a 16 - foot ​ “ kill radius ” and the pow­er to destroy a car – I ask Fitz­patrick what it would take to set it off .
“ Pick it up , ” he says matter - of - factly .
After the final prepa­ra­tions for dis­pos­al are made , the Project RENEW crew vacates the area , leav­ing behind only team leader Nguyen Duc Hoa , who places the explo­sive charge for Fitz­patrick to det­o­nate from behind a met­al ship­ping container .
With that grenade gone , it ’s eight less ounces of UXO for Viet­namese civil­ians to wor­ry about .
That leaves only some­where between 350,000 and 800,000 tons to go , accord­ing to esti­mates by BOMICEN .
The Project RENEW team has been work­ing on this site for one week and this is already the sec­ond piece of ord­nance recov­ered ( the oth­er was a 2.75 - inch rock­et found close by ) .
Dur­ing an end - of - the - day pep talk , Fitz­patrick con­grat­u­lates the team and offers a case of Huda – a local beer brewed in Hue , the ancient cap­i­tal city – to the first man to find an actu­al bomb .
Nguyen Duc Hoa has all the incen­tive he needs , how­ev­er .
​ “ It ’s a new job for me , ” he con­fides , hav­ing worked in the field of explo­sives clear­ance for just six months .
​ “ If I can do this job well , I can help the local peo­ple here to avoid acci­dents , ” he says .
Acci­dents , like unex­plod­ed ord­nance , have been plen­ti­ful here .
Tran Van
Thanh , a Trieu Phong Dis­trict offi­cial , esti­mates that approx­i­mate­ly 1,300 peo­ple have been killed , in his dis­trict alone , from UXO since 1975 .
For the rest of Quang Tri Province – which saw some of the heav­i­est bomb­ing dur­ing the war – UXO has caused 6,760 casu­al­ties , accord­ing to a 2006 sur­vey by the Viet­namese Min­istry of Defense .
End­ing the casualties
BOMI­CEN esti­mates that it will take many years and tens of bil­lions of dol­lars to clear Viet­nam of all the UXO lit­ter­ing the coun­try .
Fitz­patrick , who has since moved on to work in Afghanistan , is even less optimistic .
“ My per­son­al view is that it is going to take an act of God to clear Viet­nam because of all the issues that are present with all the com­mit­tees and steer­ing boards , along with the fact that the Viet­namese want mon­ey from inter­na­tion­al donors but do not want to adhere to inter­na­tion­al stan­dards , ” he writes in an e‑mail .
But Chuck Searcy , a U.S. Viet­nam
War vet­er­an who has lived in the coun­try for almost 15 years and serves as the Viet­nam Vet­er­ans Memo­r­i­al Fund ’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Project RENEW , believes that it is doable in the near term .
“ With ade­quate fund­ing and inter­na­tion­al sup­port , a com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic plan and sol­id man­age­ment at all lev­els of the Viet­namese gov­ern­ment , and with des­ig­na­tion of this effort as a top pri­or­i­ty of the gov­ern­ment , Viet­nam could be cleaned up and made safe with­in the 10 - year dead­line set by the terms of the Clus­ter Muni­tions Treaty , ” says Searcy , refer­ring to the Con­ven­tion on Clus­ter Muni­tions , brought into effect last Decem­ber .
( Its 96 sig­na­to­ry coun­tries – which do not include the Unit­ed States or Viet­nam – pledged nev­er to use , pro­duce , sell or stock­pile clus­ter bombs and to clear all UXO with­in 10 years . )
Searcy , who empha­sizes that he lacks tech­ni­cal expe­ri­ence in UXO clear­ance , is , how­ev­er , an expert on the col­lab­o­ra­tions between the Viet­namese gov­ern­ment and inter­na­tion­al orga­ni­za­tions in regard to the UXO prob­lem .
He does n’t believe it will be easy to coor­di­nate the activ­i­ties of the Viet­namese mil­i­tary and all the non­govern­men­tal orga­ni­za­tions involved in com­bat­ing UXOs , keep cor­rup­tion out of the process or pre­vent the inter­na­tion­al NGOs from set­ting unre­al­is­tic stan­dards .
But he ’s hope­ful enough to think it ’s pos­si­ble in the not - too - dis­tant future .
“ If the nation­al cam­paign were focused on a 10 - year dead­line , and the entire spec­trum of tech­ni­cal ser­vices and human cap­i­tal were mobi­lized , ” Searcy says , ​ “ I think it is plau­si­ble that at the end of the decade Viet­nam could rea­son­ably claim to have most­ly cleaned up the coun­try and made it safe , or at least reduced the risk to a lev­el that would be man­age­able into the fore­see­able future . ”
Any future efforts will come too late for Nguyen Vu Lan and Pham Thi Hoa .
But , if some­thing like Searcy ’s pro­pos­al were to suc­ceed , their chil­dren could live in Viet­nam with many few­er new casu­al­ties of the Amer­i­can War .
The boy is understood to have sent a message via the site on Wednesday
A British teenager who took a drugs overdose has been saved after the American girl he was chatting to online raised the alarm .
The 16 - year - old boy from Oxfordshire had sent her a message suggesting he intended to commit suicide .
Although she did not know where he lived , calls via the White House and the British Embassy enabled Abingdon police to save the boy 's life .
The boy , who has not been named , made a full recovery after hospital treatment .
Still conscious
It is believed that he was using the social networking site late on Wednesday night and sent a private message to a girl in Maryland saying that he was going to harm himself .
She told her mother , who called local police .
The police called a " special agent " at the White House , the British Embassy in Washington and finally the police control room in Abingdon .
Staff narrowed down his location to eight possible addresses , and officers found the teenager at the fourth house they tried .
He had taken an overdose , but was still conscious .
Barack Obama speaks , and the world listens – more intently , at this point , than it does to the actual president of the United States .
President - elect Obama can inspire and alarm , calm markets or add to jitters .
And with the nation in economic crisis , he seems keenly aware of that .
Obama has made clear that addressing the economy is his top priority .
In his first press conference since the election , he urged Congress to pass an economic stimulus package , and if it failed ( or if President Bush failed to sign it ) , he would push for that as soon as he took office .
But he is avoiding doing anything now , either as a sitting senator or as president - elect , that would give him ownership of decisions made between now and Inauguration Day .
Obama will not attend the G - 20 meeting on Nov. 15 , a summit of world leaders to be convened in Washington for crisis economic talks .
When the Obamas make the customary visit to the White House on Monday , for a tour with the Bushes , Obama has indicated he also expects “ a substantive conversation ” with the outgoing president .
But the mantra of Obama ’s transition is clear :
There ’s only one US president at a time .
Still , Obama already enjoys an important tool of the presidency : the bully pulpit .
For now , “ that ’s the one power he has , to inspire and reassure , ” says Paul Light , an expert on presidential transitions at New York University .
In general , “ presidents - elect need to be careful about not usurping the president ’s authority , ” he adds .
“ Moreover , they need to worry about getting entangled in the outgoing president ’s policies .... [ Obama ] could get easily entrapped into policy choices and positions that will haunt him well into the following year . ”
Already , though , Obama and Vice President - elect Joseph Biden have been planning for a possible transition since long before Election Day .
The Democratic ticket has been receiving national - security briefings , and , since Nov. 4 , they are getting the same briefing Bush gets .
Obama ’s transition team began work in early August , according to transition co-chair John Podesta .
On Sunday , Mr. Podesta said on Fox News that 100 people now have security clearance so they ’re able to be briefed at the relevant agencies on national security , under legislation passed in 2004 .
On the transition in economic policy , Podesta said , Obama has designated Georgetown professor Daniel Tarullo as one of his senior economic advisers to be fully briefed on what ’s happening at the Treasury Department with the $ 700 billion bailout package .
Mr. Tarullo has already been speaking with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and will meet with him on Monday , Podesta says .
More broadly , Podesta stressed that Obama intends to move quickly to fill top positions .
Already , Obama has named his chief of staff , top House Democrat Rep. Rahm Emanuel – a longtime friend from Chicago , experienced White House hand from his days in the Clinton administration , and famously abrasive political operative with a record of accomplishment .
Obama is under pressure , in particular , to name a Treasury secretary as soon as possible .
On Fox News Sunday , Podesta said , “ Across the board , whether it ’s national security ; the economy ; the senior leadership that will manage healthcare , energy , and the environment , [ Obama ] intends to move very quickly . ”
With the exception of the previous President Bush , Podesta noted , no new president has named a cabinet secretary before December , going back through the Kennedy administration .
“ I think we ’re moving aggressively to build out that core economic team , ” he said .
Mr. Emanuel , speaking Sunday on ABC ’s “ This Week , ” made news by reaffirming that Obama plans to make a middle - class tax cut a top priority after taking office .
That was a central campaign promise , but given the financial crisis – which spurred an expensive bailout of Wall Street , which in turn has caused a spike in the federal budget deficit – some questions had remained over whether Obama would stick with that plan .
Obama ’s plan “ at this juncture is based on giving 95 percent of working Americans a tax cut , ” Emanuel said .
“ Over the years , the middle class has been squeezed consistently by rising costs on education , healthcare , and energy , as well as a diminishing income , ” he said .
“ You must have an economic program that focuses on them . ”
The appointment of Emanuel raised eyebrows , given a brusque style that contrasts sharply with Obama ’s cool demeanor and a campaign known for its lack of drama .
Many observers say it portends a “ good cop , bad cop ” routine in the Obama White House .
And some raise concerns about his sharp partisan edge .
Emanuel ran the Democrats ’ successful effort in the 2006 election to retake control of the House , after 12 years in the minority .
But he has his Republican admirers .
“ I happen to think that Rahm is exceptionally well qualified for that job , ” said Ken Duberstein , who served as chief of staff under President Reagan , speaking at a Brookings Institution forum Friday on the transition .
“ He will run a White House staff that is very disciplined . ”
William Galston , who worked with Emanuel in the Clinton White House , spoke highly of his former colleague ’s skills .
“ Rahm is the most focused and persistent person I ’ve ever met in my life , and by appointing him , the president - elect has signaled his determination to have his decisions carried out crisply and accurately , ” Mr. Galston says .
“ Rahm , I think , will also be very good at riding herd on the jostling egos of the White House staff .
He ’s absolutely fearless , absolutely loyal to his leader . ”
BOSTON / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The wife of Bernard Madoff withdrew more than $ 15 million from an account linked to the accused swindler in the days before his arrest , Massachusetts authorities said on Wednesday , adding a new layer of intrigue to the probe of the purported $ 50 billion scam .

Ruth Madoff pulled out $ 10 million on December 10 , the day before her husband was arrested and charged with running a global investment fraud , and $ 5.5 million on November 25 , according to Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin .
The disclosure came in reports produced by Cohmad Securities Corp , a firm co-owned by Bernard Madoff that funneled millions of dollars from its clients to the financier .
Galvin ’s office filed a court complaint trying to suspend Cohmad ’s license as a broker in Massachusetts .
Galvin , whose office has the power to bring civil but not criminal charges , did not accuse Ruth Madoff of any wrongdoing and the Cohmad documents did not provide any details on what she may have done with the withdrawn funds .
The withdrawals were mentioned in a footnote in Galvin ’s 39 - page complaint .
The $ 10 million withdrawal on December 10 matches the amount Bernard Madoff was required to post in bond as a condition of his release on bail on December 11 .
Ruth Madoff is also paying for private security to monitor her husband , one of the terms of his house arrest at their Manhattan penthouse .
“ The immediate leap you make is to allege that Mrs. Madoff was on notice and knew something was going down , ” said Brenda Sharton , a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter who is working on Madoff - related litigation .
“ But all the facts have not come to light yet and we do n’t know the purpose for which she withdrew the money . ”
Lawyers for the Madoffs could not immediately be reached .
The U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Manhattan bought more time to probe the Madoff case on Wednesday , with the government and defense lawyers agreeing to extend for 30 days a deadline to bring an indictment or secure a guilty plea .
A preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 13 .
Bernard Madoff , 70 , is the only person charged so far in the alleged scam that has hit banks , charities , wealthy investors and celebrities worldwide .
Authorities say he has told them he acted alone .
Legal experts , however , have said they are skeptical that such a massive fraud could have been pulled off by one person .
“ This thing is still unfolding and the players still need to be identified , ” said Howard Kleinhendler , an attorney for Madoff investors .
“ The notion that Madoff was a one - man show acting alone just does n’t withstand scrutiny . ”
Federal prosecutors , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , various state authorities and a court - appointed trustee liquidating the Madoff firm are all investigating .
Galvin said that , for years , Cohmad Securities received monthly payments from Madoff -- totaling $ 67 million and comprising the bulk of the firm ’s total income -- for “ professional services , ” “ brokerage services ” and “ fees for account supervision . ”
Cohmad is short for the names Cohn and Madoff .
Maurice Cohn , a long - time Madoff friend and business partner , owns at least 75 percent of Cohmad , while Madoff owns between 10 percent and 25 percent , Galvin ’s office said .
Galvin said in his complaint that Cohmad had largely refused to cooperate with his office ’s request for information about its activities and those of top Cohmad executive Robert Jaffe , a long - time Madoff friend .
He said Jaffe engaged in a series of “ delay tactics ” to avoid giving testimony and that when he did appear on February 4 , he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights not to answer any questions regarding his business .
Jaffe lawyer Stanley Arkin said his client was a victim of Madoff ’s purported fraud and had no knowledge of the scheme , according to a statement from Jaffe ’s spokesman .
The statement said Jaffe did not have adequate time to prepare to testify , which is why he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights .
The complaint also said Cohmad paid money to Sonja Kohn , who founded Austria ’s Bank Medici and had close ties to Madoff .
Bank Medici has said it was one of the biggest victims of the purported Madoff fraud .
MORE TIME
Madoff , a former Nasdaq stock market chairman , is accused of running a long - standing Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay withdrawals of earlier ones .
In court papers announcing the 30 - day continuance of the criminal case , Assistant U.S. Attorney Marc Litt wrote that prosecutors and Madoff ’s lawyer , Ira Sorkin , have had talks about a “ possible disposition of the defendant ’s case and the parties plan to continue those discussions . ”
A similar extension in the case was granted in January .
An indictment is a necessary step if Madoff is ever to stand trial on criminal fraud charges .
Ruth Madoff , the co-author of a kosher cookbook , has drawn attention from prosecutors who tried unsuccessfully to have her husband ’s bail revoked .
They said the couple sent more than $ 1 million in valuables to relatives and friends in violation of a court order .
Other people and firms under scrutiny include hedge funds and other investment managers who recommended Madoff to clients over the years .
Among them is Ezra Merkin , who is being probed by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo over his role in placing client money with Madoff .
A Cuomo official told Reuters Merkin is being cooperative with the investigation .
Cuomo told reporters earlier on Wednesday that the probe was “ ongoing , ” but did not provide details .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Goldman Sachs Group rejected overtures from American International Group to settle trades with the troubled insurer at a discount , instead holding the company to the letter of its contracts , the investment bank 's chief financial officer said Friday .
CFO David Viniar also said that Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein had no meetings with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson about AIG .
Goldman GS , +1.57 % and other large firms that were counterparties to AIG AIG , +1.31 % have come under criticism in recent weeks because a lot of the government money that was initially loaned to the insurer was paid back out to these trading partners .
See full story .
AIG almost collapsed in September after credit rating downgrades made it impossible for the insurer to meet obligations on derivative - based contracts it had sold to protect against losses on complex mortgage - related securities known as collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs .
The government gave AIG an emergency $ 85 billion loan and the bailout has since ballooned to more than $ 170 billion .
Goldman was one of AIG 's largest counterparties partly because it had purchased protection against losses on CDOs from the insurer .
Speaking on a conference call with reporters Friday , Viniar said that Goldman began to significantly mark down its Super Senior CDO risk in July 2007 , resulting in valuation disputes with AIG .
The investment bank demanded that the insurer post more and more collateral over the following year .
" Over subsequent weeks and months , we continued to make calls as the market deteriorated , " he added .
Viniar was asked if Goldman Sachs felt any guilt about its possible contribution to AIG 's collapse .
" All we did was call for what was due to us under the contracts .
So you know , I do n't think there 's any guilt whatsoever , " he said .
“ ' We do n't think we did anything wrong .
We had commercial terms .
It is our responsibility to our shareholders to make sure that we are protecting ourselves .
That 's why we enter into these contracts . ' ” — Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar
" We do n't think we did anything wrong , " Viniar continued , explaining that " we had commercial terms .
It is our responsibility to our shareholders to make sure that we are protecting ourselves .
That 's why we enter into these contracts .
That 's why we have terms in the first place , to make sure that we are protected . "
As part of that protection , Goldman also apparently made trades that allowed it to profit from deterioration in AIG 's financial strength -- likely based on those collateral calls .
Viniar acknowledged Friday that Goldman profited from AIG 's woes .
When asked if the firm made gains over the course of AIG 's deterioration , he said : " Net - net , I would think we had a gain over the time .
I do n't think it was particularly material to Goldman Sachs .
But net - net , I think we had a gain .
I think that gain probably somewhat more than offset the bid - offer spread that we had to pay to put the CDS hedges on . "
No Paulson meetings
Goldman 's involvement with AIG has been scrutinized more than other firms , partly because Paulson ran the investment bank before he became Treasury Secretary .
The New York Times and other news organizations have reported that Blankfein , Goldman 's current CEO , met with regulators including Paulson in early September to discuss troubles at Lehman Brothers LEHMQ and AIG .
Bloomberg News reported that Blankfein was the only chief executive at a meeting Sept. 15 at the New York Federal Reserve Bank at which the troubles at AIG were discussed , although representatives of other firms were present .
Bloomberg cited an unidentified Federal Reserve spokesman .
However , on Friday , Viniar said Blankfein and Paulson never met to discuss AIG .
" As far as I know , there were no meetings with Lloyd and Hank Paulson , " Viniar said , according to a transcript of the conference call .
" I think Lloyd has said that .
So that 's what I would say . "
Later on in the conference call , Viniar was asked whether Goldman contributed anything to how AIG was rescued or restructured .
Viniar said , " no . "
No significant economic exposure
Viniar also stressed that Goldman was and remains protected .
He added that the firm would not have lost money from specific derivatives contracts with AIG had the insurer failed , rather than being rescued by the government .
" We have stated consistently that Goldman Sachs did not have a significant economic exposure to AIG .
AIG 's disclosure of cash flows to counterparties does not in any way contradict that statement , " Viniar told reporters .
" We had commercial contracts with AIG .
We entered into these contracts on commercial terms .
We were fully hedged with either credit default swaps or collateral , so we were not in a position to take a loss , " Viniar said .
He noted that Goldman continues to hold a bit more than $ 4 billion in collateral , supporting a roughly $ 6 billion open trading position with AIG .
THE HAGUE ( Reuters ) - Iran offered help in combating the Afghan drugs trade on Tuesday , in a gesture to a U.S. call for regional support in Afghanistan that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described as promising .
Iran ’s Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Mehdi Akhoundzadeh told an international meeting on Afghanistan in The Hague that Tehran was ready to help both in fighting the country ’s huge opium trade and in reconstruction of the impoverished state .
Clinton , in The Hague to seek broad support for a revamped strategy unveiled by President Barack Obama to tackle Islamist militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan , welcomed the gesture by Tehran that will be closely watched for any follow - up .
“ I did think that the Iranian intervention this morning was promising , ” she told reporters of Akhoundzadeh ’s speech .
While Clinton did not hold discussions with the Iranian delegation , she said U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke had what she called brief and cordial contacts with Akhoundzadeh on the meeting sidelines .
“ It did not focus on anything substantive .
It was cordial ; it was unplanned and they agreed to stay in touch . ”
The United States gave a letter to Tehran asking for “ humanitarian help ” for three Americans who were unable to return to the United States , Clinton said .
Iran however played down the encounter , saying no meeting had taken place .
Nearly eight years after the U.S. - led invasion to topple the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan , more than 70,000 U.S. and NATO troops are still there battling a growing insurgency , which is also spreading its influence in Pakistan .
In one of several shifts of emphasis by Obama from the former Bush administration ’s Afghan policy , Clinton proposed a possible truce with non-violent Taliban .
“ They should be offered an honorable form of reconciliation and reintegration into a peaceful society , if they are willing to abandon violence , break with al Qaeda , and support the constitution , ” Clinton said .
Afghan President Hamid Karzai insisted his government should lead conciliation efforts .
But he welcomed Obama ’s new stress on a regional approach and what he called his “ fresh , strong and judicious leadership ” of international efforts in Afghanistan .
HELP FROM NEIGHBORS
Clinton had played down any major overtures with Iran at the meeting in The Hague and said beforehand she had no plans for a separate meeting with its deputy foreign minister .
But the joint presence of the U.S. and Iranian delegations was an easing of U.S. policy which has long stuck to a stand - off over Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Akhoundzadeh nonetheless reaffirmed Iran ’s opposition to the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan , which has left it facing a U.S. military presence there and in neighboring Iraq .
But he added : “ Iran is fully prepared to participate in the projects aimed at combating drug trafficking and the plans in line with developing and reconstructing Afghanistan . ”

Pakistan ’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi welcomed the Iranian presence as a “ first step in the right direction . ”
“ They have an interest in a stable , peaceful Afghanistan like we do , ” he told reporters .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also signaled a greater readiness by Moscow to help reconstruct Afghanistan .
“ We need to combine the antiterrorist measures with the socio- economic measures to rebuild Afghanistan and in future Russia is quite ready to participate in that effort , ” he said .

The Pakistani Taliban said on Tuesday they had carried out an attack which killed eight cadets in a police academy in the Pakistani city of Lahore .
It was the second attack in Lahore this month after gunmen targeted the Sri Lankan cricket team , underscoring how far the insurgency is spreading into the heartland of Pakistan .
In Washington , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said Pakistan should prove its commitment to fighting militancy before getting more U.S. aid , and said the United States should not rely on Pakistan for help in the Afghan war .
“ I do n’t have a lot of confidence that the Pakistani government has the will or the capability to take on the violence , ” the Democrat told reporters .
Since taking office in January , Obama has ordered 17,000 extra U.S. troops to Afghanistan to tackle violence ahead of elections , and a further 4,000 to help train the army .
The new U.S. administration has said it will end the megaphone diplomacy used by Washington in the Bush years to cajole more troops out of often reluctant allies , but is urging them to commit more aid and civilian support .
However the Dutch hosts had always played down prospects of major new troop or aid offers at the hastily - convened conference , stressing the aim was more to brainstorm on policy .
The final statement issued after the meeting echoed the thrust of the new Obama policy , referring to the need to step up training of Afghan security forces and “ eliminate sanctuaries for al Qaeda and other terrorist networks in the region . ”
German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier , whose country came under most pressure to step up its contribution to the counter - insurgency effort , reaffirmed a German offer of 600 troops to help secure Afghan elections in August .
“ President Obama has introduced a new focus , one that we welcome very much , ” he told reporters .
Mr Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003
A judge has upheld the Canadian government 's decision to ban British MP George Galloway from entering the country to conduct a speaking tour .
Mr Galloway instead addressed a Toronto audience by video message and said he will complete his tour in the same way .
Officials had barred the Respect party leader , claiming he spoke of providing financial support to Palestinian group Hamas , which is banned in Canada .
The MP said he had given aid to people in Gaza and was not a security threat .
The Canadian government ruled otherwise on the basis that he donated cash to Hamas .
Mr Galloway , the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow in London , described the ban as " idiotic " and vowed to challenge the decision .
I am not a supporter of Hamas but I am a supporter of democracy
George Galloway
But Federal Court judge Luc Martineau ruled there were insufficient grounds to overrule the Canadian Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) .
" A proper factual record and the benefit of full legal argument " were lacking to warrant overturning the CBSA decision , the judge said .
Mr Galloway delivered a speech to a reported 600 - strong audience in a Toronto church from a studio in New York .
In it he denied any suggestion that he supported terrorism .
" I am not a supporter of Hamas but I am a supporter of democracy , " he said .
He is expected to deliver video speeches to audiences Mississauga , Ontario , Montreal and Ottawa this week .
The MP was expelled by Labour in 2003 because of his outspoken comments on the Iraq war , which party chairman Ian McCartney said " incited foreign forces to rise up against British troops " .
In 2006 , he was detained " on grounds of national security " at Cairo airport , Egypt , after trying to attend a " mock trial " of then PM Tony Blair and then US President George Bush .
Welcome to the Concession Stand
Welcome to a new feature here on Premium Hollywood …and , believe me , it ’s one I ’ve been wanting to premiere for quite some time .
I ’m someone who enjoys trying new foods and new beverages , and I ’ve often thought it would be fun to write a column which gave me the opportunity to write about the experience .
Unfortunately , I ’m forever buried in DVDs that need to be reviewed .
Finally , I had an epiphany : why do n’t I figure out a way to combine the two ?
And , thus , “ Concession Stand ” was born .
The beverage : Mountain Dew Voltage .
Last year , over a quarter million votes helped Voltage win the so - called “ DEWmocracy ” election , with the taste , name and color of the product all developed by the customers themselves … well , y’know , with a little help from the folks at PepsiCo .
( What , like they ’re gonna give the yokels all the power ? )
As the bottle proudly trumpets , it ’s your standard Dew brew , but charged with raspberry citrus flavor and ginseng .
The color of the beverage is a slightly disconcerting shade of blue , but the raspberry mixes with the traditional Dew flavor rather well , making the taste not so far removed from a Sweet Tart .
If it ’s icy cold , it goes down fast and smooth … which is good , since it ’s so sweet that drinking it slowly may result in you taking awhile to finish the bottle , but caffeine fiends with a sweet tooth will have no problem chugging it down to score the inevitable rush .
When I was pitched the opportunity to check out Voltage , they sent me three bottles of the stuff , so I scoured my to - be - reviewed pile to see if I had three DVDs featuring the same person in some role or other .
Lo and behold , I did …and that person ’s name was Lea Thompson .
Bottle # 1 : Exit Speed .
You know , in retrospect , I made a poor decision when I decided to lead with this straight - to - DVD flick because I thought it was going to be the hardest one to get through and therefore would require the initial , most powerful surge of caffeine from the Voltage .
Okay , technically , it still held that honor , but “ Exit Speed ” played like a lost ’ 70s drive - in classic and made for a way more entertaining viewing experience than I ’d intended .
Thompson is one of the ten folks – others include Alice Greczyn ( “ Privileged ” ) , Desmond Harrington ( “ Dexter ” ) , and David Rees Snell ( “ The Shield ” ) – who are traveling by bus on Christmas Eve when their vehicle encounters a motorcycle gang who taunts them mercilessly … right up until one of the bikers ends up being run over by the bus .
D’oh !
As you can imagine , his buddies do n’t take well to the demise of one their members , and they chase the bus to an abandoned scrapyard , where the passengers are forced to battle for their lives .
Oh , make no mistake , it ’s not high art , but I think writer Michael Stokes knows that ; then again , he did write “ Iron Eagle IV , ” so I could be wrong .
But given that Fred Ward ’s character spends virtually the entire movie trying to catch up to the bus ( you ’ll laugh at how many times they cut back to shots of Ward , who ’s always driving fast and furiously ) , I ’m pretty sure “ Exit Speed ” is intentionally harking back to the days when films did n’t have to be good , they only had to keep moving quickly enough that you did n’t get bored .
Bottle # 2 : Howard the Duck : Special Edition .
Boy , the caffeine ’s really kicking in now .
I also did n’t factor in the fact that I was starting with the shortest film .
It ’s only been 88 minutes since I started my first Voltage , and now I ’m moving onto my second … and starting to twitch a little bit , frankly .
I guess that ’s only appropriate , since the idea of watching “ Howard the Duck ” would make a lot of people twitch .
Not me , though .
I ’m one of the few people who actually liked the flick .
I even saw it on opening night , and although it definitely did n’t come anywhere near approaching the original Steve Gerber source material , I still thought it was a lot of fun .
With that said , however , I ’m a little more creeped out nowadays about the whole girl - on - duck love story , and you ca n’t help but wonder how much better the film would ’ve been if they ’d just waited a few years and had Howard CGI ’ed into the movie rather than having him played by a midget in a duck suit .
Thankfully , Ms. Thompson is so smoking hot here that you can forgive a lot of the film ’s flaws ; there ’s also the bonus of seeing a young Tim Robbins as an overly excitable janitor with doctoral aspirations , Jeffrey Jones taking it over the top as an alien - possessed scientist , and , of course , the Thomas Dolby soundtrack .
The best bit for the “ Howard ” fans out there …and I know damned well I ’m not the only one in existence …is the inclusion of a surprising amount of bonus material .
The descriptor of “ special edition ” does n’t always mean you ’re going to get a plethora of stuff , but it does here .
There are two new featurettes : “ A Look Back at ‘ Howard the Duck , ' ” featuring new interviews with the cast and crew , and “ Releasing The Duck , ” which takes a surprisingly forthright look at how the film was received and how it ’s turned into a cult phenomenon .
They ’ve also included four featurettes made during the film ’s original release : “ News Featurette , ” “ The Stunts of ‘ Howard the Duck , ' ” “ The Special Effects of ‘ Howard the Duck , ' ” and “ The Music of ‘ Howard the Duck . ' ”
You know , maybe it ’s just the Voltage talking , but this thing is awesome !*
* In retrospect , it was almost certainly the Voltage talking .
But it ’s still pretty cool .
Bottle # 3 : Caroline in the City : Season 2
It ’s really late , and I ’m so caffeinated and sugared up that I think I ’m pretty sure starting to hear the electric colors , so this probably would ’ve been my last Voltage for the night even I did have more than these three bottles on hand .
( It ’s tasty enough , but it ’s not something I ’d normally drink more than one of in a sitting . )
Even as wired as I am , however , I still ca n’t really call myself excited about watching “ Caroline in the City : Season 2 , ” and I ’m sure as hell not going to be watching all 25 episodes from start to finish .
But I do pick out a few episodes based on their guest stars , and they ’re all quite pleasant : Phil Hartman turns up doing a Rod Serling impression in “ Caroline and the Letter , ” Judd Hirsch plays the father of the ever - snarky Richard ( Malcolm Gets ) , and I have to admit that David Hyde Pierce ’s role as an IRS auditor who desperately wants to be in the cast of “ Cats ” is downright hilarious .
It ’s light comedy , sure , but the “ Caroline ” ensemble works well together ; Thompson ’s cute , I ’d forgotten how great Gets ’s delivery was , and , man , Amy Pietz – who plays Caroline ’s rather easy friend and neighbor , Annie – is smoking hot .
Not necessarily a TV classic , and I probably laughed a little bit harder because of the excess caffeine in my system , but you can see why it lasted longer ( 4 seasons ) than the average NBC sitcom of its era .
Shame they could n’t pony up for any special features , though .
Final Verdict :
* Mountain Dew Voltage is a sweet treat and a quick caffeine fix , but one bottle at a time will almost certainly be enough to do you .
* “ Exit Speed ” might not be worth buying , but if you catch it on TV , you might surprise yourself by getting sucked in .
* If you already admit to liking “ Howard the Duck , ” then you absolutely need to buy the special edition , since A ) the bonus material is pretty cool , and B ) you ’re already out of the closet , anyway , so you might as well .
* Only the diehard “ Caroline in the City ” fans will be rushing out to buy Season 2 on DVD , particularly in a bare - bones set like this one , but it ’s a pleasant comedic diversion .
After all , every ’90s sitcom ca n’t be “ Friends , ” you know .
So there you go : the first edition of “ Concession Stand . ”
Your thoughts …?
And before you answer that , let me throw in a bit of bribery : if you ’ve never seen “ Howard the Duck ” but have always been curious , then Hulu is glad to help solve that problem for you free of charge .
If you like it , though , I ’m telling you , the DVD is totally worth the money … and that ’s not the Voltage talking !
Remember The Selby ?
It 's that great site I plugged a while back consisting of photos ( and drawings , and little Q&As , of late ) of the homes of creative and interesting people .

The security minister has confirmed officials are considering installing technology that could enable on - demand wiretapping of all communications passing over the internet by the intelligence services and law enforcement .
Lord West told Parliament on Monday that civil servants working on the Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) were considering how Deep Packet Inspection ( DPI ) equipment " might support the lawful interception of communications and separately the lawful acquisition of communications data " .
It 's the first time the government has publicly acknowledged its interest in DPI equipment .
A delayed Home Office consultation on IMP is due to be launched " shortly " , West said .
The Programme as envisaged by GCHQ and MI6 , according to sources , has two aims .
First , spy chiefs want to create a massive central repository of communications traffic data .
Such data contains the powerful details of who contacts whom , how , when and where .
Most major ISPs and telecoms firms already retain much of this data , but some do not , and many email , VoIP , instant messenging and social networking services retain little .
This in turn would facilitate the second aim of the system , the interception of the content of internet communications .
As now , this would require a warrant under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) , but each wiretap would be much easier to implement .
West 's comments confirm our sources ' information that officials are considering a network of DPI probes inside the UK internet and telecoms infrastructure that could fulfil each ambition .
The equipment can monitor everything in each data packet passing its location in the network , allowing both " the lawful acquisition of communications data " and the " the lawful interception of communications " .
The hardware would be much the same as that Phorm plans to use in its ISP - level targeted advertising system , albeit on a far grander scale .
Leaked estimates have put the cost of a ubiquitous DPI network and central database at £ 12bn .
DPI would account for the lion 's share of that figure .
The two controversial systems have both arisen out of rapid advancements in chip and network technology that have made monitoring IP networks at line speed feasible , however .
That development of surveillance power in the last decade is illustrated by a letter to the editor of The Guardian by then - National Criminal Intelligence Service Director General John Abbott , in 2000 .
He wrote : " Conspiracy theorists must not be allowed to get away with the ridiculous notion that law enforcement would or even could monitor all emails .
The intelligence agencies have neither the inclination nor the resources , nor the legal ability to monitor the massive amounts of electronic communications that flow through the UK every day .
" It does not happen with letters or telephones and it will not with emails . "
Nine years later , the DPI equipment being considered by the government would allow exactly that .
West did not address the thrust of Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Miller 's question yesterday .
She asked whether DPI would be used to peer into communications to ascertain identity where it could not be gleaned from the traffic data .
Security experts including the University of Cambridge 's Dr Richard Clayton have pointed out that in such cuircumstances , where DPI technology is installed , the line between communications traffic data and the content of the communication could become blurred . ®

MOGADISHU ( Reuters ) - Somali pirates holding an American hostage on a drifting lifeboat want $ 2 million for his release , a fellow pirate onshore said on Friday .
The pirate , speaking to Reuters from Haradheere port , also said other pirates were taking a hijacked German ship , with foreign crew on board , toward the scene in the Indian Ocean where the lifeboat is floating , watched by U.S. warships .
“ Knowing that the Americans will not destroy this German ship and its foreign crew , they ( the approaching pirates ) hope they can meet their friends on the lifeboat , ” said the pirate , who has given reliable information in the past but asked for his name not to be used .
“ Our friends ( on the lifeboat ) hope for $ 2 million ransom as well as their own safety , ” he added .
The 20,000 - tonne German container vessel , Hansa Stavanger , was hijacked a week ago , about 400 miles off south Somalia , between Kenya and the Seychelles .
It is thought to have 24 crew , of whom five are German .
Both men have twice enjoyed the fruits of political power .
Both have been jailed , accused of corruption , and live as millionaires in a poverty - stricken country .
Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif , the leaders of the country 's largest political parties , are now locked head - to - head in a showdown that is paralysing Pakistan .
A year ago , the pair formed an alliance that aroused hopes they would work together to roll back eight years of dictatorship .
But the euphoria overlooked the historic hostility between the men .

From 1988 to 1999 , four governments headed alternately by Mr Sharif and Mr Zardari 's wife , Benazir Bhutto , collapsed amid wrangling between their parties .
Mr Zardari has not forgotten that Mr Sharif twice imprisoned him .
Mr Sharif believes the man he accused of corruption cannot be trusted .
Since resigning from government in August , Mr Sharif has been positioning himself as an alternative leader for Pakistan should Mr Zardari's Pakistan People 's Party fall .
Confronted by unrest , a souring economy and tensions with India , Mr Zardari has executed a series of self - defeating moves .
He imposed central government on Punjab province in February after a court ruled the election of Mr Sharif 's brother as chief minister was invalid .
Days later , his government caved in to Taliban demands to impose Sharia in the Swat Valley .

History may judge 2 April 2009 a significant date .
I am not yet sure which piece of trivia might fasten itself to it ; it will probably be the Queen and Michelle Obama putting their arms around each other .
An unexpected rebranding of Her Majesty as the nation 's huggable granny .
It is unlikely to be remembered as the ExCel summit , because historians are bound to think that anything with a capital letter in the middle is a trademark , which it is , and you do n't want product placement in a scholarly text .
More substantively , it may be remembered as the coming of age of the G20 , a wider gathering than the G8 , which mostly represents the people – " white with blue eyes " – who President Lula of Brazil accused of causing the financial crisis in the first place .
And it may be remembered as the moment when questions of global economic policy began to be measured in trillions – even if Brown 's headline $ 1.1 trn figure was mostly devout - wishing and double - counting .
Usually , I would say " it is easy to carp " , and then go on to do it anyway , before moving on to Brown 's virtues as they might be viewed from the perspective of David Cameron 's second term as prime minister .
But on this occasion carping is anything but easy .
The numbers are so big and the issues so technical , that carping requires advanced skills .
Fortunately , Chris Giles of the Financial Times has the qualifications to take Brown 's Potemkin village to pieces .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
On Friday Giles dismantled the $ 1.1 trn edifice as if it were a stage prop .
One quarter of it , $ 250bn , is described as " trade finance " , but Giles said that this is " an aspiration for the amount of trade that will be financed over the next two years " – the amount of credit that will actually be extended is no more than one - 60th of that .
One half of the £ 1.1 trn is " a generalised pledge for a new financing scheme " , which includes $ 200 bn pledged to the IMF by Japan and the European Union in recent months .
No new money was formally pledged last week , although Brown claimed that China had promised $ 40 bn .
And the final quarter consists of IMF Special Drawing Rights , which the Plain English Campaign would call " printing money " .
Really , you would have thought that Brown would have learnt .
His early reputation as Chancellor of the Exchequer , when he was a brilliant and prudent guardian of the nation 's finances , was terribly damaged by his attempt to count planned spending on schools and hospitals twice , and to roll up consecutive years ' numbers into impressively large " bullions " , as he called them .
You would have thought that he would have grasped two things .
One is that most people have no concept of scale when it comes to large numbers .
For the purposes of getting a political message across , there is no difference between a million , a billion or a trillion .
The other is that , having thus attached the word spin to New Labour like a barnacle , repeating the error on a global scale would be unwise .
But no , the presentational slipperiness of that early period has returned .
We should have realised in mid-March , when Alistair Darling suddenly redefined " fiscal stimulus " .
Until then , it had meant new spending or tax cuts paid for by extra borrowing – over and above the borrowing needed to cover the gap between rising social security spending and falling tax receipts caused by the recession .
That is what Brown and Barack Obama originally wanted the leading countries of the world to sign up to at last week 's summit .
Brown and Darling announced one fiscal stimulus in November ( mainly the VAT cut ) , and were thinking of announcing a second one in the Budget later this month .
Meanwhile , President Obama finally secured Congress 's approval for his fiscal stimulus in February .
Meanwhile , it became clear that there were no takers for the idea among the rest of the G20 .
Hence Darling 's Humpty Dumpty - ish : " When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean . "
On 16 March he defined " our fiscal stimulus " as the entire public borrowing requirement for the year .
On this definition , all the forecast increase in borrowing of all the G20 countries was rolled up over three years into one gigantic $ 5 trn stimulus .
In other words , a pointlessly big - number way of describing what is happening already .
There are many other ways in which we can carp at Brown 's over - claiming .
The green stuff , for example , amounted to only point nine of Downing Street 's handy summary " top 10 outcomes " , and it was mere rhetoric .
But what is the point ?
Yes , Brown may get an Obama bump in the opinion polls .
But it will be weaker than his previous attempts to defy political gravity .
The dead cat is proving surprisingly elastic , but it is still dead .
The voters have decided , broadly , what they think of him , and it is that he has brought the country to rack and ruin .
It does not matter to the British electorate that , in the wider perspective , the G20 deal was worthwhile and important – even if not as important as claimed .
As Hamish McRae rightly argues on the previous page , the deal achieved more by restraining its members from doing bad things ( deflation , protectionism ) than by signing them up for good things ( a green new deal ) .
There is a savage irrationality in the air .
It was symbolised last week by protesters smashing the windows of RBS , a bank they own .
It does not matter that , stripped of all the counter - productive spin , the G20 deal was a genuinely positive historical moment .
Brown 's efforts last week may be looked on favourably by historians , but for the next year until the likely date of the election , he will get nothing but rank ingratitude from his people .

McCain facing 2010 primary
Social conservatives tolerated John McCain as the party 's nominee , but never trusted him , and he now appears to be facing a serious primary from the right in Arizona next year .
Chris Simcox , the founder of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps and a prominent figure in the movement to clamp down on illegal immigration , will be announcing tomorrow at an event on the Mexican border that he 's resigned from the group to run in the 2010 Senate primary .
From a forthcoming release :
" John McCain has failed miserably in his duty to secure this nation 's borders and protect the people of Arizona from the escalating violence and lawlessness , " Simcox said .
" He has fought real efforts over the years at every turn , opting to hold our nation 's border security hostage to his amnesty schemes .
Coupled with his votes for reckless bailout spending and big government solutions to our nation 's problems , John McCain is out of touch with everyday Arizonans .
Enough is enough . "
McCain was forced to abandon his own immigration reform legislation during last year 's Republican Primary , a move that may have cost him substantial Hispanic support to which his record could have given him access .
So he 's basically getting it from both sides on this one .
Simcox , with a national base and a high profile on the right , is well positioned to give McCain a serious local headache .
He 'll find some allies among the conservatives who recently took over the Arizona Republican Party from McCain 's allies , and he has a national fundraising base .
UPDATE : Here 's his campaign website , which includes a clear effort not to be a single - issue immigration candidate .

Google Latitude , which uses GPS to allow you to track people from your mobile phone of desktop PC , is under fire from privacy campaigners .
They say that Google Latitude could be used to spy on unsuspecting users .
Latitude is a free tool that works from smartphones and PCs .
With Latitude installed , users can use GPS and Google Maps to track other friends who are using the service .
Crucially , to be tracked , people have to sign up for Google Latitude .
They can also limited exactly who can track them , and where they can be tracked .
This has not placated privacy campaigners , however .
Privacy International director Simon Davies said : " Many people will see this as a cool technology but the reality is it will be a privacy minefield .
I would be concerned about any integrated use across Google services as their security is so poor and it's becoming the world most pervasive system . "
Announcing Google Latitude , Google 's Vic Gundotra wrote : " Everything about Latitude is opt-in .
You not only control exactly who gets to see your location , but you also decide the location that they see .
" For instance , let 's say you are in Rome .
Instead of having your approximate location detected and shared automatically , you can manually set your location for elsewhere - perhaps a visit to Niagara Falls . "

If your nonprofit has a website , you are a content creator .
That 's because websites are not static .
They are dynamic sources of continually changing information .
There are so many reasons to have good content on your nonprofit website , but two stand out :
It engages supporters and potential supporters with information relevant to their needs .
It helps people find you when they search online , either for your name specifically or for information about the issues on which your organization is an expert .
It is no longer enough to just put up a virtual business card for your organization .
Your nonprofit website should be a hub of engaging information about your cause , the issues you address , and the resources that really help people .
Content today takes numerous forms .
Here are some common ones that will turn your website into a destination spot for both long - time supporters and those who simply need what you have to offer .
Articles
Your nonprofit is an expert on something : an issue , a disease , a social problem , some sort of research .
Take advantage of your expertise and provide articles that draw on it .
Such content will be indexed by the search engines so readers will be able to find you when they search for the keywords in your content .
You can also use those articles to keep your social media fresh .
Examples : Acterra , an environmental group in California , exemplifies this approach .
On their website , see the pull - down menu in the box labeled " Energy and Climate " to see a list of evergreen articles .
The beauty of " evergreen " articles is that they do n't go out of date often .
Load up with them and then swap out on a regular basis .
Photos
Great images make your website a draw .
Put them on every page .
Show photos of the people you serve , your volunteers , and your donors .
Revolving images are great for keeping your website fresh and interesting .
These days , almost anyone can take great photos with nothing more than a smartphone .
It 's inexpensive and easy .
Examples :
Take a look at the engaging and changing images at Rise , a Minnesota nonprofit that works with the disabled .
The Atlanta Habitat for Humanity is dominated by dynamic photos giving the site life and energy .
Video
It is very easy to incorporate video on any website now with the use of services such as YouTube and Vimeo .
Plus , short videos are quite popular and available on Instagram .
If you are appealing to a young audience , video is really required to entice your young audience to tune in and stay tuned in .
Examples : Rainforest
Alliance mixes in videos amidst the content on its website , creating a wonderful mix of creative images , moving and static .
Blog
Blogging is a great way to make sure that your website has continually renewing content .
Besides , search engines love blogs and will visit your site frequently to pick up your latest content .
Blogs can be easily incorporated into website design and work well for organizations that are very active .
Do n't try this if you can't update the blog frequently .
There is nothing sadder than a blog that has n't been refreshed recently .
Examples : The African Wildlife Foundation uses several blogs , written by various staff , to keep up with research on leopards , lions , mountain gorillas and zebra in Africa .
These blogs are addictive for anyone whose passion is African wildlife conservation .
News or Resource Room
A news or press room on your website can be a source of renewing content and an absolute blessing to visiting journalists .
Post news releases about the doings at your organization and links to news stories that have been published about it .
Examples : See Soles4Souls for an example of a vibrant newsroom .
Notice that it has a gallery of downloadable photos that journalists can use for their stories . ​
User - Generated Content
Get your readers and supporters to provide content for your site .
If you can get a steady stream of content flowing from your readers , it will add a wonderful dynamism to your site .
Encourage readers to leave comments on your blog and relate their own stories in a special location on your website .
But do not leave comments unmoderated .
Nasty comments could show up , so be prepared to delete and even boot commentators off .
Examples :
The March of Dimes does a wonderful job of inviting parents to tell their baby stories , and Safe Kids urges parents and caregivers to share their ideas about preventing child injuries .
There are so many ways to share information on your website , creating a content hub that will both help your followers and get the word out about your cause .
Much of this content can be re-purposed for other communication channels too .
Think of your social networks , newsletters , and annual report just for starters .
Dive in and start creating .

How important have unmanned aircraft become to the US military ?
Well how's this : the Air Force says next year it will acquire more unmanned aircraft than manned .
Air Force Lt. Gen. Norman
Seip this week said the service is " all in " when it comes to developing unmanned systems and aircraft .
" Next year , the Air Force will procure more unmanned aircraft than manned aircraft , " the general said .
" I think that makes a very pointed statement about our commitment to the future of [ unmanned aircraft ] and what it brings to the fight in meeting the requirements of combatant commanders . "
Seip said the Air Force currently has 85 % of its unmanned air force deployed in Southwest Asia operations and 15 % stateside to train pilots and for operational test and development .
The Air Force is doing all it can to speed up the UAS pilot training process , he added .
Published reports note that the Air Force wants to produce 300 unmanned aerial vehicle pilots over the next three years because they 're badly needed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The service has 27 unmanned aircraft flying over Iraq and Afghanistan at any time , but it wants to almost double those patrols by 2012 , according to the mysantantonio.com Web site .
Additionally , he said , teams at the Air Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base , Nev. , are developing countermeasures for potential enemy use of unmanned aerial systems .
The use of unmanned aircraft is exploding in the military and commercial communities .
Federal agencies such as the DHS , the Department of Commerce , and NASA alone use unmanned planes in many areas , such as border security , weather research , and forest fire monitoring .
Researchers at the Teal Group said in their 2008 market study estimates that UAV spending will more than double over the next decade from current worldwide UAV spending of $ 3.4 billion annually to $ 7.3 billion , totaling close to $ 55 billion in the next ten years .
The forecast also indicates that the US could account for 73 % of the world 's research and development investment unmanned flight in the next decade .
The Government Accountability Office last year called on Congress to create an overarching body within Federal Aviation Administration to coordinate unmanned aircraft development and integration efforts .
Ina Caterina Remhof could face charges for abandoning children A German couple who abandoned three young children in an Italian pizzeria on Sunday have told police they fled because they had no money , reports say .
Ina Caterina Remhof , the 26 - year - old mother , and her partner Sascha Schmidt , 24 , said they had to eat scraps of food from bins , the Ansa news agency said .
The pair were found on Thursday in a wood near the northern town of Aosta .
The two left the restaurant in Aosta , supposedly for a cigarette , but never returned .
The children are now in care .
Arrangements are being made to take the children - believed to be aged four , two and eight months - back home to western Germany , where they may be placed in their grandmother 's care .
' Relief ' Police had been combing the Aosta valley before the couple were found by a patrol on Thursday afternoon .
Investigators had feared they would not be found alive , as their car was also abandoned , along with a diary detailing financial problems .
Staff at the Aosta pizzeria only realised they had vanished after 10 minutes " They immediately asked about the children , but were sure that they were in a safe place , " Ansa quoted local police official Salvatore Aprile as saying .
The two " seemed almost relieved that their flight was over , " he said , though Ms Remhof was said to have started crying when told her children would probably be taken away from her .
The Italian newspaper , La Stampa , quoted Ms Remhof as saying that she and her boyfriend had left for a holiday in Italy with 900 euros ( £ 815 ) but had quickly run out of money .
They decided to leave the children when they started crying because " they did n't have anything to eat " , Ansa quoted her as saying .
She reportedly said that she had been confident the children would be " sent back to Germany , and I would have found them again when I got up some money " .
Italian prosecutors have said Ms Remhof could be charged with the offence under Italian law of abandoning a vulnerable person .
German officials have said her parental rights may be withdrawn .
German police have said that Mr Schmidt was on the run after not returning to prison while on parole , while the children 's biological father is serving a prison sentence for fatally mistreating a fourth child he had with Ms Remhof .

Wishing for world peace is so passé ; nowadays Miss Universe can be found blogging about Guantanamo Bay .
" I did n't want to leave , it was such a relaxing place , so calm and beautiful , " Dayana Mendoza gushed at the end of a five - day trip .
It may not be a sentiment that Binyam Mohamed would share about his time at the US base in Cuba , but then he was n't buying souvenir necklaces to take home at the end of his four years of incarceration .
Ms Mendoza , a Venezuelan model , was crowned Miss Universe last summer .
Since then , she has clocked up stops in Indonesia , Spain , the Bahamas and Puerto Rico .
" This week , Guantanamo ! !! " she trumpeted on her blog .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Her visit to the base was designed as a morale - boosting treat for troops .
" The first thing we did was attend a big lunch and then we visited one of the bars they have in the base .
We talked about Gitmo and what it was like living there , " wrote Ms Mendoza .
Other highlights included meeting the military dogs – who " did a very nice demonstration of their skills " – and a first - hand look at the detainee camps with their orange jump - suited inmates .
" We saw the jails , where they shower , how they recreate themselves with movies , classes of art , books , " she said .
" It was very interesting . "
For Cori Crider , who has represented more than 40 current and former Guantanamo prisoners , the Miss Universe visit was simply the " latest surreal chapter " in the history of the prison .
The human rights lawyer , who works for Reprieve , had just finished visiting an inmate , who had been shackled to the floor , and was driving back to her office when she saw a large crowd of jostling soldiers .
" At the centre of the uniform swarm was a shock of glossy hair and a brightly patterned top that looked more like one you 'd wear on beach holiday , her hip was out , her arm around a Marine , " said Ms Crider .
" It 's obviously tempting to blame her for posing for a photo a stone 's throw away from the isolation camps , but people do n't think .
They miss human suffering going on right under their nose . "
Other human rights analysts expressed a certain amount of sympathy for the US troops , noting that Guantanamo is a tough assignment .
However , one person who is likely to be unimpressed with Ms Mendoza 's visit is the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
He called to congratulate the Caracas - born model when she won the Miss Universe crown last July , but as an anti-US Cuba ally , he would certainly not approve of her fraternising with US soldiers at Guantanamo Bay .
Earlier this year Mr Chavez urged Barack Obama to not only make good on his pledge to close the prison there within 12 months , but to also return the land to Cuba .
The US took possession of the south - eastern corner of the island under a lease established after the 1898 Spanish - American War , and later agreed to rent the land in perpetuity for an annual fee .
However , since 1960 , Cuba 's government has refused to cash the cheques .
Ms Mendoza skates over this , noting she had seen " the division of Gitmo and Cuba " and that the Marines " informed us with a little bit of history " .
Instead she devotes her energies to the sparkling water in the bay and the beach .
" The water ... is soooo beautiful !
We went to the glass beach , and realised the name of it comes from the little pieces of broken glass from hundreds of years ago .
It is pretty to see all the colours shining with the sun . "
Miss Universe 's final encounter was with a jewellery maker .
" I bought a necklace from her that will remind me of Guantanamo Bay . "
" I do n't think he felt too bad about it , because after all , as far as he was concerned , he did his job according to the orders he was given .
And the atmosphere in general , from what I understood from most of my men who I talked to ... I do n't know how to describe it ....
The lives of Palestinians , let 's say , is something [ that seemed ] much less important than the lives of our soldiers .
So as far as they are concerned they can justify it that way . "
Les Stocker , founder of Tiggywinkles , said : " He 's part of the family here and very much a character , but we would love to help his condition and release him .
When he was brought in he seemed pretty cheesed off with life , but now he 's a normal hedgehog in everything but appearance .
I do n't think he realises he has n't got any spines . "
Mr Bildt said he had been given no explanation Sri Lanka has refused entry to Sweden 's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt .
Mr Bildt was to have taken part in a European diplomatic mission .
He is recalling Sweden 's top diplomat in Sri Lanka for consultation .
The UK's David Miliband and France 's Bernard Kouchner will still go on the mission , which is expected to push for a truce between the army and rebels .
Sri Lanka 's foreign ministry said this was not a snub and it could only cope with so many high - level delegations .
See a map of the region Sri Lanka has had tense relations with the Scandinavian former monitors of its peace process but its main problems have been with the major ex-mediator , Norway .
Mr Miliband and Mr Kouchner are both expected to arrive on Wednesday .
Ceasefire pressure Mr Bildt told the BBC : " They have said I am not welcome at this particular period of time - they were saying that they can't handle too many people .
" There must be some sort of reason but it has to be a rather odd one . "
Mr Bildt said he was recalling the Swedish ambassador in Sri Lanka for consultation , adding that Sri Lanka did " not seem to be too interested " in its relationship with Sweden at the moment .
However , he insisted it was right for the mission to continue .
" Even if only one of us were able to go it would be worth it because we really need to try to pressure everyone to allow international access [ to civilians ] . "
The UN's John Holmes has visited civilian camps in Vavuniya Karel Schwarzenberg , the foreign minister of the Czech Republic , which holds the rotating EU presidency , said the Sri Lankan move was " a grave mistake ... which will of course have repercussions in Europe " .
Sri Lanka has tried to play down the incident .
Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona told Reuters : " We have not rejected the Swedish foreign minister .
He has been invited to come here next week because we are just overwhelmed at the moment with all these visitors . "
He said of possible repercussions : " Mature governments and institutions should not deal with each other based on threats . "
The BBC's Charles Haviland says officials in Colombo are calling this a " non-issue " but he says the diplomatic spat is a symptom of tension between EU countries and Sri Lanka .
EU foreign ministers on Monday joined the UN in calling for a ceasefire in the north - east , where the army is battling the rebels .
Diplomatic efforts to bring more help for the civilians in the war zone have so far made little progress .
The United Nations top humanitarian envoy , John Holmes , said on Monday that he had failed to secure agreement from the government on access to civilians .
The Sri Lankan military has restricted the rebels to a 12 sq km ( 5 sq m ) area of land and believes final victory is near .
On Monday the Sri Lankan government said it would stop using heavy weapons in the war zone and that its operations were drawing to a close .
However , a Tigers spokesman in the conflict zone , Puleedevan , told the BBC that troops had begun mortar , artillery and rocket fire early on Tuesday morning .
Speaking for the Sri Lankan army , Brig Udaya Nanayakkara said no heavy weapons had been used .
There is no way of confirming the reports as independent journalists are denied access to the war zone .
The Tamil Tigers have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka 's Tamil minority since 1983 .
More than 70,000 people have been killed in the war , but that figure could now be far higher .

Facebook is booming in Turkey and Indonesia .
YouTube ’s audience has nearly doubled in India and Brazil .
That may seem like good news .
But it is also a major reason these and other Web companies with big global audiences and renowned brands struggle to turn even a tiny profit .
Call it the International Paradox .
Web companies that rely on advertising are enjoying some of their most vibrant growth in developing countries .
But those are also the same places where it can be the most expensive to operate , since Web companies often need more servers to make content available to parts of the world with limited bandwidth .
And in those countries , online display advertising is least likely to translate into results .
This intractable contradiction has become a serious drag on the bottom lines of photo - sharing sites , social networks and video distributors like YouTube .
It is also threatening the fervent idealism of Internet entrepreneurs , who hoped to unite the world in a single online village but are increasingly finding that the economics of that vision just do not work .
Next Week 's Firefox 3.0.8 Release Termed " High - Priority Firedrill "
by Ostatic Staff - Mar. 26 , 2009
There are many reasons to love the open source approach .
The events chronicled in an article on NetworkWorld surrounding an exploit affecting Firefox outlines , quite elegantly , how open code outwardly appears risky , and -- well , wide open -- and how that same quality generates faster fixes and stronger applications .
A security researcher discovered that Firefox is vulnerable to remote memory corruption , enabling attackers to execute malicious ( or at least very much unauthorized ) code within the context of the browser .
While security researchers spend countless hours searching out bugs and vulnerabilities , it 's not usually the case that the offending attack finds its way into the public eye .
Yesterday , however , this little exploit was published on several security sites .
The vulnerability affects Firefox versions 3.0 through 3.0.7 , on all platforms .
In less than 24 hours , developers issued a patch for the vulnerability , to be included in next week 's 3.0.8 release .
Put aside , for a moment , the quick turn around time on the patch , and take a look at the comments on the bug report .
The person filing the bug states that while the attack code calls an empty , harmless XML file ( with an XSLT transform ) now , the fact that it 's being called at all is a real cause for concern .
The developer leading the fix , Blake Kaplan , takes a look at the problem on several platforms and versions , begins patching them , and says quite candidly that the bug is obvious " once you see it . "
This is why the open source approach works well -- this is a real life example of the " many eyes " mythos .
These developers work with this code all day , but it does n't mean it 's easy ( or possible ) to see every way it could be vulnerable .
No application is perfect , and bugs and vulnerabilities happen .
The lasting effects on a project often have less to do with the damage done so much as how well damage control was carried out .
A quick fix is great , but a developer team that acknowledges issues and talks about them publicly suggests the project is n't merely the source of a paycheck or place to spend spare hours -- it is a responsibility taken very , very seriously .
The Brave , Living and Dead Editor ’s Note : Lost in the chatter of Washington political class – as it continues to defend George W. Bush ’s wars with clever debating points – is the horrendous human cost of such endeavors , whether considering the deaths of hundreds of thousands or a single individual , plus the pain and suffering of survivors .
In this guest essay , writer Michael Winship reflects on the human calamity that is war both in large numbers and in one :
In this bicentennial year of Abraham Lincoln 's birth , I recently was re-reading part of Doris Kearns Goodwin 's epic history , Team of Rivals .

Once again it was stunning to see the number of casualties during the Civil War , the dead and wounded in four years of fighting exponentially outnumbering the American men and women killed and wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan over six and a half years of combat .
On both sides of the Civil War , 618,000 were killed , although some estimate as many as 700,000 .
In just the three days of the Battle of Gettysburg , July 1863 - more than 51,000 dead and wounded .
Chickamauga , Georgia , two days , September 1963 , nearly 35,000 .
Chancellorsville , Virginia , four days , May 1863 , more than 30,000 .
And on and on .
" The war took young , healthy men and rapidly , often instantly , destroyed them with disease or injury , " Drew Gilpin Faust notes in her 2008 book The Republic of Suffering : Death and the American Civil War .
" Loss became commonplace ; death was no longer encountered individually ; death 's threat , its proximity and its actuality became the most widely shared of the war 's experiences . "
Up until that time , Faust writes , the U.S. Army had neither regular burial details nor grave - registration units .
Such duties " seemed always to be an act of improvisation . "
Often the townspeople in or near a battleground wound up with the task .
Many of the enlisted went unidentified , their bodies hastily placed in mass graves for fear of disease .
Contrast that with the painstaking care given each of the dead today when they arrive from Iraq or Afghanistan at the Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs , the joint military facility headquartered at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware .
Bodies and personal effects are thoroughly washed and cleansed , dress uniforms are individually tailored for the corpse , even the individual 's wristwatch is carefully set to the time at the location where they fell .
When each body is ready to leave Dover , all the service personnel at the mortuary stop what they 're doing and form a line along the driveway , giving a slow , ceremonial salute as the hearse passes by .
I learned this a few weeks ago , when I happened on the telecast of the HBO made - for - TV movie , “ Taking Chance , ” the true story of Marine Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl - played in the film by Kevin Bacon - who in 2004 escorted the body of Lance Corporal Chance Phelps , killed in Al Anbar Province , Iraq , to its final resting place in Dubois , Wyoming .
I knew about the film but had n't made plans to watch it .
Nonetheless , coming upon it by accident I was totally pulled in by the eloquent simplicity of the script , its attention to detail and lack of melodrama , the poignancy of Strobl and Phelps ' stories and the people " they " meet as Lt. Col .
Strobl accompanies the body on its final , cross-country journey .
( You can continue to see the film through this month , at various times , well worth the fewer than 90 minutes it takes to view .
Check the schedule at HBO.com . )
Coincidentally , the film 's release came at the same time as the Pentagon 's announcement that it was lifting the ban on photographs and videos of bodies arriving at Dover , a proscription that had been in place since the first Gulf War in 1991 .
A similar renewed openness is taking place as the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs become more candid about suicide and PTSD , post traumatic stress disorder .
Alarmed by the increasing rate of suicide , the Army has begun releasing monthly numbers , in addition to the annual reports produced in the past .
2008 was a record high - 128 confirmed suicides and 15 under investigation .
The rate has been increasing steadily since 2004 .
Last month , there were 18 suspected suicides , up from 11 the previous year .
In January there were 24 , up from five in January 2008 .
According to the Associated Press , " Usually the vast majority of suspected suicides are eventually confirmed , and if that holds true it would mean that self - inflicted deaths surpassed the 16 combat deaths [ in January ] reported in all branches of the armed forces in Iraq , Afghanistan and other nations considered part of the global war on terror . "
The Army 's suicide rate is now exceeding the U.S. civilian rate , for the first time since the military began keeping records in 1980 .
" Why do the numbers keep going up ? " Army Secretary Peter Geren asked rhetorically at a press conference last month .
" We can not tell you . "
Experts say PTSD is a big reason - the RAND Center for Military Health Policy Research estimates that 19 percent of all the troops who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from it , some 300,000 men and women .
Others point to the high rate of redeployment .
According to a new report in the Boston Phoenix newspaper , " With the number of personnel that have served in the two theaters reaching nearly 1.8 million , critics estimate that one - third have served multiple deployments . "
With that redeployment comes incredible stress and anxiety , not only on the battlefield but back home , where marriages and other relationships collapse from the strain .
This past fall , the Army announced a $ 50 million , five - year joint study of suicide with the National Institute of Mental Health .
And this week , the service will be wrapping up a month - long training program to help soldiers recognize suicidal behaviors in their comrades .
But much more needs to be done .
" We keep getting studies , " Rep. John Murtha , chair of the House defense appropriations committee said at a March 3rd hearing .
" That 's the problem with the Defense Department - they study it to death . "
What 's more , according to an Army Medical Department 's 2008 report , 33 percent of the troops in Afghanistan and 21.8 percent in Iraq say when it comes to mental health , their leaders discourage them from seeking help .
That has to stop .
We must treat the living as respectfully as we do the dead .

and with a lot of false bravado …
A quick dive into a brick wall of stupidity ... err ... the backwards logic of Ray Comfort .
Normally , I would n’t tackle anything by Ray Comfort because that ’s infringing on the territory of Pharyngula .
Comfort ’s claim to fame is an internet video in which he says that an agriculturally produced and modified banana fits perfectly into a human hand and is thus proof of God .
Wait , hold on .
I have a banana in my fridge that does n’t fit in my hand very well and its stem breaks off if you pull on it to expose the fruit ’s edible interior .
I do n’t know what to make of that .
Is the banana evolved or is yours truly just a freak of nature ?
Regardless ,
Ray feels so well educated in the ins and outs of modern biology ( and astrophysics for that matter ) , that he decided to publish a book with a very innocent and not all insulting or condescending title of You Can Lead an Atheist to Evidence , But You Ca n’t Make Him Think .
And the subtitle is not much better .
Now , I ’m a skeptic but I like to consider myself open minded so why not take a look at the first two pages of his evidence and see how he intends to dispel over a century and a half of scientific research and development in one book starting with page one .
We begin with a horrifying misquote from Stephen Hawking in which he ’s obviously replying to a question about the creation of the universe and is being taken out of context .
Not exactly the best first impression , but let ’s continue on to his first assertion and I do mean assertion .
While some believers in evolution deny that evolution is a random process , if it ’s not planned , then it ’s planned .
And if it is planned then there is Someone doing the planning .
This follows his statement that atheists believe that the universe came into being at random .
So if we follow his train of thought , because atheists believe that the universe appeared at random , it must mean that evolution is a random process .
This is a textbook example of a fallacy known as a non sequtur .
If something happens at random , whatever happens next does n’t necessarily have to be random too .
But then , Comfort asserts that because something is non-random , it must mean that there ’s a higher power in charge .
And that ’s a fallacy called proof by assertion .
Ca n’t see any real evidence of anything so far , just semantics .
Next , Comfort turns to the Book of Genesis and without even the slightest attempt to attach the Biblical to the scientific , declares that without a 14.7 psi atmosphere , the first man could n’t take a breath and would ’ve suffocated .
Considering that we can breathe in a 14.8 psi atmosphere , a 14.6 psi one and a wide range of other pressures , his point seems to be rather moot .
But that ’s not the only grossly mistaken claim made here .
… It was fortunate the air was made up of 78.09 % nitrogen and 20.95 % oxygen — the exact mixture that his blood and lungs needed to survive .
Note to Ray .
The atmosphere was around 4.6 billion years before humans evolved so the whole thing would happen the other way around .
Nevertheless , what ’s being done here is a creationist tactic meant to overwhelm the audience with the illusion of precision in nature .
Of course if he really wanted to make things seem even more complex , he could ’ve mentioned more than just oxygen and nitrogen .
There are other constituents in our atmosphere like argon ( 0.93 % ) and a greenhouse gas that makes our planet nice and warm — carbon dioxide ( 0.038 % ) .
And we could go even further into the exact amount of other trace gases .
Now does n’t that sound complex ?
The only snag here is that the atmospheric mixture does n’t to be anywhere that precise and in the planet ’s history , there have been many changes to it , yet life still thrived .
Comfort then claims that it ’s an amazing coincidence that a woman evolved at the same time as the first man .
Well , considering the fact that new species evolve in groups , it ’s actually not a coincidence at all .
In fact , it ’s kind of a given .
And when we continue reading , we see this really disturbing desecration of physics .
It was also amazing that gravity existed at the time of their evolution .
Without it , the first man and his mate would ’ve spun off into the infinitude of space .
Wow …
Just wow .
I think this is 6th grade physics here .
Gravity existed because there was a huge ball of rock under their feet otherwise known as a planet .
Gravity does not evolve as Ray ’s book claims in the next sentence .
It does n’t need to .
It ’s a physical force .
Just like in the examples we reviewed above , Ray takes everything that happens and applies it backwards .
He holds up what we see around us today , begs the question of how everything must ’ve evolved at just the right time for today ’s world all at the same time and then declares that it must be God so atheists in their insistence that things happened on their own must be blinded with their ideologies if they refuse to view the world and its history backwards .
In just two pages , it seems that virtually every sentence is filled with backwards logic , disregard for basic fact and contempt of people who ’d like to think about the world from past to modern day , saying that their “ faith ” is stronger than his .
Oh and there ’s no evidence here to discuss or consider .
None at all .
Just proof by assertion fallacies as far as the eye can see .
If these are just the first two pages , I can only imagine what the rest of this volume holds .
Blowing ( Up ) Hydrogen Bubbles
A dramatic demonstration -- with exclusive video ! -- of why the same gas that heats your house can also make it explode
With four days to go until president - elect Barack Obama takes is inaugurated , history is documenting George Bush 's environmental record at home and abroad .
Read more on the Bush legacy in The Bush Years supplement in Saturday 's paper
The document released by the White House to commemorate George Bush 's exit from the most powerful job on the planet describes a president who spent much of the last eight years as a careful steward of the planet .
" Throughout his administration , President Bush made protecting the environment for future generations a top priority , " says the booklet , Highlights of Accomplishments and Results .
" If only " – went the near - universal response from green organisations .
They see the Bush years as a concerted assault , from the administration 's undermining of the science on climate change to its dismantling of environmental safeguards to its support for mining and oil interests .
" He has undone decades if not a century of progress on the environment , " said Josh Dorner , a spokesman for the Sierra Club , one of America 's largest environmental groups .
" The Bush administration has introduced this pervasive rot into the federal government which has undermined the rule of law , undermined science , undermined basic competence and rendered government agencies unable to do their most basic function even if they wanted to .
We 're excited just to push the reset button . "
The tone was set in the first 100 days when Bush reneged on a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide from coal - burning power plants , the biggest contributors to global warming .
Days later , the White House announced that America would not implement the Kyoto global climate change treaty .
The two moves at the time were seen as a sign of surrender from Bush , a former oil man , to America 's coal and oil industries .
Christine Todd Whitman , who was the head of the Environmental Protection Agency at the time , later described the exit of Kyoto as " the equivalent to ' flipping the bird , ' frankly , to the rest of the world " .
But it was the manner of Bush 's exit from Kyoto that provided the most sustained damage , say environmentalists , with the administration injecting doubt on the science that demonstrated an urgent need to deal with climate change .
" The idea of a head of state putting the science question on the table in the way that he did was horrifying to most of the rest of the world , " said Eileen Claussen , president of the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change .
The disinformation campaign became a defining element of the Bush era – and was perhaps the most damaging .
" Certainly the most destructive part of the Bush environmental legacy is not only his failure to act on global climate change , but his administration 's covert attempt to silence the science alerting us to the urgency of the problem , " said Jonathan Dorn of the Earth Policy Institute ( EPA ) in Washington .
The campaign to keep the public unaware of the evidence on climate change came to light in October 2004 when the Nasa scientist , James Hansen , accused the Bush administration of trying to block data showing an acceleration in global warming .
The full extent of the White House efforts to downplay , distort and outright censor the science on climate change remains unclear – but such efforts continued even after Hansen accused the Bush administration of censorship .
In July 2008 , Jason Burnett , a former official at the EPA , wrote a letter to the Senate describing efforts by the office of the vice - president , Dick Cheney , and the White House Council on Environmental Quality to censor discussion of the consequences of climate change .
Burnett said the White House tried to circumvent a 2007 Supreme Court decision compelling the EPA to regulate car emissions by doctoring scientific findings on the costs of fuel - efficiency standards .
The White House objected to a study showing the benefits of raising fuel standards outweighed the costs .
In 2008 , officials from Cheney 's office sought to doctor testimony prepared for a Senate hearing on California 's efforts to impose stricter fuel efficiency requirements than the national standard .
Meanwhile , Bush officials began a concerted effort to strip away a regulatory regime that had been decades in the making .
" Every effort has been made to weaken existing law and there has been no effort to advance regulatory solutions to the most important issue we face , which is climate change , " said Frances Beinecke , president of the National Resources Defence Council .
A particular target of the Bush administration 's project of deregulation was the Endangered Species Act .
The campaign was driven in part by the administration 's concern that the act – with its protections for polar bears – could be used to force limits on greenhouse gas emissions .
As with the science on climate change , the Bush Administration has been accused of interfering with scientific findings on wildlife protection for political reasons .
An official report last month found widespread political interference in the management of endangered species .
The inspector general 's report said that the deputy secretary of the interior , Julie MacDonald , intervened repeatedly to prevent new additions to the endangered species list .
The report said MacDonald , who headed the endangered species protection programme at the US Fish and Wildlife Service , intervened improperly in 13 of the 20 cases under investigation , overruling the recommendations of field biologists that species be protected .
It described MacDonald 's dealings with the field biologists as " abrupt and abrasive if not abusive " .
MacDonald resigned in 2007 .
Dale Hall , a biologist who headed the service , called MacDonald 's conduct " a blemish on the scientific integrity of the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of the Interior " .
Other controversial actions included :
• Gutting key sections of the Clean Water and Clean Air acts
• Dismantling the protections of the Endangered Species Act
• Opening millions of acres of wilderness to mining , oil and gas drilling , and logging
• Defunding programmes charged with the clean - up of toxic industrial wastes such as arsenic , lead and mercury
• Reducing the enforcement effort in the Environmental Protection Agency
• Removing grizzly bears and wolves from the endangered species list
• Endorsing commercial whaling
• Approving mountain - top removal for coal mining
Bush pursued the grand plan of deregulation to his last days in the White House , with a series of last - minute rule changes .
Under the new rules , oil companies will be able to drill within sight of the Arches national park in Utah .
Federal agencies will no longer be compelled to consult with government wildlife experts when they open up new areas for logging or road construction , and he also barred the EPA from looking at the effects of global warming on protected species .
Some positive changes in the past eight years were inadvertent .
The Bush administration 's refusal to cap carbon dioxide emissions acted as a catalyst , with 24 states acting on their own to put in place regional cap and trade networks .
Some 27 states enacted renewable portfolios , mandating local power companies to produce more of their electricity from sun , wind and solar power .
" A lot of things happened because the Bush Administration was so negative about a lot of things , " said Claussen .
Bush expanded on a programme launched by Bill Clinton to reduce diesel exhaust , extending the rules to tractors , trains and small ships .
The administration did have one last - minute surprise in store for the green lobby though , by demonstrating a late commitment to ocean conservation .
Just two weeks before leaving office , Bush designated nearly 200,000 square miles of the Pacific Ocean as national monuments .
" We and others in the environmental community have been at odds with this administration on lots of things , but if one looks at this one event it is a significant conservation event , " said Joshua Reichert , managing director of the Pew Environment Group .
Do n't hold your breath .
It appears that Illinois legislators have put off their vote on legalizing medical marijuana , at least until the end of April .
What looked like a slam - dunk was complicated when state senators asked for several amendments to the bill , the ChiTown Daily News reported today .
It was voted out of the rules committee last week and was expected to be approved this week , but it 's not that high on their list of priorities .
Aides at chief sponsor Sen. William Haine 's office say the bill will be revisited after the Senate 's hiatus .
Legislators take a break after this week , and return April 21 .
The house is considering a similar bill .

T he recent bailout of Romania by the International Monetary Fund puts the spotlight back on the East European block of countries and what it means for the Western European banking sector .
If evidence is anything to go by , things are turning for the worse .
In fact , if a block of countries could be termed ' sub - prime ' , Eastern Europe seems to qualify as the countries seem to have been battered and bruised big time by the ongoing global financial turmoil .
With the financial contagion going beyond the developed West , few countries seem to be as hard hit as these are .
These are the countries that had earlier benefited tremendously from the cheap global credit which helped them finance the consumption and investment boom .
They ratcheted up large external debts to fund their ambitious growth .
And now they are feeling the pain .
The freezing of money markets in the United States and Western Europe , followed by a sharp increase in credit risk subsequent to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , drove investors into a liquidity scramble .
In Eastern Europe , these events translated into capital repatriations , lower foreign investment and higher risk premiums .
The slowdown in the developed economies and , finally , the onset of the recession in the second part of last year brought a fall in Eastern European exports , which further exacerbated the downfall .
This is amply evident from the fact that for most of these economies , current account balance has deteriorated like nobody 's business over the last few years .
In fact , IMF data shows that , on an average , the current account deficit for this region more than doubled between 2003 and 2008 .
Current account deficit as percentage of GDP
Country 2003 2008 * Albania - 5.19 - 10.53 Bosnia and Herzegovina - 19.40 - 15.80 Bulgaria - 5.50 - 24.37 Croatia - 6.20 - 10.13 Czech Republic - 6.33 - 2.23 Estonia - 11.34 - 10.78 Hungary - 7.94 - 5.45 Latvia - 8.23 - 15.12 Lithuania - 6.89 - 14.901 Macedonia , Former Yugoslavia - 4.10 - 13.96 Montenegro - 6.77 - 39.56 Poland - 2.12 - 4.72 Romania - 5.82 - 13.80 Serbia - 7.20 - 18.57 Slovak Republic - 5.93 - 5.13 Turkey - 2.47 - 6.52

Consequently , the region 's currencies also plummeted .
Banks in Hungary and the Baltic states fueled consumer boom in recent years by lending heavily in foreign currency , most notably Euro and the Swiss Franc .
Sometime , more than 50 per cent of a local bank 's loan portfolio was in foreign currency .
Consumers were demanding loan in foreign currency simply because these carried lower interest rates .
Things were fine as long as the currency remained stable or even appreciating .
But a sharp depreciation in the values of the local currency over the past year has increased the loan burden substantially , leading to deeper recessions and the banks facing heavy loss .
Not surprisingly these economies are skating downhill .
Hungary and Ukraine has already turned to the IMF for multi-billion - dollar bailouts , and Romania turned out to be third in the list as IMF said on Wednesday ( March 25 , 2009 ) that it would come to the rescue of Romania as part of a Euro 20 billion financing package to help it weather the financial crisis .
Next in line seem to be the Baltic countries which are suffering one of the most severe recessions of any region .
Estonia and Latvia are expected to have seen their economy recording negative growth in 2009 , while for Latvia the growth rate was down by nearly 60 per cent .
This is a frightening development indeed .
As mentioned earlier , we are virtually staring at a group of countries that are looking increasingly like sub -prime .
Recently , Credit Suisse released a scorecard which is called Vulnerability Scorecard for countries .
This scorecard ranks a number of countries around the world on factors usually taken into consideration when assessing the credit quality of sovereign debt .
The same is produced below .

Not surprisingly Iceland is at the top .
This country has become a poster boy of doom invited by reckless policies .
But what is more important to note is that in the top 14 countries in the above lists , eight are from Eastern Europe .
Fortunately for us Indians , we are in a much better position at 25 .
This brings to fore , the question of the likely implication of the deteriorating condition in Eastern Europe on the Western European financial sector .
Before we go into this , a brief recounting of history is in order .
In Eastern Europe , banks were privatised during the 1990s and early 2000s .
The preferred method of privatization was the sale of a majority stake in a local state - owned bank to a big foreign banking group , deemed capable of restructuring it and making it profitable .
Consequently , nowadays most banks in the region -- and especially in those countries that are now members of the European Union -- are owned by big Western Europe groups .
The Eastern European subsidiaries of all of these banks , often among the largest in their home countries , form a significant share of their assets .
What also led to this scenario is the European regulation which has allowed European banks to take on much more leverage than their American counterparts .
In Europe , unlike in the United States , it is only risk - weighted assets which matter to the regulators , not the total leverage ratio .
European banks can therefore apply a lot more leverage than their US counterparties , provided they load their balance sheets with higher rated assets .
This is what they have been doing .
Problem is , what was AAA couple of years earlier is possibly a junk now .
And , clearly that 's a problem .
Data from Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) puts things in perspective .

And because of this huge exposure , the growing crisis in Eastern Europe is now proving critical to their financial health .
Furthermore , a fall of any one of these banks due to losses on their operations in Eastern Europe will add a new threat to the stability of the European financial system .
The next chart produced , identifies the Western European countries that have more exposure to East Europe .
Exposure of West European banks to East European Countries ( As on Sept '08 )
Source : BIS ( Figures denote US dollars in millions )
Going by this , Austria is the country most at risk .
It is followed by Germany and Italy .
However , to understand the real problem , it is important to bring the size of the economy to focus which will give the extent of risk at relative level .
Doing so brings about an interesting situation .
Exposure of Western European banks to Eastern Europe as percentage of GDP ( 2008 )
Source : GDP data from IMF ( 2008 estimate ) , banking sector exposure data from BIS
Clearly , Austria is the country that is at maximum risk with exposure topping 60 per cent .
Their top four exposures are in Czech Republic , Romania , Hungary and Slovakia .
Of these , Romania and Hungary are already facing problems .
Banks of other Western European countries are at relatively less risk .
However , at 20 per cent plus , Belgium and Sweden are still at high risk .
Sweden , in particular , is at more risk because they have maximum exposure to Baltic countries which has been impacted the most by the recent turmoil .
To conclude , it turns out that Eastern Europe has now become the sub - prime borrower of Western Europe .
As was the case with the US mortgage borrowers , both the public and private sector in Eastern European countries are highly leveraged while falling currencies and declining output mean lower income in the immediate future .
Because of the deepening recession in the United States and Western Europe , the Eastern European countries are moving quickly into negative growth rates as well .
And with them comes the increased risk of default on debts .
Seemingly , there is a long way to go before all the risk plays out in Europe .

David Shuster calls out the Republicans for crying about the possible use of budget reconciliation by the Democrats when they themselves used it to ram through the Bush tax cuts and to open the Arctic Wildlife refuge for domestic oil drilling .
Shuster :
At the time Republican Senator Gregg , Judd Gregg said " The President ( Bush ) asked for it , and we 're trying to do what the President asked for " .
Now that President Obama is thinking of the same tactics Senator Gregg said it would be " regarded as an act of violence " .
Senator Gregg , an act of violence ?
Clearly it 's frustrating to be in the minority .
But Senators given your previous embrace of the fifty one vote threshold when you whine and complain about it now , that 's hypocrisy , and it 's wrong .
Mall owners began barring them from entering the complexes .
So they hung out on the steps .
A few scuffles between groups of kids gathered outside drew the attention of the local news media .
When reporters came to check things out the floggers directed them to Ms. Vivero , who confidently explained the new movement .
Soon she was making regular appearances on television news and talk shows .
“ People do n’t understand what this is all about , ” she said .
“ People are used to fame coming from television or from sports but not from the Internet , where people are posting photos and bringing people together and having fun . ”
Floggers are not “ like hippies or punks , who had ideals of fighting to change the world , ” said María José Hooft , who wrote a book , “ Tribus Urbanas , ” on youth subcultures in Argentina .
“ Floggers do n’t want to change the world .
They want to survive , and they want to have the best possible time they can . ”
The Cumbio craze really took off after Guillermo Tragant , president of Furia , a marketing company , discovered Ms. Vivero and the floggers last April while scouting for fresh faces for a Nike sportswear campaign .
Nike wanted “ real people from the streets , ” Mr. Tragant said .
“ The power of the image for them is so strong , ” he said , noting the afternoon “ matinee ” parties where floggers gather and walk a catwalk posing for photos of one another .
“ The sensation that the famous floggers are living today is like what Hollywood movie stars experience walking the red carpet . ”
THE Nike campaign ran for three months , with Ms. Vivero ’s image in sunglasses and a sideways - turned - cap appearing around the country .
It included a giant sneaker - shaped slide outside Abasto that the floggers could slide down while posing for pictures .
The Nike modeling led to promotional appearances .
Now on most weekends a manager whisks Ms. Vivero around the country to promote discos and to help sponsors sell branded clothes .
They pay for the flights and pay for rooms in four - star hotels for her and a small entourage .
WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration said it favors shorter jail sentences for crimes involving crack cocaine , a stance likely to spark a debate with law - enforcement officials who have opposed easing the penalties .
Under current law , a person caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine gets the mandatory minimum sentence of five years , while it takes only five grams of crack cocaine to trigger the same sentence .
Critics of the law have long maintained that it unfairly targets African - American communities , where crack is more prevalent .
" The administration believes Congress 's goal should be to completely eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine , " Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer , who heads the Justice Department 's criminal division , testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs .
Mr. Breuer said the punishments are fundamentally unfair , considering evidence showing little difference between the two forms of cocaine , plus the racial impact .
He suggested the disparity should be eliminated by relaxing crack sentences , rather than by raising powder - cocaine penalties , as some have suggested .
The administration 's stance reverses statements made by the Justice Department during the Bush administration , which opposed treating the two versions of cocaine the same .
It 's also the latest evidence from the administration and others that attitudes may be changing on handling the nation 's drug problems .
Many Netflix subscribers already enjoy online streaming access to some 12,000 movies and TV shows , but they may also eventually be able to stream premium movies and original series ' from cable channels like HBO .
The company revealed that it's at least entertaining such an idea through a question on a recent consumer survey , though customers would have to pay another $ 10 per month to get access to the premium content .
The survey was sent to a handful of Netflix customers , and it asked whether they would be interested in such a service ( a screenshot is available at Hacking Netflix ) .
Specifically , the page says that customers would pay an additional $ 9.99 on top of their normal Netflix subscriptions and that they could watch the premium content on their computers and on a number of other Netflix - capable devices , like the Roku , Xbox 360 , and TiVo .
The number of DVDs available as part of the subscription would not change , and customers would still have access to all the currently available online content .
Some of the HBO original series listed in the survey include The Wire , Rome , Curb Your Enthusiasim , and Flight of the Concords , and the movies include Children of Men , I Am Legend , and Jumper .
The survey question also asks customers if they would continue to watch HBO content on DVD if they did not choose to pay extra to instantly watch the videos online .
Clearly , Netflix is trying to weigh the pros and cons of whether adding such a service ( and paying the corresponding licensing fees ) would entice new customers to start paying extra , or whether people would rather continue watching HBO content the old - fashioned way .
Netflix first started offering streaming content to subscribers in 2007 , and over the past two years , the company 's already - popular subscriptions have skyrocketed .
Most recently , Netflix noted that subscribers who watch TV and movie content online tend to rent fewer DVDs than those who only use the service for the by - mail rentals , indicating that online video does indeed compete for the same piece of the pie as physical media .
Though the cannibalization is no skin off Netflix 's back , since subscribers have to pay the same rates in order to get access to both , the company is undoubtedly looking for different ways to expand its online offerings and , as Zatz Not Funny points out , a premium tier of online access could help usher in better movie deals from a plethora of studios .
When Matt Smith takes over as the BBC 's favorite Time Lord next year , he wo n't be the only new look on an old favorite ; rumors are surfacing that the Tardis is also getting a redesign .

British newspaper the Daily Mirror is reporting that the interior of Doctor Who 's home will be given " a radical new look " when the show returns for its fifth season in 2010 .
The decision was , according to the paper , made by incoming showrunner Stephen Moffat , in part to make sure that the time machine will look good in high - definition .
An anonymous source told the paper that the new look will be " the most hitech , intricate Tardis ever , " which makes me a little nervous .
The Tardis ... high tech ?
I kind of liked the steampunk chic of the Russell T. Davies era , myself ...

A BEAUFORT policeman accused of letting a woman he slept with get away with driving offences was yesterday cleared of all misconduct charges .
The jury returned a not guilty verdict to three counts of misconduct in a public office following a seven - day trial in the County Court in Ballarat .
Outside court yesterday , 53 - year - old Rex Charles Buncle said the trial had been the " worst experience of his life " .
A police officer for more than 20 years , he expressed relief at the jury 's decision .
" It was a correct decision and a very just one and I 'm very happy with it , " he said .
Mr Buncle said the whole process had been difficult .
" It 's been the worst experience of my life to face a jury and a judge , " he said .
Mr Buncle 's lawyer Geoffrey Steward said they had got " a fair trial and a just result " .
During the trial the prosecution alleged Mr Buncle had failed in his duty as a policeman by not conducting radio checks or a preliminary breath test on a woman he observed on his way home from work about 2 am on June 24 , 2007 .
The court heard the woman was in a car with no registration plates and her breath smelt of alcohol .
Mr Buncle drove the woman to the Ballarat Railway Station but she refused to get out and they went back to his house and had sex .
The next morning Mr Buncle dropped the woman back at her car on the way to an accident .
Mr Steward said Mr Buncle was a " good bloke " who had given the woman a " bit of a go " and that had blown up in his face .
The woman was pulled up by Horsham police later that day and charged with driving while disqualified and driving an unregistered car .
Mr Steward said yesterday that a decision on whether Mr Buncle would return to police services would be made by Victoria Police .

In A Lesson in the Importance of Language Design , Zbigniew Lukasiak raised the question " How do we argue that this API is more elegant than that ? "
It 's a good question .
There 's more art to it than science .
Yet good art always includes craft , so I believe that it 's possible to identify several principles which contribute to elegance .
The first is conciseness : saying a lot with a few words .
The Inelegant Way
This code for declaring a class which inherits from a parent and overrides methods in Perl 5 is idiomatic and familiar to many Perl programmers :
package Some :: Class ; use Modern : : Perl ; use base ' Parent : : Class ' ; # or @ Some : : Class :: ISA = ' Parent : : Class ' ; # or if you 're paranoid BEGIN { @ Some : : Class :: ISA = ' Parent : : Class ' } ; # or use vars ' ISA ' ; @ISA = ' Parent : : Class ' ; # or our @ISA = ' Parent : : Class ' ; sub foo { ... } sub bar { ... } 1 ;
I 've written before about how many Perl specific concepts you need to understand to write or comprehend this code .
There are several -- a package is a class , the package global @ISA contains all parent classes in method resolution order , the base pragma has certain advantages and disadvantages , methods are subs with an invocant , etc .
You do n't have to know all of these to write modern Perl , but you should be familiar with the underlying mechanisms to some degree .
What 's atop is just syntax .
( Careful readers might note that parent may supplant base as the preferred inheritance pragma , for various subtle reasons . )
Would you call this code elegant ?
There 's a simplicity to it , but a lack of uniformity .
There 's an orthogonal minimalism to other parts of Perl 5 .
Is it elegant ?
Consider an alternative .
The Concise Way
use MooseX :: Declare ; use Modern : : Perl ; class Some : : Class extends Parent : : Class { method foo { ... } method bar { ... } }
Can anyone deny that this example is more concise than the first example ?
Reading it is straightforward , even though the underlying mechanism is the same .
The differences are merely syntax .
The second example has little or no superfluous concepts .
It does not expose the underlying mechanism .
It does not ( ab) use other Perl concepts ( such as the import ( ) mechanism of use ) visibly .
It reads declaratively .
Is there anything in the code that 's unnecessary ?
It 's concise .
Not all elegant code needs special syntax , but sometimes a little bit of syntax can make a lot of inelegance just go away .

Tenía veinticuatro años , volaba a ras del mar y estaba a punto de bombardear un destructor y una fragata misilística .
Le decían Piano porque se llamaba Guillermo Dellepiane , y era alférez en una fuerza que no tenía héroes ni próceres porque jamás había entrado en combate .
Se trataba de la primera misión de su vida y acababa de despegar de Río Gallegos .
Su padre se había muerto sin poder cumplir el sueño de realizar en el terreno de la realidad lo que a lo largo de toda su carrera había simulado hacer : la guerra del aire .
Tan inquietante como entrar en batalla debe de resultar el hecho de consagrar una vida a un acontecimiento que no ocurrirá .
Guerreros de la teoría y el entrenamiento , muchos cazadores se reciben , se desarrollan y se retiran sin haber cazado jamás una presa verdadera .
El padre de Piano , cerca de la jubilación , había muerto hacía dos años en un accidente absurdo , cuando se derrumbó un ala del edificio Cóndor .
Volando hacia el blanco en un A - 4B
Skyhawk , el hijo venía a cumplir ahora la escena deseada y urdida por el fantasma de su padre .
Era el 12 de mayo de 1982 y una escuadrilla de ocho aviones argentinos avanzaba en silencio de radio hacia dos barcos británicos .
Los cuatro primeros iban adelante y dispararían primero .
Los cuatro halcones de atrás , a una distancia prudencial , tendrían una segunda oportunidad o entrarían a rematarlos .
Para Piano , era una misión iniciática , la última lección de un profesional de la guerra : la guerra misma .
Hasta entonces todo habían sido aprendizajes y pruebas .
Alférez es el primer escalafón de los oficiales , y Dellepiane ni siquiera había experimentado el reabastecimiento en vuelo , una compleja operación que en este caso consistía en acercarse volando a un Hércules , encajar la lanza de la trompa del A - 4B en la canasta de combustible y cargar tanques para seguir viaje .
Muchos fallaban en ese intento : se ponían nerviosos y no podían meter la lanza .
" Mirá si yo no puedo , es una vergüenza " , se decía .
Estaba más preocupado por ese bochorno que por la muerte .
Pero cuando tuvo al Hércules frente a frente no falló , y rápidamente se unió a su jefe , un primer teniente , que ordenó bajar a menos de quince metros de las olas y avanzar a toda máquina .
Volaban tan bajo que dejaban estelas en el mar .
Evadiendo misiles
Con el alma en vilo escucharon que , cinco minutos antes de llegar al blanco , los primeros cuatro aviones atacaban .
En el horizonte no se veía nada pero
Piano se dio cuenta en seguida de que a sus compañeros no les había ido muy bien .
En dos minutos supieron que tres aviones habían sido alcanzados por la artillería antiaérea y que habían sido derribados en medio de hongos de fuego y estampidos de agua .
El cuarto avión regresaba por las suyas .
El sol volvía espléndido un día negro .
Negrísimo .
Piano vio de repente los buques enemigos .
Eran efectivamente dos y les estaban disparando .
En ese momento no pensaba en la patria ni en Dios , sólo veía con una cierta incredulidad esa película fantástica y en technicolor .
La veía como si él no fuera parte de ella .
Era un espectáculo corto y alucinante pero sin ruidos , porque en la cabina no se oía nada .
Fueron fracciones de segundos : Piano contuvo el aliento verificando la velocidad y la altura , y en el momento exacto en el que pasaba por encima de uno de los dos barcos , mientras recibía y eludía disparos de todo tipo , apretó el botón y soltó una bomba de mil libras .
Las bombas impactaron en el destructor y le abrieron agujeros horribles y definitivos .
Quedó fuera de servicio , pero eso Piano lo supo mucho después porque en ese instante lo único que pudo hacer fue salir rápido de la ratonera evadiendo misiles y huyendo a toda velocidad .
Cuando una escuadrilla dispara , los aviones se dispersan y cada uno regresa como puede .
El joven alférez se sintió solo unos minutos pero de pronto divisó la nave de su jefe y la alcanzó .
No podían hablarse , porque las navegaciones aéreas eran en silencio , pero volaban juntos , como hermanos , a una distancia de doscientos metros uno del otro , con el infierno atrás y el continente adelante .
Habían cumplido y volvían con la gloria ; era una extraña y grata sensación .
Hasta que de repente un proyectil rasante surgido de la niebla pegó en un alerón del avión del primer teniente .
Fue un golpe mortal a velocidad infinita que le hizo dar una vuelta de campana , pegarse contra la superficie del océano y explotar en mil pedazos .
Todo en un pestañeo de ojos .
Piano lo vio sin poder creerlo pero sin dejar de apretar el acelerador .
Descendió todavía más y prácticamente aró el mar con un gusto metálico en la boca .
Dependía emocionalmente de su jefe .
Había bajado por un momento la guardia , pensando " me va a llevar a casa " , pero ahora estaba solo y desesperado .
Ahora dependía únicamente de su propia pericia , o de su suerte .
Voló un rato de esa manera , huyendo del diablo , y luego , cuando estuvo seguro de que no lo seguían , avisó al Hércules C- 130 , que los cazadores le llaman " La Chancha " , e inició el ascenso .
" La Chancha " puso la canasta y sin perder el pulso el joven alférez empujó la lanza y recargó combustible .
Después voló el último tramo casi a ciegas : el mar había formado una gruesa capa de salitre en el parabrisas del avión .
El salitre de la desolación le nublaba a Piano los ojos .
Lo más duro era entrar en la habitación de un compañero muerto , juntar su ropa , hacer su valija y dejarla en el vestíbulo del hotel donde pernoctaba su escuadrón .
Ese ritual lo esperaba en Río Gallegos al final de aquel día en el que finalmente había tenido su bautismo de fuego en el Atlántico Sur .
Los dioses , como decía la vieja sentencia griega , castigan a los hombres cumpliéndoles los sueños .
En los años sucesivos sólo recordaría esa primera misión .
Y la última .
En el medio únicamente quedaban vuelos de reconocimiento , incursiones en la zona del Fitz Roy , nervios terribles y más caídos y duelos .
También el ánimo de los mecánicos , que siempre despedían a los pilotos de combate con banderas y aclamaciones , y el regreso de la base al hotel que , con éxito o sin éxito , con muertos o sin ellos , hacían en un jeep o en una camioneta Ford F100 cantando canciones contra los ingleses .
No tenían , por supuesto , la menor idea de cómo iba la guerra .
Y cuando los trasladaron a San Julián sufrieron cierta tristeza : ocuparon una hostería y anduvieron por esa peque ña ciudad en estado de alerta total .
No eran muy supersticiosos , pero tenían cábalas y de hecho no se sacaban fotos entre ellos porque creían instintivamente que eternizarse en esas imágenes significaba un pasaje directo hacia la desgracia .
Nada pensaron , sin embargo , de aquella misión en día 13 : estaba nublado y frío , y a Piano y a sus compañeros les ordenaron partir hacia las islas .
Decían que los ingleses habían desembarcado y que se luchaba cuerpo a cuerpo en tierra .
Los A - 4B llevaban bombas , cohetes y cañones .
Piano estaba , como siempre , ansioso .
Aunque esa ansiedad solía terminarse cuando lo ataban en la cabina y había que salir al ruedo .
Los nervios entonces desaparecían , como el torero que siente un nudo en el estómago hasta que baja a la arena y enfrenta con su capote al toro .
Pero el despegue no fue tan fácil .
Se rompieron unos caños de líquido hidráulico y hubo que buscar a mil quinientos metros un avión gemelo .
Al alférez lo desesperaba que su escuadrilla partiera sin él , de manera que se subió al otro A - 4B y empezó el rodaje sin cargar el sistema Omega , que permitía coordinar y volar con precisión .
Piano no quería quedarse en San Julián , y como los suyos ya se habían marchado llamó al jefe de la segunda escuadrilla y le pidió permiso para plegarse a su grupo .
Le dieron el visto bueno y despegó sin tener bien configurado el avión .
Ascendió y buscó entre las nubes el rumbo , y encontró en un momento al Hércules , que llevaba doce hombres y tenía la orden de no entrar en la zona de la batalla ni quedar al alcance de los misiles enemigos por ningún motivo .
Cargó combustible y siguió a su guía por el norte de las islas Malvinas , luego tomó dirección Este a vuelo rasante y hacia el Sur bajo chaparrones .
Y se sorprendió al escuchar que el operador de radar de las islas preguntó si había aviones en vuelo .
El jefe de la formación le respondió con un pedido , que les proporcionaran las posiciones de las patrullas de Sea Harriers .
Cuando llegó el informe verbal los pilotos argentinos sintieron un escalofrío .
Había cuatro patrullas en el aire y una quinta al norte del estrecho de San Carlos .
El cielo estaba infestado de aviones ingleses .
Era una trampa mortal , y la lógica indicaba regresar de inmediato al continente .
Pero ya estaban a cinco minutos del objetivo y el día se había despejado , y entonces el guía tomó la resolución de seguir .
Después descubrirían que estaban atacando un enorme vivac armado por los ingleses en Monte Dos Hermanas .
Más de dos manzanas con carpas , containers y helicópteros , un campamento desde donde dirigía la guerra el general Jeremy Moore .
Todo ocurría en el término de minutos .
Los A - 4B iban a ochocientos kilómetros por hora y a veinte metros de distancia entre unos y otros .
Los pilotos temían que una fragata misilística les cortara el paso antes de llegar al blanco .
No llevaban armamento para atacar un buque ; las bombas tenían espoletas para objetivos terrestres .
Por la gran movilización de helicópteros de esa zona los generales de Puerto Argentino habían conjeturado que allí podía estar el mismísimo centro de operaciones de los británicos .
Y no se equivocaban .
Las cartas de vuelo decían que el ataque debía hacerse a las 12.15 .
Y faltaban dos minutos .
Los cazadores pasaron por encima de la bahía San Luis y el operador del radar de Malvinas les advirtió que los Harriers los habían detectado y que ya convergían sobre ellos .
Cuando faltaban un minuto y veinte segundos la escuadrilla casi despeinó a un soldado inglés que subía una loma .
Ahora los aviones , en la corrida final , volaban pegados al suelo .
Más allá de la elevación apareció el campamento .
Y Jeremy Moore evacuó su carpa un minuto antes de que le cayeran los obuses .
Dellepiane lanzó sus tres bombas de 250 kilos , provocó destrozos , y percibió que les tiraban con todo lo que tenían .
Desde misiles y artillería antiaérea hasta con armas de mano .
Era un festival de fuegos artificiales .
Y casi todos los pilotos se desprendieron de los tanques de reserva y de los portamisiles e hicieron una curva para regresar por el Norte , cada uno librado a su inteligencia .
Piano voló haciendo maniobras de elusión y acrobacias , y sintió impactos en el fuselaje .
Era otra vez un espectáculo increíble y aterrador .
A la altura de Monte Kent se topó con un helicóptero Sea King en pleno vuelo y le disparó .
Salieron dos proyectiles y se le trabó el cañón , pero una bala pegó en las palas y obligó al piloto inglés a un aterrizaje de emergencia .
Enseguida , por la izquierda , vio que pasaban dos bolas de fuego que iban directamente hacia el avión de su teniente , así que le gritó por la radio " Cierre por derecha " y siguió virando hasta ver que los misiles pasaban de largo y se perdían .
Más adelante se topó con otro Sea King y volvió a intentar dispararle , pero también fue en vano : el cañón no se destrababa .
Así que en el último instante levantó el Skyhawk y pasó a centímetros de las aspas del helicóptero para evitar que el piloto de casco verde lo liquidara con su gatillo .
Fue más o menos en ese instante cuando se dio cuenta de que estaba sucediendo algo inesperado : se estaba quedando sin combustible .
Un proyectil le había perforado el tanque , y tenía sólo 2000 libras .
Precisaba más del doble para alcanzar la posición de " La Chancha " .
Pero no pensaba en ese momento crucial en llegar a ningún lado sino en escapar del acoso de los Harriers .
Se desprendió entonces de los portamisiles y siguió volando un trecho pidiéndole al radar de Malvinas que le dijera , sin tecnicismos y con precisión , dónde estaban sus verdugos .
Los Harriers volaban a una distancia considerable , así que ya sobre el norte del estrecho San Carlos dudó sobre si debía eyectarse en la isla o tratar de llegar al Hércules .
Sus maestros , en las lecciones teóricas , le habían recomendado siempre que en una situación semejante intentara regresar .
Eyectarse significaba perder el avión y caer prisionero .
Cruzar significaba enfrentar el riesgo de no lograrlo y terminar en el mar .
Si caía no podría sobrevivir más de quince minutos en las aguas heladas , y no había posibilidades operativas de que ninguna nave pudiera rescatarlo a tiempo .
Sus compañeros , por radio , trataban de darle consejos y sacarlo del dilema .
Pero su jefe tronó : " Déjenlo a Piano que decida " .
Y entonces Piano decidió .
Salió a alta mar , se puso en la frecuencia del Hércules y comenzó a conversar con el piloto que lo comandaba .
Dos hombres hicieron ese día caso omiso a las órdenes de los altos mandos : el piloto de " La Chancha " salió de su posición de protección , entró en la zona de peligro y avanzó a toda máquina al encuentro del A - 4B de Piano , y un oficial de San Julián tuvo un arrebato , se subió a un helicóptero y se metió doscientas millas en el mar a buscarlo , un vuelo completamente irregular y arriesgado que no ayudaba pero que mostró el coraje suicida del piloto y la desesperación con que se seguía en tierra la suerte de aquel cazador herido de combustible que intentaba volver a casa .
El alférez escuchó " Vamos a buscarte " y trató de mantener el optimismo , pero el liquidómetro le indicaba a cada rato que no conseguiría salir vivo de aquel último viaje .
" ¿A qué distancia están ? " - preguntaba cada tres minutos -. " ¿A qué distancia están ? "
La radio se llenaba de voces : " Dale , pendejo , con fe , con fe que llegás " .
El alférez sacaba cuentas sobre la cantidad de combustible , que se extinguía dramáticamente , y pronosticaba que se vendría abajo .
Y sus oyentes redoblaban los gritos de aliento : " ¡ Tranquilo , pibe , con eso te alcanza y sobra ! "
Sabía que le estaban mintiendo .
Cuando llegó a 200 libras se dio por perdido .
De un momento a otro el motor se plantaría y se iría directamente al mar .
Comida para peces .
Cuando llegó a 150 libras recordó que eso equivalía , más o menos , a dos minutos de vuelo .
" ¡ No me abandonen ! " - los puteó , porque había silencio en la línea - .
De repente el piloto del Hércules C - 130 creyó verlo , pero era un compañero .
Piano pasó de la euforia a la depresión en quince segundos .
No rezaba en esas instancias , sólo le venían relámpagos del recuerdo de su padre .
El fantasma estaba dentro de aquella cabina , metido en sus auriculares .
" Dame una mano , viejo " , le pedía guturalmente , con las cuerdas vocales y con los ventrículos del corazón .
El liquidómetro marcó entonces cero , y de pronto Piano escuchó que lo habían divisado y vio por fin a " La Chancha " .
La vio cruzando el cielo , hacia la derecha y bien abajo .
Le pidió al piloto que se pusiera en posición y se largó en picada sin forzar los motores , planeando hacia la canasta salvadora .
Cuando la tuvo enfrente le dio máxima potencia con una lágrima de combustible en el tanque y al ponerse a tiro pulsó el freno de vuelo y metió la lanza .
Todos atronaban de alegría en la radio y se abrazaban en tierra .
Piano también gritaba , pero quería abastecerse rápido , retomar el control y regresar a San Julián por su propia cuenta .
Pronto descubrieron que eso no era posible .
Todo el combustible que entraba , pasaba al tanque y caía por el orificio .
" Quedate enganchado " , le dijo el piloto del Hércules .
No tenían alternativa .
Volaron así acoplados el resto del camino , perdiendo combustible y con el riesgo de una explosión o de no llegar a tiempo .
Fue otra carrera dramática hasta que vieron el golfo y luego la base .
Entonces el A - 4B se desprendió y chorreando líquido letal buscó la pista .
Piano intentó bajar el tren de aterrizaje pero la rueda de nariz se resistía .
Estaba todo el personal de la base de San Julián esperando , y él dando vueltas , dejando estelas de combustible de avión y tratando de lograr que esa maldita rueda bajara .
Finalmente bajó , y el alférez aterrizó , se desató rápido , se quitó el casco , saltó al asfalto y se alejó corriendo del enorme lago de combustible que se formaba a los pies del A - 4B .
Medalla al valor
Hubo fiesta hasta tarde y felicidad desenfrenada en San Julián .
Como
Piano se consideraba vivo de milagro se tomó muchas copas y tuvieron que acompañarlo hasta su habitación : se durmió con una sonrisa y se despertó muy tarde .
Era el 14 de junio de 1982 y sus compañeros le informaron que la Argentina se había rendido .
Gracias a una licencia providencial , dos días después ya estaba en Buenos Aires .
La ciudad permanecía hundida en la ira y en la depresión .
Y también en la indiferencia .
Cualquiera que se cruzaba con Piano se le acercaba con precaución y al rato le pedía que contara todo lo que había vivido .
Pero Piano no tenía ganas de contar nada .
Durante años soñó con aquellas piruetas mortales , aquellos vuelos rasantes , aquellas muertes : insomnio pertinaz y espectros atemorizantes que lo perseguían como Sea Harriers impiadosos .
Le dieron la Medalla al Valor en Combate , y se mantuvo dentro de la Fuerza Aérea haciendo una callada carrera con foja intachable y mucha capacitación profesional .
Hace dos años fue enviado como agregado aeronáutico a Londres .
Los ingleses lo recibieron como un gran guerrero .
En la misma tradición de Wellington y de Napoleón , los ejércitos europeos aún practican el honor para sus antiguos y respetables enemigos .
Las aspas atravesadas del Sea King que había derribado Piano en Monte Kent están en el Museo de la Royal Navy , y el helicopterista que conducía aquel día está vivo pero retirado .
Piano consiguió su teléfono y conversó afectuosamente con él .
" Me alegra no haberlo matado " , se dijo .
Los veteranos ingleses que lucharon en el Atlántico
Sur tienen un enorme respeto por los aviadores argentinos .
Y sienten nostalgias por aquellos tiempos : " Fue la última guerra convencional - dicen - .
Unos frente a los otros por un territorio concreto .
Hoy todo se hace a distancia , metidos en terrenos sin fronteras definidas y por causas borrosas , con terrorismos atomizados y combatientes religiosos eternos .
Con esos enemigos al final no podemos juntarnos a tomar una cerveza " .
Aquel alférez , convertido en comodoro , fue invitado una tarde a entregar un premio en la escuela de aviación de la RAF .
Por la noche , los pilotos de guerra recién recibidos y sus señores oficiales cenaban en un salón majestuoso de mesas larguísimas .
Piano ocupó un lugar privilegiado , y el director de la escuela pidió silencio y habló del piloto argentino .
Se sabía su currículum bélico de memoria y en su discurso mostraba el orgullo de tener esa noche a un hombre que había luchado de verdad contra ellos .
El jueves pasado Guillermo Dellepiane asumió como director de la Escuela de Guerra Aérea en Buenos Aires .
Ocupa un despacho en el Edificio Cóndor , donde murió su padre .
Piano es ahora un cincuentón bajo y gordito .
Se le cayó el pelo , es sumamente cordial y tiene un pensamiento moderno , y por supuesto en la calle nadie lo reconoce .
Nadie sabe que forma parte de la hermandad del honor , y que es un héroe imborrable de una guerra maldita .
In another case , which is pending , The Associated Press sued the online news distributor All Headline News last year , saying that it had improperly copied A.P. articles .
The legal disputes are emblematic of a larger question that has emerged from the Internet ’s link economy .
The editors of many Web sites , including ones operated by the Times Company , post excerpts from competitors ’ content from time to time .
At what point does excerpting from an article become illegal copying ?
Courts have not provided much of an answer .
In the United States , the copyright law provides a four - point definition of fair use , which takes into consideration the purpose ( commercial vs. educational ) and the substantiality of the excerpt .
But editors in search of a legal word limit are sorely disappointed .
Even before the Internet , lawyers lamented that the fair use factors “ did n’t map well onto real life , ” said Mr. Ardia , whose Citizen Media Law Project is part of the Berkman Center at Harvard Law School .
“ New modes of creation , reuse , mixing and mash - ups made possible by digital technologies and the Internet have made it even more clear that Congress ’s attempt to define fair use is woefully inadequate . ”
For now , Web sites are defining it themselves .
Sites like Alley Insider and The Huffington Post are ad - supported businesses that filter the Web for readers , highlighting what they deem to be the most meaningful parts of newspaper articles and TV segments .
Alley Insider , according to its editor in chief , Henry Blodget , operates under a digital golden rule : “ To excerpt others the way we want to be excerpted ourselves . ”
The post about Ms. Noonan ’s column , including five full paragraphs , had explicit credits to the author and the newspaper , three links to the source and a direct encouragement to users to read the original column .
Alley Insider doubtlessly exposed new readers to Ms. Noonan ’s column , and an unknown number of users followed the links to The Journal ’s Web site .
But others probably did not follow the link , meaning that Alley Insider alone  and not The Journal  reaped the advertising pennies from the excerpt .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The number of homes under contract to be sold fell 4 % in November , according to a report released Tuesday .
The Pending Home Sales Index fell 4 % to 82.3 for the month of November , to its lowest level since the series began in 2001 , according to the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) .
That 's a drop from a downwardly revised reading of 85.7 in the month of October .
The November index is 5.3 % below the same month a year ago , when the Index stood at 86.9 .
A combination of factors kept home buyers side - lined , according to Mike Larson , real estate analyst at Weiss Research .
" You have the recession , rising unemployment , slumping consumer confidence and tighter mortgage standards are the icing on the cake , " he said .
The reading of pending home sales is a forward - looking index that tracks when sales contracts are signed but a deal has yet to be closed .
Sales are typically finalized within one or two months of signing the contract .
However , one analyst cautioned that a signed contract does not necessarily translate into a final sale these days , given the current market turmoil .
Some potential home buyers may sign a contract but then can't get a mortgage due to stricter lending standards , said Patrick Newport , economist with IHS Global Insight .
Other people may have signed the initial papers and then changed their minds because the economic outlook has deteriorated so much , " he added .
Even as home prices have fallen to record lows , the recession has certainly stopped plenty of other buyers from even thinking about making a move .
" December 's housing market activity could be comparably lower due to ongoing problems in the economy , so a real estate - focused stimulus plan [ from the government ] is urgently needed , " NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a written statement .
Mortgage rates : November 's pending sales activity does not reflect the 37 - year lows that mortgage rates hit in December .
The average 30 - year , fixed - rate loan declined to 5.1 % , with 0.7 up - front points , for the week ending December 31 , according to Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) .
But so far , the dip in mortgage rates has primarily caused a spike in mortgage refinancing , rather than in new home sales , according to Newport .
" I do n't think [ low mortgage rates ] will have that much of an impact on sales - it will have some impact - but not that much , " he added .
NAR President Charles McMillan , a broker with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Dallas - Fort Worth disagrees .
He urged Congress to provide stimulus for the housing market so that home buyers can take advantage of the drastically reduced home mortgage rates .
" It 's crucial for Congress and the new administration to move quickly to remove impediments and offer home buyers the incentives they need to tap into today 's historic low mortgage interest rates , " he said .
NAR expects the 30 year fixed rate to hold fairly steady through the first half of 2009 , but then to rise slightly in the second half of the year .
Regional breakdown : Pending home sales across all regions were down from October to November .
But sales in the West were actually up significantly from November 2007 .
The pending home sales index fell 7.2 % to 63.2 in the Northeast and stood 14.6 % below its November 2007 levels .
In the Midwest , the index slipped 6.7 % to 74.2 and was down 10.1 % year - over - year .
In the South month - to - month losses were more modest , with the pending home sales index down 2.2 % to 85.3 , but it was off 12.7 % from a year ago .
In the West , however , while the index was down 2.4 % in the month to 101.2 , pending sales jumped 19.3 % from November 2007 .
That sales increase is due to the dramatic drop in home prices in states like California , Arizona and Nevada , which has spurred new deals , according to Larson .
" You are having a lot of foreclosures in those three states and banks are just cutting the prices until those homes sell , " added Newport .
Despite a flurry of activity in the West , Larson warned that the housing market recovery would be slow and gradual .
" We still have a much higher level of inventory than usual , " he said , " and it will take quite some time to chew through some of that overhang . "

Last weekend , Harvard University sponsored a conference called ( I am not making this up ) " The Free Market Mindset : History , Psychology , and Consequences . "
Its purpose was to try to figure out why , since everyone knows the current crisis amounts to a failure of the market economy , the stupid rubes continue to believe in it .
The promotional literature for the conference opened with That Quotation from Alan Greenspan — the one in which he suggested that there was , after all , a " flaw " in the free market he had n't noticed before .
Well , that does it , then !
If our Soviet commissar in charge of money and interest rates says the free market does n't work , who are you to disagree ?
The promotional material continues :
If the current state of the U.S. economy makes clear that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan 's faith in free markets was misplaced , the question remains : what was it about free markets that proved — and still continues to prove — so alluring to economists , scholars , and policy - makers alike ?
Because , of course , if there 's one guiding principle behind the largest government in world history , it 's free markets .
Ahem .
This conference , we were told ,
brings together leading scholars in law , economics , social psychology , and social cognition to present and discuss their research regarding the historical origins , psychological antecedents , and policy consequences of the free market mindset .
Their work illustrates that the magic of the marketplace is partially an illusion based on faulty assumptions and outmoded approaches .
The speakers then spent the day , I am sure , laying out their own faulty assumptions and outmoded approaches , and studiously ignoring the Austrian School of economics .
In short , the conference was about this :
Why do people still think the interaction of free individuals is a superior economic system to one directed by Harvard Ph.D.s like us ?
I mean , apart from the failure of central planning in every case in which it 's been tried , a failure so staggering that only a blockhead could miss it , why would people cling to the idea that being herded into a collective run by the experts is n't the best way to live ?
So by assuming from the outset the very thing that needs to be proven — namely , that the current state of the economy just occurred spontaneously , as the result of wicked market forces — our betters relieve themselves of the need to consider that central banking , a government - established institution , just might have had , you know , a little something to do with what happened .
George Reisman has already demonstrated the absurdity of referring to our present system as a " free - market " one .
Naturally , of course , none of the participants bothered to notice that a Soviet commissar in charge of money and interest rates amounts to something like the opposite of the free market , or that the economic distortions he causes cannot , therefore , be the fault of the free market .
This is exactly why , in my book Meltdown , I call the Fed " the elephant in the living room . "
We 're not supposed to notice it , and we 're supposed to pretend the damage it causes is the result of wildcat capitalism , unfettered free markets , or whatever other juvenile phrase is currently in vogue to describe the usual bogeyman .
Now I do n't want to list all the paper topics at this conference , since it'd be a shame to make all of you feel stupid for having frittered away your weekend when you could have listened to , say , Stephen Marglin 's paper on " How Thinking Like an Economist Undermines Community . "
Now there 's a topic I have n't heard quite enough platitudes about .
( If you must , you can view the whole schedule here . )
You could also have heard a bunch of totally conventional polemics about how the market economy allows for " too much " pollution , when in fact a genuine free market — which , I need hardly point out , is not actually considered in any of these alleged papers — would punish polluters and bring about the internalization of so - called externalities .
Murray Rothbard dealt with this matter in an extremely important article none of the participants had read .
I wonder if anyone at the conference asked questions like these :
When Greenspan flooded the economy with newly created money and brought interest rates down to destructively low levels , thereby distorting entrepreneurial calculation as well as consumers ' home - purchasing decisions , was that the fault of the free market ?
Do you think the Fed 's creation of cheap credit out of thin air makes market participants more careful or less careful in how they allocate borrowed funds ?
When Alan Greenspan bailed out Long Term Capital Management in 1998 , was that a " free market " phenomenon ?
Do you think he thereby encouraged more or less risk taking among other major market actors ?
The Financial Times spoke in 2000 , in the wake of the dot - com boom , of an increasing concern that the so - called " Greenspan put " was injecting into the economy " a destructive tendency toward excessively risky investment supported by hopes that the Fed will help if things go bad . "
" All the insane dot - com investment we 've seen , all this destruction of capital , all the crazy excesses of the past few years would n't have happened without the easy credit accommodated by the Fed , " added financial consultant Michael Belkin .
Did the free market cause that ?
Do lending standards decline for no particular reason , or could this phenomenon have a teensy weensy bit to do with ( a ) government regulation aimed at increasing " homeownership " and ( b ) loose monetary policy by the Fed ?
( When the banks get the additional reserves the Fed creates , they naturally want to lend it out — and in order to do so , they wind up lending it to people they either have or would have rejected previously .
As I show in Meltdown , the phenomenon of lax lending standards in the wake of an inflationary boom by a central bank is traceable all the way to the 19th century .
There is nothing even slightly unexpected — or market - driven — about it . )
Questions like these could go on and on .
Not one , you can be certain , was raised at this conference .
Now if you really wanted to sponsor an event whose purpose was to try to understand why people believe inane things that have been falsified by reality , you 'd do much better to hold a conference on socialism , or on Keynes and his school .
It would be fascinating to learn the psychological motivation behind the persistence of Keynesian economics , whose popular version is a nonfalsifiable , ersatz religion .
Is Japan 's economy still suffering ?
Why , that 's because Japan did n't spend enough — even though it spent so much that it became the most indebted country in the developed world .
Have people spent so much that they 're now burdened with debt they can't possibly repay ?
Then we need more spending .
Is the economy a distorted mess after an artificial boom ?
Then instead of letting the economy restructure itself along sustainable lines , let 's instead " stimulate " the system just as it is , with the goal of bringing about more " consumption , " more " labor " employed , and higher " income , " without bothering to disaggregate any of these things and deciding what kinds of labor need to go where , what kinds of consumption are sustainable and what are figments of the bubble economy , or how the capital structure needs to be reassembled in order to cater to genuine consumer demand .
In fact , let 's actually boast about neglecting capital theory altogether ( as indeed Keynes did in a 1937 article in the Quarterly Journal of Economics ) .
Here 's another thought : given how many Keynesian economists predicted a return to depression conditions when World War II spending came to an end , and that what we instead got was the single most robust year the private economy has ever seen , is n't it a little strange that not one of these economists went back and reexamined his premises ?
On the other hand , consider the names Jim Grant , Peter Schiff , Ron Paul , and Jim Rogers .
Apart from having predicted the current crisis — unlike anyone at the Harvard conference and indeed unlike the paper - tiger economists they unsurprisingly preferred to spar with during their deep - thinking session last weekend — one thing these men have in common is that they are all Austrian economists , they all believe in the Austrian theory of the business cycle , and they all pin the blame for the crisis on the Fed , a nonmarket institution .
These men believe in the real free market , not the centrally planned market of Alan Greenspan , Ben Bernanke , and the Federal Reserve .
And they saw a crisis coming at a time when everyone else was predicting new highs for the Dow and singing the praises of a world economy that was more robust than it had ever been .
Maybe that 's why people believe in market economics : unlike the Rube Goldberg models of their counterparts in the profession , the things Austrian economists write and say actually have some connection to the real world .
People who believe in the market economy support a social order in which free individuals make voluntary contracts with each other , and no one can initiate physical force against anyone else .
Is that vision so obviously unattractive that we have to refer its supporters for psychological evaluation ?
We might instead wonder at the psychological condition of those who would denounce such a system : might they be motivated , for all their noble talk , by nothing but base envy of those with more material wealth than they , or by a pathological desire to dominate other people ?
I 'm sure that will be covered at next year 's conference .

Google policy analyst Derek Slater — who 's so obviously related to Christian Slater — explains how to reshape broadband in the US .
Step one :
Own the actual pipes that run to your house .

Click to viewSounds crazy , but he cites the historical example of rural telephony , where the public owned the wire , not private companies .
It 'd work like this : A city or neighborhood would all have fiber run to it at once , and then you 'd purchase a share of the fiber and connect to whatever ISP you want .
There 'd be a connection point where any company could pay to set up equipment and offer service , which is sort of how it works in Amsterdam , Slater explains .
Once a normal thing , it 's now a pretty powerful idea , choosing your ISP — in most places , you do n't have a choice .
There 's Comcast .
There 's Time Warner .
Or whoever the local monopoly is .
Choice breeds competition :
Where do you think cable companies are rolling out fiber - fast internet ?
It 's not a coincidence it's where Verizon or AT&T are offering high - speed internet .
And this could be the way to speed up the painfully slow rollout of Godzilla internet in the US , especially in those rural areas .

Almost over - looked in the aftermath of the news of Oracle buying Sun , Canonical announced today , April 20th , that the final version of its next generation of Ubuntu , 9.04 , will be available for download on April 23rd .
I ’ve already reviewed the release candidate of Ubuntu 9.04 , and I like it .
I like it a lot .
Besides the main desktop release , Canonical is also releasing the Ubuntu 9.04 Netbook Remix .
This is a version that ’s designed to work well on the limited resources of a netbook like the Dell Mini 9 .
That said , you can , of course , run ordinary Ubuntu on a netbook .
The idea of the Remix is n’t just to be lightweight though .
It has an easy - to - use interface for users who could care less about Linux , or any other operating system for that matter .
While this may not be to the taste of hardcore Linux users , it may be just what ’s needed to introduce new users to Linux .
Canonical is also continuing to show that Ubuntu is not just about the desktop .
The company will also be releasing the next version of its Ubuntu Server offering .
In addition , the Server Edition will come with a preview of UEC ( Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud ) .
This will let you build your own cloud environment within your company .
Then , if your own little cloud works for you , you can look into running your applications on Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud , aka EC2 .
Good times are just ahead for both business and home Ubuntu users .

As conferences get older , they tend to require a greater burden of proof .
Program committees reject papers as " too early " , and want more demonstrations that the ideas are sound .
This is why conferences tend to lose the excitement of the early days .
Onward ! is a conference that focuses on innovative ideas about software .
The program committee is looking for ideas that , if they succeed , will make a big impact .
Though the committee has to be convinced that the idea is reasonable , it is less concerned with proof than other program committees .
Essays and full papers are due April 20 , and short papers are due June 26 .
Onward ! is also looking for workshop proposals and films .
See http://www.onward-conference.org/
Essays are an unusual and noteworthy part of Onward !
An Onward !
essay is a thoughtful reflection about some aspect of sofftware technology .
Its goal is to help the reader to share a new insight , engage with an argument , or wrestle with a dilemma .

Astrophysics are a touch bewildering .
And love is a bit of a noodle - scratcher .
But a convoluted , multi- layered plot about a genetically engineered pensioner ; now that ’s really complicated .
The following game endings are all either vague , slightly ambiguous or just downright indecipherable without advanced degrees in picking up on minuscule - but vastly important – plot details .
In an effort to make things a little easier , we ’ve broken down the following six confusing endings so they can be explained in a sentence , while also including a detailed Q&A for each for anyone who wants all the details .
Simple , eh ?
Oh , and obviously this article contains ...
MASSIVE SPOILERS !
The short version :
The princess does n’t exist , instead representing Tim ’s guilt over helping build the A - Bomb .
Once more …
The long version :
I just wanted to jump on baddies ’ heads , but now I ’m all confused .
Does Tim actually rescue the princess ?
In a word , no .
The Princess does n’t actually exist and instead represents Tim ’s obsession with the A - Bomb .
Our hero is not a brave warrior in a fantastical kingdom , but is instead actually a weapons ’ scientist based in New York .
He was involved in the Manhattan Project that gave birth to the Atomic Bomb , the first of which would be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 , effectively ending the Second World War .
So the events of the game are n’t real then ?
Nope .
The entire game is actually a succession of Tim ’s dreams and the gameplay mechanics involving time manipulation are merely in place to convey the themes of regret and the desire to do things differently that are so prevalent in his mind thanks to his involvement with the bomb .
That ’s why the final level is actually the first level and the entire game that follows is Tim ’s way of trying to replay events and change his relationship with the Princess / A - Bomb .
Super , I ’m on board now .
Things are n’t real , but still , what the hell ’s going on in the level before the epilogue ?
When you reach the end of Act 1 ( the game ’s final level ) the game rewinds .
In the normal passage of time it looks like the Princess is aiding you , so that you can be reunited .
When the level rewinds , though , you discover the truth .
The Princess is really fleeing from you , the knight who appears to capture her is actually saving her and all because , in reality , you ’re the bad guy who ’s been stalking her , not trying to rescue her .
Hmmm .
So why is Tim so obsessed with finding The Princess / A - Bomb if he ’s actually the bad guy ?
The stalking of the Princess is Tim ’s way of trying to alter events to appease his guilt for the creation of the bomb .
He knows he participated in a terrible act , which his natural inquisitiveness as a scientist drove him to .
However , he ’s got enough self - awareness to regret his actions and that ’s why levels are themed around rewinding time , stepping outside of yourself and being given a second chance .
Tim needs to find the Princess / Bomb because he seeks forgiveness .
What initially appears as a quest fuelled by heroism is actually one fuelled by obsession and remorse .
What does the epilogue mean ?
Provided you stand behind specific bits of scenery , you ’re rewarded with the game ’s true message .
Quotes like : ‘ Now we are all sons of bitches ’ – uttered by Kenneth Bainbridge , one of the scientists from the Manhattan Project after the initial testing – and : ‘ She stood tall and majestic .
She radiated fury ’ – alluding to the explosion and subsequent mushroom cloud from the A - Bomb – shows Braid is really about the regret of the birth of the atomic age .
And not merely a Mario clone where you have to save the damsel in distress .
Big Brother row as police force starts using Google camera cars to fine wayward drivers
Police are taking a leaf out of Google 's book with their latest weapon in the war on motorists .
They are using cars with spy cameras on a mast .
Drivers talking on their mobile phones , eating , applying make - up or otherwise driving illegally will be pictured .
And as the telescopic cameras can zoom in from some distance , the first inkling that they have been snapped could be when a £ 60 fine lands on the doorstep .
Police say the new cars – similar to those used by Google to map town and city streets – will help reduce road deaths .
But motorists say the Big Brother vehicles will merely be another cash cow for the Government and a further ' tax ' on hard - pressed motorists .
Little Brother is watching you :
One of the police Smart cars
The Treasury already rakes in more than £ 105 million in fines each year from speed cameras and driving - offence fixed penalties .
Two Smart cars are pioneering the scheme in Greater Manchester , where distracted motorists are said to have caused more than 400 accidents in the past two years , killing or seriously injuring 25 victims .
Drivers who are caught using their mobiles will be sent a £ 60 fine and will have three penalty points on their licence .
Those caught on camera without a seatbelt or driving erratically while eating will be fined £ 30 .
Anyone who refuses to accept a fine – which will go into Treasury coffers – could be hauled before the courts .
Karen Delaney from DriveSafe , the road safety group behind the latest scheme , said : ' Many vehicles are now better equipped than offices or homes , with the latest technology in satellite navigation , telecommunications and state - of - the - art music systems all to hand .
Spy cameras : Google 's car which takes pictures of UK streets
' Add in other distractions such as complex dashboard instrumentation , a hot cup of coffee and a conversation with other vehicle occupants , and it is no wonder that some drivers are not paying attention . '
She added : ' The Smart enforcement vehicles are fully police liveried and working in areas where our data analysis has identified a high occurrence of " driver distraction " collisions and where officers have regularly observed offences being committed . '
Nigel Humphries , from the Association of British Drivers , said : ' This is a total infringement .
They might as well put something in cars to test what drivers are thinking – to see if they are concentrating on the road or thinking about something else .
' Apart from that it 's going to be counter - productive .
There 's no excuse for not having police officers watching the road to look out for motorists who are driving erratically . '
Peter Roberts , from the Drivers ' Alliance , said : ' People should n't be using mobile phones when they are driving in the car , especially handheld ones .
But I am not comfortable with spy cameras which can see into your car and see what you are doing .
' The old - fashioned type of policing where coppers are sitting by the side of the road watching people go past to see if they are using a mobile is a far better way of doing things . '
SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder 's announcement that the federal government will no longer raid medical - marijuana dispensaries was cheered by California dealers as well as state legislators who seek to legalize and tax sales of the drug .
Under the Bush administration , the Drug Enforcement Agency raided dispensaries across the country .
Such seizures were especially common in California , which in 1996 became the first state to legalize marijuana sales to people with doctor 's prescriptions -- in opposition to federal laws banning any use of the drug .
The attorney general signaled recently that states will be able to set their own medical - marijuana laws , which President Barack Obama said during his campaign that he supported .
What Mr. Obama said then " is now American policy , " Mr. Holder said .
" We may be seeing the end of an era , " said Rob MacCoun , a law professor who studies drug policy at the University of California , Berkeley .
" It 's not likely to be a priority for the Obama administration . "
That news relieved Kevin Reed , who owns the Green Cross , a medical - marijuana - delivery service in San Francisco .
He said he was n't too concerned about raids because they usually target large dispensaries that " get out of control " with high traffic and cash flow .
But federal seizures were constantly " in the back of your head , " Mr. Reed said .
Olbermann : ' Absurd ' Bush defender ' had to be stoned ' David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 12 , 2009
Print This Email This Former Bush press secretary Ari Fleischers Wednesday attempts to spin the Bush presidency on Iraq and the economy were met with nothing but derision and disdain by MSNBCs Keith Olbermann who said Fleischer must have been stoned to make such statements .
Appearing on Hardball with Chris Matthews earlier in the day , Fleischer defended former President Bushs legacy , saying  I think Barack Obama should say  thank you every day that he inherited a world without Saddam Hussein in it . 
He added that as a result of the Bush tax cuts , the country got 55 straight months of job creation . 
Fleischer also attempted to propagate the now widely discredited neoconservative theory that Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were allies and that Hussein had a hand in 9/11 by saying ,  After Sept. 11 , how could we take a chance that Saddam might not strike again . 
To all of these statements , Olbermann on his Wednesday night program Countdown responded with  Fleischer had to be stoned  and that recent attempts by Fleischer and other Bush aides to spin the presidency were patently absurd and almost insane . 
 We got this arrogant , condescending crap that Obama should basically be sending thank you notes to Bush every day for ridding the world of Saddam Hussein ,  Olbermann said , asking Newsweek editor and MSNBC political analyst Jonathan Alter , " Is the idea that the more ridiculous you make the spin , the larger the yield ? 
 I dont think theres too much reality ,  Alter said of the Bush aides , adding  These folks are all in the legacy business .
A lot of the Bush veterans cant find jobs so they have plenty of time to go out and spin for their old boss . 
Politico's Mike Allen has reported on new attempts by former Bush aides to spin the administration 's record .
Fleischer told Allen that the Bush pundits are a loose confederation of people united in our belief in what President Bush did , and were freer now to talk about some things than we used to be  good and bad . 

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa established a solid lead over his nine challengers Tuesday , securing a second four - year term .
But one of his closest allies , Councilman Jack Weiss , appeared headed for a May 19 runoff in the contest for city attorney .
With about half of the votes counted , Villaraigosa avoided a runoff against the second - place candidate , attorney Walter Moore .
The mayor had been expected to secure the needed majority , given that he had appeared in television commercials for himself and two other campaigns -- and had outspent Moore by a ratio of 15 to 1 .
Taking the stage shortly before 11 p.m. at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel downtown , Villaraigosa was greeted with a short burst of applause .
“ I stand before you all humbled tonight , humbled by your support and by your confidence .
I ’m humbled by your continued trust and your continuing forgiveness , ” he said .
Advertisement
In other contests , Councilwoman Wendy Greuel was drawing enough votes to avoid a runoff in her bid for city controller , holding a commanding lead on businesswoman Kathleen “ Suzy ” Evans and engineer Nick Patsaouras , according to early results .
City attorney candidate Jack Weiss , a Westside councilman , appeared headed for a May 19 runoff against Carmen “ Nuch ” Trutanich , although early returns showed Deputy City Atty .
Michael Amerian narrowly in third place .
Villaraigosa had been hoping to use Tuesday ’s election to expand his political reach at City Hall , ushering Weiss and Greuel into citywide office .
Having those two in such powerful posts would represent a dramatic break for the mayor , who frequently disagreed with City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo and had an increasingly distant relationship with City Controller Laura Chick .
Both Chick and Delgadillo are being forced out by term limits .
Los Angeles voters also were approving a major component of Villaraigosa ’s renewable energy platform : Measure B , the solar energy plan .
The measure , heavily backed by the union that represents workers at the Department of Water and Power , would require the city to add 400 megawatts of solar panels by 2014 .
Only two years ago , Villaraigosa ’s political standing had been damaged by an extramarital affair and by a judge ’s decision to invalidate his plan for gaining more control of the Los Angeles Unified School District .

A solid victory by Villaraigosa would show that he has bounced back , keeping him in play as one of the Democrats who could mount a statewide bid for governor in 2010 .
Moore voiced satisfaction that Villaraigosa experienced such a weak showing in the early returns .
“ My voters were both angry and optimistic and excited , ” he said .
Villaraigosa used this year ’s campaign as an informal launching pad by appearing not just in a barrage of commercials for himself , but in 30 - second spots for Weiss and Measure B .
Still , Tuesday ’s election drew little public interest and an anemic voter turnout , mostly due to the absence of drama at the top of the ticket .
Unlike the 2005 mayor ’s race , when Villaraigosa toppled incumbent Mayor James K .
Hahn to become the city ’s first Latino mayor in 133 years , no formidable candidates entered the race to derail Villaraigosa ’s pursuit of a second four - year term .
Advertisement
Political experts had feared that turnout would fall far below the nearly 29 % turnout in the 2005 mayoral primary .
Villaraigosa regularly deflects questions about a gubernatorial bid , saying only that he loves being the mayor of the nation ’s second - largest city .
Yet even if he runs , Tuesday ’s victory will buy the mayor at least 18 more months to work on his ambitious agenda for the city -- one that touches on public safety , schools , transportation and the environment .
Villaraigosa is more than two - thirds of the way toward his goal of hiring 1,000 additional police officers .
The mayor also is attempting to replace as many as 17,000 older diesel trucks at the Port of Los Angeles and reach his goal of ensuring that 20 % of the power at the DWP comes from renewable sources , such as wind and solar energy .
The mayor ’s political staying power had been in doubt two years ago , when he faced withering criticism for engaging in an affair with a Spanish - language television reporter .
Those revelations followed the defeat of Villaraigosa ’s effort to gain control at the Los Angeles Unified School District .
Advertisement
Still , Villaraigosa retained enough cachet to campaign during much of last year for the presidential bid of then - Sen.
Hillary Clinton .
Meanwhile , Villaraigosa ’s supporters on the school board agreed to give him control over a handful of public schools at L.A. Unified -- campuses that were featured in the mayor ’s 30 - second commercials for his reelection this year .
By November , real estate developer Rick Caruso ended his flirtation with a mayoral bid , leaving a field of nine underfunded hopefuls -- none of them with experience in public office -- to run for the job .
The most prominent was attorney Moore , who had raised a credible $ 212,000 , far more than any other challenger but nowhere near the $ 3 million war chest Villaraigosa used to air a series of feel - good commercials focusing on public education and reduced crime .
Appearing at the same victory party as Villaraigosa , Weiss launched into an attack on Trutanich ’s decision to represent environmental polluters during his two decades as a private attorney .
Although he did not mention Trutanich by name , Weiss criticized Trutanich ’s law firm for representing the National Rifle Assn .
Advertisement
“ The city attorney is all about who ’s on your side and fighting for what is right , ” he said .
Trutanich has sought to portray Weiss as negligent in his duties as a councilman and used mailers to remind voters of a 2007 effort to recall Weiss that failed .
On election night , Trutanich said Weiss had pulled ahead in large part because his television commercials were on the air weeks before his opponents ’ .
“ If I were Jack Weiss , I ’d be concerned , ” Trutanich added .
In the race for controller , Greuel had faced noisy , if underfunded , challenges from Patsaouras , a onetime Villaraigosa appointee at the DWP , and Evans .
Advertisement
Throughout the campaign , Patsaouras said Greuel would be a weak successor to Chick , who enthusiastically used her office to criticize an array of city departments and programs .
Greuel responded by portraying Patsaouras as part of Villaraigosa ’s inner circle .
And she flooded the airwaves with commercials attacking him for paying his taxes late and for running a bank that faced trouble during the 1990s .
At her election night party overlooking the pool at the Sportsmen ’s Lodge in Studio City , Greuel said she would be “ tough on our departments and make sure that every taxpayer dollar is spent wisely . ”
Los Angeles voters offer a mixed review of the five measures on the city ballot :
Advertisement
* Measure A , which authorized the hiring of an independent assessor to review personnel complaints at the city Fire Department , was narrowly passing .
* Measure B , the Villaraigosa - backed $ 3 - billion solar energy proposal , was just over the 50 % needed for approval .
* Measure E , to allow the city to offer financial incentives to businesses , was in a dead heat , according to partial returns .
Voters were approving Measures C and D , which made technical changes to the retirement benefits of police officers and firefighters .

Election results Complete returns for elections in Los Angeles and other local jurisdictions will be published in Thursday ’s editions .
Up - to - date results are available online today at www.latimes.com/election-central .
Also contributing to Tuesday ’s elections coverage were Michael Finnegan , Carla Hall , Joanna Lin and Alicia Lozano .
Yesterday saw the launch of the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation ( ISSF ) .
Composed of scientists , environmental organizations , and the tuna industry , ISSF will focus on ensuring that tuna populations are preserved from overfishing .
Greenpeace , an environmental organization not involved with ISSF , has welcomed its creation .
“ So far those organizations mandated to manage tuna stocks have failed to do much more than push the species to the brink of extinction , ” said Sari Tolvanen , Greenpeace International oceans campaigner .
“ With the fishing industry clearly willing to fish itself to death , it ’s great to see processors finally taking a stand .
Now we need the fine words of the ISSF to be translated into real action . ”
Tuna are in crisis .
The large - scale failure of tuna fisheries to manage the populations has created a situation where every species and nearly all populations are in decline .
Some such as Southern bluefin tuna have been classified as critically endangered in the IUCN ’s Redlist , but are still being fished .
According to a recent study by Jeremy Jackson populations of predatory fish , including tuna , have dropped 90 percent since the 1950s .
In a press release from Greenpeace , the organization urges ISSF to put forward the highest possible standards on the industry , including only fishing tuna from well - managed , non-threatened populations ; using fishing methods that do not result in high by - catch ; banning Fish Aggregation Devices ( FADs ) which have been shown to increase the catch of juvenile fish too young to have bred ; foregoing transshipping at sea ; and ensuring all tuna sold was legally caught .
Furthermore , Greenpeace says that ISSF must address issue of equity to make sure that all fishing nations receive a fair price for their tuna .
“ We expect ISSF member companies to ‘ walk the talk ’ they will deliver to tuna management bodies , ” said Nina Thuellen , Greenpeace International oceans consumer markets coordinator .
“ This means the ISSF ’s political demands must also be reflected in the sourcing standards of its members .
They must also be accountable to consumers who want and have the right to legal , fair and sustainable products . ”

Michele Shafer KNOWS otherwise .
Sequoia hired two law firms ( and worked with the Civil Division of the local Prosecutor 's office ) to try to defeat the study proving irregularities on Sequoia 's DREs that became part of a subsequent lawsuit .
http://www.votersunite.o...mediaSnohomishCounty.htm
Despite all the notice in the world ( having to spend thousands on lawyers means the company can't deny knowing about the study ) , neither the lawyers nor Sequoia ever refuted the study in the slightest .
Yet the study concludes that there 's a 100 % chance that a large force acted on the DRE voting that did not act on the paper ballots that were hand - recounted , on a side by side , precinct by precinct basis , in the Gregoire v. Rossi gubernatorial election / recount contest of 2004 .
If this is not proof , then given the secrecy with which Sequoia and others attempt to hide their processing of the vote , what WOULD they accept as proof of election fraud ?
If one asks the above question of election officials , one does n't get a satisfactory answer .
Since they do not know ( or wo n't say ) what the smoking guns of election fraud are in computerized elections , it 's pert near impossible for them to find what THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR , and probably would n't know what it was if they saw it .
The above link has a summarized press release and a link to the study , but the study itself can be found at www.votersunite.org/info/lehtolawsuit.asp
( see links near bottom of page ) Unfortunately my co-plaintiff , Jack WElls , descendant of a Revolutionary War soldier and one of the original senators in the newly minted state of Washington , passed away over a year ago .
But he fought in the Aleutians --- the second time in US history that American territory was subject to land invasion ( the other being the war of 1812 in which the British burned down the White House , Congress , and other parts of DC including the Library of Cognress ) .
Jack WElls did n't hesitate to defend his country from invasion , and if any foreign power were to propose to make a modest proposal to request only the control of our vote counts --- forsaking our resources , cities and other assets --- we'd all see the usurpation of our democracy by force for precisely what it was .
Jack Wells , however , was able to see that it did n't matter whether or not it was a foreign power ( Venezuelan past ownership of Sequoia is irrelevant ) --- he understood immediately as Lincoln did that in a large republic , we must liver forever or die ( from within ) by suicide , and he stepped up immediately , though I 'd never met him before , and was eager to defend his country for the second time in his life .
Jack Wells was an honored teacher at a Washington state community college , and , I hope , is still teaching now , even in death , by his example .
Sequoia never refuted the study Jack and I made the first Exhibit in the lawsuit .
The lawsuit was later dismissed by the Court of Appeals , after agreeing transparency was necessary and at the very bedrock of democracy , on the grounds of mootness : The Snohomish County Board of supervisors voted to eliminate Sequoia DREs from polling place use .
According to the court , it need n't decide our request for a $ 5 million refund and to void the sales contract because Jack Wells and I were victorious , the touchscreens were gone .
If Michele Shafer , or Sequoia , disagrees , then I challenge them to a public debate , videotapes for the web and in front of a large audience , any time , any place , any where .
Hopefully Sequoia will post a large amount of prize money for the winner of the vote after the debate .
Since Sequoia 's betting our entire democracy on their takeover of our vote counts , they should be happy to back up their claim to private ownership of the heart of democracy in public , in a debate format that presents a form of accountability .
Standing from afar , like Jim Cramer , Sequoia can cast its denials and its claims , but forced into an accountable format like The Daily Show , it was clear that if the Cramer v Stewart bout has lasted a few more minutes , as the wife of one financial analyst put it , Jim Cramer would have been crying .
I predict an analogous fate for Michelle Shafer , but I also predict that she will refuse to accept this challenge to debate .
Michelle Shafer ?

Arapahoe County Clerk Nancy
Doty is part of a vocal minority Majority of voters concerned about votes counted in secret Nancy Doty misrepresented that voters concerned with election integrity are a vocal minority .
A nationwide August 2006 Zogby poll of 1,018 likely voters revealed 92 percent of Americans are worried about our votes being counted in secret and agreed Americans have the right to view and obtain information about how elections officials count votes .
http://www.zogby.com/templates/printnews.cfm?id=1163
The Sequoia Edge touchscreen DRE voting machines which Nancy Doty demands to continue using in Arapahoe County , without a Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail , can be hacked , in approximately one minute , by an election official , altering election results countywide .
UC Scientists Release Voting Machine Hacking Video .
http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6369
The Colorado legislature required sixty two of sixty four Colorado counties to use Voter Verified Paper Audit Trails on their touchscreen voting machines .
The 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution states " no state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . "
Do the legislature and Nancy Doty believe the 14th Amendment prohibition against a state denying Equal Protection of the Law does not apply to Arapahoe county citizens ?
What legal argument does Doty rely upon to continue demoting Arapahoe County voters to second class citizenship ?
People fought and died at Manassas , Shiloh , Vicksburg , Chancellorsville , Gettysburg and Antietam to give ALL AMERICANS Equal Protection of the Law .
Brave patriots refused to sit in the back of the bus and marched , at Selma .
They were clubbed , beaten , attacked by dogs , spit on and firehosed .
Their churches were burned .
Dr. Martin Luther King gave his life to ensure ALL AMERICANS HAVE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAW .
Approximately two thirds of Colorado registered voters are registered as Independents or Democrats .
Nancy Doty is a Republican who gave a $ 500 campaign contribution to Republican Senate candidate Bob Schaffer , in 2007 , while she was administering an election Bob Schaffer ran in .
A vocal minority supported Bob Schaffer , who was soundly defeated in Colorado .
An even smaller vocal minority contributed $ 500 or more to Republican Bob Schaffer .
Nancy
Doty is part of a very small vocal minority .
Contributing to a political candidate , who is running for election , in an election you are administering should be outlawed .
Nancy
Doty is also part of a small vocal minority who apparently believes in denying equal protection of the law , to some citizens .
We have heard from this minority before and stood up against them .
It is time for the majority to speak out against them again and ensure every American is provided Equal Protection of the Law .
Please see the Coloradans for Voting Integrity website , www.cfvi.us, for more information concerning election integrity issues in Colorado .

" Doug " said @ 3 & 5 : I 'm happy to know Michelle , and hope that she will be amused by the attempt here to vilify her .
I consider her to be a friend , and to be quite rational in her thoughts .
I suspect that many of you who decry the advent of electronic voting systems attempt to focus on her , since she has proven quite effective in her work .
If by " effective in her work " , you mean an uncanny ability and willingness to misrepresent the truth about the shortcomings and facts about her company 's voting systems --- and those of other companies --- and to smear pollworkers and other volunteers to our democratic process , and to surreptitiously rewrite information on her website , etc. , then yes , your friend has been quite " effective in her work " .
Were I an attorney looking at this blog posting , I might counsel Ms. Shafer to determine to consider a libel suit ... the efforts at character assasination seem just to typical of today 's recent political environment .
Wondering if your same sentiments also apply to the way your friend Michelle has treated volunteer pollworkers , doing their job properly , only to be blamed for the failures in Michelle 's company 's voting systems ?
Also , wondering if your decrying of " today 's recent political environment " also includes the shame of officials who receive government funding , and then do not tell the truth about the use of those public funds ?
Does it also include companies who receive government funding and then make statements about their ownership by foreign companies which is not true ?
Your friend Michelle has many moral dilemmas to answer to .
I recognize that she has a horrible portfolio to represent .
There are , however , ways to do so which do not misrepresent the truth , or laugh in the face of the public trust that she 's ultimately been granted .
There is , of course , nothing libelous as reported on this blog .
Everything I have noted in the article is substantiated by well - documented facts , and firmly held beliefs born out by those facts .
As Michelle knows ( or perhaps , even you do , just in case you happen to be Michelle ) she is always more than welcome to offer her own point of view in response .
She has , for many years now , declined the opportunity to do so .

After many years , doing very well on the Sequoia payroll ( actually , on the government 's payroll , since Sequoia was enjoying the use of massive federal funding supplied through HAVA ) Gibbons was cut loose after our expose revealing him to be , um , less than either stable or independent ( See the link above for some details ) .
Unfortunately , though I learned of his tragic and untimely death a few months later , and attempted to learn from a number of sources what the precise cause of death was , I was never able to do so .
So in lieu of the ability to report on the matter accurately , or even to avoid offering unsupported and / or conspiratorial insinuations , I did not cover the death here .
If I 'm able to learn more , independently verifiable information --- versus the material I 've collected from some of the sources close to Gibbons , I will share it .
As Michelle Shafer ( and perhaps even her friend " Doug " ) knows , we do not cover material here , or make accusations which cannot be independently verified as accurate .
Even when it has to do with the horrible Sequoia Voting Systems company .

Interesting Brad , that you enjoy using " ad hominem " arguments , and that you resort to personal attacks .
While such attacks are fairly typical of those who , like yourself , seem unable to engage in rational discussion .... it does weaken the credibility of your arguments .
I know Michelle Shafer and have never known her to misrepresent the truth .
Comparing a specific attack on a private citizen ( you do know what that is , do n't you ? ) who is an advocate for her firm to unnamed poll workers - underpaid " volunteers " who are sometimes not sufficiently trained for election duty is ... well , not relevant .
While many in your circle appear to have no compunction about calling someone with a differing viewpoint a " liar " , you might consider how that impacts the credibility that you have .
I doubt that you will .... but perhaps those who are so anti-technology might understand that this over emotional drivel tends to put off the very public you would like to persuade .
I note that there is no great rush to toss the new systems .
I note also that the general public appears to understand ( from my readings ) that the potential for election fraud exists with any and all voting systems .... and , I might add with any and all voter registration systems .
I 've long since given up on engaging you , or those who appear rather rabid on this topic in any additional rational debate , since so many of you - particularly you , appear incapable of acknowledging that others have views different than your own .... and that , believe it or not ... that they have a right to such different views .
I 'm quite happy that I do NOT live in your world !
Now , as for the woman who is so dreadly fearful of Diebold ATM devices ... perhaps she can take note that Michelle Shafer works for Sequoia , NOT Diebold .
Further , I might suggest to her that she scrap her personal computer and get off line entirely so she can avoid all the nasty risks associated with the use of the Internet .

By the way ' Brad ' , my name is Doug , and I 'm not all that hard to find .
You might try it , since you evidently question my existence , and appear unable to make use of the tools that your blog site provides to you .
As for Ms. Shafer 's need to " answer to " anyone on anything , since you 've never been elected to any position of responsibility , since you do n't represent anyone beyond yourself .....
I 'm thankful that she need not answer to you .
You 're just another private citizen .
Best Wishes !

Doug , I must say that is a pretty twisted notion of those to whom an elected official is answerable , and I also must say that you are a fine one to complain about ad hominem attacks because of your own ad hominem attack on " the woman who is so dreadly fearful of Diebold ATM devices " and that is heavily frowned upon here .
Plus , if you plan to keep commenting here , I must ask you to modify your screen name somewhat because there is another " Doug " who comments here sometimes , and I 'm certain he would not wish to be confused with you .

Dearest " Doug " - Interesting Brad , that you enjoy using " ad hominem " arguments , and that you resort to personal attacks .
While such attacks are fairly typical of those who , like yourself , seem unable to engage in rational discussion .... it does weaken the credibility of your arguments .
Hmmm ... You 've just used an " ad hominem " argument and personal attack to make your case against me .
Smartly done , " Doug " !
That said , I fail to see the " ad hominem " argument or personal attack that I 've made against Michelle .
Please feel free to share .
I know Michelle Shafer and have never known her to misrepresent the truth .
Then you do n't know Michelle Shafer .
Or what she does for a living .
Please feel free to do a search here at The BRAD BLOG for " Michelle Shafer " and click around into what you find ( all of it documented , and independently verifiable , of course , or it would n't be here . )
Comparing a specific attack on a private citizen ( you do know what that is , do n't you ? ) who is an advocate for her firm to unnamed poll workers - underpaid " volunteers " who are sometimes not sufficiently trained for election duty is ... well , not relevant .
So , it 's okay to attack those patriotic volunteer pollworkers --- whose training was sufficient enough , except for the times when the Sequoia ( and other ) voting machines behaved in a way that it was not supposed to --- but not okay to point out the documented evidence of a spokesman for an industry ( please note , she has served as spokesman for both Sequoia and the e-voting industry 's ETC ) who has received billions of dollars of tax - payer dollars , for not telling the truth , is out of bounds ?!
Golly - gosh , I 'm guessing you must have a lot of good friends at AIG , " Doug " .
Do n't you dare " attack " any of those private citizens !
And while you 're at it , I 'd greatly appreciate if you'd not join in disparaging the patriotic poll workers whose thankless tasks ensure that we 're able to keep some semblance of democracy here in America despite the anti-democracy efforts of folks like Sequoia , Michelle , et al .
While many in your circle appear to have no compunction about calling someone with a differing viewpoint a " liar " , you might consider how that impacts the credibility that you have .
I do not speak for anybody " in [ my ] circle " , nor do they speak for me .
But I do speak for myself .
And if someone tells a knowing lie , they are a liar .
If that impacts my " credibility " , to inform the public of that , then so be it .
I 'd suggest lying ( which I do not do ) is a far greater strike against one 's credibility , then calling somewhat out as a " liar " when they , um , lie --- as Michelle has done on many occassions --- publicly , and verifiably .
Of course , there are others " in [ her ] circle " who would likely tell you the same thing about her if you promised them the off record status that I 'm happy to offer such sources who speak to me in such a manner , when reasons dictate .
I doubt that you will .... but perhaps those who are so anti-technology might understand that this over emotional drivel tends to put off the very public you would like to persuade .
Thanks for that advise , chief .
I recall hearing similar advise in the past from folks like yourself ( generally Republicans , like Karl Rove and friends ) who are always helpful in recommending what behavior will and wo n't " put off the very public [ I 'd hope ] to persuade " .
But beyond that , first time to this argument ?
Apparently so , if you believe that Michelle Shafer still maintains any credibility on any of these issues , above and beyond the tax - payer funded bought and paid for access she 's enjoyed , where private citizens and actual stakeholders in elections have not .
For the record , my " anti-technology " credentials include 10 years as a software programmer .
And , if you bother to actually educate yourself on these matters , rather than believe what you 're told by your friend Michelle , you 'd quickly learn that the leading advocates * against * the use of products made by Michelle and her company happen to be scores of the world 's most well - regarded computer scientists , security experts and academics .
Those folks are surely " anti-technology " luddites , however , as you see them , no doubt .
Seriously , " Doug " .
You need to expand your knowledge of this issue beyond " what Michelle tells me " .
I note that there is no great rush to toss the new systems .
" No great rush " for whom ?
Your " notes " seem to need a bit of freshing up .
The state of CA who decertified almost all of the DRE systems made by Michelle 's companies ?
The state of FL who similar got rid of them ?
The states of OH and CO where the Secretaries of State recommended against the use of any of them ?
How about the state 's of MD , VA , TN , IA and many more whose legislatures have now banned those systems ?
How about the federal bill moving through Congress to do the same ?
Has Michelle mentioned any of that to you lately , for your " notes " ?
I note also that the general public appears to understand ( from my readings ) that the potential for election fraud exists with any and all voting systems .... and , I might add with any and all voter registration systems .
It sure does .
The " general public " is correct .
That 's why one needs transparent , citizen - observable , verifiable election systems and procedures , so there remains a hope of stopping bad guys from defrauding elections .
That is in strict opposition to the proprietary " trade secret " software used by Michelle 's company ( ies ) which count our votes in secret , unverifiably , to offer 100 % faith - based elections .
Ask her why she 's gone to court to keep the public from being able to verify the validity of their own elections on her company 's systems time and again .
Ask her , while you 're there , why it is that she 's claimed ownership of the Intellectual Property for those systems when they actually belong to a Venzuelan company tied to Hugo Chavez .
After you 've asked her , you can come back here , do some searching and find out the facts , in opposition to what she 'll tell you .
K ?
I 've long since given up on engaging you , or those who appear rather rabid on this topic in any additional rational debate , since so many of you - particularly you , appear incapable of acknowledging that others have views different than your own .... and that , believe it or not ... that they have a right to such different views
You , and she , have every right to your own points of view .
Even when they are paid for by my tax dollars .
You do n't , however , have the right to your own " facts " .
I 've got the facts to back up every .
single .
word .
I post on this site .
If you have a dispute with any of them , I hope you 'll let me know and present your independently verifiable evidence for my error .
Where I am are wrong , I 'm always happy to issue a correction ( not secretly , as Michelle does on her site (s ) , but actually in a transparent way so all can see the error that I 've made , and how and when I 've corrected it . )
Beyond that , I disagree with MANY in the EI movement .
Just as I disagree with many in the e-voting industry .
Believe it or not , I 'm happy to talk and work with each of them , no matter how much I may disagree .
Michelle , on the other hand , has simply chosen not to do so .
So if she wo n't speak up for herself , I guess she needs to find ( under and mis-informed ) friends and associates , such as yourself to do it for her .
You are doing her , nor yourself , any favors in the bargain .
If you are who you say you are , then your misunderstanding of the issues at stake here will not reflect well on your position ( as President of the association to whom , it is said , the Doug you claim to be , was recently elected ) .
I 'm quite happy that I do NOT live in your world !
Yeah !
I 'm happy you 're happy !
It 's often much more enjoyable to live with one 's head in the ground , unaware of facts , anyway .
So have fun there !
And give my best to the Mad Hatter if you see him skitter by !
Now , as for the woman who is so dreadly fearful of Diebold ATM devices ... perhaps she can take note that Michelle Shafer works for Sequoia , NOT Diebold .
Actually , Michelle works for Diebold as well .
Though she rarely leaves her home in Austin , she works for once - CA , now - CO based Sequoia Voting Systems , as well as the Election Technology Council ( ETC ) on behalf of Diebold , Sequoia , Hart Intercivic and ES&S .
She poorly represents all of them .
And all on the tax - payers dime !
Neato , huh ?
Further , I might suggest to her that she scrap her personal computer and get off line entirely so she can avoid all the nasty risks associated with the use of the Internet .
What that commenter does , of course , is her choice .
What folks like you and Michelle , however , do with MY tax - payer dollars , and MY right to a free , fair , verifiable , and transparent election , is another matter entirely .
Someday , you 'll understand that .
At least I hope you 'll feel free to stick around this site and educate yourself a bit , long enough to do so .
By the way ' Brad ' , my name is Doug , and I 'm not all that hard to find .
You might try it , since you evidently question my existence , and appear unable to make use of the tools that your blog site provides to you .
Michelle , and her friends , know well enough how to fake internet presences .
If you 'd like to touch base with me either by email or voice ( I 'm easy to find ) in such a way so that I can authenticate you are who you say you are , I 'll be happy to remove the quotations from around the word " Doug " .
I 'd be delighted to chat w/ you privately any time .
I suspect Michelle , however , would prefer you do n't .
I 'll leave it to you to figure out why that might be .
As for Ms. Shafer 's need to " answer to " anyone on anything , since you 've never been elected to any position of responsibility , since you do n't represent anyone beyond yourself .....
I 'm thankful that she need not answer to you .
You 're just another private citizen .
True .
Though I do n't make money from government welfare , as she does .
Nonetheless , she need n't " answer to " me if she does n't wish .
But to insinuate that she 's not welcome to offer her points of view here , even when / if I disagree with her , is absurd .
I just thought I 'd let you know that it 's she who has chosen not to discuss such matters , not me .
She tends to stick with those media who wo n't call her on it when she , um , does n't tell the truth .
I am always fair , however , and never looking to sandbag anybody .
Best Wishes !
And backatcha , " Doug " !
Hope you 'll stick around !
May be useful to ya !

Granted , I do n't get free money from the government , like Michelle Shafer , for writing her " little blog " .
But then again , I also tell the truth on my little blog .
I have to .
People actually read it .
But the truth , in today 's currency , at least among " folks " like yourself apparently , and certainly among Sequoia , Michelle and friends , may not be worth as much lying for government dollars .
Yes , I do know Michelle .
She 's a friend .
You do n't say .

Yes .

Nobody pays attention , so not a thing to worry about .
Everything 's going fine , and the " new technologies " have been rolled out smoothly and without a hitch .
Just ask Michelle .
Lawsuits , decertification , threats of government sanctions and near - bankruptcy are n't the droids you 're looking for , amigo .
Do n't pay attention to that man behind Michelle 's curtain .
And congratulations on your remarkable intellectual curiosity .

And thanks for the response ( or lact thereof ) about the death of Mike Gibbons .
I 'm glad there is no story until you have a FACTUAL story .
What are the known facts available about that ?
Like does anybody know when , where , how , why ?
I 'm sure if there was anything questionable , we'd have seen it here , but I 'm wondering about the basics .

" but perhaps those who are so anti-technology might understand that this over emotional drivel tends to put off the very public you would like to persuade . "
I 'm a Software Engineer .
I have a BS in Computer Science .
I 'm a geek and borderline nerd ( just using those two terms as distinctive should support that premise that I 'm not " anti-technology " ) .
BECAUSE
I know how to program computers , because I know how to show one thing on a screen and do something _completely_ different under the covers , because I _know_ how easy it is to get away with if you are promised that NO ONE can look at the " code " , source or machine , I understand the _dangers_ of these machines .
You , Doug , like most right - wing ( or just wrong - headed ) people I know , simply do n't use " facts " to decide if someone is lying or not .
Facts and reality do n't matter , your own " view " is all that matters , you try to dictate that reality conform to your " view " in spite of facts .
I 've seen it over and over , broken logic and false premises and false dichotomies and trying to paint a 10 lb bag of shit as " valid " because there 's 1 ounce of truth buried in that bag ; somewhere .
So , based on your " view " that people against using " unverifiable , non-auditable , insecure electronic voting machines " must be " anti- technology " shows me that you do n't apply logic and reason to your " view " .
I _love_ technology ..
I just have a solid grasp of just what technology is ( i.e. it 's not some magic box to me , so I understand when it 's good and bad and when it can be used to beat the public over the head , like with unverifiable election results from machines built by people who have an agenda that does n't include verifiable elections ) .
Sorry , Doug .
But that one statement shows you 're not intersted in discussing the truth , you 're interested in trying to convince people that your FLAWED view should be accepted by them , too .
Not all of us are that simple , some of us think for ourselves .
Though , you 're right .. the " public " we 're trying to convince of just how dangerous your ilk are do n't want to know about facts , they want to have the world handed to them in 30 second sound bytes .
Life is n't that simple , but Americans are .
Sadly .

Wow , Michelle 's imaginary friend , huh ?
For a guy who responded to a posting of mine a few years ago by tracking back to my actual name , you really do have a creative version of reality Brad .
Brad , thank you so much for referring to me and to others who have served as election volunteers as patriots !
I appreciate it and am happy that you recognize me as the patriot that I am .
I 've worked and volunteered at local polling stations , central count stations and have worked with a wide variety of technologies .
Those have included the old lever machines ( yep , those pre-date Michelle ) , the punch card systems that your " ilk " saw as the great villan of the 2000 election , and optical scan systems .
As IS the case with the variety of electronic systems - each one had its strengths and weaknesses .
Each one could be subject to some form of cheating at the polls .
That cheating never appeared to be confined to one particular political party , either - I know , a big shock for you , huh ?
As for reality , well ...
I 'm firmly entrenched in the reality of the private sector .
That means that my blog does n't include any " begging for bucks " to support it .
In fact , it does n't really focus on election technology at all .
Y'all really entertained me during some of my vacation days ...
The absolute tizzy that you and a few others went into was quite telling .
The reckless manner with which you accuse honorable patriots like Michelle of perpetrating fraud , of lying , etc. is even more telling .
As any casual reader of this wasted space on the Internet may note , I never had to stoop to such a low level .
However , I do understand that those who can't win a rational argument somehow must resort to such tactics .
Best wishes with your " alternate reality " ....
In the interim , I 'll go back to working in the private sector - you know , those folks who get real productive work done , and who create the jobs that give the rest of you the tools you choose to use as a forum for protest .
Perhaps one day , you 'll find some productive pursuit in which you can engage .
I 'd love to see you " on the air " , since I have little doubt that such an effort would prove to be a commercial flop .
Keep begging for bucks in the interim , though .... and if your efforts do n't succeed here , I 'm sure that there 's a street corner somewhere that will enable you to ply your trade further !
Now , feel free to ban me , or to accuse me of whatever your under - used mental capacity might help you to create !!!

The sad thing about blogs like this is that there is no way that someone like Ms. Shafer or Mr. Allen can disprove a negative .
Troofers are all over the place .
Just look at the folks who believe that the World Trade Center towers collapsed due to a government conspiracy or that JFK was shot by dozens of individuals in Dealey Plaza rather than a lone nut .
Troofers believe what they want to believe .
Years ago they would be walking the streets wearing aluminum hats and mumbling to themselves .
Now they sit inside .
Their mumblings transferred to a blog where they attract others like themselves .

Wow , Michelle 's imaginary friend , huh ?
For a guy who responded to a posting of mine a few years ago by tracking back to my actual name , you really do have a creative version of reality Brad .
If you pay attention to the name at the top of the comment , it will inform you who wrote the comment , " Doug " .
Unlike Sequoia 's voting systems , for example , it should be pretty clear .
Brad , thank you so much for referring to me and to others who have served as election volunteers as patriots !
I appreciate it and am happy that you recognize me as the patriot that I am .
Indeed .
Thank you for that .
It 's a shame your love for democracy stops after you leave the polling place .
In any case , I do appreciate your efforts there , so thanks for serving !
Those have included the old lever machines ( yep , those pre-date Michelle ) , the punch card systems that your " ilk " saw as the great villan of the 2000 election , and optical scan systems .
Is that what my " ilk " thought ?
I guess my ilk forgot to inform me .
There was no problem with the punchcards , just with the people who did n't want to count them .
Oh , and the punchcards that 7 Sequoia employees have now testified , on camera , to having beeng gamed ( bad paper , rejected over and over again until someone forced them to use it ) , but only in FL and especially in Palm Beach ( where they were instructed to misalign the chads ) .
Here 's the video report if you 're interested , and if Michelle forgot to point you to it ( see Part 3 ) .
The other problem in 2000 , of course , was the optical scan system that reported NEGATIVE 16,022 votes for Al Gore in Volusia County .
But I 'm sure you and Michelle have a good explanation for that as well , even though nobody else does .
As IS the case with the variety of electronic systems - each one had its strengths and weaknesses .
Each one could be subject to some form of cheating at the polls .
True. Especially Sequoia's !
Have you asked Michelle about that Big Yellow Button on the back of each touch screen that allows any voter to vote as many times as they 'd like , until being physically restrained from doing so ?
That cheating never appeared to be confined to one particular political party , either - I know , a big shock for you , huh ?
Not really .
But thanks for reminding us all how little you 've actually read at this blog .
You underinformation is showing again , " Doug " .
As for reality , well ...
I 'm firmly entrenched in the reality of the private sector .
That means that my blog does n't include any " begging for bucks " to support it .
Thanks for the reminder !
Please feel free to leave a donation in " dishonor " of " Doug " here .
And thanks again , " Doug " !
In fact , it does n't really focus on election technology at all .
Really ?!
Knock me over with a feather !
You seem so well informed on the topic !
The reckless manner with which you accuse honorable patriots like Michelle of perpetrating fraud , of lying , etc. is even more telling .
Nothing reckless about it at all , champ .
If you have evidence to demonstrate that anything I 've ever written about her ( or anything else for that matter ) is untrue or inaccurate , I 'm sure you 'll share it with us .
As I already requested same , and you 've been unable to offer anything , I guess that speaks for itself .
As any casual reader of this wasted space on the Internet may note , I never had to stoop to such a low level .
However , I do understand that those who can't win a rational argument somehow must resort to such tactics . :-)

Not sure when The BRAD BLOG became not a part of the private sector , but whatever .
If Michelle decides to get off the government dole and work for an honest living at some point , I hope you 'll show pity on her and give her a job .
I know I would .
Perhaps one day , you 'll find some productive pursuit in which you can engage .
I 'd love to see you " on the air " , since I have little doubt that such an effort would prove to be a commercial flop .
No doubt !
Keep begging for bucks in the interim , though .... and if your efforts do n't succeed here , I 'm sure that there 's a street corner somewhere that will enable you to ply your trade further !

Consiste nella compressione del nervo mediano all ’interno del tunnel carpale , un passaggio osteofibroso nel polso delimitato dalle ossa carpali e dal legamento carpale attraverso cui passano i tendini flessori della mano e il nervo mediano .
Quando , per eccesso di tensione muscolare , si determina una compressione permanente al tunnel , il nervo che vi passa rimane intrappolato e compresso .
E' stato dimostrato che prolungati e/o ripetitivi movimenti di flesso - estensione del polso ( in minor misura anche la flessione delle dita ) , provocano un aumento della pressione all ' interno del tunnel carpale e che il ripetuto allungamento dei nervi e dei tendini che scorrono dentro il tunnel possono dar luogo ad una infiammazione che riduce le dimensioni del tunnel determinando la compressione del nervo mediano .
La fase iniziale della compressione del nervo mediano è detta “ irritativa ” , può durare anche vari anni ed è caratterizzata da alterazioni della sensibilità aspecifiche ed episodiche che si verificano soprattutto durante la notte o al risveglio .
In particolare si osserva quasi sempre formicolio e torpore alle prime tre dita della mano .
L’evoluzione della compressione , quando non adeguatamente trattata , conduce inesorabilmente ad un peggioramento dei sintomi : il formicolio diventa continuo sino a disturbare il sonno notturno ; inesorabilmente però subentra quasi sempre la fase “ paralitica “ , caratterizzata da gravi disturbi della sensibilità tattile e dalla diminuzione della forza prensile anche a causa dell ’ipotrofia muscolare presente alla eminenza tenare , situata alla base del pollice .
La Sindrome del Tunnel Carpale presenta una significativa associazione con alcune attività lavorative .
Ne risultano infatti più spesso colpiti gli addetti al settore manifatturiero , elettronico , tessile , alimentare , calzaturiero , pellettiero , come pure gli addetti al confezionamento pacchi , cuochi di albergo , gli addetti ai pubblici esercizi .
Senza farla troppo lunga , ecco spiegati in questo video 3 semplici esercizi della durata di 8 - 10 secondi l'uno che possono aiutare a prevenire il tunnel carpale e le tendiniti al polso , dovute spesso ad un utilizzo intensivo del mouse , evitando un possibile intervento chirurgico in futuro :
Cantor on This Week : GOP should be more inclusive on gay rights David Edwards and Joe Byrne

Eric Cantor , minority
Whip in the Democrat - run House , worked on re-building America 's respect for House Republicans today on ABC's This Week .
Responding to comments from those within the party , Cantor put forth a picture of Republicans as agents of change .
Not all critics of the GOP are democrats .
Governor John Huntsman of Utah made detrimental remarks this week about Republican leadership in Washington .
 I do n't listen or read to whatever it is that they say because it 's inconsequential , completely ,  he said .
 The future of our party will be based upon what happens in the laboratories and incubators of democracy .
Make no mistake about it ,  he added .
Huntsman , 48 , has been named a ' third - tier ' candidate for president in 2012 , and has spoken out previously about the critical situation that Republicans in Washington are in .
After anchor George Stephanopoulos showed Eric Cantor a clip of John Huntsman 's remarks , Cantor smiled and told Stephanopoulos that he could n't comment , because he had not spoken to the governor .
 But let 's say this , George ... Speaker Pelosi does n't need our votes to pass any legislation . 
Eric Cantor used the language of change , positive alternatives , and unity in his dissection of what the Republican party needs to do to solve the financial crisis .
we need ... affirmative plans , positive alternatives to the problems facing this country ,  Cantor asserted .
 They 're not just Republican or Democrat problems ; they are so big , so challenging [ that ] we all need to join together not only in Washington but around the country and to put the ideas forward . 
Additionally , Cantor recognized the bad name that Washington has acquired for it 's history with financial crises .
 Let 's come up with solutions that actually produce results for a change , instead of making matters worse , which Washington is famous for . 
Rush Limbaugh 's speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference yesterday addressed his desire that Obama fail .
 What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation ? "
A huge standing ovation in the packed ballroom followed .
However , Eric Cantor is not a politician who thinks that an Obama failure will be a GOP victory .
As the 4th - ranking Republican in the House , Cantor distanced himself from Limbaugh 's perspective .
 So the Rush Limbaugh approach of wanting the president to fail is not the Eric Cantor , House Republican approach ? " Stephanopolous probed .
" Absolutely not , " Cantor said .
" I do n't think anyone wants anything to fail right now .
We have such challenges . 
But Cantor 's most surprising moment on This Week came when Stephanopolous brought up the Republican stance on gay rights .
 Governor Huntsman says that you re not going to be reaching out to broaden the base of the party , reaching out to young people whove left the Republican Party in droves , unless you do have that positive agenda on the environment , unless you move to the middle on issues like gay rights .
Are you prepared to do that in the House ?
The minority Whip cautiously implicated that a shift to the middle on gay rights and the environment is inevitable .
 There is no question the Republican Party has to return to be one of inclusion , not exclusion .
And we are a party with many ideas . 

Malia Obama , second from left , and Sasha Obama , center , who holds hands with two unidentified friends .
Malia & Sasha prepare for Sidwell
They ’ll have more new friends than they can count , and not all for the right reasons .
Bodyguards will be around , for sure , but hard to spot .
And their teachers will have a brand - new worry in the digital age — cell phone cameras .

That ’s the life awaiting Malia and Sasha Obama when they step off the plane from Chicago on Sunday to start next week at Sidwell Friends School , which has been teaching presidents ' kids dating back to Teddy Roosevelt .
Chelsea Clinton managed to have a relatively normal life at the prestigious Quaker school — a big selling point for self - described “ mom - in - chief ” Michelle Obama — but that does n’t mean it wo n’t be a heady experience for the girls , if Chelsea ’s experience is any guide .
On Chelsea Clinton ’s first day , the press camped outside the school — yet missed it when the 12 - year - old slipped in with her mother amid heavy security .
The media focus has been even more intense for Malia , 10 , and Sasha , 7 , who already are being called role models for a generation of young black girls .
Yet , at Sidwell , former students said , the girls wo n’t be treated like little princesses .
The school will try , as it did with Clinton before them , to help them simply fit in , along with the children of other wealthy and well - connected Washingtonians .
But as with Clinton , some parents likely will push their kids to befriend the girls , in the way they might push their kids to excel in math class , some former Clinton classmates said .
Among the students , Clinton was instantly popular , drawing a circle of hangers - on from Day One .
But with time , that faded , former classmates said .
“ In the beginning , tons of people wanted to be her friend and they were in it for the wrong reasons so she had a little bit of distance in the beginning because of that , ” said a former Clinton classmate who did n’t want to give her name because she remains close friends with the former first daughter .
“ She handled it very well , but it is hard to not come across as snobby when you are 12 and you do n’t want to deal with all of these people around you who want to be your friend . ”
Ellis Turner , associate head of school at Sidwell , said that “ every student has an opportunity to feel comfortable ” at Sidwell .
An added bonus for the girls is that they already have friends there — Vice President - elect Joe Biden has grandchildren at the school .
No matter , they ’ll be treated like all of the other students .
“ There is no celebri - dom at Sidwell , at all .
It really is irrelevant who your parents are because everyone ’s parents have accomplished something , ” former Clinton classmate Lory Ivey Alexander said .
“ It ’s so not a big deal when you are there .
It ’s almost unusual to think that other people see these people as celebrities .
Sometimes people say to me ‘ Oh my God , you went to school with Chelsea Clinton ! '
And I say , ‘ No , Chelsea went to school with me ! ’ ”
Yet being friends with a first child , has its perks , former classmates said , like tickets to the Inauguration , sleepovers at the White House and invites to holiday parties .
Bill Clinton ’s presence at Sidwell meant snipers on the roof and a gaggle of onlookers pressing in to talk to the leader of the free world .
Hillary Clinton was a fixture at the school , often picking Chelsea up and attending school events , a familiar first lady routine .
That was something Rosalynn Carter did as well — though Amy Carter attended public school .
“ Mrs. Carter was first and foremost a mom .
Every afternoon she went off and picked up Amy in her limo or she got her to violin classes , ” said Mary Finch Hoyt , Rosalynn Carter ’s social secretary .
“ After Amy made friends , they would all come to the house and they were like flocks of birds and they were running in empty halls .
They had a good time .
It 's going to be a lot better than people think .
Most first children would say it ’s pretty normal . ”
But normal is certainly relative .
Amy Carter lived in a pre-blogosphere , pre-24 - hour news channel and pre-Internet era — and even still , there were reports then that the press attention was too much for her .
Even Chelsea Clinton went to school before kids had Facebook pages and those ubiquitous cell - phone cameras — hard to control in a school setting .
Alexander said she did n’t think the attention would be a problem for the Obama girls , as the school is small and the community is tight knit .
“ The school will shelter their experience , somewhat , but it wo n’t be that they 're special .
Everyone is special , ” she said .
“ But it ’s not that special of an experience to have the first daughters or the second family .
It was pretty normal for us and it will be for the people attending there now . ”
It is all a part of the school ’s Quaker philosophy , which stresses community service and interconnectedness — themes that could have been ripped from one of Obama ’s stump speeches .
The guiding principle is a belief that there is “ that of God ” in everyone .
Diversity , both racially and economically , are also high on Sidwell ’s list , which has about 1,000 students on two different campuses .
Nearly 40 percent of students are non-white and 1 out of 5 students gets financial aid .
Tuition is $ 28,442 for the elementary school and $ 29,442 for middle and upper school .
The girls had attended The University of Chicago Laboratory Schools , a prestigious private school where half of the students have parents who work at the university .
The Hyde Park based school has a similar mission in terms of diversity and celebrating " common humanity . "
The Obama girls will attend school on two different campuses — Sasha , a second - grader , in Bethesda , and Malia , a fifth - grader , in Washington , D.C .
School days open with a moment of silence , and each week there is “ meeting for worship ” where students sit for about 45 minutes in silence , or they can speak if they so choose .
Former Clinton classmates also said Secret Service agents tried to blend in — they dressed down , did not sit in on classrooms and were n’t talking into their sleeves all the time .
But even then — and that was before the Sept. 11 attacks — the Clintons said they picked Sidwell because they “ wanted to be able to tell the press and the public that they could not be allowed on the property , '' Hillary Clinton said after her daughter graduated in 1997 .
The Secret Service and Sidwell , which has its own security detail , declined to comment on security arrangements .
A Michelle Obama spokeswoman also declined to comment .
During the campaign , Michelle Obama had several conversations with Hillary Clinton about raising children in the limelight — a historian of “ first kids ” said the passing down of advice about child rearing in the White House stretches back to Jacqueline Kennedy , who studied the lives of first children before she became first lady .
Kennedy ’s advice for Clinton was to make sure her daughter had a life outside of the White House limelight .
Still , it is the newness of it all that might make it different for the Obama girls .
While they will be one of many Sidwell students with prominent parents , they will also be symbols , both nationally and internationally , because they are black .
Over the years , first children have fared better in the spotlight , according to historian Doug Wead , but the Obama family represents a real break from the past .
President George W. Bush alluded to that fact when he said that “ it will be a stirring sight to watch President Obama , his wife , Michelle , and their beautiful girls step through the doors of the White House . ”
Wead agreed .
“ People are just flabbergasted .
The Russians were just stunned by the election of the Obamas , and that this is a real democracy and the American dream is alive and really symbolized by Malia and Sasha , ” Wead said .
“ What they love and what they say and what they do — everyone will be watching and following them . ”
With its decision in Nordyke v. King last week , in which the recent Supreme Court Heller decision was applied to state law , the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals took another step down the long road of “ incorporating ”  the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment ’s Due Process Clause .
In doing so , it continued down the path toward completely inverting the model of government to which The People agreed when they ratified the Constitution .
The Preamble to the Bill of Rights says , in part , “  The Conventions of a number of the States , having at the time of their adopting the Constitution , expressed a desire , in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers , that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added …
RESOLVED … that the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States , as amendments to the Constitution of the United States …. ” 
( Are you surprised that you have never read this before ?
That it is not usually included in printed versions of the Constitution ?
What accounts for that omission , do you think ? )
Unsurprisingly , then , the First Amendment begins by saying , “  Congress shall make no law . ” 
Why ?
Because , as stated in its Preamble , the purpose of the Bill of Rights was to ensure that the Federal Government did not abuse its powers .
So widely was this understood to be the purpose of the Bill of Rights that in Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) , Chief Justice John Marshall for a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that the Bill of Rights limited only the powers of the Federal Government , not those of the states .
This was the only significant constitutional decision in which Marshall ever ruled against federal authority .
James Madison endeavored in the First Congress to include in Congress ’s proposed bill of rights an amendment providing for federal judicial oversight of states ”  behavior in respect to certain rights .
His effort was unavailing .
Thus , when “ originalist ” 
Antonin Scalia announced that the First Amendment establishes a right to burn a flag enforceable by federal courts against state authorities , he showed exactly how “ originalist ”  he really is .
When Randy Barnett took to the pages of The Wall Street Journal last week to state that federal protection of all individual rights against state infringement was part of the original plan of the U.S. Constitution , he revealed how concerned with the consent of the governed he really is .
And when notable gun-rights advocates such as Don Kates and Stephen P. Halbrook argued for the “ incorporation ”  of the Second Amendment into the Due Process Clause “  that is , for right - wing judicial legislation “  they demonstrated that , as has been true for most of American history , the Constitution has come to be ( in Jefferson ’s words ) “ a thing of wax ”  waiting to be reshaped by today ’s Judicial - Branch majority into the opposite of what it “ meant ”  yesterday .
As Raoul Berger showed years ago in his The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights ( for anyone who cared to know ) , the argument that the Due Process Clause was intended to work this thorough revolution in the American order is entirely bogus .
But judicial activists , nay , anti-constitutionalists on the right are no slower to deploy it than their mirror images on the Left to win through the federal judiciary what they desire : victories for their policies that they have been unable to achieve at the ballot box .
Concurring in the judgement of his three - judge panel , Judge Ronald M. Gould wrote that of course the Second Amendment did not empower individuals to keep nuclear weapons in their homes .
The incorporated Second Amendment gun right , then , would be subject to “ reasonable ”  regulation .
This is what the Incorporation Doctrine has given us : in place of reservation of these areas of law to state governments for regulation via legislative elections , we get seizure of control over them by unelected , unaccountable , politically connected lawyers ( that is , federal judges ) who purport to substitute “ reason ”  for the ( one infers ) “ unreasonable ”  regulations crafted by elected officials .
One does not have to be a gun banner to lament Nordyke v. King “  and all its cousins .
The Incorporation Doctrine sounds benign enough .
Who could oppose having federal courts stand up for individuals ”  rights , even if their doing so does violate the structure of the Constitution ?
Historically , however , it has not turned out so well .
It was under the cover of the Incorporation Doctrine that federal courts recently invented a right of child rapists not to face the ultimate penalty for their crimes .
It was under the cover of the Incorporation Doctrine , indeed , that a Supreme Court majority for several years banned capital punishment altogether .
It was under the cover of the Incorporation Doctrine that the Supreme Court eliminated state prohibitions of various types of pornography .
The Incorporation Doctrine also underlies the Court - created ban on prayer , even on moments of silence , in public schools .
The Incorporation Doctrine has allowed federal courts to invent rights to burn flags , ban invocations at high school graduations , and establish essentially a national code of “ acceptable ”  punishments .
Whatever one thinks of these various policy departures ( and many of them actually tickle my fancy ) , the bottom line is that every time a court invented one of them , or legions of other Incorporation Doctrine policies , it did so despite what the Constitution actually meant .
Which means that to the extent that we live under the Incorporation Doctrine , we live under a judicial dictatorship .
This video gives an excellent snapshot of the economic development in Angola , a country I have not been to since 1995 , and its business with China .
Angola , just like DRC , is one of Africa 's mineral richest countries , so no wonder there is quite an interest for its natural resources , only to be challenged by logistical nightmares .
There is a lot to be said about the deals China makes all over the world , securing oil , buying or leasing agricultural land and concluding massive hybrid aid / business contracts .
Just today , I stumbled upon the following two press articles :
From the Chinese Press Agency :
China provides US $ 600,000 of humanitarian aid to DR Congo .
From Reuters :
Congo to push forward with $ 9 bln Chinese mining contract .
Says enough , I think .
Two views , two perspectives , two sides to probably the same story .
As government to government aid has clearly failed in the past decennia ( read ' Dead Aid ' ) , maybe the business deals are the only true form of development for Africa .
If only the economic profits would also benefit the less fortunate in Africa .

IF ONLY men could learn from history .
Alas , experience is a “ lantern on the stern , which shines only on the waves behind us ” .
It is fitting that Martin Indyk , one of America 's most seasoned diplomats in the Middle East , starts his insider 's account of peacemaking under Bill Clinton with this famous passage by Samuel Taylor Coleridge .
For if Barack Obama intends to make peace between Israel and the Arabs , his first job is to understand why Mr Clinton , the last president to make a real effort to do so , discovered that he could not .
Mr Clinton faced far riper circumstances in the 1990s than Mr Obama inherits today .
He had in Yitzhak Rabin , Israel 's prime minister , a visionary leader willing to return the Golan Heights to Syria and negotiate directly with Yasser Arafat , whom previous Israeli leaders considered an incorrigible terrorist .
America wielded vast regional influence following its routing of Saddam Hussein in Kuwait and the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Arafat himself , having alienated many Arab leaders by supporting Saddam , was short of friends , cash and alternatives ; the “ freedom fighter ” seemed anxious to give diplomacy a chance .
Mr Indyk claims that the Clinton administration invested more time and prestige on this than on any other area of foreign policy .
It is certainly the case that most of the Americans and Israelis who took part in the Camp David summit of 2000 , and who have subsequently written accounts of what went wrong , blame Arafat rather than themselves for its collapse .
Since the members of Mr Clinton 's peace team were Jewish ( Mr Indyk says one Arab journalist called them “ the five rabbis ” ) , their neutrality is sometimes questioned .
Mr Indyk himself , originally an Australian , once worked for the chief Israeli lobby in America , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , before becoming a diplomat and serving twice as America 's ambassador to Israel .
Yet he admits mistakes and avoids blaming Arafat alone , confessing that the “ dark side ” of the “ innocent optimism ” with which America tackled diplomacy in the Middle East was a naivety bred of arrogance .
The main impression his book leaves is of the unforgiving complexity of this conflict , in a region where many conflicts connect together , and where the interplay of personality and politics can so often trip up history .
One problem , for example , was that Rabin was in a hurry .
Mr Clinton was thrilled to hear in 1993 that the former general was willing to cede the Golan Heights for peace with Syria .
But Rabin did not reveal that he was also negotiating secretly in Oslo with Arafat .
So while Mr Clinton focused merrily on squeezing a Syrian deal out of the late Hafez al - Assad , Rabin was in the end more enticed by the cheaper ( since it pushed Palestinian statehood into the future ) and quicker bargain he thought he could strike with Arafat .
In the event , the Syrian track failed .
The deal with Arafat , which was consummated with pomp and sentiment in the Rose Garden handshake of September 1993 , was deeply flawed .
Mr Indyk believes the failure of a second stab at a Syrian deal by Ehud Barak , another Israeli prime minister in a hurry , severely weakened Mr Clinton 's hand .
With the Syrian track dead , Arafat knew as he set off reluctantly for the Camp David summit in 2000 that the hopes of Mr Clinton and Mr Barak now depended on him .
Arafat feared being caught in a pincer and dared not make too big a compromise just as Palestinians were starting to admire Hizbullah 's success in ousting Israel from Lebanon by force and not diplomacy .
So Mr Indyk thinks that Arafat arrived at Camp David determined to avoid being cornered .
And when Mr Barak 's otherwise big concessions stopped short of yielding Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem 's Haram al - Sharif , where the great mosques stand , Arafat got the pretext he needed .
He could walk away as an Arab hero and await a better offer .
A better offer , including sovereignty over the Haram , duly came in “ the Clinton parameters ” .
But by then a new intifada had caught fire , Arafat could not bring himself to answer with a clear yes and the moment passed .
The Palestinian leaders , says Mr Indyk , later misled their people into believing that Mr Clinton had offered only three disconnected cantons on the West Bank .
In fact he had offered the whole of Gaza , 94 - 96 % of the West Bank , 1 - 3 % compensation for the rest , the Arab parts of Jerusalem and sovereignty over the Haram .
By pushing Oslo even though America had wanted Syria first , says Mr Indyk , Israel showed that the Israeli tail could wag the American dog .
But he does not say as much as he is supremely qualified to about the Israel lobby 's influence on diplomacy , beyond debunking the idea that this is the main thing that makes presidents go easy on Israel .
He says shared values and interests , and long experience of co-operation , not least in intelligence , matter more .
Allied to this is a tendency in peacemaking for America to defer to Israel 's ideas “ because its ally is the one that has to make the tangible concessions of territory ” .
Should the next president pile greater pressure on Israel ?
For all Rabin 's courage , notes Mr Indyk , he was “ deeply cautious ” towards the Jewish settlers in the occupied territories because he wanted to preserve his domestic political capital .
Mr Indyk now thinks America should stand up to Israeli leaders when they plead political trouble at home to fend off pressure to curb settlements .
He admits that Mr Clinton went easy not only because he sympathised with the predicament of his Israeli friends but also because George Bush senior 's harsh confrontation with Israel over settlements in the 1990s was considered later to have taken a serious toll of the president 's domestic support .
If Mr Indyk is a consummate insider , Patrick Tyler is a professional outsider : a reporter who has worked for the New York Times and Washington Post and who is best known for his 1999 book , “ A Great Wall : Six Presidents and China ” .
His new work , “ A World of Trouble : The White House and the Middle East ” uses the same format to tell America 's Middle Eastern story from General Eisenhower to George Bush .
The book has the merits and defects you might expect .
It is fast - paced and well - sourced but runs right from before the six - day war of 1967 to the present , and so has often to oversimplify .
Mr Tyler may also be a little too fond of glib judgments :
Mr Clinton 's peacemaking failed because he lacked the necessary “ unwavering principle , and political discipline ” ; the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was “ a fraudulent act of militarism ” ; and so forth .
Still , for anyone needing a reminder of how America got into its present pickle in the region , this is a brisk , enjoyable way to get it .
At times , as befits the Middle East , it reads almost like a thriller .
Mr Obama had better take a deep breath before diving in .
VASSAR -- James D. Smith died Monday beside his wife , Lynne A. Smith , at the same place where he saved her life almost 15 years ago -- the Shell gasoline station here .
Smith , 66 , of Vassar , was driving his Chevrolet S - 10 pickup on West Huron when he suffered a massive heart attack and died , his wife said .
A funeral will take place at 2 p.m. Friday at Wolverine Human Resources , also known as the Pioneer Work and Learn Center , 150 Enterprise in Vassar , with the Rev. Vincent McMillon officiating .
Burial will follow at Riverside Cemetery .
Lynne Smith said the couple was returning home from breakfast in Frankenmuth .
" I saw the pickup veering over and said , ' Jimmy , you 're going to hit the curb , ' and when I looked over at him , I knew he was gone , " she said .
As the truck went over the curb , Lynne Smith scrambled to take control and piloted the vehicle through some bushes .
It came to rest in the parking lot of the service station , also known as People 's Choice Market , 911 W. Huron .
" By the grace of God , there were no pedestrians or cars there , " she said .
It did n't immediately dawn on her where she was .
" It was so ironic , " she said .
" Somebody later brought it to my attention -- that he saved my life here and now his life ended here . "
The couple met at the service station about 35 years ago .
In 1994 , James Smith -- then a Vassar police officer -- saved the life of his future wife , then known as Lynne Butterfield .
Records show that Smith and Butterfield were in the market at 1:30 a.m. Aug. 21 , 1994 , when her estranged husband , Gary G. Butterfield , came in twice to buy a soft drink and a cup of coffee .
James Smith knew Gary Butterfield , having arrested him on Aug. 20 for stalking his wife .
When Butterfield , who was out on bail , entered the store for the second time , Smith got up to call 911 .
Police records show Lynne Butterfield got up to leave but Gary Butterfield pushed her down , pulled out a fillet knife and slashed her throat .
As he raised his arm a second time , Smith tackled him .
The cut left her with an 8 - inch - long , 1 1/2 - inch - deep wound from her left ear to her throat , along her jaw line .
Doctors said the knife missed her jugular vein by 2 centimeters and estimated she lost a quarter of her blood .
The slashing made national news .
By April 1995 , Lynne Smith was talking about the attack on the " Today Show . "
On Aug. 19 , 1995 , she married Smith .
Smith retired from the Vassar Police Department as a corporal in December 1999 after 28 years .
Butterfield , 57 , was serving a 12 - to 30 - year sentence at the Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson for assault with intent to commit murder and assault with a dangerous weapon .
John Cordell , spokesman for the state Department of Corrections , said Butterfield is eligible for parole but even if denied because of his " highly assaultive crime " status , he will go free on his maximum discharge date of Nov. 19 , 2019 .
Butterfield has had three parole hearings so far , Lynne Smith said .
She attended each one .
" His next one is in 2010 , and I will be there , " she said .
Apart from Iron Man , The Dark Knight , and Tropic Thunder , I was out of touch with the Oscars .

The world is getting hotter , and the main cause is greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activity .
Enormous damage has already been done , and we will have to live with the consequences of past emissions for decades , perhaps even centuries .
Unless we rapidly and drastically cut emissions , the existing damage will turn to catastrophe .
Anyone who denies that is either lying or somehow unaware of the huge mass of compelling scientific evidence .
Many publications regularly publish articles summarising the scientific evidence and outlining the devastation that we face if action is n’t taken quickly .
I highly recommend Green Left Weekly as a continuing source .
I ’m not going to repeat what you ’ve undoubtedly read there .
But I do want to draw your attention to an important recent development .
Last month , more than 2500 climate scientists met in Copenhagen to discuss the state of scientific knowledge on this subject .
And the one message that came through loud and clear was this : it ’s much worse than we thought .
What were called “ worst - case scenarios ” two years ago by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change actually understated the problem .
The final statement issued by the Copenhagen conference declared : “ The worst - case IPCC scenario trajectories ( or even worse ) are being realized … ”
Nicholas Stern , author of the landmark 2006 study , The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change now says , “ We underestimated the risks … we underestimated the damage associated with the temperature increases … and we underestimated the probability of temperature increases . ”
Seventeen years of failure -- with one exception
Later this year , the world ’s governments will meet , again in Copenhagen , to try to reach a new post - Kyoto climate treaty .
Will they meet the challenge of climate change that is much worse than expected ?
The politicians ’ record does not inspire hope .
Seventeen years ago , in June 1992 , 172 governments , including 108 heads of state , met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro .
That meeting produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , the first international agreement that aimed “ to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system . ”
In particular , the industrialised countries promised to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels .
Like the Kyoto Accord that followed it , that agreement was a failure .
The world ’s top politicians demonstrated their gross hypocrisy and their indifference to the future of humanity and nature by giving fine speeches and making promises -- and then continuing with business as usual .
But there was one exception .
In Rio one head of state spoke out strongly , and called for immediate emergency action -- and then returned home to support the implementation of practical policies for sustainable , low - emission development .
That head of state was Fidel Castro .
Fidel began his brief remarks to the plenary session of the 1992 Earth Summit with a blunt description of the crisis :
“ An important biological species is in danger of disappearing due to the fast and progressive destruction of its natural living conditions : [ hu ] mankind .
We have become aware of this problem when it is almost too late to stop it . ”
He placed the blame for the crisis squarely on the imperialist countries , and he finished with a warning that emergency action was needed : “ Tomorrow it will be too late to do what we should have done a long time ago . ”
After the 1992 Earth Summit , only the Cubans acted on their promises and commitments .
In 1992 Cuba amended its constitution to recognise the importance of “ sustainable economic and social development to make human life more rational and to ensure the survival , well - being and security of present and future generations ” .
The amended constitution obligates the provincial and municipal assemblies of People ’s Power to implement and enforce environmental protections .
And it says that “ it is the duty of citizens to contribute to the protection of the waters , atmosphere , the conservation of the soil , flora , fauna and nature ’s entire rich potential . ”
The Cubans have adopted low - fertiliser agriculture , and encouraged urban farming to reduce the distances food has to travel .
They have replaced all of their incandescent light bulbs with fluorescents and distributed energy efficient rice cookers .
They have stepped up reforestation , nearly doubling the island ’s forested area , to 25 % in 2006 .
As a result of these and many other projects , in 2006 the WWF concluded that Cuba is the only country in the world that meets the criteria for sustainable development .
By contrast , the countries responsible for the great majority of greenhouse gas emissions followed one of two paths .
Some gave lip service to cleaning up their acts , but in practice did little or nothing .
Others denied that action was needed and so did little or nothing .
As a result we are now very close to the tomorrow that Fidel spoke of , the tomorrow when it is too late .
Why Cuba ?
The WWF deserves credit for its honesty in reporting Cuba ’s achievements .
But the WWF failed to address the next logical question .
Why was Cuba the exception ?
Why could a tiny island republic in the Caribbean do what no other country could do ?
And the next question after that is , why have the richest countries in the world not cut their emissions , not developed sustainable economies ?
Why , despite their enormous physical and scientific resources , has their performance actually gotten worse ?
The first question , why Cuba could do it , was answered not long ago by Armando Choy , a leader of the Cuban revolution who has recently headed the drive to clean up Havana Bay .
His explanation was very clear and compelling :
“ This is possible because our system is socialist in character and commitment , and because the revolution ’s top leadership acts in the interests of the majority of humanity inhabiting planet earth -- not on behalf of narrow individual interests , or even simply Cuba ’s national interests . ”
General Choy ’s comments reminded me of a passage in Capital , a paragraph that all by itself refutes the claim that is sometimes made , that Marxism has nothing in common with ecology .
Karl Marx wrote :
“ Even an entire society , a nation , or all simultaneously existing societies taken together , are not the owners of the earth .
They are simply its possessors , its beneficiaries , and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations . ”
I ’ve never known any socialist organisation to make this point explicitly , but Marx ’s words imply that one of the key objectives of socialism must be to build a society in which human beings work consciously to be good ancestors .
And that is what the Cubans are doing in practice .
The idea that we must act in the present to build a better world for the future , has been a theme of the Cuban revolutionary movement since Fidel ’s great 1953 speech , History Will Absolve Me .
That commitment to future generations is central to what has justly been called the greening of the Cuban revolution .
The Cubans are committed , not just in words but in practice , to being good ancestors , not only to future Cubans , but to future generations around the globe .
Why not capitalism ?
But what about the other side of the question ?
Why do we not see a similar commitment in the ruling classes of Australia , or Canada , or the United States ?
If you ask any of them individually , our rulers would undoubtedly say that they want their children and grandchildren to live in a stable and sustainable world .
So why do their actions contradict their words ?
Why do they seem determined , in practice , to leave their children and grandchildren a world of poisoned air and water , a world of floods and droughts and escalating climate disasters ?
Why have they repeatedly sabotaged international efforts to adopt even half - hearted measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions ?
When they do consider or implement responses to the climate crisis , why do they always support solutions that do not work , that cannot possibly work ?
Karl Marx had a wonderful phrase for the bosses and their agents -- the big shareholders and executives and top managers and the politicians they own -- a phrase that explains why they invariably act against the present and future interests of humanity .
These people , he said , are “ personifications of capital ” .
Regardless of how they behave at home , or with their children , their social role is that of capital in human form .
They do n’t act to stop climate change because the changes needed by the people of this world are directly contrary to the needs of capital .
Capital has no conscience .
Capital ca n’t be anyone ’s ancestor because capital has no children .
Capital has only one imperative : it has to grow .
The only reason for using money to buy shares , launch a corporation , build a factory or drill an oil well is to get more money back than you invested .
That does n’t always happen , of course -- some investments fail to produce profits , and , as we are seeing today , periodically the entire system goes into freefall , wiping out jobs and livelihoods and destroying capital .
But that does n’t contradict the fact that the potential for profit , to make capital grow , is a defining feature of capitalism .
Without it , the system would rapidly collapse .
As ecosocialist Joel Kovel says : “ Capitalism can no more survive limits on growth than a person can live without breathing . ”
A system of growth and waste
Under capitalism , the only measure of success is how much is sold every day , every week , every year .
It does n’t matter that the sales include vast quantities of products that are directly harmful to both humans and nature , or that many commodities cannot be produced without spreading disease , destroying the forests that produce the oxygen we breathe , demolishing ecosystems , and treating our water , air and soil as sewers for the disposal of industrial waste .
It all contributes to profits , and thus to the growth of capital -- and that ’s what counts .
In Capital , Marx wrote that from a capitalist ’s perspective , raw materials such as metals , minerals , coal , stone , etc. are “ furnished by Nature gratis ” .
The wealth of nature does n’t have to be paid for or replaced when it is used -- it is there for the taking .
If the capitalists had to pay the real cost of replacing or restoring that wealth , their profits would fall drastically .
That ’s true not only of raw materials , but also of what are sometimes called “ environmental services ” -- the water and air that have been absorbing capitalism ’s waste products for centuries .
They have been treated as free sewers and free garbage dumps , “ furnished by Nature gratis ” .
That ’s what the pioneering environmental economist William Kapp meant nearly 60 years ago , when he wrote , “ Capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs ” .
Kapp wrote that capitalism ’s claims of efficiency and productivity are : “ nothing more than an institutionalized cover under which it is possible for private enterprise to shift part of the costs to the shoulders of others and to practice a form of large - scale spoliation which transcends everything the early socialists had in mind when they spoke of the exploitation of man by man . ”
In short , pollution is not an accident , and it is not a “ market failure ” .
It is the way the system works .
How large is the problem ?
In 1998 the World Resources Institute conducted a major international study of the resource inputs used by corporations in major industrial countries -- water , raw materials , fuel and so on .
Then it determined what happened to those inputs .
The institute found that , “ One half to three quarters of annual resource inputs to industrial economies are returned to the environment as wastes within a year . ”
Similar numbers are reported by others .
As you know , about a billion people live in hunger .
And yet , as the head of the United Nations Environmental Program said recently , “ Over half of the food produced today is either lost , wasted or discarded as a result of inefficiency in the human - managed food chain . ”
“ Inefficiency ” in this case means that there is no profit to be made by preventing food waste -- so waste continues .
In addition to exacerbating world hunger , capitalism ’s gross inefficiency poisons the land and water with food that is harvested but not used .
Capitalism ’s destructive DNA
Capitalism combines an irresistible drive to grow , with an irresistible drive to create waste and pollution .
If nothing stops it , capitalism will expand both those processes infinitely .
But the Earth is not infinite .
The atmosphere and oceans and the forests are very large , but ultimately they are finite , limited resources -- and capitalism is now pressing against those limits .
The 2006 WWF Living Planet Report concludes , “ The Earth ’s regenerative capacity can no longer keep up with demand -- people are turning resources into waste faster than nature can turn waste back into resources . ”
My only disagreement with that statement is that it places the blame on “ people ” as an abstract category .
In fact the devastation is caused by the global capitalist system , and by the tiny class of exploiters that profits from capitalism ’s continued growth .
The great majority of people are victims , not perpetrators .
In particular , capitalist pollution has passed the physical limit of the ability of nature to absorb carbon dioxide and other gases while keeping the Earth ’s temperature steady .
As a result , the world is warmer today than it has been for 100,000 years , and the temperature continues to rise .
Greenhouse gas emissions are not unusual or exceptional .
Pouring crap into the environment is a fundamental feature of capitalism , and it is n’t going to stop so long as capitalism survives .
That ’s why “ solutions ” like carbon trading have failed so badly and will continue to fail : waste and pollution and ecological destruction are built into the system ’s DNA .
No matter how carefully the scheme is developed , no matter how many loopholes are identified and plugged , and no matter how sincere the implementers and administrators may be , capitalism ’s fundamental nature will always prevail .
We ’ve seen that happen with Kyoto ’s ``Clean Development Mechanism '' , under which polluters in rich countries can avoid cutting their own emissions if they invest in equivalent emission - reducing projects in the Third World .
A Stanford University study shows that two - thirds or more of the CDM emission - reduction credits have not produced any reductions in pollution .
The entire system is based on what one observer says are “ enough lies to make a sub - prime mortgage pusher blush ” .
CDM continues not because it is reducing emissions , but because there are profits to be made buying and selling credits .
CDM is an attempt to trick the market into doing good in spite of itself , but capitalism ’s drive for profits wins every time .
Green eco-capitalists
One of the greatest weaknesses of the mainstream environmental movement has been its failure or refusal to identify capitalism as the root problem .
Indeed , many of the world ’s Green parties , including the one in Canada where I live , openly describe themselves as eco-capitalist , committed to maintaining the profit system .
Of course this puts them in a contradictory position when they face the reality of capitalist ecocide .
In Canada , as you may know , oil companies are engaged in what the British newspaper The Independent accurately called “ The Biggest Environmental Crime in History ” , mining the Alberta tar sands .
If it continues , it will ultimately destroy an area that is nearly twice as big as New South Wales , in order to produce oil by a process that generates three times as much greenhouse gas as normal oil production .
It is also destroying ecosystems , killing animals , fish and birds , and poisoning the drinking water used by Indigenous peoples in that area .
It ’s obvious that anyone who is serious about protecting the environment and stopping emissions should demand that the tar sands be shut down .
But when I raised that in a talk not long ago in Vancouver , a Green Party candidate in the audience objected that that would be irresponsible , because it would violate the oil companies ’ contract rights .
Evidently , for these eco-capitalists , “ capitalism ” takes precedence over “ eco ” .
But as capitalist destruction accelerates , and as capitalist politicians continue to stall , or to introduce measures that only benefit the fossil fuel companies , we can expect that many of the most sincere and dedicated greens will begin to question the system itself , not just its worst results .
Greens moving left : Gus Speth
An important case in point , and , I hope , a harbinger of what ’s to come in green circles - is James Gustave Speth , who is now dean of the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies .
Gus Speth has spent most of his life trying to save the environment by working inside the system .
He was a senior environmental advisor to US President Jimmy Carter , and later to Bill Clinton .
In the 1990s he was Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and Chair of the United Nations Development Group .
Time magazine called him “ the ultimate insider . ”
Last year , after 40 years working inside the system , Speth published a book called The Bridge at the Edge of the World : Capitalism , the Environment , and Crossing from Crisis to Stability .
In it , he argues that working inside the system has failed - because the system itself is the cause of environmental destruction .
“ My conclusion , after much searching and considerable reluctance , is that most environmental deterioration is a result of systemic failures of the capitalism that we have today …
“ Inherent in the dynamics of capitalism is a powerful drive to earn profits , invest them , innovate , and thus grow the economy , typically at exponential rates … ”
That ’s exactly correct - no Marxist could have said it better .
Nor could we improve on Speth ’s summary of the factors that combine to make contemporary capitalism the enemy of ecology .
“ An unquestioning society - wide commitment to economic growth at almost any cost ; enormous investment in technologies designed with little regard for the environment ; powerful corporate interests whose overriding objective is to grow by generating profit , including profit from avoiding the environmental costs they create ; markets that systematically fail to recognize environmental costs unless corrected by government ; government that is subservient to corporate interests and the growth imperative ; rampant consumerism spurred by a worshipping of novelty and by sophisticated advertising ; economic activity so large in scale that its impacts alter the fundamental biophysical operations of the planet ; all combine to deliver an ever - growing world economy that is undermining the planet ’s ability to sustain life . ”
Speth is not a Marxist .
He still hopes that governments can reform and control capitalism , eliminating pollution .
He ’s wrong about that , but his analysis of the problem is dead - on , and the fact that it comes from someone who has worked for so long inside the system makes his argument against capitalism credible and powerful .
The socialist movement should welcome and publicize this development , even though Speth and others like him , do n’t yet take their ideas to the necessary socialist conclusions .
Greens moving left : James Hansen
Similarly , we should be very encouraged that NASA ’s James Hansen , one of the world ’s most respected climate scientists , joined in the March 20 demonstration against a planned coal - fired electricity plant in Coventry , England .
Hansen is another environmentalist who has worked inside the system for years .
He told the UK Guardian that people should first use the “ democratic process ” by which he means elections .
He went on :
“ What is frustrating people , me included , is that democratic action affects elections but what we get then from political leaders is greenwash .
“ The democratic process is supposed to be one person one vote , but it turns out that money is talking louder than the votes .
So , I ’m not surprised that people are getting frustrated .
“ I think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order , because we ’re running out of time . ”
In the same interview , Hansen expressed concern about the approach of the Obama administration :
“ It ’s not clear what their intentions are yet , but if they are going to support cap and trade then unfortunately I think that will be another case of greenwash .
It ’s going to take stronger action than that . ”
Like Speth , Hansen is not a socialist .
But he condemns the most widely - promoted market - based “ solution , ” and he calls for demonstrations and protests , so ecosocialists can and must view him as an ally .
Why ECOsocialism ?
Which brings me to a question I ’ve been asked many times , including during this visit to Australia .
“ Why ecosocialism ? ”
Why not just say ’ socialism ’?
Marx and Engels were deeply concerned about humanity ’s relationship to nature , and what we would today call ecological ideas are deeply embedded in their writings .
In the 1920s , there was a very influential ecology movement in the Soviet Union .
So why do we need a new word ?
All that is true .
But it is also true that during the 20th century socialists forgot or ignored that tradition , supporting ( and in some cases implementing ) approaches to economic growth and development that were grossly harmful to the environment .
Socialist Voice recently published an interview in which Oswaldo Martinez , the president of the Economic Affairs Commission of Cuba ’s National Assembly addressed just that question .
He said :
“ The socialism practiced by the countries of the Socialist Camp replicated the development model of capitalism , in the sense that socialism was conceived as a quantitative result of growth in productive forces .
It thus established a purely quantitative competition with capitalism , and development consisted in achieving this without taking into account that the capitalist model of development is the structuring of a consumer society that is inconceivable for humanity as a whole .
“ The planet would not survive .
It is impossible to replicate the model of one car for each family , the model of the idyllic North American society , Hollywood etc. - absolutely impossible , and this cannot be the reality for the 250 million inhabitants of the United States , with a huge rearguard of poverty in the rest of the world .
“ It is therefore necessary to come up with another model of development that is compatible with the environment and has a much more collective way of functioning . ”
In my view , one good reason for using the word ‘ ecosocialism ’ is to signal a clear break with the practices that Martinez describes , practices were called socialist for seventy years .
It is a way of saying that we aim not to create a society based on having more things , but on living better - not quantitative growth , but qualitative change .
Another reason , just as important , is to signal loud and clear that we view ecology and climate change not as just as another stick to bash capitalism with , but as one of the principal problems facing humanity in this century .
Evo Morales :
Save the planet from capitalism
Although he has never used the word , so far as I know , one of the strongest defenders of ecosocialist ideas in the world today is Evo Morales , the president of Bolivia , the first indigenous head of state in Latin America .
In a short essay published last November , Evo brilliantly defined the problem , named the villain , and posed the alternative .
“ Competition and the thirst for profit without limits of the capitalist system are destroying the planet .
Under Capitalism we are not human beings but consumers .
Under Capitalism , Mother Earth does not exist , instead there are raw materials .
Capitalism is the source of the asymmetries and imbalances in the world .
It generates luxury , ostentation and waste for a few , while millions in the world die from hunger in the world .
“ In the hands of capitalism everything becomes a commodity : the water , the soil , the human genome , the ancestral cultures , justice , ethics , death … and life itself .
Everything , absolutely everything , can be bought and sold and under capitalism .
And even “ climate change ” itself has become a business .
“ Climate change ” has placed all humankind before a great choice : to continue in the ways of capitalism and death , or to start down the path of harmony with nature and respect for life . ”
You know , last year I spent months working with other members of the Ecosocialist International Network , composing a statement to be distributed at the World Social Forum .
It was finally published as the Belem Ecosocialist Declaration .
( See http://climateandcapitalism.com/?p=597)
Now I wonder why we did n’t just publish this statement by comrade Evo Morales .
He set out the case for ecosocialism , including a program of 20 demands , more concisely , more clearly , and vastly more eloquently than we did .
I urge you to read it and to distribute it as widely as possible .

Slamming on the brakes
Writing in the 1930s when Nazi barbarism was in the rise , the Marxist philosopher and literary critic Walter Benjamin said :
“ Marx says that revolutions are the locomotives of world history .
But the situation may be quite different .
Perhaps revolutions are not the train ride , but the human race grabbing for the emergency brake . ”
That ’s a powerful and profound metaphor .
Capitalism has been so destructive , and taken us so far down the road to catastrophe , that one of the first tasks facing a socialist government will be to slam on the brakes .
The only choice , the only way forward , is ecosocialism , which I suggest can be defined simply as a socialism that will give top priority to the restoration of ecosystems that capitalism has destroyed , to the reestablishment of agriculture and industry on ecologically sound principles , and to mending what Marx called the metabolic rift , the destructive divide that capitalism has created between humanity and nature .
The fate of the ecological struggle is closely tied to the fortunes of the class struggle as a whole .
The long neo-liberal drive to weaken the movements of working people also undermined ecological resistance , isolating it , pushing its leaders and organizations to the right .
But today neo-liberalism is discredited .
Its financial and economic structures are in shambles .
There is growing recognition that profound economic change is needed .
This is an historic opportunity for ecological activists to join hands with workers , with indigenous activists , with anti-imperialist movements here and around the world , to make ecological transformation a central feature of the economic change that is so clearly needed .
Together we can build a society of Good Ancestors , and cooperatively create a better world for future generations .
It wo n’t be easy , and it wo n’t be quick , but together we can make it happen .
Thank you .

" Why
are we suddenly having an explosion in guys asking for vasectomies ? "
This is a question Dr. Steven Jones ’ staff asks him a lot lately , the
Cleveland Urologist told CNN .
Dr. Marc Goldstein , a New York - based urologist in practice for over
thirty years , told the network , " I have never seen anything like this .
When things started to go south in the stock market , then the vasectomy
consults went north . "
The folks over at vasectomy.com no doubt were
pleased for snagging that most awesome domain name .
Little did they
know a bad economy would provide their payday ; the number of
appointment requests through their site spiked 30 percent in January .
It ’s
not just men who are suddenly concerned about their family ’s future .
Consumers are spending more money on all types of contraceptives ,
according to the Nielson Company .
Indeed , the embrace of family
planning appears to be a critical step in financial planning .
Nielson
said sales of over - the - counter contraceptives jumped a dazzling 10.2
percent in the first two months of the year .
The company reports that ,
while other retail sales slip , condom sales jumped
up 5 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 6 % in January , compared with
the same time periods last year .
Sales of Essure , a non-invasive ,
irreversible birth control method for women were up also , 28 % over last year ’s sales .
Planned Parenthood clinics , the leading provider of contraception in the country , also report
increased traffic over the past several months , according to Tait Sye ,
spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
" There ’s no
question we ’re seeing increased traffic at most clinics , and many
clinics report an increase in new patients as well , " Sye said .
A
spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa told the local TV news the number of women in the state asking for access to birth control is up nearly 40 percent .
So
much for contraception being a non-sequitur in discussions about the
economy .
Just a couple of month ago , Congressional Republicans , fresh
from their first meeting with Obama , stood snickering before the press
about the inclusion of a family planning provision in the president ’s
emergency economic plan .
What does birth control have to do with the
economy ?
they chided , suggesting Obama might be trying to sneak a
liberal social program by them .
Minority Leader Representative John
Boehner protested ,
" Regardless of where anyone stands on taxpayer funding for
contraceptives and the abortion industry , there is no doubt that this
once little - known provision in the congressional Democrats ’ spending
plan has NOTHING ( emphasis his ) to do with fixing the economy and
creating more American jobs . "
It was lost on the Republicans , many of
whom oppose contraception for ‘ moral ’ reasons , that rational people
facing hazardous economic times need to control the number of children
they have to support .
And , by the way , that kind of responsible
behavior is good for the economy which can hardly afford the social
programs to support families who ca n’t make it on their own .
( Republicans are supposedly for responsibility except … when they ’re
not . )
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .

Boehner might want to check in with that Joe the Plumber
demographic who , if recent trends are any indicator , not only considers
contraception a great form of protection against uncertain times but is
opting for the permanent form at that .
( And for any Joe without
insurance that vasectomy will cost
between $ 500 - $ 1000 , probably twice as much as his tax cut .
The
contraception provision in the stimulus package would have extended
coverage for this kind of contraceptive and others to those above
earning 200 % above the federal poverty level .
So Joe , when you lay out
that stack of cash do n’t forget to thank Boehner who thinks your decision to prevent an unaffordable pregnancy is too silly to cover . )
The Salt Lake Tribune
recently interviewed a local couple in their twenties who see pregnancy
prevention as key to their family ’s survival .
They have two kids , 2
years old and 3 months , and were attending a state insurance fair to
sign up for health insurance .
He works two part - time jobs and she stays
at home caring for the kids .
Money is a constant worry — he foregoes
medications to pay for diapers and the electric bill .
She explained
that they are being " way more careful " about preventing pregnancy .
The
couple is hoping to qualify for government insurance in order to get
birth control .
" I just worry if the economy is going to get worse .
I
would starve myself before my kids [ go hungry ] .
What if it gets so bad
I do n’t have food for them ? "
Cut to eye - rolling Congressional
Republicans .
Family planning is nothing less than a foundation
on which many Americans build sturdy , responsible lives .
Regardless of
political affiliation , that ’s exactly what many are struggling to do
right now .
Those who have lost their jobs and health insurance are in
great need of family planning .
They ’re also , alarmingly , the ones with
the least access to it .
Meanwhile Republicans openly mock attempts to include family planning as a part of the economic recovery , actively work to defund Planned Parenthood , promote policies that encourage health care workers to deny patients access to contraception , and defend programs that withhold basic information about contraception to sexually active teens .
( Then they ’re baffled to find the number of teen parents spiked during the Bush years . )
Family
planning is an American family value and , as national data indicate ,
something we rely on in our greatest times of need .
Attacks on our
right to plan our families shred the social safety net .
The Republicans
are welcome to titter and heckle the next time a proposal to support
family planning crosses their desks .
Doing so will only reveal how
astoundingly out of touch they are from American ’s real lives and needs .
Sudan / Darfur : Test for “ Humanitarian ” Aggression
Sudan / Darfur is Test Case for Obama ’s “ Humanitarian ” Aggression
by Glen Ford ,
Black Agenda Report
Sudanese President Omar Al - Bashir had no choice but to expel the western " aid " organizations that had merged with the American propaganda machine aimed at regime change in Khartoum .
Obama operatives like UN Ambassador Susan Rice have for years been " eager to blockade Sudan 's ports " and to launch " selective " bombing raids against Sudan .
When imperial doctrine claims the right to intervene whenever disasters overtake sovereign countries - and proceeds to create and exacerbate those disasters - then no government is safe against regime change .
President Obama " appears to be fine - tuning a ‘ humanitarian ' interventionist doctrine that is applicable to any point on the planet . "
“ Obama has not broken the American mold , but rather , appears to be fine - tuning a ‘ humanitarian ’ interventionist doctrine . ”
Any government in the world that believes it has been targeted for regime change by the United States and its allies would be foolish to allow western - based nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) to operate freely in its territory .
When Sudanese President Omar Al - Bashir evicted 13 western NGOs from his country last month , he was responding quite rationally to the clear threat of so - called “ humanitarian ” military intervention by the U.S. under the pretext of “ rescuing ” Sudanese in the war - torn Darfur region .
Under the Obama administration , a military interventionist doctrine is rapidly crystallizing around the concept of “ Responsibility to Protect , ” or R2P , which holds that nations have a responsibility to forcibly intervene when a state is judged to be unwilling or unable to protect or otherwise fulfill its responsibilities to its people – responsibilities that can be broadly or narrowly defined .
United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice and Samantha Power , a member of Obama ’s National Security Council , are leading advocates of a broad and unilateralist interpretation of R2P .
Both are very close to President Obama , and can be assumed to reflect his thinking on foreign policy .
And both are implacably hostile to Omar Al - Bashir ’s government in Sudan .
Rice is eager to blockade Sudan ’s ports and to launch “ selective ” bombing raids .
“ Almost the entire Arab and African world supports Sudan against the ICC . ”
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is also a hawk on Sudan , who talks of enforcing no - fly zones over Darfur .
That ’s the same policy the U.S. pursued against Iraq in the interim between the 1991 and 2003 wars .
The logic leads inexorably to incremental invasion and regime change in Sudan .
The crisis exploded when Bashir was indicted for “ crimes against humanity ” – a step below formal charges of genocide – by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , a body whose prosecutorial urges seem limited to Africa .
As reported by IRIN , a news service of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs : “ Almost the entire Arab and African world supports Sudan against the ICC , arguing it is a biased and political tool that only targets Africans and infringes sovereignty . ”
The African Union and the Arab League have long opposed ICC action against Sudan , on national sovereignty grounds and because an indictment could have been predicted to lead to disruptions in international aid to Darfuran refugees .
President Obama has dispatched a U.S. Air Force general as his special envoy to Sudan to deal with , in Obama ’s words , the “ immediate crisis prompted by the Khartoum government 's expulsion of non-governmental organizations that are providing aid to displaced persons inside of Sudan . "
Obama is reaching for the heights of hypocrisy .
First , the United States is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court , fearing that its own numerous and constant violations of international law might land an American president in the dock , one day .
Second , the entire purpose of U.S. policy toward Sudan is to create a crisis in hopes of toppling the regime and transforming the largest country in Africa – or big , dismembered chunks of it – into a client of the United States .
Susan Rice can’t wait for her “ Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Sudan ” moment to arrive .
Obama ’s envoy / general would like to get an audience with his Sudanese military counterparts , and talk coup .
“ Susan Rice ca n’t wait for her ‘ Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Sudan ’ moment to arrive . ”
The American search for a pretext for “ humanitarian ” military intervention is perfectly understood by the Darfur rebel groups seeking to topple Bashir , who control the refugee camps in Darfur .
No sooner had President Bashir kicked the western NGOs out , than “ activists ” in the 88,000 - person Kalma refugee camp organized a “ strike ” against accepting aid from United Nations relief organizations .
As the Los Angeles Times reported on March 21 :
" ’We want the international [ aid groups ] back , ’ said Ali Abdel Khaman Tahir , the chief sheik at Kalma , speaking by telephone because the government is refusing to allow journalists in the camp , which is on the edge of Nyala , the capital of Southern Darfur province .
" ’If we allow them to distribute the food , then the government will be able to say to the world that everything is OK in Kalma , ’ said Mubarak Shafi , a camp activist .
‘ We want all the other problems solved first . ’ "
The “ problems ” the “ activist ” refers to are political , ultimately devolving to autonomy or independence for the region .
The rebel groups are intimately involved with U.S. allies in the region and western individuals and NGOs attached to the aid effort .
In accordance with Washington ’s wishes , the rebel - led refugees demanded that their pipelines to western media , the NGOs , be allowed back in .
Food and medicine were not the issue .
Nor is refugee relief a priority of the Obama administration .
It ’s all about regime change .
“ The rebel groups are intimately involved with U.S. allies in the region and western individuals and NGOs attached to the aid effort . ”
The Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) , a major rebel faction , has offices in Tel Aviv .
ABC News reports that “ Israel has conducted three military strikes against targets in Sudan since January in an effort to prevent what were believed to be Iranian weapons shipments from reaching Hamas in the Gaza Strip . ”
The alleged Gaza / Iran connection is for western consumption .
In fact , Israel is in the vanguard of U.S. clients , including Uganda , Rwanda , Kenya , Ethiopia and Chad , that connive to dissolve the Sudanese state .
When “ humanitarian ” intervention and “ Responsibility to Protect ” are the watchwords of superpower imperial destabilization policies , no targeted nation can afford to host western “ aid ” groups that feed the propaganda machines of aggressors .
Ethnic and other conflicts in Sudan are quite complex ( see Mahmood Mamdani , “ What 's Really Happening In Darfur ? ” BAR ) , and the numbers and nature of mortality in Darfur are in serious dispute everywhere except in the U.S. corporate media .
The Washington narrative is constructed for the sole purpose of overthrowing the Sudanese government .
States will do whatever is necessary to preserve themselves , and in Sudan ’s case , that meant the western echo - operatives in the “ aid ” industry in Darfur had to go .
The U.S. knew full well that its destabilization campaign against Sudan would ultimately achieve just such a result .
“ The Washington narrative is constructed for the sole purpose of overthrowing the Sudanese government . ”
The United Nations has also adopted a form of R2P , which authorizes the UN Security Council to intervene in the affairs of individual states when " national authorities [ are ] manifestly failing to protect their populations from genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity . ”
But the United States cannot count on manipulating the UN Security Council , which includes China and Russia , to achieve its narrow imperialist goals – in this case , regime change in Sudan .
The Americans are unilateralists .
They ca n’t even bring themselves to join the International Criminal Court – although they revel in its indictments of Africans .
Obama has not broken the American mold , but rather , appears to be fine - tuning a “ humanitarian ” interventionist doctrine that is applicable to any point on the planet where crises can be exploited to create chaos worthy of the Lone Ranger ’s armed attentions .
Call it Disaster Imperialism .

The same ratio of two varieties of titanium has been found in a range of meteorites , hinting that the cloud of gas and dust that formed the solar system was well - mixed before the first solids formed ( Illustration : NASA )
The solar system emerged from a well - blended soup of dust and gas despite being cobbled together from the remains of multiple exploded stars , new meteorite measurements suggest .
Meteorites form a fossil record of the conditions that existed when they formed .
By looking at the chemical makeup of some rocks , evidence has mounted in recent years that sun and the rest of the solar system formed from a cloud of debris blasted away from a number of supernovae .
But it is still unclear what that cloud – the solar nebula – looked like or how many stars might have been involved in the Sun ’s birth .
Now , a team led by Martin Bizzarro of the Natural History Museum of Denmark has found one clue .
Bizzarro and colleagues measured the levels of titanium in meteorites from the moon and Mars as well as inclusions in some meteorites that are thought to be the oldest rocks in the solar system .

Stable forms
Titanium is a good probe for conditions billions of years ago because it does not evaporate easily .
It also has a number of stable isotopes – forms of the element that contain different numbers of neutrons – that can be used to cross - check each other .
Although the concentration of titanium varied from rock to rock , the team found that two isotopes of titanium – titanium - 50 and titanium - 46 – were always found in the same ratio .
“ It is quite astonishing , ” since these two different isotopes probably formed in different stellar explosions , Bizzarro told New Scientist .
Titanium - 46 , which contains 22 protons and 24 neutrons , is created inside the cores of massive collapsing stars .
Titanium - 50 , which contains 22 protons and 28 neutrons , is commonly created when white dwarf stars explode as type Ia supernovae after gorging on a companion star .
Well mixed
If these two types of titanium come from two sources but are always found in the same ratio , the solar nebula must have been very well mixed .
The level of mixing seems to exceed what meteorite researchers have seen in the isotopes of other elements , Bizzarro says .
“ People thought that the isotope anomalies typically reflected that the cloud from which the solar system formed was not very well homogenised , ” says Bizzarro .
He suspects the differences that are seen between the planets , asteroids , and other rocks came later , when the young sun was more active , sending out vaporising solar flares .
Stray cloud
But there may be alternative explanations for the seemingly universal ratio of titanium concentrations .
The mix could also be explained if a stray cloud of dust containing both varieties of titanium hit the early solar system , says Jeff Hester of Arizona State University in Tempe .
“ Then you could have wild inhomogeneity in how the dust was distributed in the solar disc , while preserving the association between the two isotopes of titanium , ” he says .

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow .
( American poet , 1807 - 1882 )
There was a little girl , who had a little curl
Right in the middle of her forehead ,
And when she was good , she was very , very good ,
But when she was bad she was horrid .
She stood on her head , on her little trundle bed ,
With nobody by for to hinder ;
She screamed and she squalled , she yelled and she bawled ,
And drummed her little heels against the winder .
Her mother heard the noise , and thought it was the boys
Playing in the empty attic ,
She rushed upstairs , and caught her unawares ,
And spanked her , most emphatic .
But Philip Roth 's 1967 book But Philip Roth 's 1967 book When She Was Good was actually based on his first wife , according to Wikipedia .
And Norma Fox Mazer also wrote a sad novel called " When She Was Good " in 2000 .

One of the top 10 questions people who end up at this site put into search engines such as Google is a query about how to distinguish between porter and stout , something I ’ve not actually tackled head - on yet .
So – what difference is there between the two beers ?
Er …
None .
Not now , anyway , not in any meaningful way .
I ’m not sure that there was ever a point , even when porter was at its most debased , when you could point to any truly distinctive difference between porter and stout except to say that “ stout ” meant a stronger version of porter .
Indeed , for much of the past 300 years , to ask “ what ’s the difference between porter and stout ? ” would have been like asking “ what ’s the difference between dogs and Rottweilers ? ”
Since the revival of porter brewing , or to be more accurate , “ the revival of beers being called porter ” , even the “ different strength ” division has vanished , with several brewers making “ stouts ” that are weaker than their “ porters ” , I do n’t believe it ’s at all possible to draw a line and state categorically about dark beers being brewed today : “ Everything over here is a stout and everything over there is a porter . ”
You ca n’t even draw a couple of meaningful Venn diagram circles and label one stout and the other porter : in terms of strength , ingredients , flavour and appearance , modern - day stouts and porters , I suggest , with the exception of “ milk stouts ” , occupy effectively identical spaces .
Here ’s a quick and dirty survey of 30 more or less randomly chosen porters and stouts from the 2009 Good Beer Guide , 15 of each , with their ABVs and the adjectives used to describe them :
Porters 2009 Brewer ABV Adjectives Elland 6.5 % creamy liquorice chocolate roast malt Larkins 5.2 % roast bitter - sweet fruity Oulton 5.2 % fruity bitter - sweet Cox & Holbrook 5.0 % caramel roast malt very sweet White Horse 5.0 % dark red chocolate fruity berry Wicked Hathern 4.8 % ruby lightly smoked chocolately nutty Beowolf 4.7 % mint - chocolate liquorice roast fruit toffee Berrow 4.6 % ruby hops Bartrams 4.5 % ruby hops Burton Bridge 4.5 % malty roast fruit liquorice bitter Enville 4.5 % sulphurous sweet fruity Moor 4.5 % fruity roast malt slightly sweet RCH 4.5 % chocolate coffee roast dark fruits Vale 4.3 % roast rich fruitiness sweet to dry hoppy Pilgrim 4.0 % roast bitter - sweet berry fruit Average 4.8 % Stouts 2009 Brewer ABV Adjectives Outstanding 5.5 % bitter liquorice Burton Bridge 5.0 % roast malty fruity Famous Railway Tavern 5.0 % full - bodied intense roast grain sweet to dry Keynsham 5.0 % roast liquorice smoky Wapping 5.0 % bitter fruit dry Bartrams 4.8 % biscuity smoked lightly roast coffee Beowulf 4.7 % charcoal liquorice raisins Wye Valley 4.6 % smooth roast bitter B &T 4.5 % bitter coffee roast Goachers 4.5 % Irish - style Hop Back 4.5 % roast sweet malty Titanic 4.5 % tobacco smoke liquorice chocolate dry Town House 4.5 % roast chocolate toffee sweet to bitter Big Lamp 4.4 % roast malty Woodlands 4.4 % creamy roast dry Average 4.7 %
The porters , you will notice , are on average slightly stronger than the stouts , though if you take the Elland 1872 Porter out , the averages are exactly the same .
Commonest adjectives used for porters : roast ( 60 % ) fruity ( 53 % ) chocolate ( 33 % ) sweet ( 27 % ) liquorice ( 20 % ) ruby ( 20 % ) .
Commonest adjectives used for stouts : roast ( 67 % ) liquorice ( 27 % ) bitter ( 27 % ) dry ( 27 % ) fruity ( 20 % ) smoked ( 20 % ) .
I ’m not certain how meaningful this is – it suggests that porters ( in the UK at least ) have a tendency to fall on the fruity - chocolate - sweet side , stouts on the liquorice - bitter - dry side , but the differences are not that marked .
A survey that chose a different 30 porters and stouts might easily have different results , and there are certainly stouts that are fruity , porters that are dry .
I suspect that when a brewer brews something today he or she calls “ stout ” this is simply meant to mean that it will be a dark beer , while if it is named “ porter ” , the beer is very probably meant to be making a nod at an idea of authenticity , a suggestion that it is true to an earlier model .
However , since anyone looking for an earlier model of porter has a choice of at least six or seven different versions ( roughly 1720s , 1740s , 1780s , 1820s , 1880s , 1910s and 1930s , I would suggest , with each era of porter being significantly different from its predecessor in one or more of ingredients , method of manufacture , flavour and strength ) , “ authentic ” is meaningless without being specific about which period you ’re trying to be authentic to , and it certainly does n’t tell you what sort of drink you ’re going to get .
Historically , from the 1720s to the early 20th century “ stout ” ( or to be more accurate , brown stout – it is possible to find references to “ pale stout ” right up to the early 1840s ) was just another name for strong porter .
There are plenty of references from the early 19th century showing that , for both brewers and drinkers , “ strong porter ” and “ stout ” were interchangeable terms : one of my favourites comes from a court case reported in The Times in July 1803 , which revolves around the marvellously named crime of “ sucking the monkey ” .
An attorney called Johnson was suing a carrier called Ottadfield ( sic ) for the price of a 36 - gallon cask “ of porter , of superior quality , called Brown Stout ” , which he had bought as a present for his mother and had paid to have delivered to her in Barnsley by wagon .
The cask arrived safely but on the way north “ an accident happened to it , which now and then took place , namely the sucking the monkey . ”
Someone had inserted a straw or tube into the cask through a hole bored into it with a gimlet and sucked out all the rich and doubtless deliciously alcoholic contents .
All that arrived in Barnsley was what The Times called the “ caput mortuum ” , the empty cask .
The beer was described in court as “ remarkably fine old porter and very strong ” and “ excellent brown stout ” .
Johnson was awarded £ 5 2s 2d damages for the loss of the porter and the cost of the cask , the carriage and the booking .
Three decades later , in 1831 , “ stout ” still mean “ top quality porter ” : when the partners at Truman ’s brewery in Brick Lane , on the eastern edge of London , one of the three or four biggest porter brewers in Britain ( and thus the world ) renewed their lease on the premises for 61 years at £ 1,500 per annum and four kilderkins of “ the Best Beer or Porter called Stout ” .
As Ron Pattinson has pointed out , notably here , early 19th century brown stouts very often had identical recipes to the same brewer ’s porter , differing only in the amount of wort drawn off a given quantity of malt : less water was used for mashing stouts , so that they would be stronger .
Ron has also put together a survey of stout and porter gravities showing that in the 19th century the average beer described as porter had a gravity of a little less than 1058 , while stouts were on average about 1078 .
In the second half of the 19th century , recipes for stout and porter start to diverge : I ’m indebted once again to “ Statto ” Pattinson for the figures : as his tables here and here show , as the strength of the black beer grew , generally speaking London brewers in the later 19th century dropped the proportion of black ( or roast ) malt and increased the proportion of brown malt , while final gravities in the stronger beers climbed .
If I ’m interpreting this correctly , the stronger stouts would thus have tended to be less roasty and rather sweeter than the porters – particularly if they were sold “ mild ” , that is , unaged .
My suspicion is that this was the start of a long move towards English brewers producing sweeter stouts , which was definitely in progress by the 1880s , and which culminated in the arrival of “ milk ” stout , containing some unfermentable lactose sugars , in the 1900s .
In 1883 the Brewer ’s Journal made several references to sweet - tasting stouts brewed with a considerable quantity of non-malt saccharine .
“ one - fifth or even larger proportions of Egyptian sugar …
This stout … tastes extremely sweet . ”
The move to sweet stouts , the Journal said , was “ rendered necessary , perhaps , by a desire for rapid turn - over and a changeable public taste . ”
These sweet stouts had to be sold quickly , however , or secondary fermentation would destroy their sweetness ,
The arrival of milk stout around 1908 , which would stay sweet without any danger of further fermentation , probably hastened the end of production of the slightly older types of sweet stout .
made from 20 per cent and more sugar .
( Though as Ron P has shown [ thanks again , Big Man ] , sugar usage rose during the First World War . )
There is no evidence that I ’ve been able to find from the literature , however , of any major difference developing between the standard , drier porters and stouts , except that stouts continued to be stronger , Recipes were changing , though : the Journal wrote in February 1890 that brown malt was now
“ no longer used by the majority of brewers in the production of black beers to anything like the original extent … [ original , here , meaning 20 or 30 years earlier rather than the 1720s ] … the brown malt of the present day neither corresponds in physical appearance or value to the “ blown ” material that was manufactured with the greatest possible care fifteen or twenty years ago .
In fact crystal and candied forms of coloured malt have latterly been taking the place of the brown , while dextrinous forms of caramelized sugar are now frequently used … ”
By now porter was losing ground to mild as Britain ’s ( though not Ireland ’s ) favourite drink , a process hastened by the tax rises and restrictions of the First World War .
After the war the strength of stout had dropped to the same level as pre-war porter , around 1055 OG , while porter was down to 1038 or so .
As porter sales declined even more , one publication , written in 1934 , could say ; “ Porter is a variety of stout ” , and similarly TEB Clarke ’s book What ’s Yours in 1938 called porter “ a lowly brand of draught stout ” .
In the public ’s eye , the roles had been turned upside down , and stout was now the generic , porter merely a sub - type .
Soon after , British brewers stopped brewing porter , so that Maurice Gorham in 1949 called it “ obsolete … though its name survives on the beer pulls of some unmodernised houses .
It was originally to stout as X is to XX [ that is , as ordinary mild was to best mild ] ”
There we are , then – a chase down the centuries , during which we ’ve been unable to find any real difference between porter and stout except that stout was originally stronger , something which , as was demonstrated way up there at the top of this post , is now no longer true .
Hope that answers your question , Google queryist …

You ’ve read a bunch of different productivity posts , blogs , books , and magazine articles — admit it — and yet it ’s always so complicated .
You just want to accomplish great things , without all the fuss .
And while there are many great systems out there — GTD , Zen To Done , The Power of Less , and more — it always takes a lot of work .
You want to focus on the doing , not the upkeep of your productivity system .
Look no more .
This is all you need to know about productivity , all you need to know about getting amazing things done , doing important work … in three simple steps .
I guarantee you — if you follow these three steps , you ’ll be productive , and you ’ll accomplish great things .
1. Find Something Amazing to work on .
Seriously — amazing .
Not just regular tasks , but something that you ’ll feel good about , that excites you , that will have a high impact on your job and goals and life , that will make a difference .
Do this at the beginning of each day , or even at the end of each day so that you do n’t have to think about it the next morning — you already know what you ’ll be working on .
If you do this , at the end of the day , you can even prepare all the materials and tools you ’ll need first thing in the morning , and clear your desk so you ’ll be ready to go .
Get excited about this work .
You ’re going to accomplish great things .
2 . Hole yourself up and just work on the Something Amazing .
This is the key .
Well , aside from the first step , because if you do n’t do the first step , this step is n’t going to work as well .
And also the third step ( below ) is incredibly important , more than you might think , so do n’t skip that one .
But aside from the first and third step , this is the most important step in the system .
Here ’s how it works : clear your schedule for a good chunk of time — maybe 30 minutes if that ’s all you can spare , an hour is better , and 2 - 3 hours or more are even better than that .
Schedule this chunk of time first thing in the morning , or at least early in the morning , if you can , so it does n’t get pushed back by other things during the day .
Then clear away ALL distractions : notifications for email , IM , Twitter , and anything else that might pop up or make a noise , your phones , all mobile devices any clutter in front of you ( just shove it in a drawer or put it on the floor to clear away later ) , and most importantly , The Internet .
Yes , turn off the Internet .
Well , not the whole Internet , as other people might be using it , but just your connection to it .
If possible , go somewhere where there are no distractions and no Internet connection .
Tell everyone you work with that you will be incommunicado for an hour or three working on an important project .
If you can , make this a regular thing on your schedule — 2 - 3 hours in the morning every day , when people know you ca n’t be disturbed .
Once you ’ve holed yourself up , do n’t work on anything except the Something Amazing .
Seriously .
Resist any urges to switch tasks or check on something or get up and talk to someone .
Those urges will come up , trust me .
It ’s like an addiction — you just have to get through them .
Steel yourself , and just sit there breathing deeply ( with your head between your legs , if that helps ) until the urge passes .
Then get back to work on the Something Amazing .
Focus on that one thing until you ’re done .
Really , just the one thing .
3 . Take a nap .
Or reward yourself some other way — take a break and walk outside , or play WoW , or check the email you ’ve been itching to check , or read through your brilliant Twitter messages , or go for a run ( not everyone ’s idea of a reward , perhaps , but I love it ) .
And celebrate your accomplishment !
You ’ve gotten something amazing done .
Now repeat Steps 1 - 3 until your workday is over .
But … what about all the other tasks and things I need to do ?
How do I track them and get them done ?
First , those less important tasks will get done , but the world probably wo n’t end if you put them off for a few hours or even a day or two .
Unless you happen to be Mr. Obama , and one of those “ less important ” tasks is something like “ Solve crisis with nuclear weapon malfunction ” , in which case do n’t you think you should have put that task at the top of your list , Mr. President ?
For the rest of us , the world will go on without every single task getting done .
Second , keep a running list of every task you think of .
When you ’re done doing your Something Amazing , take a look at the list and see what really needs to be done .
Maybe it ’s another Something Amazing , maybe it ’s just a routine task that needs to get done .
Maybe it ’s a bunch of smaller tasks that you can get done all at once before moving on to the next Something Amazing .
Also look through the list and cross off things that do n’t really need to get done — usually things you ’ve been procrastinating on for awhile .
This system is n’t as comprehensive as other , more complicated , productivity systems , I ’ll grant you .
But it ’s simple , and it works .
Try it today , and let me know if it does n’t make a difference .

SAN FRANCISCO  Aiming to outdo Amazon.com and recapture the crown for the most digital titles in an e-book library , Sony is announcing Thursday a deal with Google to make a half million copyright - free books available for its Reader device , a rival to the Amazon Kindle .
Since 2004 , Google has scanned about seven million books from major university and research library collections .
For now , however , Google can make full digital copies available only of books whose copyrights have expired .
The books available to Reader owners were written before 1923 and include classics like “ A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur ’s Court , ” by Mark Twain , and “ The Awakening , ” by Kate Chopin , as well as harder - to - find titles like “ The Letters of Jane Austen . ”

“ We have focused our efforts on offering an open platform and making it easy to find as much content as possible , and our partnership with Google is another step in that direction , ” said Steve Haber , president of the digital reading business division of Sony Electronics .
“ We would love to continue working with Google to see how we can get more content for Reader owners . ”
VATICAN CITY -- A 9 - year - old Brazilian girl and the doctors who performed the girl 's abortion needed the Catholic Church 's care and concern , not its condemnation , said a leading Vatican official .
Archbishop Rino Fisichella , president of the Pontifical Academy for Life , criticized what he called a " hasty " public declaration of the excommunication of the girl 's mother and the doctors who aborted the girl 's twins .
The girl " in the first place should have been defended , hugged and held tenderly to help her feel that we were all on her side " he wrote in the Vatican newspaper , L'Osservatore Romano , March 15 .
" Before thinking about excommunication , it was necessary and urgent to protect her innocent life and bring her back to a level of humanity of which we men of the church should be expert witnesses and teachers , " he said .
" Unfortunately , this is not what happened and it has impacted the credibility of our teaching , which appears in the eyes of many as insensitive , incomprehensible and devoid of mercy , " he said .
Doctors at a hospital in Recife , Brazil , performed an abortion March 4 on the girl , who weighed a little more than 66 pounds and reportedly had been raped repeatedly by her stepfather from the time she was 6 years old .
Abortion in Brazil is illegal except in cases of rape or if the mother 's life is in danger .
After the abortion , Archbishop Jose Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife said it was " a crime in the eyes of the church " and that human laws can never override the laws of God .
He told a Brazilian newspaper that , while it was true the child ran health risks if she continued the pregnancy , " the end does not justify the means .
The good aim of saving her life cannot justify the killing of two other lives . "
The Vatican 's prefect of the Congregation for Bishops , Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re , said excommunication against those responsible for the abortion was legitimate .
In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Stampa March 7 , the cardinal underlined that according to canon law anyone who procures an abortion incurs automatic excommunication , meaning there is no need for an official decree from church authorities .
However , canon law indicates several conditions -- for example , not yet having turned 17 years old -- that would render an individual exempt from the penalty of excommunication .
The church officials ' statements puzzled Brazilian Catholics and were criticized in the media .
Many priests were called upon by their parishioners to explain the church 's position .
Nongovernmental organizations criticized the fact that the stepfather would not be excommunicated .

Fisichella criticized the way Archbishop Sobrinho handled the situation .
" Only because the archbishop of Olinda and Recife hastily declared the excommunication of the doctors " did this story of despicable , yet all too common , violence against girls and women make newspaper headlines , he said .
Fisichella said that because of the Brazilian girl 's young age and her " precarious state of health her life was in serious danger " by continuing the pregnancy .
" How should one act in these cases ? " he asked , underlining that the girl 's case represented an " arduous decision for doctors and moral law itself . "
Doctors deserve respect for the difficult decisions they must often grapple with , he said , adding that no one nonchalantly makes life - and - death decisions and to even suggest it " is unjust and offensive . "
He said the Catholic principle that upholds the sanctity of life is unshakeable and " abortion has always been condemned by moral law as an intrinsically evil act . "
However , because excommunication is incurred automatically at the moment a direct abortion is carried out , " there was no need to declare with such urgency and publicity a fact that occurred automatically , " he said .
Fisichella said the church can still be firm with its moral principles and at the same time reach out and show mercy toward others .
He told the young girl in his written article : " We are on your side .
We feel your suffering and we would like to do everything that would help you restore the dignity that you have been deprived of and the love that you will still need .
" There are others who deserve excommunication and our forgiveness , not those who have allowed you to live and who will help you regain hope and trust despite the presence of evil and the wickedness of many people , " he said .
At a press conference at the Brazilian bishops ' conference headquarters in Brasilia March 12 , church officials seemed to backpedal on Archbishop Sobrinho 's comments .
Sobrinho " did not excommunicate anyone , " but simply cited the norms that exist in canon law , said Auxiliary Bishop Dimas Lara Barbosa of Rio de Janeiro , secretary - general of the Brazilian bishops ' conference .
Archbishop Geraldo Lyrio Rocha of Mariana , president of the bishops ' conference , said to reduce the issue to a simple question of excommunication was to push to the back burner the issue of violence against children , which needs to be discussed by the country .
This year the bishops ' annual Lenten fraternity campaign , " Fraternity and Public Security , " addresses domestic violence as a source of insecurity among Brazilian women and children .
At the press conference , Archbishop Rocha said : " Rape is such a repugnant act that the church does not need to call attention to it .
Abortion , however , is not seen as such by some , and that is the reason for excommunication : not only to punish but to show those who practiced the act the gravity of their deeds . "

Has Charlie Nesson been at the magic mushrooms again ?
The hippy head of the Berkman Center , the influential New Age techno - utopian think tank that 's attached to Harvard Law School , wants to enlist Radiohead in his fight against the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .
Nesson , a long - time opponent of creator 's digital rights , is contesting the statutory damages in infringement cases .
A Boston graduate student called Joel Tenenbaum was ordered to reach a settlement with the record companies after being sued for copyright infringement , having shared files using the Kazaa P2P network back in 2003 .
Nesson 's strategy in Sony BMG Music vs Tenenbaum is to put the music business on trial .
That 's fine - suing freetards is n't going to stop P2P file sharing and it is n't going to save the music business .
It only adds to the anoraks ' persecution complex .
Even the RIAA has now concluded it 's the wrong strategy .
But is Nesson the man to fight The Man ?
Nesson 's novel argument is that unlicensed P2P file sharing is " fair use " .
Even his Harvard students , who are doing the work for him , think that 's stretch .
And maybe he does n't want to win , just preen about in front of a camera .
He wants it televised , he Arse Technica , because :
" It 's like a reality show that we can all be participants in as we go along ...
It 's an incredibly powerful expansion of the idea of teaching . "
Even long - time RIAA opponents such as Ray Beckerman of the Recording Industry vs . The People have expressed their doubts about Nesson 's random and bizarre behaviour .
As the stoner ramblings on his blog suggest , Nesson 's all over the place : leaking private correspondence from colleagues , and insisting that unlicensed P2P is " fair use " .
( Beckerman is not pleased that Harvard waited five years to counter - attack the RIAA , and then only intervened in the case of one individual .
Sitting on a cash pile of $ 36.9 bn [* ] , Harvard is richer than the annual revenue of every record company in the world put together ) .
Paul Resnikoff at Digital Music
News describes how the case " ... has now slumped into a sewer of leaked correspondence , improper procedures , unprofessionalism , and several bouts of seeming insanity .
Nesson has been pushing to qualify P2P - based downloading ( and uploading ) as fair use , something most experts disagree with .
These experts , including Lawrence Lessig , privately expressed their disagreement with Nesson , only to have their correspondence spilled online - by Nesson himself . "
After Nesson was recently obliged to apologise to the Court , Beckerman concluded that the only value of the case is entertainment .
The bizarro assertions continue .
Nesson wants to depose Brian Message of ATC Management - one of Radiohead 's management companies - and chairman of the Music Managers Forum .
" He is leading a wonderful group of U.K. artists who are coming out in favor of the idea of non-commercial sharing among music fans . "
Are you sure , Charlie ?
Brian Message - who also manages Kate Nash - is behind the new ( FAC ) Featured Artists Coalition which opposes copyright term extension in Europe .
But claiming that Radiohead are file sharing freetards is a mistake .
The band looks after its finances professionally and cleverly used a publicity gimmick - preview the new album In Rainbows - to send the physical recording to the top of the charts .
The band asserted full rights over the master recording - which was issued by an indie label , XL Recordings .
Radiohead have never endorsed non-commercial sharing , although like many established , successful artists they can afford to turn a blind eye , if it gains them more fans .
The band described it as a " one - off response to a particular situation " and said it wo n't repeat the experiment .

It 's the bright , contrasting colors that attract my eyes to Jason Levesque 's illustrations .
Also known as the Stuntkid , Jason came up with his art name while working at a dot - com start - up in Williamsburg .
“ I would ride my skateboard down the stairs .
I was doing a lot of office stunts .
I thought maybe Stuntboy , but that name was already taken , so I went with Stuntkid . ”
Most of Levesque 's art starts with a photograph taken with his Nikon D50 camera .
“ When I shoot through the lens , I 'm imagining what I 'm looking at as an illustration .
Sometimes I have to ignore the background . ”
“ I do n't have a motive to my art work .
I think that kind of sets me apart from artists and puts me more in the world of illustration .
People paint with cause or try to bring about a world of change .
My art is really for the sake of aesthetic quality , ” he said .
“ As an illustrator , I come up with an idea and then the most effective way to get it done in the practical sense .
The entire time , I 'm focused on the end product and not the inspiration . ”

As the United States considers its own cap - and - trade system to reduce domestic emission levels , support is growing behind the idea of a " carbon tariff , " a tax on imports from countries which are not undertaking similar environmental measures .
Recently , Energy Secretary Steven Chu endorsed the idea of a carbon tariff as a means of defending the international competitiveness of American industries .
His concern is that other states will have an " unfair " trade advantage over the United States if we reduce greenhouse - gas emission and they do not .
What is not being debated is how much carbon other countries should be allowed to produce .
Environmental scientists maintain that the planet can only sustain a finite amount of carbon emissions , but scientists do not tell us how to divide these emissions between nations .
Yet this is the key issue in establishing what is fair in international trade as well as addressing climate - change issues globally .
Without such a conversation on the distribution of global carbon emissions , carbon tariffs will not be effective .
For instance , if the United States decides to apply a carbon tariff , then it must decide how much carbon it gets to produce compared with other countries .
The Boxer - Lieberman - Warner bill , for example , determines whether another country 's environmental regulation is comparable to the US ( and thus exempt from a carbon tariff ) .
The bill establishes a dividing principle that freezes everyone at their current share of greenhouse - gas emissions and requires that countries reduce emissions from these levels .
Under this standard , the US , which represents less than 5 percent of the world 's population , is allocated over 18 percent of the world 's greenhouse - gas production .
The problem for the planet 's atmosphere is that other countries can do the same thing but based on different dividing principles .
China could apply carbon tariffs to any country that has a higher per capita level of greenhouse - gas emissions than it does .
( This would include the US , Canada , and the European Union . )
India could adopt a formula that gives nations that have already contributed significantly to the current stock of greenhouse gases fewer emissions rights in the future .
This series of conflicting national level environmental measures is bad for the environment and bad for the global economy .
First , it does not solve the global climate - change problem .
If each state is able to choose its own level of greenhouse gases it should be permitted to emit , then countries will select standards that benefit themselves and the planet will still have an unsustainable level of greenhouse - gas production .
Second , a carbon tariff is detrimental to the global economy because it leads to increased barriers to trade based on different conceptions of how much carbon countries should be allowed to produce .
At a time of economic crisis , a carbon tariff provides the means for government officials to be protectionist when the global system needs to maintain a commitment to open trading .
We should not rely on the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) rules to solve this problem .
The WTO ( already under attack as insensitive to environmental concerns ) will have little interest in arbitrating climate - change policies between nations .
In addition , a WTO legal challenge would take years to litigate .
By contrast , other states could adopt reciprocal legislation almost immediately .
The European Union has already considered imposing a carbon tariff on states that have not signed the Kyoto Protocol and could resurrect that proposal quickly .
China and India could do the same .
None of these tariffs would be beneficial for the global economy .
Perhaps only an economic and environmental crisis will finally get governments to accept an international climate - change agreement .
But the idea that we have to wait years ( if not decades ) to reach a political solution could be potentially catastrophic , particularly when interim environmental damage has serious consequences that cannot be reversed by a future international agreement .
Countries need to honestly and openly address the issue of what standards should determine how much pollution each state should be allowed to produce .
Adopting carbon tariffs on other states does not help us get there , and , at worst , could be an additional hurdle to reaching an international agreement .
We need multilateral negotiations on climate - change issues , not unilateral declarations ( backed by carbon tariffs ) of how the world 's carbon limits will be distributed .
We must keep our focus on the policy outcome that we want to achieve : an open international trading system and an effective international climate - change agreement .
The danger of carbon tariffs is that we may end up in a world that has regressed on trade relations and not adopted an adequate response to global warming .
Rachel Brewster is an assistant professor at the Harvard Law School .
The Likudniks , here and abroad , are running scared .
Why ?
Well , it may turn out that President Obama genuinely intends to solve Middle East conflicts peacefully , diplomatically .
For example , Obama just had Secretary of State Clinton send , Jeffrey Feltman , her Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs , in company with Dan Shapiro , head of the Middle East Division of the National Security Council Staff , to meet last week with Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al - Muallim and presidential advisor Bothainia Shaaban in Damascus .
According to Feltman , the talks covered " Lebanon , Israel , Iran , Hamas , Iraq " and " Syria ’s attempts to develop a nuclear program . "
Feltman was the Bush - Cheney Ambassador to Israel in 2006 during the Israel - Hezbollah - Hamas war and the associated Israeli unrestricted bombing of Lebanon .
Shapiro was Obama ’s " emissary " to " Jewish groups " during the presidential campaign and reportedly drafted the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 [ . pdf ] , which contained , among many onerous findings and determinations , the following ;
" [ T ]he United States will not provide any assistance to Syria and will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria ends all support for terrorism , withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon , and halts the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and medium - and long - range surface - to - surface ballistic missiles . "
According to Shapiro ’s Act , if Obama now wishes to normalize relations with Syria , he will have to certify to Congress that
" [ T ]he Government of Syria has ceased the development and deployment of medium - and long - range surface - to - surface ballistic missiles , is not pursuing or engaged in the research , development , acquisition , production , transfer , or deployment of biological , chemical , or nuclear weapons , has provided credible assurances that such behavior will not be undertaken in the future , and has agreed to allow United Nations and other international observers to verify such actions and assurances . "
Which brings us to the otherwise inexplicable publication this week of a seemingly authoritative " report " by Hans Ruhle in the Swiss daily , Neue Zuercher Zeitung .
Ruhle alleges  in the course of " revealing " what retired Iranian general Ali Reza Asghari allegedly told the CIA when he defected back in February , 2007  that the immediate imperative for the Israeli aerial attack on a site near Al Kabir on September 6 , 2007 was that a " North Korean " ship had been " checked " and determined to be carrying " nuclear fuel " to Syria .
Checked ?
By whom ?
Determined ?
By whom ?
Ruhle does n’t say .
But surely , not by the United States or any " concerned state " associated with the Proliferation Security Initiative of Bonkers Bolton , established by President Bush the Younger back in 2003 .
According to Bolton ;
" Our [ PSI ] goal is to work with other concerned states to develop new means to disrupt the proliferation trade at sea , in the air , and on land .
The initiative reflects the need for a more dynamic , proactive approach to the global proliferation problem .
It [ PSI ] envisions partnerships of states working in concert , employing their national capabilities to develop a broad range of legal , diplomatic , economic , military and other tools to interdict threatening shipments of WMD - and missile - related equipment and technologies .
To jumpstart this initiative , we have begun working with several close friends and allies to expand our ability to stop and seize suspected WMD transfers . "
Surely , therefore , if any of our PSI " partners " had " checked " this ship and " determined " that it was carrying North Korean " nuclear fuel , " bound for Syria , along the " axis of evil , " it would have seized this shipment .
What then ?
Well , at a minimum Bush - Cheney would have informed the International Atomic Energy that their suspicions about North Korea ’s and Syria ’s nuclear programs had been vindicated .
More likely , with a nuclear " smoking gun " implicating both North Korea and Syria in their possession , Bush - Cheney would have launched wars against both .
But , reportedly , Bush - Cheney refused to even participate in the Israeli raid on the Al Kabir site .
A raid for which the Israelis reportedly insisted there could be no delay .
Yet , in April , 2008 , the CIA released a detailed computer - simulation based video depicting what they were " convinced " the Syrians  assisted by the North Koreans  had been doing at the Al Kabir site since 2001 .
To wit :
" Syria was building a gas - cooled graphite - moderated reactor that was nearing operational capability in August 2007 .
The reactor would have been capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons , was not configured to produce electricity and was ill - suited for research . "
Now , while the CIA claimed that the alleged reactor was " nearing operational capability " at the time of the Israeli raid , it is important to note that there was no mention whatsoever in their report of the " smoking gun " just now " reported " in the Neue Zuercher Zeitung  the shipment of what was " checked " and " determined " to be North Korean startup " nuclear fuel " for a clone of the North Korean weapons - grade plutonium - producing reactor at Yongbyon .
The most likely explanation is that neither the CIA  nor any of our PSI partners  had any reason to believe that such a shipment had taken place .
So , why the seemingly inexplicable publication this week of what now seems anything but an authoritative report on nuke weapon collaboration between North Korea and Syria ( and funded by Iran ) ?
Perhaps to make it virtually impossible for President Obama to ever certify to Congress that the Government of Syria " is not pursuing or engaged in the research , development , acquisition , production , transfer , or deployment of biological , chemical , or nuclear weapons " and " has agreed to allow United Nations and other international observers to verify " that they are not ?
Perhaps , but maybe Hans Ruhle , allegedly a former Chief of the Planning Staff in the German Ministry of Defense , is also an alarmed Likudnik .

Toshiba announced two new notebooks with the Sun OpenSolaris platform pre-installed , the 12 " Portégé R600 and the 14 " Tecra M10 .
The models are the result of a strategic partnership between Toshiba and Sun Microsystems that began in December 2008 .
Next to OpenSolaris 2008.11 , applications on the notebooks include Sun 's own VirtualBox , OpenOffice 3.0 , a web stack including MySQL and the Apache Web Server , and Adobe Flash Player .
Sun 's developer tools are also included : Glassfish V2 , Java SE Development Kit , NetBeans and Studio Express .
Both notebooks come with Intel Core2 Duo processors , with speeds ranging from 1.4 to 2.53 Gigahertz .
The " ultraportable " Portégé R600 has a 160 - GByte hard drive , while the Tecra M10 can be configured with up to 320 GBytes .
The ultra-mobile 12 " notebook from Toshiba is available now in the U.S. pre-installed with OpenSolaris .
The notebooks are currently available in the U.S. at the OpenSolaris website .
Prices for the 14 " model begin at $ 1,099 .
The site also includes an installation and pre-installed recovery guide .
The price includes one full year of support from Sun and a three - year warranty .
May should bring availability in Britain and other countries should follow .
The current ToshibaDirect price listings are for Windows , although the OpenSolaris version prices should be identical .
" The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/ 4 percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period .
To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets , the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $ 750 billion of agency mortgage - backed securities , bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $ 1.25 trillion this year , and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by up to $ 100 billion to a total of up to $ 200 billion .
Moreover , to help improve conditions in private credit markets , the Committee decided to purchase up to $ 300 billion of longer - term Treasury securities over the next six months . "
$ 1.75 trillion
Even as the consumer price index increased for a second month in a row ( for a total of 0.7 % , or 4.2 % at an annual rate ) , the Fed now says it will accelerate inflation .
The FOMC Statement specifically pledges to $ 1.25 trillion + $ 200 billion + $ 300 billion .
That adds up toin Fed asset purchases .
Financial markets reacted immediately , with stocks , Treasuries , foreign currencies , gold and commodities in general all soaring in value .
$ 300 billion of purchases wo n't really make that much difference considering that the deficit this year will be well over $ 1.5 trillion .
However , combined with the massive purchases of mortgage - backed securities and agency debt , and the possibility that they might later decide to purchase even more , the massive increase in liquidity will certainly result in Treasury yields dropping significantly , which is what we saw today .
However , considering the inflation that this will unleash , Treasuries are not the place to be right now .
The only safe place is in real assets , such as gold .

What commenters do n’t do is provide a sustained or inventive analysis of Applebaum ’s work .
In fact , critics hardly seem to connect one column to the next .
In spite of Applebaum ’s hard - to - miss hints that she celebrates Christian holidays ( “ On Christmas morning , my husband found a CD of ‘ The Greatest Speeches of All Time ’ in his stocking ” ) , conspiracy - minded commenters insist that she ’s Jewish and that her Jewishness determines her politics .
And even though she makes it plain that her worldview coalesced when she was reporting on Eastern Europe in the ’80s and ’90s , commenters almost never address the intellectual consequences of her analogies between the cold war and the war on terror .
Someone should be paying more attention , especially since online newspaper commenters as a whole seem to have ( at least ) the stamina , drive and spare time to become a cogent part of online journalism .
But as it is , online commentary is a bête noire for journalists and readers alike .
Most journalists hate to read it , because it ’s stinging and distracting , and readers rarely plow through long comments sections unless they intend to post something themselves .
But perhaps the comments have become so reader - unfriendly , in part , because of the conventions of the Web - comment form .
Online commentary , for one thing , is a circadian art , one in which style and tone seem largely determined by the time of day a comment is posted .
At washingtonpost.com , Applebaum ’s columns typically receive around 100 or 200 responses before the site closes off the commenting option .
( At Slate , which is online - only , registered commenters weigh in on the same column , but in a more formal way . )
Immediately after the column appears online — often late at night — come early amens .
Then dissent sets in , and a scolding tone emerges ( “ You should know better ” ; “ Surely you jest ” ) .
In the later hours , things get more plaintive and surreal , as lonelier , insomniac imagery takes over and commenters begin to turn on one another .
( Around 2 a.m. : “ What has happened to the soul of The Washington Post ? ” and “ The blood is on your hands .
I ’ll help you look for a rag , but do n’t wipe it on my pants . ” )
By the time the East Coast workday starts , responders seem showered , caffeinated and ready for battle .
Comments of 250 words or more show up , and sometimes they ’re itemized .
These itemized entries borrow their structure from the blogosphere ’s signature “ fact - check , ” a form in which a skeptic affects exhausted patience as he paces through a published argument point by point to show how perniciously or laughably wrong it is .
These fact - checks are rarely potent enough to compel corrections by The Post , and Applebaum never replies to them .
Commenters , in short , rarely really sock it to a columnist .
They also too often go automatic , churning out 100 - word synopses of one stock ideological position after another .
But most disappointing of all , for readers , is that commenters do n’t , as literary critics say , read an article against itself to show how , for example , an argument framed as incendiary is in fact banal , or one that ’s meant to be feminist is retrogressive , or one that touts its originality is a knockoff .
The low - down on Django - Techblog
I figured I would write - up some of the features of Django Techblog , the blogging application I wrote to power this site .
It does most of what you would expect from a blogging app , but there are a few features that it does differently .
The main difference is extended markup , but there are a couple of other features that worthy of note :
Multi -blog capable .
I want to blog on a variety of subjects , but because some of the things I post about ( namely the geeky stuff ) are only of interest to a select few , I risk turning away visitors who are n't interested in those techy posts .
Categories and tags are one solution to this , but I prefer to have a number of blogs under an umbrella blog , each with its own posts , templates and tags .
In Techblog , there is also a concept of a channel which appears exactly like a blog from the front - end , but aggregates posts & tags from one or more blogs .
In this site , the home - page at / is actually a channel consisting of / blog / tech / and / blog / personal .

Microblogging .
Techblog has support for Twitter and potentially other microblogging services could be added .
You add your twitter account details , which Techblog uses to poll your tweets and automatically post them to a specified blog .
It filters out replies because they are rarely of interest to anyone other than who the reply is intended for , and also parses hashtags to create equivalent tags in the blog system .
A microblog post can have a unique template ( just a Django template ) so they can have a different look and feel to regular posts .
You can check my tweets in / blog / microblog / .
Getting the Code
The code for Django - techblog is licensed under my politeware license , which means you can use it for any purpose you see fit , but I would appreciate a thank you !
It should n't be too difficult to set - up if you have worked with Django , but I 'd be happy to help if you experience any problems with it .

— Energize Your Body Naturally !
The store shelves are lined with supplements that claim to increase energy levels , and for the most part they do work in the short term .
The main ingredient in most of them is caffeine , which is actually not too bad for your system when limited to a cup or two a day .
The problem with the supplements is that they combine a bunch of other chemicals along with the caffeine , and those chemicals are not so good for your body .
You are better off looking for natural alternatives or just having a cup of coffee without the extra ingredients .
Some supplements use natural components that are already in your body , such as amino acids and B vitamins .
While these also may work for you , they come with a lot of other stuff mixed in , including artificial colors and sweeteners .
If you focus on a few of the all natural energy secrets discussed below , you can achieve the same energy response from your body without pills or shakes .
Actually , if done on a regular basis you will likely become even more energetic .
Before you spend your hard earned money on expensive supplements , consider five of the best secrets to energize your body naturally .
1. Adequate Sleeping Patterns
If you think you can limit your body to a few hours of sleep a night and “ catch up ” later , it ’s time to rethink your sleeping patterns .
One of the most common causes of fatigue is a lack of sleep , but it also happens to be the easiest problem to fix for most people .
Your body needs at least seven hours of sleep every night in order to function properly , and constant deprivation can lead to a chronic lack of energy .
Even if you are in your bed seven or more hours a night , consider how restful your sleep is .
The environment in your bedroom has a lot to do with how soundly you sleep , so set yourself up for success by making it as dark , quiet , warm , and cozy as possible .
If you are sleeping with a television on or have other distractions going on around you , then you are likely not getting as much sleep as you may think .
Short snoozes during the day can also give a jolt of energy .
Even 15 minutes just to put your feet up and close your eyes can help .
2. Dehydration
This is another common issue that leads to feeling tired and worn out .
In fact , when your body runs low on water it can even lead to sensations very similar to hunger , which often causes excessive eating .
Avoid the problem from the get - go and load up on as much fluid as possible .
Just stay away from sugary and carbonated drinks because they will only make you feel even thirstier .
3. Activity Level
How much do you move around during the day ?
We are not talking about deliberate exercise here , but the amount of your day that is spent doing some kind of normal , every day physical activity on your feet .
There has been a link between physical movement and energy levels , so just getting up and making yourself move around a little can increase your energy level .
If you spend much of your day sitting , then try to get up every hour or so to walk around a bit , even if it is only for a few minutes .
The more you move your body the more energetic you are likely to start feeling .
4. Exercise
Since movement creates energy , one of the absolute best ways to feel energetic all day long is to exercise on a regular basis .
Now we are talking about deliberate exercise that boosts your metabolism and your heart rate .
Yet , there is a difference between exercising to lose weight and doing it for energy .
While high intensity exercise and really long sessions in the gym will produce more energy , it will also use up most if not all of what is created .
You can actually come out of those sessions a little less energetic , though it is still wonderful for your body in other ways .
Studies have shown that lower intensity workouts and short bursts of activity throughout the day are more effective if an increase in energy is the goal .
Taking a 10 or 15 minute walk around the block a couple of times a day or doing some yoga exercises or Pilates will go a long way to focusing your mind and bringing back the energy you now lack .
Of course , the best approach is to mix in lower and higher intensity workouts and keep with it over time .
Some studies are now showing that higher intensity workouts may in fact bring a surge of delayed energy after the muscles have recovered , so mixing harder and lighter workouts together on a regular basis will effectively keep you more energetic on a daily basis .
Try eating fruit right before you workout [ Eating before exercise ] , as it is quickly absorbed into the blood stream as an energy source and will give you a burst of energy to get through the workout .
5. Nature ’s # 1 Source of Energy
If you have noticed that the recommendations for gaining energy naturally sounds quite like the “ healthy ” living plan that a doctor might give you for losing weight or controlling diabetes or heart disease , you are onto something .
If you think for a moment about what energy actually is , you will see that how we treat our bodies and what we put into it greatly determines what we get back out of it .
It ’s like your car : you have to put the right type of fuel into the tank if you want optimal performance .
Energy is created naturally when you put food into your system .
Your body then has to break down the food you gave it , and either use it for bodily functions , store it as fat , or process it out as waste .
All of this activity is what gives you the energy to carry on with your day or push through that kickboxing class at the Y .
Therefore , the food that you put into your system is the best determinant of how much energy you will have at any given time .
So , how do you feed your body so that it stays energetic without those frequent lethargic crashes ?
It all comes down to what you eat and how often you eat .
Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for your body , but they are not all created equal .
Processed , refined , sugary carbs like candy bars and ice cream are processed through your body really quick .
They are broken down and hit your blood stream extremely fast , but since they actually offer little to none of the vitamins and nutrients your body actually needs for bodily functioning , it is also processed and pushed out of your blood quickly .
That means you will get an energy spike but within an hour you will feel even more fatigued than ever .
Eating for energy means eating foods that your body will spend more time breaking down and using .
This means carbs that are still chock full of nutrients , such as whole grain breads , pasta , and rice .
Fresh vegetables and fruits are also great sources of energy , and fruit actually hits the blood stream quickly just like sugar , making it a great alternative to high calorie sugar - coated sweets .
For the most powerful punch of energy , go for a combination of wholesome carbohydrate with a protein source .
For example , wheat crackers with cheese , apples dipped in peanut butter , or a cheese sandwich on whole wheat bread .
Quick Mentions
You may want to check on a few smaller lifestyle issues to see if they are contributing to your fatigue .
If you are taking medications , check if fatigue is a side effect .
If so , ask your doctor if there is an alternative medication or an herb that would be just as helpful .
Also consider the amount of time you are taking for yourself each day .
A life of serving and worrying over others without caring for your own needs is extremely draining .
Constant stress can also wear you down .
This is a common problem for women who feel overwhelmed caring for their family , work , friends , and all their other responsibilities .
Take a little “ me time ” and see if you do n’t find yourself revived at least a little .
Finally , consider carefully the people you surround yourself with on a daily basis .
Is someone dragging you down ?
Is there a stressful relationship that zaps your energy more than it restores it ?
Ultimately , the secret to gaining more energy naturally is to consider every aspect of your current lifestyle and change whatever is necessary to bring a more peaceful , balanced sense to your daily existence .
Think of food as energy , not pleasure .
Think of exercise as revitalizing power , instead of a chore .
Do n’t try to tackle it all at once .
Start with small walks and more whole grains and add to it with time .
An energetic life awaits you in the future .
Just take baby steps until you get there .
Twitter Gem Reborn with Fewer Features and 100 % More OAuth
The Twitter gem is kind of my baby .
It was pretty much the first gem I created and as such I care for it a little more .
When I originally created it , I knew nothing .
I sucked .
Now over time , I suck less and Twitter ’s addition of OAuth seemed like the perfect time to completely rewrite it .
Yay for rewrites !
The gem is now leaner , meaner and works swell with OAuth .
I would imagine as I use OAuth a bit more , I ’ll figure out some ways to make it even easier in the twitter gem but it works for now .
The Cuts
One of the biggest headaches and coolest things about the Twitter gem was the command line interface .
It allowed for multiple accounts and was SQLite database backed .
That was cool and all but it is ridiculous to have main and active record as dependencies for someone who just wanted the API wrapping aspects of the gem .
Knowing this , I have finally killed the CLI .
Fear not , CLI fans , it will make a triumphant return , but that return will be in a separate gem that merely relies on the Twitter gem .
The Twitter gem itself will be only a wrapper for the REST and Search APIs that Twitter provides .
No more extra cruft .
OAuth
As I said , the main reason for the rewrite was that Twitter now supports OAuth .
I thought about it long and hard and decided to not continue support for HTTP Authentication .
Twitter has not discontinued support for HTTP Authentication , but they will in the future and I did n’t want to add a bunch of hours to releasing the updated gem simply to support something that is going to be deprecated .
So how does one use the OAuth stuff in the Twitter gem ?
First off , familiarize yourself with OAuth .
Then , you can check out the example below pulled straight from the examples directory included in the gem ( or over here on github ) .
require File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , '..' , ' lib ' , ' twitter ' ) require File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__ ) , ' helpers ' , ' config_store ' ) require ' pp ' config = ConfigStore.new ( " #{ENV [ ' HOME ']}/.twitter " ) oauth = Twitter :: OAuth.new ( config [ ' token ' ] , config [ ' secret ' ] ) if config [ ' atoken ' ] && config [ ' asecret ' ] oauth.authorize_from_access( config [ ' atoken ' ] , config [ ' asecret ' ] ) twitter = Twitter ::Base.new ( oauth ) pp twitter.friends_timeline elsif config [ ' rtoken ' ] && config [ ' rsecret ' ] oauth.authorize_from_request( config [ ' rtoken ' ] , config [ ' rsecret ' ] ) twitter = Twitter ::Base.new ( oauth ) pp twitter.friends_timeline config.update ( { ' atoken ' => oauth.access_token.token , ' asecret ' => oauth.access_token.secret , }).delete ( ' rtoken ' , ' rsecret ' ) else config.update ( { ' rtoken ' => oauth.request_token.token , 'rsecret ' => oauth.request_token.secret , } ) # authorize in browser % x ( open #{oauth.request_token.authorize_url} ) end
The ConfigStore is a simple class that allows me to save the request and access token and secrets as I ’m completing the handshakes between the script and Twitter .
As you can see , it is pretty simple .
Get a request token , then use that to create an access token .
From there , you can reuse the access token to authorize future requests .
An Example App
Now one might think , based on that previous example , “ Thanks so much John !
I really appreciate you getting the ball rolling for me with a simple example . ”
Friends do I have news for you .
I did n’t stop there .
I whipped together a little sample app , that I have been using for a few days now .
Eventually , it will become a full Twitter client , but for now it is pretty basic and dirty .
It uses Clearance for authentication for authentication and automatically sends you to Twitter to authorize after firing it up ( if you have n’t previously ) .
I used Rails rescue_from to automatically send you to Twitter if any of the authorization stuff gets messed up at a later point to .
rescue_from Twitter :: Unauthorized , : with => : twitter_unauthorized private def twitter_unauthorized ( exception ) redirect_to new_authorization_url end
Anytime the Twitter gem throws the Twitter : : Unauthorized exception , you are redirected to new_authorization_url , which is powered by the AuthorizationsController , which looks like this .
class AuthorizationsController < ApplicationController def new oauth = current_user.oauth session [ ' rtoken ' ] = oauth.request_token.token session [ 'rsecret ' ]
= oauth.request_token.secret redirect_to oauth.request_token.authorize_url end def show oauth = current_user.oauth oauth.authorize_from_request(session [ ' rtoken ' ] , session [ ' rsecret ' ] ) session [ ' rtoken ' ] = nil session [ ' rsecret ' ] = nil current_user.update_attributes ( { :atoken => oauth.access_token.token , :asecret => oauth.access_token.secret , } ) redirect_to root_path end end
The new action stores the request token and secret and then redirects you to Twitter to authorize the app .
Over at Twitter , I have registered an application and set the redirect url to go to / authorization in the app , which as you can see above , obtains the access token and secret and stores them with the current user .
You ’ll probably notice that I am calling current_user. oauth and current_user .
client throughout the app .
These are helper methods I added to the user model to shorten up what was happening in the controller .
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base include Clearance :: App:: Models :: User attr_accessible : atoken , : asecret def authorized ?
!atoken.blank ? && !asecret.blank ?
end def oauth @oauth ||= Twitter : : OAuth.new ( ConsumerConfig [ ' token ' ] , ConsumerConfig [ ' secret ' ] ) end def client @client ||= begin oauth.authorize_from_access ( atoken , asecret ) Twitter ::Base.new ( oauth ) end end end
I could shorten up the controllers even more ( and will at some point ) by delegating several methods on user to user.client .
I ’ll post more on that later when I get around to it .
Also , at some point , I ’m going to remove the atoken and asecret from the user and allow support for multiple Twitter accounts for one user in the app .
This should be pretty easy , but I wanted to get something working first before I complicated things .
Conclusion
From a user standpoint , OAuth is really nice .
I love not having to put in my username and password .
From a developer standpoint , OAuth is also pretty nice .
Basically , you register your application with Twitter , provide the consumer token and key in a config file and this example app is ready to go .
As with any rewrite there are bound to be bugs .
I have fixed one already that someone caught .
If you catch any weird bugs using the rewritten Twitter gem , there is group and ticket information on the Twitter gem website .

Fannie , Freddie Quietly Lift Moratorium on Foreclosures
Created : April 02 , 2009 17:35 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
A ban on foreclosure sales and evictions from houses owned by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which began as a high - profile effort just before the holidays to keep people in their homes as the government tried to come up with homeowner rescue plans , is over .
Spokesmen for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac confirmed the ban ended March 31 , in a response to an inquiry from TWI .
The agencies made a major announcement in November to roll out the ban , garnering headlines and extensive news coverage .
Freddie Mac CEO
David Moffett issued a statement at the time , saying the ban “ provides a new measure of certainty ” to families facing foreclosures during the holidays .

But its expiration did n’t seem to merit the same level of fanfare , with some housing advocates caught by surprise , scrambling for information today and Wednesday on listservs and in phone calls .
Danilo Pelletiere , research director for the National Low Income Housing Coalition , said the ban ’s eventual expiration was n’t unexpected – but it also was n’t clear specifically when it was supposed to end .
Some housing attorneys and advocates were confused because they were in the middle of cases that would be affected by the expiration .
Fannie and Freddie have repeatedly extended the ban , which was originally expected to expire on Jan. 9 .
Fannie Mae said in a brief statement from spokesman Brian Faith that “ ‘s suspension of foreclosure - related evictions concludes as of March 31 , 2009 .
The company has in place special foreclosure sale requirements that take into account the Making Home Affordable program .
A foreclosure sale may not occur on any until the loan servicer verifies that the borrower is ineligible for a Home Affordable Modification and all other foreclosure prevention alternatives have been exhausted . ”
Since the ban started , both Fannie and Freddie have developed rental programs to keep tenants from being evicted from foreclosed properties owned by the two agencies .
In addition , the Obama administration in March unveiled its plan to help troubled borrowers either refinance their homes or modify their mortgages .
Housing advocates are n’t exactly cheering about the ban being lifted .
But they are hoping the new programs succeed , and plan to keep a close eye on their progress , Pelletiere said .
The lifting of the ban will be a testing ground for the administration ’s approach to foreclosures .
A bill to allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages has stalled in Congress .
Money from the Troubled Assets Relief Program has gone to banks and bailout efforts .
The ban , enacted as foreclosures soared and the holidays approached , was the government ’s first dramatic step to help homeowners .
The housing rescue plan was developed and announced only after the Treasury Department first unveiled its plan to buy toxic assets from banks .
“ A perpetual moratorium is not a solution to how we do foreclosures in the future , ” Pelletiere said .
“ It ’s a holding pattern .
We need to break that holding pattern to allow for something else positive to happen . ”
Brad German , a spokesman for Freddie Mac , said he was “ mystified ” as to how anyone could be surprised by the ban ’s expiration .
The idea behind it was to give the government time to create homeowner rescue plans , and that ’s been done , he said .
Neither agency also expects a flood of homeowners out on the street because the ban is being lifted , he added .
“ For all practical purposes , people will be in their homes for a while , ” despite the ban ’s expiration , German said .
Fannie and Freddie will need time to approach tenants and homeowners and figure out whether they are qualified for help , he said .
Separate programs launched recently by Fannie and Freddie to allow tenants to stay in Real Estate Owned ( REO ) foreclosed properties owned by the agencies and lease them on a month by month basis at market rents , until they can be sold again , are not affected by the ban ’s expiration , German said .
Those programs will continue , with no expiration date scheduled .
Fannie ’s program covers renters of foreclosed properties , while both former owners and renters can qualify for Freddie ’s program .
The REO rental programs aim to reach out to those no longer covered by the foreclosure ban and see if they can qualify , German said – which mitigates the effect of the ban being lifted .
For example , under Freddie Mac ’s program , a homeowner currently facing eviction could stay in his house as a renter until it is sold , if he meets the program ’s guidelines .
But with little information to go on today , housing advocates found themselves in confusion and concern over whether the REO program was ending , and whether all renters would be subject to evictions again .
Even when the Fannie and Freddie ban was active , however , it sometimes failed to reach people before they got evicted , said Judith Liben , a senior housing attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute , a nonprofit legal services advocacy group .
Only the District of Columbia and a few states have no - fault eviction laws requiring that a lease survives foreclosure , and that tenants ca n’t be automatically evicted .
And the new REO policy by Fannie and Freddie , while laudable , takes time to reach the neighborhood level , Liben said .
Expanding no - fault eviction laws could be one answer to the problem of renters facing evictions , Liben said .
Other states are moving to require more foreclosure notice for tenants .
The vulnerability of tenants to foreclosure evictions , along with falling property values of vacant and foreclosed homes , are prompting Liben and others to question the banking industry ’s reluctance so far to move toward allowing people to stay in foreclosed houses and pay rent .
Many are hoping the rest of the mortgage industry will follow Fannie and Freddie ’s lead in establishing REO rental programs .
“ Very few people have reached the stage where they are looking at renters as part of the solution , ” Pelletiere said .
“ There ’s almost a resistance to it .
Bankers in particular still have this mindset that ‘ I need to get those people out and sell the house right away . ’
But rental housing really is part of the solution to this crisis . ”
An oversupply of housing , combined with a weak economy that often requires people to move to find new jobs – and not tied down to a house they ca n’t sell – makes renting an especially worthwhile option , Pelletiere added .
“ Until the economy finds its footing , we do n’t want to put pressure on people to settle down , ” he said .
“ In the past we ’ve had a very significant bias toward homeownership that has been to the detriment of rental housing .
And that has to stop .
Housing policy going forward really has to balance out a little more .
In the long term , rental housing can be good for communities . ”
Problems with bank - owned foreclosed properties that sell for way below market value , for example , could be addressed by keeping renters in the houses .
Community groups last month urged Congress to crack down on the practice of Broker Price Opinions , which are cheaper substitutes for full appraisals and are used to determine a property ’s value .
BPOs often are performed by real estate agents with minimal training and cost as little as $ 50 , compared to $ 300 and above for a traditional appraisal .
They are increasingly employed by lenders for sales of bank - owned foreclosed properties , known as REOs , or Real Estate Owned properties , and for short sales , in which owners sell their homes for less than they are worth .
The bank forgives the difference , and takes a loss .
Using a BPO is illegal in more than 20 states , but the practice has become widespread , said David Berenbaum , executive vice president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition .
The BPOs frequently result in lowball estimates of a property ’s value , with lenders using them to unload REOs and short sale properties .
Agents who perform BPOs have an inherent conflict of interest , because they are working for lenders who want to quickly dispose of properties .
Speculators and other investors scoop them up at the fire sale prices , dragging down property values overall .
“ Right now , it ’s a race to the bottom , ” Berenbaum said .
“ They ’re having a terrible impact on property values . ”
Whether or not they use BPOs , banks increasingly are selling off REOs at low prices , even in stronger housing markets .
In Temecula , Calif. , for example , Citigroup sold a foreclosed house for just $ 139,000 , when comparable houses in the area were going for $ 240,000 to $ 260,000 , the North County Times reported – meaning the bank left some $ 100,000 on the table .
In markets where the REOs do n’t sell and lenders fail to maintain their properties , other problems persist , with neighborhoods facing a glut of abandoned homes and blight , as TWI has explained .
RealtyTrac , an online foreclosure database , predicts a record 1.5 million REOs this year , meaning more trouble ahead .
Given all this , some housing advocates can’t understand why lenders are n’t allowing more former homeowners or current tenants to pay rent and live in foreclosed houses until they can be sold .
The new REO rental programs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac marked a major step toward that goal .
But there ’s been no major private industry initiative to move beyond the model of getting owners and tenants out ASAP , Berenbaum noted , despite the obvious benefits of doing so .
“ Frankly , if the mortgage industry would allow homeowners facing foreclosure to remain in the properties as tenants , it would stabilize their investments and stabilize the communities , ” Berenbaum said .
But bloated REO inventories are proof of how overwhelmed servicers and lenders due to record numbers of foreclosures – and they ’ve said repeatedly they do n’t want to be in the property management business .
They also contend they ’re not always the ones responsible for the vacant homes problem .
In a magazine published by the Housing Wire mortgage blog , Robert Klein , CEO of Safeguard Properties , a major servicer , put it this way :
“ The fact is , as an industry , mortgage servicers spend in excess of $ 2 billion annually to take care of vacant properties so they do n’t become nuisances to neighbors and communities .
Unfortunately , servicers who are the ‘ good guys ’ get lumped in with property flippers and Internet investors whose irresponsible practices have been major contributors to urban blight . ”
Despite that blight , lenders and servicers seem to be closing their eyes to the possibility of economic benefits from filling empty houses with renters , said Liben said .
“ I think that the mortgage industry and the banking industry are very slow to catch on to why things are different in this particular crisis , ” Liben said .
“ They are n’t even trying to be creative .
It ’s like “ This is the way we ’ve always done it .
Get people out and sell the house and get new people in and that ’s that . ’”
Or , “ We do n’t want to be landlords . ’”
That ’s all they ever say . ”
Foreclosed and vacant houses often lose 50 percent of their market value by the time they are sold out of bank REO inventories , Liben said .
Those kind of losses should be spurring the industry to at least undertake a cost benefit analysis to figure out whether it might be more financially advantageous to rent out the properties , she said .
“ Maybe those properties would n’t have declined by 50 percent if they had people in them , ” Liben said .
Creating policies to encourage lenders to rent their foreclosed properties remains an uphill battle , said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
The mortgage industry just is n’t interested in getting involved in the rental market .
And some of the nonprofit development groups that overreached in promoting homeownership during the boom , putting people in houses they could n’t afford , are n’t taking the lead on initiating rental options , he said .
“ They do n’t want to own up to what they did , ” Baker said .
“ They ’ve pretty much put their heads in the sand . ”
Pelletiere , of the National Low Income Housing Coalition , said the rental issue remains a “ tense ” one for some nonprofits , because of the bitter controversy over whether the Community Reinvestment Act , an anti-redlining law , played a role in the housing crisis .
Conservatives have blamed the CRA and poor and minority borrowers for the foreclosure crisis , saying the government forced lenders to make risky mortgages to them to meet CRA requirements .
Nonprofits fought that campaign by pointing out that most subprime loans were made by independent mortgage brokers and firms not covered by the CRA .
Nonetheless , the belief persists , and nonprofits are wary of ceding any ground on the issue by changing their focus to promoting renting , Pelletiere said .
For the lending industry , the issue is far less complicated , Liben charged .
The savings and loan crisis should have prepared them to better manage their REOs , she said .
“ They have no excuses , ” she said .
“ They should have seen this coming . ”
In the absence of industry initiatives , economists and housing experts have been floating various rental ideas , including allowing a delinquent homeowner to give the property back to the bank , in return for having his credit wiped clean .
Rent - to - own programs , in which a portion of rent goes toward a downpayment , also are being revived in some communities with too many foreclosed homes .
But none of those efforts will gain a foothold until the mindset that renters are a detriment to a neighborhood begins to change , Pelletiere said .
Or until renting is seen as one of the answers to the problem of foreclosures and vacant homes .
For those reasons , he and others will watch closely as Fannie and Freddie run their REO rental programs , and try to keep people in their homes as a ban on foreclosure sales and evictions finally ends .

Israel faces the prospect of intervention by international courts amid growing calls that its actions in Gaza are a violation of world humanitarian and criminal law .
The UN general assembly , which is meeting this week to discuss the issue , will consider requesting an advisory opinion from the international court of justice , the Guardian has learned .
" There is a well - grounded view that both the initial attacks on Gaza and the tactics being used by Israel are serious violations of the UN charter , the Geneva conventions , international law and international humanitarian law , " said Richard Falk , the UN 's special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories and professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University .
" There is a consensus among independent legal experts that Israel is an occupying power and is therefore bound by the duties set out in the fourth Geneva convention , " Falk added .
" The arguments that Israel 's blockade is a form of prohibited collective punishment , and that it is in breach of its duty to ensure the population has sufficient food and healthcare as the occupying power , are very strong . "
A Foreign Office source confirmed the UK would consider backing calls for a reference to the ICJ .
" It 's definitely on the table , " the source said .
" We have already called for an investigation and are looking at all evidence and allegations . "
An open letter to the prime minister signed by prominent international lawyers and published in today 's Guardian states : " The United Kingdom government ... has a duty under international law to exert its influence to stop violations of international humanitarian law in the current conflict between Israel and Hamas . "
The letter argues that Israel has violated principles of humanitarian law , including launching attacks directly aimed at civilians and failing to discriminate between civilians and combatants .
The letter follows condemnation earlier this week from leading QCs of Israel 's action as a violation of international law , and a vote by the UN 's human rights council on Monday on a resolution condemning the ongoing Israeli military operation in the Gaza Strip .
" The blockade of humanitarian relief , the destruction of civilian infrastructure , and preventing access to basic necessities such as food and fuel are prima facie war crimes , " a group of leading QCs and academics , including Michael Mansfield QC and Sir Geoffrey Bindman , wrote in a letter to the Sunday Times .
Israel has already been found to have violated its obligations in international law by a previous advisory opinion of the ICJ , and is likely to vigorously contest arguments that it is an occupying power .
It previously stated that occupation ceased after disengagement from Gaza in 2005 .
Its stance raises questions as to the utility of an advisory opinion by the ICJ after Israel rejected its finding in a previous case , which found the wall being constructed in the Palestinian territories to be a violation of Israel 's obligations under international humanitarian law .
Questions are also being raised as to whether the international criminal court , which deals with war crimes and crimes against humanity , would have any jurisdiction to hear cases against perpetrators of the alleged crimes on both sides of the conflict .
Neither Israel nor the Palestinian territories are signatories to the Rome statute , which brings states within the jurisdiction of the ICC .
More likely , experts say , is the establishment of ad - hoc tribunals of the kind created to deal with the war in the former Yugoslavia and the genocide in Rwanda .
" If there were the political will there could be an ad - hoc tribunal established to hear allegations of war crimes , " Falk said .
" This could be done by the general assembly acting under article 22 of the UN charter which gives them the authority to establish subsidiary bodies . "
Web 2.0 Expo Famously , when Twitter 's Web2.0rhea app was suddenly embraced by digerati+dog in late 2007 , its original Ruby on Rails architecture had more than a little trouble keeping up the endless stream of digital solipsism .
But in mid-2008 , the web 's startup - of - the - moment quietly ported some of its core code to Scala , and according to Twitter developer Alex Payne , the switch should stand as a lesson to cutting - edge coders everywhere .
Addressing developers at the annual Web 2.0 Expo in San Francisco , California , Payne argued that Scala - not Ruby on Rails or PHP or Python - should be the language of choice for the modern web startup .
Today , Payne said , most of the hip dev set codes in Ruby or PHP or Python because they 're perceived as " agile " languages suited to quick site changes - but also because the deverati grew bored with languages like Java and C ++.
The trouble , he insisted , is that the so - called Web 2.0 languages are n't always as efficient as they need to be , especially in an economic environment threatening to bring Web 2.0 to its knees .
" Investors now want to know that you 're not going to be paying tons and tons of money for servers because you decided to build in a stack that is n't as efficient as possible , " he said .
" In a down market , you may have to make choices between technologies you love to work with and technologies that will keep the lights on .
The question is ... whether we can afford to build things that we love with tools that we love .
The answer is ' Yes ' .
But it means adopting a different set of tools . "
For Payne , who oversees Twitter 's API development , your ticket to the web promised land is Scala , the next - generation language developed by Martin Odersky at Switzerland 's École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne .
Sometime in 2007 , Twitter came to the realization that its Ruby - based message queuing system could n't keep up with all that Web2.0rhea .
" It grew with us for a number of months , and then , at a certain point , it just hit a wall , " Payne said .
" And that wall was not so much it code but in limitations in Ruby virtual machine .
There 's a lot of things that Ruby is great at , but long running processes ?
Particularly memory intensive ones ?
Not so much . "
By mid-2008 , one of these Ruby message queues completely crashed and developers needed two and a half hours to shove the dropped Tweets back through the system .
When your game is micro-blogging , that 's a lifetime .
Then , in his spare time , one developer ported the code to Scala .
According to Payne , the Scala queue could process the same message backlog in 20 seconds .
The new system was in place before the end of last year , Payne told The Reg , just in time for the Twittering chaos of the Barack Obama inauguration .
By the end of this year , Payne said , Twitter hopes to have its entire middleware infrastructure and its APIs ported to the new language .
Ruby will remain , but only on the front end .
" We 're still happy with Rails for building user facing features ... performance - wise , it 's fine for people clicking around web pages .
It 's the heavy lifting , asynchronous processing type of stuff that we 've moved away from . "
For this sort of heavy lifting , languages like Java and C++ may be as fast as Scala .
But Payne wants more than speed .
He prefers Scala because it combines functional and object - oriented techniques .
" Functions are objects , and objects are functions , " he said .
" Scala asks can you have the best of these two worlds together ?
And you can . "
But he also prefers Scala because it's , well , beautiful .
" It 's a fuzzy thing .
But we like writing beautiful code , code that you 're proud of , code that you can show to non-programmers and they get it . "
When Twitter made the Scala switch , it was n't using Java Virtual Machines ( JVMs ) .
But , Payne argues , the language is that much more attractive if you 're already running Java .
" The biggest selling point for certain organizations is that Scala is 100 per cent compatible with your existing JVM code .
There 's no wrappers .
There 's no bullshit .
You just load up your JVM code and call in to it , and there 's no performance penalty .
If you have a big investment in Java infrastructure , Scala is the ideal language . "
But if you do n't , Payne will tell you much the same thing .
Clearly , he 's in love .
And he 's pitching his new Scala book .
And his new Scala book is published by O'Reilly .
And O'Reilly runs the Web 2.0 Expo . ®
Australian officials desperate to reduce film ' camming ' have arrested and charged a man in Sydney with 18 counts of copyright infringement .
Unusually , he was n't caught in the act , and the cinema was a drive - in .
The man is allegedly a member of the well known scene group PreVail .
One of the up sides of drive - in cinemas is that people are free to talk inside their own cars , use their phones , and even smoke at will .
This privacy can also mean that spotting someone surreptitiously recording the movie can be hard .
Tinted windows can make the use of night vision equipment futile , and cameras can be hidden or covertly installed in cars .
The movie ’s audio , piped in through the car ’s audio system , can also prove a great direct recording source .
Perhaps for these reasons , the New South Wales police have arrested and charged a man from the south west Sydney area , in connection with movie ‘ camming ’ .
The police carried out a raid and searched his residence , with members of the anti-piracy lobby group AFACT assisting (! ) .
Afterwards , they seized what is being described as ‘ sophisticated video camcording equipment ’ ( a camcorder ) and computer equipment ( most likely a computer ) .
The raid comes after a digital watermark , identifying the cinema , was found in some of the CAM and TS releases from the group ‘ PreVail ‘ .
Allegations are that the 26 year old man was linked to that group .
However , no information on what ties the unnamed man had with the group has been made public , as a watermark would only identify the cinema that it was recorded at .
Interestingly enough , two of the movie titles listed in the press - release have never been released by PreVail .
“ He ’s Just Not That Into You ” and “ Marley and Me ” were indeed released as a Cam version , but not by PreVail .
Of course , the arrests seem to have been prompted by ( again ) gross exaggerations of the facts by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) with the press releases talking about the great losses CAMs cause .
It also comments how Scene ‘ Top Sites ’ sell their releases to ‘ criminal groups ’ who then mass produce DVDs for sale .
Apart from scene groups often being very anti-sale , it ’s unclear why criminal groups would pay for these releases anyway .
A wait of less than an hour will enable them to get them for free online .
All things aside , if the man is a member of PreVail ( a group that has ‘ released ’ more than 200 films in the last 3 ½ years ) and is convicted , his sentence will not be a light one .
With $ 60,500 AUS ( $ 39,000US or € 31,000 ) and 5 years imprisonment per offense , that can yield a maximum sentence of over a million Aussie dollars and 90 years in prison .
In fact , he ’s looking at a potential punishment greater than most murderers .
The 18 charges include possessing a device with intent to make an infringing copy , possessing an infringing copy for distribution , and distributing infringing copies .
The case will be heard on March 12th at Blacktown Local Court .
On the plus side though , proving the bluster about financial gain will be hard .
It appears to be how lobby groups prod police forces to act , even if the police are active pirates themselves .
Iowa looks into medical marijuana
The next state to consider legalizing medical marijuana might be Iowa .
Although no changes are expected this year , activists in the typically conservative state are on the move , and are potentially seeing the earliest signs of movement : Activists called Tuesday for the legalization of medical marijuana in Iowa , but even lawmakers who are sympathetic to such a move said a measure wo n't be approved this year .
Supporters of a measure legalizing medical marijuana urged a subcommittee of the Senate Human Relations Committee to change the law ....
Sen. Joe Bolkcom , D - Iowa City , headed the panel and said lawmakers were willing to examine the idea .
But he cautioned that much more work is needed and that action was n't likely this year ....
Sen. Merlin Bartz , R - Grafton , said he 's supported measures allowing medical use of marijuana in the past but that the current measure was too broad .
" I think there are some positive things that can take place , but this has more of the look of a legalization , " said Bartz .
As someone who grew up in Iowa , even the very idea that state legislators are considering it feels momentous .
Sure , it 's a long way off , but apparently not as long as I once would have thought .

Tuesday night E and I heard a biomimicry expert speak at ASU .
Her name is Janine Benyus , and she ’s a natural history author who ’s been documenting the emerging cross-disciplinary field of biomimicry .
Before hearing her talk , I had a very primitive notion of biomimicry : “ Dude , did you know a spider ’s silk is 10 times stronger than steel — like , if we could do that , how cool would it be ? ”
And , like most over - simplified notions , it ’s both right and not so much .
Here is the Wikipedia definition of biomimicry : Biomimicry ( from bios , meaning life , and mimesis , meaning [ imitation ] ) is a relatively new science that studies nature , its models , systems , processes and elements and then imitates or takes creative inspiration from them to solve human problems sustainably .
Benyus ’s presentation was an overview of some of the work being done RIGHT NOW on deriving high - tech solutions to problems in engineering , health , agriculture , energy production and many other fields by observing organisms and natural systems .
Her idea : “ We need to re-design everything ” , as she admits is a tall order , but from her examples , there are a lot of smart people working on it 24 / 7 .
Here are some of the things she mentioned :
significantly increasing efficiency of wind - turbine blades by designing them with bumps like the tubercules on the flippers of Humpback whales
making strong and very water - resistant plywood without formaldehyde using a soy - based adhesive similar to the glue mussels use to adhere to underwater rocks
An aerodynamic 70 mpg Mercedes car that looks like a box - fish and has an interior steel frame designed by bone - mimicking software ( check it out on this link
apartment buildings with intramural structural cooling based on the cooling tunnels in African termite towers
water - gathering technologies for arid areas based on highly efficient moisture - gathering organisms like a Namib beetle whose wings are capable of sieving fog - droplets out of a 50 mph wind , and the Thorny “ devil ” ( a horned lizard like reptile of the Australian desert ) whose scale - borders act as capillary channels and can direct even tiny quantities of water , like dew , against gravity to its mouth .
exterior surfaces for structures based on the pleated form of many cactus like saguaro , which are not only self - shading , but also direct rain to where it ’s needed at the roots of the plant .
self - cleaning paint for buildings and autos that works using the “ lotus effect ” : tiny surface bumps allow rain drops to skip down a wall , washing away dirt without using detergents , as do the surfaces of many plant leaves like water lotus .
These are only a small fraction of the projects she covered .
There ’s more at the website Asknature.org , which is designed not only to introduce the public to the concept of biomimicry , but has a resource section for connecting people with nature - based strategies for the problems they need to solve : “ sticking to ” , “ self - cleaning ” , “ break down , ” etc .
What struck me most ( apart from the really smart ideas biomimicry people are coming up with ) were two things :
1 ) Biomimicry is a fantastic example of why Basic Research is important and should be funded .
The ideas involved are not vague tree - hugging notions of how we should all “ learn from the animals ” , but fact - based high - tech products , companies , projects , and enterprises created by biologists , engineers , entrepreneurs , designers , scientists and others working together : commerce and science , business and academia tightly and productively intertwined .
And they arise from basic research : many are launched from studies that are undertaken to further our knowlegde of the world around us , and not originally intended to result in commercial applications .
And 2 ) The Arizona angle .
Not only did Benyus point out how the desert itself is full of organisms surviving under adverse conditions and so is a perfect system to study and learn from , but also how many people in biomimicry are working at Arizona State University .
Over and over , she mentioned names of scientists , teachers , and students who were sitting around us in the audience .
While this made me proud of ASU , it was painful too in light of the ongoing budget crisis created by partisan factions in the Arizona state legislature .
Even as we sat there listening to all the social , economic , scientific , and environmental advances ASU personnel are making in schools and departments from Design to Chemistry , money was being ripped away short - sightedly from those very programs and people in the name of fiscal responsibility .
Bad bad bad monkeys — what are the politicians thinking ?
“ Monkey see monkey do ” — biomimicry and its educational foundations and commercial development — deserves staunch support , for the good of the future .
And Arizona , with its universities already deeply involved in such research , could be a leader in biomimicry studies and industry .
But only with a well - nourished educational system .
As Benyus said , the defiinition of the success of a species is not whether its offspring survive , but whether its 10 - thousandth generation survives .
To do that , a species must take care of where its offspring will live .
This is what a bird does when it builds a nest , this is what nature does on both a grand and a small scale : “ Life creates conditions conducive to life . ”
That is the lesson for individuals , for people in charge of policy and states : it is the lesson for the ages .
But in the interest of happy thoughts , I ’ll leave you with this final fact , humorous visual image , and new word : Supposedly , the “ stiction ” of a fully engaged gecko could support 200 pounds .
Imaging suspending a porky politician — by his waist of course — from the ceiling , with a just a gecko !
How sustainable is that ?
Photos : I ’m uncertain whom to credit the great photo of Ms. Benyus and a very large milipede to .
But in case this applies , I will credit AskNature.org , a project of The Biomimicry Institute .
The photo of the Thorny Devil is from Wikipedia , and is by Wouter .

GOP senator would support probe of ' shocking ' anti-terror memos Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday March 5 , 2009
Print This Email This Update at bottom : ' Be careful what you wish for , ' Leahy tells Maddow some in GOP back legal action
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) said he was opposed to any Truth Commission tasked with investigating Bush administration abuses , but that he could support criminal investigations into political appointees who authored the controversial OLC memos .
Speaking at Sen. Patrick Leahy 's ( D - VT ) Wednesday hearing on exploring the possibilities of setting up a nonpartisan Truth Commission , Specter , a moderate in his party who has supported past Senate inquiries into polices of the Bush administration , said :
 I would not mind looking backward if theres reason to do so .
If we have evidence of torture  go after it .
If theres reason to believe that these Justice Department officials have knowingly given the president cover for practices they know not to be right or sound  go after them .
Some of the [ OLC ] opinions are more than startling , they re shocking .
If [ OLC counsel ] did that knowingly it sounds to me that it may fall within criminal conduct .
Specter said he supported the Justice Department pursuing an investigation into the writing of the memos .
 They re not going to pull any punches ,  Specter said of a Justice investigation .
A key aspect still unresolved of Leahys proposal to set up an independent  Truth Commission  with the task of examining wrongdoing by the Bush administration , is whether immunity will be offered to those who testify , and if so , what kind of immunity .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahys hearing on the feasibility of setting up a nonpartisan commission of inquiry  into national security abuses over the last eight years met with strong support from a variety of sectors  civil libertarians , some corners of the military and human rights advocates .
In opening the days hearing before a half - full chamber room that included a dozen Guantanamo Bay protestors wearing orange prison jumpsuits , Leahy strove to create a bipartisan atmosphere .
Leahy said the commission could be imbued with subpoena powers and even the power to grant immunity to those who agree to testify .
But he also warned that the commission would not rule out criminal prosecutions for witnesses who perjure themselves .
 This is a time when conservatives , liberals , Republicans and Democrats should be setting aside labels to come together foremost as Americans ,  Leahy said .
 We shouldnt be afraid to look at what weve done and hold ourselves accountable as we do other nations when they make mistakes .
Today is another opportunity to come forward and find the facts and join all of us , Republicans and Democrats , to develop a process to understand what went wrong and then to learn from it . 
But there is also significant opposition from Leahys Republican colleagues on the committee who contested that Congress had no business delegating responsibility to investigate Bush abuses and that no matter how nonpartisan in name the commission was , it would still become a vehicle for Democrats to launch criminal probes into Republicans .
 The idea of creating an independent , and Im not sure how independent it would actually be , unaccountable Truth Commission , is a bad idea with all due respect ,  said Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , a member of the Judiciary Committee .
 The suggestion that this can be delved into somehow in a nonpartisan fashion asks us to suspend our powers of disbelief . 
Two of Leahys fellow Democrats on the Judiciary Committee gave support to the Truth Commission , though from their comments , they seem to be more interested in criminal prosecutions for high - profile Bush appointees than Leahy .
 There can be no doubt that we must fully understand the mistakes of the past to address them and to prevent them occurring in the future ,  said Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) .
 Your proposal is aimed at finding the truth , not settling the score .
I think a truth commission as the chairman has proposed is the best way to get the story out to the American people . 
Feingold said immunity for low - level participants of the Bush administration needed to be explored but added any Truth Commission should tread carefully in granting immunity as  there may be some cases that should be prosecuted . 
He also said that Congress should only task the commission with fact - finding and not with making any recommendations .
The commission should be comprised of investigative professionals rather than partisan policymakers Feingold said .
 It is distinctly in the public interest for this information to come out ,  said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , adding that some conduct of Bush appointees may have been so abhorrent as to merit criminal investigations .
Cornyn said that any investigation into the interrogation methods of the CIA , would likely result in a more timid , agency , fearful of retroactive discipline , that would become reluctant to vigorously pursue intelligence gathering .
Frederick Schwartz , chief legal counsel of the Brennan Center for Justice and a witness in support of the Truth Commission , said he didnt personally believe that CIA operatives , who engaged in questionable interrogation practices such as water boarding , should be criminally prosecuted or brought before the Truth Commission .
 I think they acted in good faith because they had legal opinions [ backing them up ] , said Schwartz , referencing the recently made public Office of Legal Counsel memos that authorized radical and questionable executive powers .
Thomas Pickering , a former U.S. ambassador , testified in support of the commission , noting how it would improve American standing abroad with foreign allies and also take away propaganda power from terrorists who have used the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib as a recruitment tool .
 We must as a country take stock of where we have been and determine what is and what is not acceptable and what we will never do again ,  Pickering said .
 We ought to acknowledge the mistakes that were made . 
Pickering added that the commission should not have the power to grant blanket immunity or full immunity .
Speaking against the idea of the commission , Jeremy Rabkin , a law professor at George Mason University , objected to the statements made by some far - left sectors of society that compare President Bush and his cabinet to notorious war criminals of foreign countries . 
Rather than improving American standing abroad , Rabkin said a Truth Commission would actually legitimize these views in other countries .
Countries that have held Truth Commissions in the past , such as South Africa and Chile , had to go that route because their countries were to divided and peace to fragile to handle any kind of criminal prosecution .
 Oh yes , that is what is done with war criminals when you cant prosecute them ,  Rabkin said .
 I think this will be said as ratifying the background view .
If people think there should be prosecutions , there can be prosecutions . 
Leahy warned that if Republicans chose to not take part in his nonpartisan fact - finding commission ,  then calls from more strident members of his party for criminal prosecutions of Bush administration appointees would only become louder and they would become more empowered in the eyes of the public , which according to a recent Gallup poll , two thirds of Americans support some type of inquiry into Bush administration abuses .
 If criminal conduct occurred , this senator wants to know about it ,  Leahy said .
 Im trying to get the ability to find out if criminal conduct occurred so it wont happen again .
If crimes occurred , I dont think they should be swept under the rug . 
The full formal testimony of Wednesdays witnesses can be read here .
Leahy tells Maddow some Republicans back legal action
During an appearance on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show , Leahy said that some Republicans might back legal action against members of the Bush White House .
Leahy told Maddow that the recently released Bush anti-terror documents " makes me think of some of the ads Ive seen for the Frost / Nixon tapes where the actor playing President Nixon says , ' It s not against the law when the president does it . '
Well , nobodys above the law in this country . ' "
Politico's Andy Barr writes , " Rather than prosecuting Bush officials , the Democrat has proposed the creation of a ' truth commission ' to investigate alleged wrongdoings in the waging of the war on terror .
Leahys proposed commission would have subpoena power , but would not press criminal charges against former White House officials . "
" Now , interestingly enough , some of the Republicans , in their arguments this morning , were saying , maybe prosecution is the only way you re going to really find out , " Leahy said .
" Something has been done wrong and you should have prosecution .
My feeling is , be careful what you wish for .
That may be what you get . "
Maddow responded , " We do have a very interesting sort of convergence of right and left on the relationship of your commission idea to prosecutions .
We got Nancy Pelosi and Russ Feingold and Sheldon Whitehouse and Michael Ratner from the Center for Constitutional Rights , all arguing they wouldnt want any offers of immunity from the commission to preclude prosecutions . "
" But today , as you said , Republicans arguing against the commission , Arlen Specter , David Rivkin , former Justice Department official , both suggesting that the commission might interfere with the Justice Departments turf in prosecuting , " Maddow continued .
" Are they ... "
Leahy interjected , " That s why I say ' be careful what you wish for ' because we already have a prosecutor looking into this .
If prosecution can find all the answers , that s fine .
But I m just worried that it might not .
That s why I m trying to find this middle ground . "
But Leahy warned Republicans , " If we can not get the kind of bipartisan support needed for a commission to get all the facts out , then its going to fall back on prosecution .
But I am not willing to just ignore what happened .
Some have said turn the page .
I say , well , lets read the page first before you turn it . "

* AmEx and Citi perform worse - than - expected - analysts
* JPMorgan and Capital One outperform expectations
* Default rates seen over 10 percent by year - end
NEW YORK , March 16 ( Reuters ) - U.S. credit card defaults rose in February to their highest level in at least 20 years , with losses particularly severe at American Express Co AXP.N and Citigroup C.N amid a deepening recession .
AmEx , the largest U.S. charge card operator by sales volume , said its net charge - off rate -- debts companies believe they will never be able to collect -- rose to 8.70 percent in February from 8.30 percent in January .
The credit card company ’s shares wiped out early gains and ended down 3.3 percent as loan losses exceeded expectations .
Moshe Orenbuch , an analyst at Credit Suisse , said American Express credit card losses were 10 basis points larger than forecast .
In addition , Citigroup Inc C.N -- one of the largest issuers of MasterCard cards -- disappointed analysts as its default rate soared to 9.33 percent in February , from 6.95 percent a month earlier , according to a report based on trusts representing a portion of securitized credit card debt .
“ There is a continued deterioration .
Trends in credit cards will get worse before they start getting better , ” said Walter Todd , a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates .
U.S. unemployment -- currently at 8.1 percent -- is seen approach 10 percent as the country endures its worst recession since World War Two , leaving more than 13 million Americans jobless , according to a Reuters poll of economists .
However , not all were bad surprises .
JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Capital
One reported higher credit card losses , but they were below analysts expectations .
Chase -- a big issuer of Visa cards -- reported its charge - off rate rose to 6.35 percent in February from 5.94 percent in January .
The loss rate for the first two months of the quarter is 126 bps from the previous quarterly average compared to an estimate of a 145 bp increase , Orenbuch said .
Capital One Financial Corp's COF .N default rate increased to 8.06 percent in February from 7.82 percent in January .
MORE PAIN AHEAD
Analysts estimate credit card chargeoffs could climb to between 9 and 10 percent this year from 6 to 7 percent at the end of 2008 .
In that scenario , such losses could total $ 70 billion to $ 75 billion in 2009 .
“ People underestimated the severity of the downturn we are experiencing and I would n’t be surprised to see them north of 10 percent , ” said Todd , who added American Express was most exposed to higher credit card losses , given its sole reliance on the industry .
Credit card lenders are trying to protect themselves by tightening credit limits , rising standards , and closing accounts .
They have also been slashing rewards , raising interest rates and increasing fees to cushion further losses .
Meredith Whitney , one of Wall Street ’s best known and most bearish bank analysts , estimates that Americans ’ credit card lines will be cut by $ 2.7 trillion , or 50 percent , by the end of 2010 -- and fewer Americans will be offered new cards .
“ We believe that the US credit card industry will feel additional credit pain over the next 12 - 18 months .
Until lenders like Capital
One show stabilization , followed by trend - bucking improvement over a several - month period , we will continue to remain bearish on credit card lenders , ” said John Williams , an analyst at Macquarie Research .
Todd said credit card issuers shares -- which are down up to 60 percent in 2009 -- will remain under pressure until the end of 2009 , or early next year , when bad loans could start to redeem .

Last year during the Greek Riots , there was a government suggestion to somehow punish people who cover their faces during protests , in effect making it unlawful to protect your anonymity .
Back then along with another person , I took a symbolic solidarity action by taking a picture of myself as a hoodie but as time passed and the riots abated , the issue was forgotten .
However it seems that the Government has not forgotten their plans and has now proceeded to decree that anyone caught “ vandalizing ” , acting violently or simply disrupting the public peace while wearing a hoodie or otherwise covering their face characteristics will be further charged with 2 - 10 years of punishment .
You read that right , if you go out to protest and you are deemed to be disruptive to the public peace ( who will judge that ?
The cops of course ) while covering your face ( or not , Greek cops have no problem accusing you anyway , and what is easier to accuse than “ covering the face characteristics ” ) then you can go to jail for 2 years at least .
Wonderful .
As a reaction to this announcement , Plagal , who initiated the action the last time , brought up this symbolic move of picturing yourself in a hoodie once more and urges everyone to do something similar .
The reaction this time has been much more positive and many more people have done the same ( there ’s a list in the link above ) which could possibly be due to the fact that another blogger proposed the same thing independently , only she went one step further and proposed the great idea to switch all our avatars to Hoodies in solidarity .
So here we go :
I ’ve already updated my twitter and facebook avatars and I urge you to do the same in all the places where you commonly hang out .
And of course if you ’re a blogger upload one in your blog and explain why you did it .
If you live in Greece I furthermore wholeheartedly suggest you start strolling around the city as a Hoodie , just so that you can show your disdain for this new government clampdown of freedom of expression and the right to anonymity .

Media Matters has caught another Fox fabrication .
This time , Fox News ' reporter ' Wendell Goler repeatedly aired a video clip in which President Obama seems to declare his support for imposing a " European - style " universal health care system on the United States .
Goler used the clip to support Republican attacks on the President 's spending policies and his supposedly " European " priorities .
The problem is , President Obama never said any such thing .
The clip Goler used was from a March 26 online town hall event , and President Obama was paraphrasing a written question submitted by the audience .
In his answer , the President said that while he does support universal health care , he does n't support imposing a European or Canadian system on the United States .
I actually want a universal health care system ; that is our goal ... whether we do it exactly the way European countries do or Canada does is a different question , because there are a variety of ways to get to universal health care coverage ...
I do n't think the best way to fix our health care system is to suddenly completely scrap what everybody is accustomed to and the vast majority of people already have .
Rather , what I think we should do is to build on the system that we have and fill some of these gaps .
Despite the plain meaning of President Obama 's words , Fox and Goler took them completely out of context to support the President 's Republican critics .
It was n't an accident -- Fox aired at least three different versions of Goler 's hit piece .
Watch the video , starting with what President Obama actually said :
Hardline nationalist Lieberman was a controversial foreign ministry choice Israel 's new ultra-nationalist foreign minister has said it is not bound by a US - sponsored 2007 agreement to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians .
" The Annapolis conference , it has no validity , " Avigdor Lieberman said .
He was speaking at a handover ceremony at the foreign ministry , prompting his predecessor Tzipi Livni to interrupt and diplomats to shift uncomfortably .
At Annapolis , each side agreed to further discussions aimed at creating an independent Palestinian state .
Palestinian officials described Mr Lieberman as an " obstacle to peace " whose policies would rebound negatively on Israel .
" Nothing obliges us to deal with a racist person hostile to peace such as Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Lieberman , " Yasser Abed Rabbo said in comments to AFP news agency .
Correspondents say officials at the foreign ministry seemed taken aback at such a sudden and public repudiation of one of the main planks of Israeli diplomatic activity .
" There is one document that obligates us - and that 's not the Annapolis conference , it has no validity , " Mr Lieberman said .
The document he was referring to was the international peace plan known as the Road Map , signed in 2003 , while " the Israeli government never ratified Annapolis , nor did parliament " .
Conflagration
The Annapolis accords were seen as a last - ditch attempt by the previous US administration to realise what President George W Bush called his " vision " of peace involving a two - state solution .
I voted against the Road Map in the government , but that is the only document that was ratified by the government and the Security Council , and it binds this government as well
Avigdor Lieberman
The Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed to launch " vigorous , ongoing and continuous " negotiations to reach a comprehensive peace deal , and make every effort to conclude it before the end of 2008 .
Although the incoming Netanyahu government has avoided committing itself to the establishment of a Palestinian state , the Road Map endorsed by Mr Lieberman was also meant to achieve that aim .
Middle East envoy Tony Blair earlier warned Israel that the Palestinians must have their own state to avoid a major conflagration in the region .
" The alternative to a two - state solution is a one - state solution .
If there is a one - state solution there is going to be a big fight , " the former UK prime minister said on a visit to Brussels .
After Mr Lieberman 's comments were published , a spokesman for the White House National Security Council , Mike Hammer , said the Obama administration remained " committed to the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in peace and security " .
Mr Hammer said that the administration was expecting " frank discussions " , but that it was looking forward to " working vigorously with the new Israeli government " .
He stressed that any discussions would be based on an underlying shared commitment to Israel and its security .
Ratified Mr Lieberman , known for his outspoken criticism of Arab citizens of Israel and some Arab leaders , was a controversial choice for foreign minister in the government of right - winger Benjamin Netanyahu which was sworn in on Tuesday .
In his speech , he admitted voting against Israel 's ratification of the Road Map " but that is the only document that obligates us , it is the only document that was ratified by the government and the Security Council , and it binds this government as well " .
Asked about the new foreign minister 's comments , political sources close to Mr Netanyahu were quoted saying they largely reflected the new leader 's position .
The Road Map made progress towards a Palestinian state contingent on the Palestinian Authority 's progress on suppressing activity by militant groups - the strongest of which , Hamas , actually ousted the Fatah - dominated Palestinian Authority from Gaza in 2007 .
It also obliges Israel to freeze settlement activity on territory it occupied in the 1967 war .
Mr Netanyahu 's cabinet is the largest in Israel 's political history combining centre - right , centre - left and far - right parties .
Ms Livni's Kadima party , which backs a two - state solution , won the most seats in February elections , but was considered less likely to be able to form a coalition than a Likud - led right - leaning coalition .
Talks aimed at bringing Kadima into a unity government failed , with Ms Livni saying the parties ' platforms were too different .

The Department of Health confirmed this evening that while there have been no cases of the swine flu virus in the State , it is currently awaiting the results of tests on four people who presented themselves with flu - like symptoms over the last 48 hours .
At a briefing this evening , the Minister for Health said that results on the four samples would be available later this evening .
While health officials declined to say whether any of the four suspected cases had recently returned from Mexico , it was confirmed that all four had a travel history which was a cause for concern .
A fifth sample tested for the virus which has been responsible for 149 deaths in Mexico was negative .
Ms Harney said that her Department was not advising against travel to areas affected by the virus and said that along with a stockpile of antiviral medication , there was also a stockpile of masks and gowns available should they be needed .
Ms Harney is due to attend an emergency meeting of EU health ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday to discuss the issue .
Earlier today , the Department of Health said the State has stockpiled enough antiviral drugs to deal with the threat of swine flu .
Dr Tony Holohan , chief medical officer of the Department said the stocks of antivirals cover " almost 50 per cent of the population . ”
There is enough Tamiflu , a drug taken orally , to treat 25 per cent of the population and enough Relenza , an inhaled medication , to treat 20 per cent of the population over the age of seven .
In a statement released this afternoon Dr Kevin Kelleher , head of health protection with the HSE said : ” We have n't seen any cases in Ireland as yet , but it is important to be prepared for any possible cases that may arise ” .
“ This is an evolving situation and it is likely that more countries will be affected over the coming days , ” he added .
This morning Spain became the first country in Europe to confirm a case of the H1N1 virus when a man who returned from a trip to Mexico last week was found to be infected .
Two people in Scotland were confirmed as testing positive for the virus tonight .
Experts from the WHO are due to meet tomorrow in Geneva to discuss whether to increase the pandemic threat level .
The current phase three level means the flu predominantly affects animals with a few human infections .
If there is a sustained threat of human to human transmission the WHO will increase the level to a phase four or five alert .
“ There are currently no travel restrictions advised , but the situation is also under active review by the WHO , ” the HSE said .
It advised people in Ireland who have travelled to the affected areas and who develop flu - like symptoms to seek medical help .
“ If you develop an influenza - like illness and have recently returned – within the last 7 days – from Mexico , Texas or California , you should contact your GP , ” said Dr Kelleher .
Symptoms of the virus consist of influenza - like illness - fever and respiratory tract illness ( cough , sore throat , runny nose ) , headache , muscle aches – with some cases including vomiting and diarrhoea .
The HSE also recommends the following precautionary measures :
- Cover your nose and mouth with disposable single - use tissues when sneezing , coughing , wiping and blowing your nose
- Dispose of used tissues in the nearest waste bin
- Wash your hands after coughing , sneezing , using tissues , or contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects
- Keep your hands away from the mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth
- If you are sick with flu , stay at home to avoid spreading infection to others
Meanwhile , in a statement released this evening Safefood reassured customers that pork products are safe to eat .
“ Swine flu does not pose a food safety risk as it cannot be transmitted through food , ” the statement said .
“ Safefood , following guidelines from the WHO , advises that pork and pork products can be prepared and eaten as usual , provided that they are handled hygienically while raw , and cooked thoroughly prior to consumption , ” it added .

The ISS as seen by the space shuttle Discovery last week as the shuttle prepared to dock with the station .
What is the station ’s long - term future ?
( credit : NASA )
Does the ISS have a future ?
In November 1983 , when President Reagan was deciding whether to go ahead with NASA ’s plan for a space station , David Stockman , the head of the Office of Management and Budget , gave what former NASA Deputy Administrator Hans Mark in his memoir The Space Station a Personal Journey called “ an eloquent statement ” to the effect that the “ we should defer the decision for a few years . ”
The Attorney General , Bill Smith , then pointed out that “ I ’ll bet that the Comptroller of Ferdinand and Isabella made exactly the same speech when Columbus proposed to them that he sail west to reach the east . ”
Reagan did n’t miss a beat : “ Yes Bill you ’re right , but you remember the Comptroller won the argument and Isabella had to pawn her jewels …
What I want to know is , who has the jewels around here ? ”
Now that it is nearing completion , much of the passionate debate surrounding the project has dissipated .
The arguments over the cost and the utility of the International Space Station ( ISS ) seem stale and no longer worth fighting about .
The debate has moved on , notably to the question of NASA ’s Constellation program and its architecture for the return to the Moon and beyond .
Yet the ISS exists , and the space industry and space scientists alike have to decide what they want to do with it .
Now that it is nearing completion , much of the passionate debate surrounding the ISS has dissipated .
For the next three years ESA will have 285 million euros to spend on research onboard the ISS .
The US will not only have the funds from NASA ’s annual budget but , thanks to the US section ’s status as a “ National Laboratory ” , other parts of the government as well as the private sector will be able to work there .
The Japanese have an extensive plan to use their newly - attached Kibo module as well as the external platform that NASA plans to launch sometime in the fall .
If all goes well there will soon be a full crew of six astronauts and cosmonauts living and working on the station .
This will more than double the amount of time that can be devoted to experiments .
Previously the painfully slow process of getting anything done on the ISS gave the impression that nothing has yet been done .
As the sheer volume of research piles up , it will be easier to judge just how valuable the “ world class laboratory ” really is .
What is truly impressive is the politics of the project .
The station has now gone through four separate administrations of both parties and is now on its fifth one .
The project has now been endorsed by large bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress and the great question is no longer whether to finish building it , but how long and at what expense to keep it in operation .
Some of the key issues associated with those questions include :
Is the truss structure sound , and will it stand up to long - term stresses of orbital operations ?
How long will the seals between the modules hold up and what kind of maintenance will they need ?
Will the solar arrays continue to operate at sufficient efficiency for the next decade or longer ?
What will it cost to replace different elements when they wear out ?
When the ISS can no longer be used as whole , can the different elements of the structure be recycled into a newer space station ?
Right now there is no firm answer to the question of how will NASA gain access to the ISS during the “ Gap ” between the shuttle ’s retirement and the introduction of the Orion .
However , there is at least a possibility that the SpaceX Dragon capsule or perhaps something from another firm will be ready in 2012 or thereabouts .
The Gap may also be reduced if the shuttle keeps flying beyond its current 2010 retirement date .
The delays that are all too common during shuttle operations have raised the possibility that there will still be unflown missions in late 2010 at the time NASA plans to retire the system .
What will happen then ?
Will the president order that the system be retired with all that hardware still on the ground , notably the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer ( AMS ) , which has just been put on the manifest of an extra “ last ” mission ?
If there is going to be one — or maybe more — flights in 2011 , how will they be paid for ?
Will there be extra money in NASA ’s budget ?
Will it have to come out of the Constellation program ’s funding , or will there be some sort of supplemental appropriation ?
Whoever the new NASA administrator is , major policy decisions for the station need to be made soon .
The ISS is a major human accomplishment , mostly built and paid for by America .
The fact that it is a symbol of international cooperation makes it more important than ever .
It is one of the very few places where the US and Russia are still working harmoniously together .
Neither nation sees any reason to change this .
The other partners have all invested too much time and effort to see the station be abandoned prematurely .
Whoever the new NASA administrator is , major policy decisions for the station need to be made soon .
Congress needs to spend some time looking at the future of the program and the major contractors should start trying to work out what they will have to do to keep it in orbit .
It is time for NASA to explain to the public what has and has not been accomplished on the ISS and what have we learned from its construction .

It 's hard to get your head around reports like this one by the St. Petersburg Times , which says that both Corey Smith , of the Detroit Lions , and Marquis Cooper , of the Oakland Raiders , removed their life jackets and floated out to sea , not long after their boat capsized in the Gulf of Mexico .
About his own son , who supposedly tried to swim for help toward a light he saw ( or thought he saw ) , Bob said :
The interesting wildcard in all this is the potential for delusions given the seemingly hopeless circumstances as well as the effects of hypothermia setting in .
Who had all of his wits about him ?
Who did n't ?
Even Nick Schulyer , the lone survivor , showed signs of hypothermia and could have been hallucinating at any point , as referenced by Rey Sanchez , the cousin of Marquis Cooper .
I do n't want to get too deep into this because no matter what happened , this is a tragic event .
But something 's just not right to me with this story .
These were guys whose minds and bodies were used to , basically , torture .
And they gave up after two to four hours ?
Like I said , I wo n't get too far into it because I have no first - hand knowledge , and I do n't have proof of anything else going on .
Nor am I trying to accuse anyone of improper conduct .
All I 'm saying is this does n't sound right .
Intel has been shipping its
Atom processor for months now , although it has been talking about the CPU for much longer .
Earlier this year I went through the architecture and unique design approach behind Intel ’s first foray into a new approach to chip design since the original Centrino .
While Atom is n’t setting any performance records , it is amazingly powerful for its size and power consumption .
In making Atom , Intel made sure to give it an equally impressive chipset : Poulsbo .
The combination of Atom and Poulsbo unfortunately uses too much power and is too big to be used in the most attractive of devices : smart phones , relegating them to MIDs ( Mobile Internet Devices ) .
MIDs are n’t terribly successful , mostly because they are bulky , plagued by terrible UIs and too expensive for what they are .
In a couple of years Atom will surely find its way into smart phones thanks to Intel ’s push for integration , but thanks to the Netbook segment Atom has n’t gone unappreciated .
Largely pioneered by the efforts of ASUS and obsession with the letter E , the Netbook market is almost entirely dominated by Intel ’s Atom CPU .
In order to keep costs down , Netbook manufacturers have paired Atom with a desktop chipset instead of Poulsbo : the Intel 945G .
Since Atom ’s FSB can work in GTL + mode , it is compatible with Pentium 4 / Core 2 chipsets .
Atom is honestly fast enough for many tasks , delivering the performance of a mainstream notebook from 4 years ago .
The problem is that there are some applications that are commonplace today that ca n’t run on Atom .
HD video playback is n’t possible on Atom + 945G platforms because the CPU is n’t fast enough to decode high bitrate video ( much less H.264 ) and the chipset does n’t support HD video decode acceleration .
NVIDIA saw an opportunity with Atom .
Intel had a very popular CPU , that could be used in many more environments if it could only be paired with a more powerful chipset .
Enter the GeForce 9400 M .
This is the same GeForce 9400 M that ’s used in desktops and notebooks , the very same GeForce 9400 M that ’s in the new MacBook , MacBook Pro and MacBook Air ... and NVIDIA is pairing it up with Intel ’s Atom processor .
( CNN ) -- A U.S. Navy submarine and a Navy amphibious ship that collided Friday in the Strait of Hormuz south of Iran have arrived in Bahrain to be assessed for damage , the Navy said .
The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans are shown in Navy photos .
The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans arrived Saturday in Mina Salman pier to " to further assess and evaluate the damage that resulted from their collision at sea , " the service said in a written statement .
Fifteen sailors were slightly hurt aboard the Hartford in the collision , which occurred early Friday morning .
On Friday , Navy officials in Washington told CNN that there was significant damage to the sail , or tower - like structure on the topside of the submarine .
On Saturday , the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine 's propulsion unit .
No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans .
The ship 's fuel tank ruptured , spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz , the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement .
" Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday , and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean 's surface , " the Navy said .
" The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel , and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures , winds and seas . "
When the collision occurred , both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation , Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday .
Christensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship .
The Strait of Hormuz is located between the United Arab Emirates and Iran , linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf .
It is heavily used by oil tankers .
Both vessels are on regularly scheduled deployments to the U.S. Navy Central Command area of responsibility , and conduct Maritime Security Operations .

Investor Mistakes – Looking at Past Performance
At some point in our investing career , we all make the mistake of thinking about how much money we used to have .
Whether it ’s how much our whole account was worth or just the price of the stock when we purchased it , we let the past affect our decisions .
If at all possible , stop doing this !
How ever long the time period , the value of the investment increased when the price at the end of the measuring period is higher than the start .
Therefore , if we want to increase our wealth compared with the present , we need to find an investment that goes up in price in the future .
This has nothing to do with the past , nothing .
Why does this matter ?
Let me explain by taking a look at this example .
Let ’s say it was the end of 2008 when we saw Citigroup trading at $ 12 per share .
We think “ Wow , the stock was at $ 50 at one point .
It ’s so undervalued ! ”
We then buy 1,000 shares of it and wait .
As the investment community loses even more confidence , the stock goes down and trades at $ 1 per share .
Our $ 12,000 investment is nearly wiped out and turns into $ 1,000 .
Could the stock go to $ 50 again at some point ?
Of course .
Will it go back up just because it was there before ?
Absolutely not .
Holding On For Too Long
Our luck is n’t so bad though , because Citigroup ’s stock price goes back up .
A couple months later , it went from $ 1 to $ 4 .
Since this all happened in a month , it ’s a pretty extreme move .
Even though we know that nothing goes up in a straight line , we are definitely holding on .
We bought it at $ 12 !
It ’s going to go back .
It has to .
Of course , we know what happens .
The stock came back down to $ 3 as other traders take profit , resulting in a 25 % decline from $ 4 .
We could ’ve sold at $ 4 , but we let the price that we purchased at affect our judgment .
While we know that the stock price will most likely go down , we ignore it because we hope that it will go back up to the levels that we purchased it .
We know that the past has nothing to do with the present , but we always fall into this trap .
By looking at the past , we are potentially :
Taking on More Risk –
We all want to get our money back as soon as possible , so we end up buying stocks that could potentially go up the quickest .
Hanging Onto Losers –
Anyone bought dot com stocks in 1999 and still own them ?
It ’s safe to say that those are n’t coming back to those insanely high levels .
Not Making Good Use of Capital –
The money that is tied up with losing stocks could be used to invest in profitable investments .
The more capital is tied up with losers , the less potential you have .
Think about the opportunity cost .
Making a Bad Investment – Most people buy investment based on the future .
If you are using the past to be the judge , you are just investing incorrectly .
Forget about the past .
Move on and aim for a better future .

The current financial crisis has an Achilles Heel : Who can we blame ?
No single person orchestrated , coordinated , and managed the financial disaster .
Unless you believe the devil or the Illuminati were behind it , the financial disaster remains more of a systemic problem than one of twisted minds .
But there are key players involved .
They are men of government , business , and , thanks to the revolving door , both at once .
When they slip up , permanent damage results .
For the purposes of this list , financial crisis refers to the current crisis , characterized by subprime mortgage defaults , widespread bank failures , an unprecedented government bailout program , and a basic lack of trust in the economy .
A man behind the crisis is someone in a position of power during the crisis who helped form , perpetuate , or aggravate it .
We listed 25 men behind the financial crisis below :
25 . Christopher Cox
Former SEC Chairman
Cox left a mixed legacy .
On the one hand , Cox , who served until early 2009 , increased transparency , enforcement , and investor communications in the financial industry .
On the other hand , he missed red flags about Bernie Madoff .
He did n’t see the severity of the Wall Street mess until it was too late .
Cox generally has a good reputation , but he did n’t speak up soon enough , which allots him a space on this list .
24 . Adam Applegarth
Applegarth ran Britain ’s Northern Rock between 2001 - 2007 .
After the bank , one of the largest mortgage providers in the country , was bailed out by the Bank of England , Applegarth ran the other direction — with $ 1.15 million in hand .
He now holds the dubious honor of heading the first bank in Britain that customers ever ran on .
23 . Bernie Madoff
Madoff was n’t directly involved in the corporate and regulatory mess that led up to the crisis , nor is he perpetuating it .
But his $ 65 billion Ponzi scheme played an important role in aggravating a sense of cultural distrust in the financial sector .
Part of the economy ’s woes come from a communal unwillingness to put money back into a deceitful economy .
Madoff symbolizes this sense of reluctance , a reminder that trusting “ experts ” with your money is a bad idea .
22 . Raymond MacDaniel
MacDaniel is the CEO of Moody ’s Investor Services , one of the world ’s biggest ratings companies .
His company ( along with Fitch and Standard & Poor ’s ) offered AAA ratings to subprime - backed securities during the housing bubble , which could be seen as an oversight .
But MacDaniels not only acknowledges that his agency has to manage an inherent conflict of interest–it is paid by some of the investment banks it rates–but blames Moody ’s faulty ratings on bad information .
His response to a Financial Times article uncovering a ratings model error was equally baffling .
Moody ’s paid him a $ 350,000 bonus this year for his troubles .
MacDaniel ’s lax enforcement of the research and independent questioning his ratings agency should have done during the crisis , combined with his current defensive stance , makes him a man behind the crisis .
21 . Chris Dodd
Senator Chris Dodd , chair of the Senate Banking Committee , is notoriously in cahoots with banks , which in part explains why Wall Street , not Main Street , gets the benefit of the bailout .
In 2003 , Countrywide Financial granted Dodd below - market mortgage rates on two of his homes as a result of his membership in the “ Friends of Angelo ” program .
In 2008 , Dodd proposed a bailout bill that included helping Countrywide .
Coincidence ?
Hardly .
Dodd ranks first among senators for insurance industry contributions , including more than $ 20,000 from Countrywide ( and those reduced rates ) and nearly $ 134,000 from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Dodd refused to admit Fannie and Freddie were in trouble until late last year .
Another notorious Dodd scandal ( this article explains http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/03/17/dodd/
how Dodd may have actually been a pawn in this .
Do n’t worry , conservatives , it was Geithner and Summers who played him ) concerns his flip - flopping over having retroactively added an executive pay limit onto the stimulus bill .
Sen .
Dodd recently released his Countrywide financial statements after months of pressure — but did not allow the media or the public to see them .
20 . Richard S. Fuld , Jr .
Lehman Brothers ’ bankruptcy spurred panic in the fall of 2008 .
Fuld , the 14 - year chairman and CEO of Lehman , helped foster the bank ’s collapse by refusing to sell it when he had the chance .
Despite the ego blow , Fuld made off with almost $ 75 million in the two years leading up to the crisis ( 2006 and 2007 ) , allotting him the dubious honor of winning the 2008 Financial Times ’ Overpaid CEO Award of 2008 .
19 . Bill Clinton
The Glass - Steagall Act , had it been left intact , could have greatly reduced the severity of the current crisis .
But the Clinton administration helped repeal the act , dealing a fatal blow to the economy .
The clincher ?
Clinton does n’t even regret it .
“ In the case of the current crisis , ” he is quoted as saying in a meeting prior to this year ’s Global Initiative Conference , “ I believe the bill I signed allowed Bank of America to take over Merrill Lynch . ”
That ’s some twisted logic .
18 . Chuck Schumer
Schumer , like Chris Dodd , receives handsome contributions from financial institutions .
He opposed regulating Fannie and Freddie in the years leading up to the crisis , but his real claim to fame was triggering the IndyMac bank run in June 2008 .
Schumer wrote in a letter to a regulator that he was “ concerned that IndyMac ’s financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers and that the regulatory community may not be prepared to take measures that would help prevent the collapse of IndyMac . ”
Shortly after Schumer ’s remarks , depositors ran on the bank , withdrawing $ 1.3 billion in 11 days .
Some critics say it led to the bank ’s downfall ; the truth is that it may have only accelerated it .
Regardless , the statement caused a panic — and one of the more memorable events of the financial crisis .
17 . William Donaldson
Facing regulatory pressure from the EU , George W. Bush ’s SEC Chief of Staff , William Donaldson , released banks from lending restrictions in 2004 .
In exchange , his team would be able to regulate them as bank holding companies .
Once the EU was appeased , Donaldson and his successor , Christopher Cox , slackened their regulatory power almost to the point of ignoring the banks entirely .
According to Rolling Stone ’s Matt Taibbi , during the last year and a half Cox was in charge , the SEC commission in charge of supervising the five major banks did no inspections — nor did it have a director .
BusinessWeek reports that Donaldson said “ regulators had put in place formulas to properly monitor investment banks ’ leverage . ”
Formulas are n’t of much use , though , if you do n’t actually apply them to anything .
16 . James Cayne
Bear Stearns was n’t solely responsible for the financial crisis .
Indeed , former CEO James Cayne acted like he did n’t see it coming .
But it was the first big financial firm to fail , leading to a gut - wrenching domino effect .
After Bear fell , confidence in the industry plummeted .
JP Morgan Chase bought Bear with a government loan in March 2008 .
The rest is history .
15 . Ronald Reagan
Reagan oversaw the deregulation of the savings and loan industry .
S&Ls traditionally used peoples ’ savings to fund mortgages .
The 1980 DIDMCA ( Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act ) enabled them to offer transaction accounts , consumer loans , and commercial loans .
S&Ls started issuing credit cards and using up to 20 % of their assets , as permitted by the new law , for consumer and commercial real estate loans .
A real estate boom and high interest rates encouraged S&Ls to pour money into risky financial ventures , including big real estate transactions , linked financing , and junk bonds .
In 1986 , the S&L industry collapsed , ironically resulting in more regulations .
Although the Reagan administration handled the S&L crisis well , the Teflon President seeded the risk - taking , Master of the Universe mentality that spawned the current crisis .
Reagan turned deregulation into a dogma strong enough to blind businesspeoples ’ ethics .
This cultural legacy remains a pivotal factors behind today ’s crisis .
14 . Robert Rubin
As Clinton ’s Secretary of the Treasury , Rubin successfully opposed the regulation of derivatives .
He also supported the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act .
But his most famous stint is as an adviser to Citigroup , where he served as a director until this year .
Rubin encouraged the bank ’s executives to increase trading in mortgage - backed securities and other exotic instruments , according to the New York Times .
He also supported Citigroup ’s “ unwieldy financial supermarket model ” during his tenure , says the Times .
These stances , combined with a lack of internal oversight , contributed to Citi ’s overexpansion and overexposure to risk .
When the crisis hit , bloated Citi was slammed , leading to what amounted to a government takeover of the bank .
Rubin stepped down earlier this year amidst criticism from investors .
Citi paid him $ 126 million over the past ten years .
13 . Barack Obama
In order to handle the financial crisis effectively , Barack Obama surrounded himself with people who have inside knowledge of the financial industry .
The problem is that these people are also insiders .
Stepping through the revolving door gave them a strategic advantage in helping out their industry .
The result is that the economics branch of the government ( run by Wall Street insiders ) continues to bail out Wall Street .
Obama has the power to make the bailout process transparent , or have it changed entirely .
He can appoint hearings , investigate the true scope of the country ’s financial losses , and tell people the truth .
But he chooses to sit back while the old guard — the people whose behavior caused the crisis — follows its own frenetic agenda .
If Obama wants to change the country , he needs to start from the inside of his own administration .
12 . Tim Geithner
The man did n’t pay his taxes , was mentored by former Goldman Sachs CEO Robert Rubin ( who helped block regulation of CDSs before the crisis ) , and continues on the bumbling , opaque vein that Hank Paulson initiated –yet nobody is asking for his head .
It ’s business as usual for Geithner , who wants $ 2 trillion in taxpayer money to bail out fully capitalized and solvent banks .
William K. Black , interviewed by Bill Moyers , points out the inconsistency : “ Both statements ca n’t be true .
It ca n’t be that ( banks ) need $ 2 trillion , because they have mass ( ive ) losses , and that they ’re fine . ”
He also questions the logic behind sending $ 5 billion in taxpayer money to the Swiss bank UBS , then charging them $ 780 million in criminal fines .
In essence , the government quietly bailed the same Swiss bank that was defrauding it by hoarding taxable income .
Black describes out two more Geithner missteps :
1. Geithner used to be the president of the New York Fed , which is supposed to regulate most of the country ’s biggest bank holding companies .
Yet Geithner has testified that he has “ never been a regulator . ”
2 . There ’s a Savings and Loan crisis - era law called the Prompt Corrective Action Law .
This law mandates that when banks are insolvent and failing , regulators or the bank “ must promptly correct the capital inadequacy . ”
If a bank does not promptly recapitalize , the law says that regulators must force it into receivership ( further explanation is here ) .
Black claims that :
TARP II is designed to provide a federal subsidy to insolvent and failing banks .
( It ) violates the express purpose of the PCA law to resolve bank problems at the lowest cost to the FDIC and the taxpayers .
Providing taxpayer “ capital insurance ” subsidies to insolvent or troubled banks increases the taxpayers ’ costs .
So Geithner ’s plan is not only wasteful — the government should n’t be paying off banks ’ debts–but illegal .
11 . Chuck Prince III
Businessweek reports that Citigroup , the second largest bank in the world , was “ the biggest player in the roughly $ 400 billion SIV market ( mostly CDOs ) . ”
Despite his company ’s heavy investment in CDOs , Prince did n’t require his company to quantify its risk exposure .
That means that Citi had no idea how risky its CDO investments were until they all collapsed .
When disaster struck , it hit Citigroup especially hard .
The bank lost more than $ 20 billion in 2008 .
It cut 75,000 jobs .
And the government gave it $ 54 billion in TARP funds , then guaranteed $ 306 billion in bad assets .
Citi remains a mess for the government , taxpayers , and the financial industry .
10 . Daniel Mudd
Franklin Raines ’ successor as Fannie ’s CEO , Daniel Mudd , tripled the entity ’s purchase of potential subprime mortgages ( those where buyers need to put down 10 % or less ) between 2005 - 2007 , according to BusinessWeek .
Mudd was under congressional and Wall Street pressure to boost Fannie ’s position in capital markets .
That meant extending more loans to low - income buyers , especially in overdeveloped markets like California .
When Mudd was forced to step down by the government conservatorship movement last September , Fannie had piles of Alt - A and subprime mortgages in its coffers .
Mudd lost his severance , but earned more than $ 10 million during his tenure .
9. Larry Summers
Obama economic advisor Larry Summers has a history of shooting down regulation , taking money from financial firms , and bailing out companies with government funds .
When he worked in the Clinton administration , Summers , according to the American Prospect , advocated bailouts , lack of regulation , and asset bubbles .
One notable example of his policies occurred when regulator Brooksley Born , then - head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) pushed a piece of derivatives regulation in the late 1990s .
Summers was part of a trio that passed a law prohibiting the very kind of regulation Born was proposing .
This particular type of CDS ended up bringing AIG to its knees .
Before gaining his current political appointment , Summers was informally lobbied by financial firms to the tune of $ 2.7 million , including $ 135,000 for a one - day speaking engagement at Goldman Sachs .
That amounts to roughly $ 16,000 an hour .
According to former regulator Bill Black ( as interviewed by Bill Moyers ) , Summers ’ engagement was the bank ’s way of informally lobbying him before he gained his post in the new Obama administration .
Summers also accepted perks like free rides on the Citigroup corporate jet .
In exchange , he continues to advocate on behalf of financial firms .
The Wall Street Journal claims that Summers asked Chris Dodd to remove executive pay caps for Citigroup and other bailout recipients .
He also helped bail out the very companies that paid him in advance .
8. Franklin Raines
Raines was Fannie Mae ’s CEO and chairman from 1998 to 2005 .
Raines started a program in 1999 aimed at issuing Fannie loans to low - income individuals .
The idea was to increase the number of low - income and minority homeowners ( people with a lower probability of paying their loans back ) .
He also loosened the credit requirements for the bank loans that Fannie purchased .
Those actions , combined with Raines ’ famous book - cooking , resulted in short - term gains for Fannie and Raines , but ended in disaster .
In 2004 , Raines stepped down after an SEC investigation found “ accounting irregularities ” including shunting losses to C - level execs so that they could earn bigger bonuses .
Officials later discovered that Raines had overstated as much as $ 6.3 billion in earnings .
7. C.K. Lee and the Office of Thrift Supervision
The Office of Thrift Supervision — not the Fed or the SEC — was charged with regulating AIG , including its European operations , since 1999 .
The OTS , a small , relaxed operation that , through a legal loophole , regulated some corporate giants , only had one insurance specialist on its staff when it was regulating AIG , according to Rolling Stone .
C.K .
Lee , the regulator in charge of keeping AIG in check , later stated that because AIG said its CDSs were harmless , he believed them .
Some regulation .
6. Angelo Mozilo
Remember how , in the not - too - distant past , mortgage brokers would try to convince you to take on ARMs , interest - only loans , anything but a 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage ?
That kind of behavior had higher commissions , courtesy of Mozilo ’s Countrywide , at its roots .
After co-founding Countrywide Financial , Mozilo built it into the biggest mortgage lender in the country .
Countrywide investors enjoyed 23,000 % returns between 1982 -2002 .
Mozilo himself made $ 479 million between 2001 - 6 .
He manipulated Countrywide ’s stock price through private sales and buybacks , and spearheaded a “ Friends of Angelo ” program that offered Mozilo ’s buddies , including a number of politicians , special treatment when it came to mortgages .
Favors included below - market interest rates and reductions in mortgage payments .
Mozilo sold the company to Bank of America in October of 2008 at a fraction of its former stock price .
Mozilo may be out of the limelight , but his legacy continues .
Old Countrywide execs like Stanford Kurland are now once again profiting off mortgages , albeit in a changed market .
5. George W. Bush
The Bush administration did n’t meddle in the building regulatory and investment bank mess that catapulted the crisis .
That , it turns out , was one of its biggest mistakes .
That ’s nearly a decade of no oversight .
Add the $ 3 trillion sunk into the Iraq War , and you have a national budget disaster , courtesy of GW .
Rating agencies ignored loan files until after the collapse .
Federal investigators ignored signs of fraud dating back as early as 2004 .
According to William K. Black , 500 white - collar FBI specialists were reassigned to research national terrorist issues .
Years later , the Bush administration did n’t replace those 500 agents , who would have been able to research the banking meltdown before it hit .
That ’s one reason for the suddenness and severity of the crisis .
4. Phil Gramm
Senators Phil Gramm and Jim Leach sponsored the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , a Depression - era bill that prevented commercial banks from acting as investment banks .
The bill also stopped banks from entering the insurance business .
Gramm ’s repeal of Glass - Steagall helped spawn bloated financial conglomerates like AIG and Citigroup .
The investment - cum - commercial practice of writing loans , then selling them off became standard procedure .
A year later , Gramm wrote a law that prevented CDSs from being regulated as securities or gambling .
Today , Gramm says that rather than loosening up regulations on bank holding companies , Glass - Steagall ‘ was the first step towards making the Federal Reserve a “ super- regulator . ” ’
Which is worse ?
You choose .
3. Alan Greenspan
Alan Greenspan was an ardent free - market proponent .
That ’s not a bad thing in itself , but Greenspan chose to ignore several powerful signs that housing was a bubble and the free market actually needed to be reigned in .
By refusing to heed warnings ( an attentive Greenspan might have required bigger down payments , stricter underwriting , or mortgage insurance ) Greenspan let the crisis foment .
2. Hank Paulson
Former Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson is the poster child for what happens when conflicts of interest go awry .
Paulson was CEO of Goldman Sachs from 1998 - 2006 .
Next , he revolved into a new position as Secretary of the Treasury , which came with a $ 200 million tax deferral .
Once there , he simply kept acting like the CEO of Goldman Sachs .
Rolling Stone ’s Matt Taibbi points out that Goldman Sachs was AIG ’s biggest credit default swap customer , holding $ 20 billion worth of the crappy assets .
If AIG went down , Goldman might go with it .
Paulson could n’t allow that to happen , which might explain why he hired ex-Goldman board member Edward Liddy to head AIG , and former Goldman VP Neel Kashkari to administer the government ’s TARP program .
The aggregate result of Paulson ’s mess is billions in unaccounted - for bailout funds , government contracts for more of his Goldman friends , and a legacy as the wrong man for the job .
1. Joe Cassano
AIG Financial Products ’ Joseph Cassano did n’t invent CDSs , but he did transform them into a worldwide phenomenon .
He guaranteed buyers that AIG would compensate them if the credit obligations went belly - up .
He did not , however , require that buyers show any money upfront when they bought the CDSs .
As a result , AIG sold about $ 500 billion in guarantees , but could n’t cover them with any assets .
He also specialized in the “ naked ” credit default swap , in which neither buyer or seller actually have access to the loan .
Rolling Stone ’s Taibbi explains it :
Unlike traditional insurance , Cassano was offering investors an opportunity to bet that someone else ’s house would burn down , or take out a term life policy on the guy with AIDS down the street .
It was no different from gambling , the Wall Street version of a bunch of frat brothers betting on Jay Feely to make a field goal .
Cassano was taking book for every bank that bet short on the housing market , but he did n’t have the cash to pay off if the kick went wide .
AIG bet that the housing bubble would never burst .
But it did , resulting in the shell of a company that government vultures are still picking at today .
It also ended Cassano ’s glory days — after an estimated $ 280 million in compensation over the last seven years .
Yinan Wang , the 14 - year - old Chinese boy who clinched a place at Oxford University last week , will be the last child prodigy to study there under reforms being considered by admissions tutors .
Despite an almost perennial flurry of headlines on children barely in their teens being offered places , the university is considering an unprecedented blanket rule on minimum ages for undergraduates .
' The admissions executive is in discussions around whether we should introduction a minimum age of 17 for undergraduates , ' confirmed Ruth Collier , a spokesperson for admissions to Oxford .
' We have been pushed to consider it , not because of concerns about whether it is psychologically healthy for children to study here , but because of child protection laws which have come into play this year for the first time . '
Oxford is the only university in Britain that currently accepts undergraduates who are under the age of 17 .
Individual colleges decide which candidates they will accept as undergraduates , but Collier confirms that age is rarely , if ever , a factor .
' It 's up to each college who they accept , but if you 're the best student for the place and are 14 years old , then the general attitude is " so be it " , ' said Collier .
' We have always said our policy is entirely non-discriminatory and we are proud of that openness , which we consider crucial to Oxford 's ethos , but we have discovered this year that there are heavy costs in having that policy . '
The Children Act , the biggest shake - up in child protection law in 30 years , which was introduced last March , gives all those who work with children a legal duty to protect the young .
' Because no other university accepts children , the government have produced no guidance on how higher education establishments should implement it , ' said Collier .
' We are studying it very hard and worrying a great deal about how we should do it , which is taking up a great deal of time and coming at a cost . '
Collier lists concerns including not leaving children on their own with adults and making sure that any teachers with whom they come into contact have had a criminal records check .
Children can no longer live in student accommodation , because the university could not carry out a criminal record check on every other undergraduate sharing the same premises .
' Suddenly we can't offer one - to - one tutorials , while the people who do administration in our colleges have to spend a great deal of time making absolutely sure they are not inadvertently placing a child in a potentially dangerous situation with anyone who has n't had a criminal records check , ' she added .
Collier is unable to discuss individual cases , such as that of Yinan Wang , but she added : ' This is the first year we have had someone quite so young since the new laws have come in , and some people have been shocked by how much is involved .
' The problem is that we can't alter the environment here ; we can't lay on special measures for younger students .
We 're used to operating as an institution for adults . '
A former pupil at Copland Community College in Brent , north - west London - one of the country 's biggest comprehensive schools - Wang will read material sciences at Corpus Christi after gaining A - grade passes in maths , further maths and physics last week .
The 14 - year - old is one of the youngest students at Oxford since Ruth Lawrence , who became its youngest - ever maths graduate in 1982 , aged 12 .
However , Wang overcame the additional challenge of being unable to speak English when he arrived in the UK two years ago .
Mark Wormald , the admissions tutor at Corpus Christi , said he would welcome a university - wide ruling on a suitable age for undergraduates .
' On a case - by - case basis , it is difficult for us to take a view on the best age for undergraduates , ' he said .
' If a parent comes to us to say coming here is the best thing for their child , it is quite difficult for us to argue against that because there is no blanket policy .
If possible , we like to have a consensus with all colleges regarding age , ' he added .
